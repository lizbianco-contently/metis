The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to address S.J. Res. 6, \nwhich provides for congressional disapproval of the Occupational Safety \nand Health\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nAdministration's recently promulgated ergonomics standard. This action \nis being taken pursuant to the Congressional Review Act provisions \nincorporated into the APA in 1996. If successful, it will be the first \ntime that the CRA has been used to invalidate an agency regulation. It \nwill send a strong message to Federal agencies that Congress is serious \nthat the intent of the CRA--that agencies issue more flexible and less \nburdensome rules, and be more responsive, and open, to input from the \nregulated public--is followed.\n  I will leave it to my colleagues to discuss the numerous problems \nwith the Clinton Administration's regulation, such as its flawed \nrulemaking process, its extraordinary potential costs, its encroachment \non state administered workers compensation programs, and its \ncomplexities and vagueness to the point of unworkability. I have to \nnote, however, that the ergonomics rule certainly qualifies as a \n``midnight'' regulation, which is exactly the sort of rulemaking that, \nin great part, led to enactment of the CRA. And I note further that the \nCRA is not radical legislation. In fact, it passed with broad \nbipartisan support, was signed by a Democratic President, and earlier \nversions of the legislation twice passed the House and four times the \nSenate.\n  Passage of the CRA was an exercise by Congress of its oversight and \nlegislative responsibility. It was intended to compel bureaucrats to \nconsider the economic effect of their regulations and to reclaim some \nof Congress' policymaking authority which had been ceded to the \nexecutive branch because of the increasing complexities of statutory \nprograms, and the resultant reliance on agency rulemaking. But my \npurpose today is not to focus on the merits of the Congressional Review \nAct.\n  OSHA has admitted that repetitive stress injuries have declined 22 \npercent over the last five years. This statistic proves two things: \nOne, that there is a musculoskeletal disorder problem in the workplace. \nAnd two, that employers are cognizant of the problem, and addressing \nit. Further, the dramatic reduction illustrates that there are ways to \nreduce, and perhaps eradicate, MSDs in the workplace, in part by use of \nthe science of ergonomics. OSHA, unfortunately, has continued to ignore \nthese lessons and refuses to revise its approach that the stick is more \neffective than the carrot. This is proven by the very standard that is \nbefore us today.\n  Again, however, the most important fact that can be taken from the \nemployers' successes in combating repetitive stress injuries over the \npast few years is that apparently there are methods available to attack \nthis severe problem. We must continue to encourage the development of \nthese innovative approaches. At the same time, we must not lose sight \nof the fact that the administration and the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration have a role, and a responsibility, in leading the \nattack on these crippling workplace injuries.\n  OSHA must not give up its place at the vanguard of the assault on \nworkplace MSDs because of the shortcomings of the Clinton \nAdministration's ergonomics standard. I urge Labor Secretary Chao, in \nthe strongest possible way, to investigate and consider all options, \nincluding initiation of additional rulemaking, if warranted, as part of \nan all out effort to seek solutions for this type of debilitating \ninjury. I have received a letter from Secretary Chao. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Chairman Jeffords: It is my understanding that the \n     Senate will soon consider a Joint Resolution of Disapproval \n     pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration's (OSHA) ergonomics standard. As you are \n     aware, the Congressional Review Act of 1996 gives Congress \n     the authority to vitiate this standard and permanently \n     prevent OSHA from promulgating a rule in substantially the \n     same form.\n       Let me assure you that, in the event a Joint Resolution of \n     Disapproval becomes law, I intend to pursue a comprehensive \n     approach to ergonomics, which may include new rulemaking, \n     that addresses the concerns levied against the current \n     standards.\n       This approach will provide employers with achievable \n     measures that protect their employees before injuries occur. \n     Repetitive stress injuries in the workplace are an important \n     problem. I recognize this critical challenge and want you to \n     understand that the safety and health of our nation's \n     workforce will always be a priority during my tenure as \n     Secretary.\n       I look forward to working with each of you throughout the \n     entire 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao,\n                                               Secretary of Labor.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am heartened by the letter from the Secretary of \nLabor. It indicates that the Administration recognizes there is a \nproblem and is committed to finding the answer. To this end, I am \ndismayed by what appears to be a systematic campaign of misinformation, \nand I would like to dispel the myth being perpetuated by those who \noppose enactment, that adoption of this Resolution of Disapproval will \nsound the death knell for any future ergonomics regulation. That is not \naccurate.\n  Contrary to the misinformation being circulated, passage of the \nresolution of disapproval will not prevent OSHA from undertaking \nrulemaking regarding repetitive stress injuries. As I have already \nstated, I believe that rulemaking is an option that should be given \nserious consideration by the Administration. Secretary Chao agrees. In \nfact, by jettisoning this burdensome and unworkable standard, we will \nbe eliminating a roadblock to consideration of more responsible \napproaches directed at resolving the workplace MSD puzzle. One approach \ncould well include promulgation of a more reasonable and workable ergo \nstandard.\n  The Congressional Review Act provides, in relevant part, that a rule \nvitiated by enactment of a Joint Resolution of Disapproval ``. . . may \nnot be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule that is \nsubstantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, unless the \nreissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after \nthe date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.'' \nWhile this language appears clear on its face, it is being \nmisinterpreted to mean that OSHA cannot regulate in the ``area'' \ncovered by the disapproved rule.\n  There is no basis nor justification for this interpretation of the \nCRA provision. Where I have seen it mentioned--for example, in a March, \n1999 CRS report--there is no citation of authority to support that \ninterpretation. Indeed, it appears to have been created out of whole \ncloth or thin air. The better--in fact, correct--interpretation, \nprovided by the actual language of the Statute is that a disapproved \nrule cannot be issued ``in substantially the same form.''\n  The intent, and thrust, of this language is made clear in a joint \nstatement, by Senators Nickles, Reid of Nevada, and Stevens, submitted \nfor the Record on April 18, 1996. The purpose of the Joint Statement \nwas to provide a legislative history for guidance in interpreting the \nterms of the Congressional Review Act. The Joint Statement indicates \nthat the ``substantially the same form'' language that I quoted above, \nwas ``necessary to prevent circumvention of a resolution [of] \ndisapproval.'' Thus, the concern clearly was that an agency should not \nbe able to reissue a disapproved rule merely by making minor changes, \nthereby claiming that the reissued regulation was a different entity.\n  This interpretation is confirmed by further discussion in the joint \nstatement about the differing impact a disapproval would have depending \nupon whether the law that authorized the disapproved rule provided \nbroad or narrow discretion to the issuing agency regarding the \nsubstance of such rule. Where such underlying law provides broad \ndiscretion, the agency would be able to exercise that discretion to \nissue a substantially different rule, but where the discretion is \nnarrowly circumscribed, the disapproval might work to prevent issuance \nof another rule.\n  OSHA, of course, has enormously broad regulatory authority. Section 6 \nof the OSH Act is a grant of broad authority to issue workplace safety \nand health standards. To prove this point, one need look no farther \nthan the scope of the ergonomics regulation before us. OSHA, in fact, \nconsiders its authority so broad that it ignored, in issuing its ergo \nstandard, the clear statutory mandate in section 4 of the OSH Act not \nto regulate in the area of workmen's compensation law. And the \ndefinition of ``occupational safety and\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nhealth standard,'' in section 3(8) of the Act, is further indicative of \nthe discretion granted to the agency. I am convinced that the CRA will \nnot act as an impediment to OSHA should the agency decide to engage in \nergonomics rulemaking.\n  Some might question why now utilize the Congressional Review Act \ndisapproval procedures instead of reviewing or amending the ergo \nstandard through other means, such as additional notice and comment \nrulemaking, or by permitting the legal challenges to be brought to \nconclusion. The answer is simple. The CRA is being used in precisely \nthe manner Congress intended.\n  As noted in the April 18, 1996 Joint Report, certain timing \nprovisions in the CRA were put in place ``. . . to try to provide \nCongress with an opportunity to act on resolutions of disapproval \nbefore regulated parties must invest the significant resources \nnecessary to comply with a major rule.'' And, I might add, scarce \nagency resources are also a concern. The standard before us certainly \nis a major rule, and the estimated compliance costs are huge.\n  For all of the reasons stated above, I believe that OSHA's ergonomics \nstandard presents the ideal case in which to exercise the disapproval \nprovisions of the Congressional Review Act. An over broad, vague, and \nunworkable standard may act as a disincentive to development of \nreasonable and rational approaches to a serious problem. In addition, \nhuge compliance costs do not encourage compliance and, in fact, may be \nbeyond the resources of many small businesses. This may be the case \nwhere no standard is preferable to the standard promulgated by OSHA. \nBut I am convinced that this is not the bottom line. OSHA can issue \nanother ergonomics standard. I urge the secretary of Labor to consider \nthis option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I tell my friend from Massachusetts I \nwill be brief because he has a lengthy statement. Let me make a few \nbrief comments. We have 10 hours of debate on the issue under the \nCongressional Review Act. I expect we will be going back and forth. \nThat is 5 hours on each side. We can have ample debate and discussion. \nI think that is healthy and very good.\n  One of the reasons Senator Reid and I worked so hard and we passed \nthe Congressional Review Act was that Congress would review regulations \nthat had a negative impact or an impact on the economy in excess of \n$100 million a year. That makes sense. The idea of, wait a minute, \nshould you have regulatory agencies passing measures that have a \nprofound impact on the economy without holding Congress accountable? \nCongress should have some say. And sometimes do the regulatory agencies \ngo too far? Sometimes it is their own fault. Sometimes we tell them, to \npass some regulation and make the world safer, sounder, cleaner, \nwhatever, without considering the cost or impact. We have done that in \nCongress.\n  What we did when we passed the Congressional Review Act was say we \nshould review those regulations if they have an economic impact in \nexcess of $100 million and find out how does this make sense. Is it a \ngood deal? Is it a good deal for the economy? Is it a good deal for \ntaxpayers to invest this kind of money? Congress should have a say.\n  The bureaucrats who write the regulations are not elected; we are. \nThat was the purpose of the Congressional Review Act. This is the first \ntime we will utilize that act. I believe in this case the regulation \npromulgated by the Clinton administration in the Federal Register, \ndated November 14, 2000, which is over 6,000 pages long, went too far. \nAll legislators who believe in division of power when reviewing this \nregulation will say the Clinton administration, in its last 4 days, \nwent way too far and exceeded their constitutional authority. The \nPresident is President; he is not chief legislator.\n  In this legislation, in this regulation, they went into legislating. \nThey went into devising a Federal system of workers compensation.\n  If Members want to pass a Federal workers compensation law, introduce \na bill. It would go, I assume, to the Education and Labor Committee. It \nwould be marked up. Have that process go forward if we are going to \npass Federal workers compensation.\n  I have asked a couple of former Governors on the Democrat side if \nthey knew there was Federal workers compensation in the ergonomic \nstandard. Do they know this has a compensation system that is much \ngreater than most State workers compensation laws? Most Senators \nanswered no.\n  This has Federal workers compensation that supersedes State worker \ncompensation laws. If you have any respect for the Constitution, if you \nhave any respect for Members as legislators, you should say no \nbureaucrat, no official in the Department of Labor--who, incidentally, \nis probably not there anymore--can make that kind of imposition. That \nrequires Federal legislative action. If someone wants to promulgate \nthat kind of rule, let them introduce this as a statute. Let's debate \nit.\n\n  I don't think anyone will debate it. This is not defensible. How in \nthe world can you come up with a Federal workers comp law that \nsupersedes State law that is more generous? It might be proposed, but \nmy guess is it would never pass, nor should it.\n  Yet in this case we have unelected bureaucrats who say: Let's make \nthis the law of the land. Is he super Senator? Is he super legislator? \nWhere did he get this kind of authority?\n  I appeal to my colleagues, Democrat or Republican, review the \ncontents of this legislation. See how extensive and expensive it is. \nThis is probably the most expensive, intrusive regulation ever \npromulgated, certainly by the Department of Labor--maybe by any \ndepartment. It deals with the issue of repetitive motion injuries. It \nis wide open. It could be somebody typing at a desk, somebody standing \nat a checkout line, somebody stacking groceries, somebody moving things \non trucks. It could apply to almost any job in America. It can be \nenormously expensive.\n  Federal bureaucrats are saying you can do this; you can't do that. \nYou can only move 25 pounds 25 times a day. A grocery store may have to \nhire 10 times as many people to stock the grocery store. A moving \ncompany has to move a lot of things. Employees would say: I have to \nstop; it is 8:25, but I have already moved 25 things. Time out. Hire \nmore people. Oops, can't do that; we need more people; we need to hire \nmore people. Oops, we have to go out of business because we cannot \ncomply with this rule.\n  There is no way in the world a lot of companies can comply with this \nrule. We would be putting them out of work or out of compliance, \ncertainly liable for a lot of money and expense for a regulation that \ngoes way too far.\n  My primary argument to my colleagues is nobody in OSHA was elected to \nlegislate. We are elected to legislate. We, Members of Congress, are \nthe legislative branch. Read the Constitution. Article I says Congress \nshall enact all laws. It does not say: unelected bureaucrats, you write \na law, try and get it enacted, try and get it passed by legislation.\n  On January 16, in the last couple of days of the Clinton \nadministration, this was a major gift to organized labor, saying, go \nahead and legislate the last couple days.\n  No, we are the legislative body. If we want to legislate in this \narea, introduce a bill and we will consider it. Let's not have, as in \nthe last couple of days of the Clinton administration, a regulation \nwith costs ranging in excess of $100 billion a year. Let's not let that \nhappen. Let's not supersede State worker compensation laws.\n  It will be interesting to see how former State Governors and State \nofficials vote on this issue. Do they really want the Federal \nGovernment to supersede State workers compensation laws? I say the \nanswer is no.\n  I urge all my colleagues, especially colleagues on the Democrat \nside--my colleagues on the Republican side are perhaps more familiar \nwith this issue--I urge my colleagues on the Democrat side to review \nthis. Do you really want to have a Federal workers compensation law \npassed by regulation superseding State worker compensation laws? I \nthink not. I certainly hope not. If that is the case, we have delegated \nso much power to the regulatory agencies we should be ashamed of \nourselves.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to review this statute. That is what the \nCongressional Review Act is all about. Let's review it. Let's talk \nabout it today. Let's find out how intrusive it is, today. Let's find \nout if it really is the Federal Government taking the place of Congress \nin the legislative field. I believe they went way too far. We did \nintroduce a bill 4 or 5 years ago, Senator Reid and myself, and it \npassed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly, signed by President \nClinton. It is a good law. It was written for such items as this. This \nis an excellent time to review this regulation and stop it.\n  Does that mean we are for ergonomic injuries? No. Does that mean we \nshouldn't be taking action in Congress and/or in the Department of \nLabor to try and minimize ergonomic injuries? No. Let's figure out what \ncan we do that is affordable, that is doable, that doesn't cost jobs, \nthat does improve worker safety, that does reduce or minimize worker \ninjury. Let's work on that together. Let's not accept a regulation \ncrammed through in the last couple of days of the Clinton \nadministration that has economic costs in excess, maybe, of $100 \nbillion.\n  One might ask, where do you get that figure? OSHA says it might cost \n$4.5 billion. The Clinton administration's Small Business \nAdministration said it could cost up to 15 times that amount. That is \nup to $60 billion a year. Business groups having to comply with this \nsay it may well be in excess of $100 billion. There is no way to know \nhow much this would cost. It would cost plenty. It would cost jobs.\n  Again, this is something that needs to be reviewed by Congress and \nneeds to be stopped by Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the 10-hour clock is running. \nMy guess is we can have a vote this evening, or we will have a vote \ntomorrow morning. People should be on alert we may well work into the \nevening today. Be on guard to expect rollcall votes to occur later this \nevening or tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Are we going to alternate back and forth?\n  Mr. NICKLES. As manager, I will designate Senator Hutchinson and \nSenator Enzi to manage on our time. We are happy to alternate back and \nforth. We are happy to accommodate our colleagues in any way.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to follow Senator \nKennedy on our side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I reserve that. Let's not do that just yet.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a matter of enormous importance \nand consequence to America's workers. It will be the first time in the \nhistory of OSHA that Congress has taken action that will effectively \nterminate the ability of OSHA to protect American workers. It is in an \narea in which there is a growing problem and a growing concern because \nof the increased numbers of ergonomic injuries. In a period of some 10 \nhours we are going to undermine the efforts of the Department of Labor \nand OSHA over a period of 10 years. Some have made the comments, rather \ncavalierly, that this is a offhand rule that was developed in the final \nhours of the Clinton administration. Of course that is a complete \ndistortion and a complete misrepresentation, as are a number of the \nother recent comments I have heard. I will respond to them in some \ndetail at this time.\n  It is important to note there has been due process. There are those \nwho have differed with the rules and regulations. You would listen to \nthis part of the debate and think that those who are against the rules \nand regulations never had an opportunity to make their case during the \nprocess. Of course that is basically hogwash because they did have that \nopportunity.\n  We can also listen to those who say we have to eliminate these \nregulations. Of course there is a process and procedure by which the \nPresident can modify these rules and regulations, if he doesn't like \nthem. That is not the path those who are seeking to overturn these \nregulations are taking. The President of the United States can just \nfile, in the Federal Register, a resolution, effectively, of \ndisapproval, and wait 60 days and those regulations are effectively \nsuspended.\n  The Department of Labor could then go about the process through \npublic hearings and alter the regulations. So for those who want to \nbring some modification and change, who think there ought to be some \nopportunity to do something different, that power and authority is \nthere today. But that is being rejected by those who want to overturn \nany opportunity to provide any protection for the millions of Americans \nwho have been adversely affected, impacted, and injured by ergonomics \ninjuries over the past several years. That is what we are looking at.\n  With all the talk we have heard already this morning, and we will \nhear later on, we could still have the opportunity to modify and change \nand adjust and go back and trim the regulations. It is a simple \nprocess. But, no, that technique is being rejected. They are coming in \nhere with a blunderbuss and saying, ``We have the votes, we are playing \nhardball''; effectively, ``we are going to give short shrift to the \nAmerican workers''--primarily women because they are the ones most \nadversely impacted. We all have a responsibility to them.\n  I mention to my good friend, when he talks about 400 pages of \nregulations--there are 8 pages of regulations; not 400, 8 pages of \nregulations. It is right in here. If the Senator would want to look \nthrough them, I will be glad to spend some time. Eight pages of \nregulations--it might take someone 20 minutes to read through them. \nEight pages of regulations--the rest is support.\n  It is not the Department of Labor talking about $4 billion of \nexpenditures. It is the Department of Labor talking about $4 billion of \nsavings. It is a big difference. We have to get our facts straight.\n  The same applies to the workers compensation provision. This does not \nundermine States' workers compensation. It has virtually nothing to do \nwith workers compensation, other than what has been done traditionally \nwith other kinds of OSHA rules and regulations such as for cadmium and \nlead.\n\n  There has not been an uproar from the States. I don't hear any. If \nthe Senator will have some letters from Governors who talk about how \ntheir workers compensation has been destroyed, uprooted in ways, we \nwould welcome them. We have not seen them. We have not heard from them.\n  I ask our Members to pay close attention. What is really at risk here \nis enormously important.\n  First of all, we don't have to be here dealing with this issue. We \ncould be debating the bankruptcy issue. If we want to be doing that--we \nwill have a chance and opportunity to do that --but, nonetheless, one \nof the first orders of business we are coming up to is not to look out \nafter minimum wage workers or an increase in the minimum wage. No. We \ndon't have that out here. We are not debating a Patients' Bill of \nRights. It has been before the Congress for 5 years. We are not doing \nthat on the floor of the Senate. No, we are not going to consider that. \nWe are not debating prescription drugs in the Senate.\n  What are we doing? For the first time in the history of the Senate, \nwe are talking about repealing protections for workers who are out \nthere in the workforce of America with a blunderbuss kind of technique \nthat says, ``We have the votes, we are going to repeal it, and as a \nresult of that repeal and the statutory provisions, you will not be \nable to have any kind of ergonomic protection for American workers.''\n  We have the alternative of trying to change this in a responsible way \nbut, oh, no, we are going to show a contemptible attitude, an arrogant, \ncontemptible attitude towards the American workers by this blunderbuss \ntechnique that is being proposed by our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I listened when Senator Reid's name was mentioned. He supported the \nconcept of CRA, but he is strongly opposed to the actions being \nrecommended by the Republican leadership.\n  We all have a responsibility to protect the safety and health of \nworkers on the job. Today the most significant safety and health \nproblems that workers face are debilitating and career-ending ergonomic \ninjuries. Millions of workers and their families suffer needlessly. \nThese injuries can be prevented by simple, inexpensive changes in the \nworkplace. This rule is about prevention, preventing the injury. That \nis\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nwhat this rule is about. We know the injuries are out there. We know \nwhat can be done in order to diminish the number of injuries and that \nis what this rule targets.\n  The Department of Labor's solution to this problem has been sound, \nsensible, and necessary. It is flexible and cost-effective for \nbusinesses, and it is overwhelmingly based upon scientific evidence. It \nhas the support of virtually every health science professional group \nand their representatives. Every one of them has supported this \nproposal, every one of them--but not the Chamber of Commerce and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers.\n  But if you are talking about protecting workers and you are talking \nabout the medical implications and the health implications, every \norganization that is concerned with that supports these proposals.\n  If people have differences about the specifics of this solution, we \ncan work them out in a bipartisan way. The President can stop this \nregulation and issue a new one if he doesn't like it. But in 10 hours \nof debate today, the Republicans intend to destroy this crucial \nprotection that was begun over 10 years ago by the Secretary of Labor, \nElizabeth Dole.\n\n  In the 30 years that the job safety laws have been in effect, \nCongress has never taken away a protection for workers. Listen to me. \nIn the 30 years the job safety law has been in effect, Congress has \nnever taken away protection for workers. This could be the first. \n``Don't alter it, don't change it, don't modify it--eliminate it. We \nhave the votes. That is what we are going to do.'' This is a \ncontemptible attitude towards the working families in this country.\n  One of the most essential roles of government is to protect its \ncitizens. We protect public safety by providing a police force. We \nprotect public health by regulating prescription drugs and food safety \nby rules and regulations by the FDA. Maybe there are those who want to \neliminate all the rules and regulations.\n  The FDA isn't elected either, but they have rules and regulations to \nensure safety and efficacy. We gave them that power. We gave them that \nresponsibility. Are we suggesting now, since they are not elected to \nthe Senate of the United States, how outrageous that they look out \nafter protecting America from the scourge of different diseases that \nhave ravaged our civilizations in the past--hoof and mouth disease, mad \ncow disease? Let's get those professionals out. They are not elected. \nLet's just free ourselves from regulations. It may cost the meat \nmanufacturers and producers a few more bucks because they have to be \ninspected. Let's free ourselves from those matters. These are the same \nissues--health and safety. The same issues.\n  We are protecting workers on the job today. If they are going to \neliminate those protections today, what regulations are they going to \neliminate tomorrow? We came very close to it 3, 4 years ago, \neliminating protective regulations in food safety--the elimination of \nthe Delaney clause--and many others. We came within a vote or two of \neliminating those. The same forces are out there.\n  Today it is the safety in the workforce. Tomorrow it is going to be \nfood, health, and well-being, and the air that we breathe and the water \nthat we drink. Make no mistake about it. The greed is unbelievable. \nThat is what it is all about. What do you think this is about? It is \nabout bucks. It is about money. It is money on the one side; what the \nChamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers want \nversus trying to invest and protect American workers. It is greed. It \nis money. It says that we are not really interested in safety. If they \nwere interested in it, they would want to be responsible. Why do they \ndrop this in the middle of the night? We found out in the magazines and \nnewspapers on Sunday that this technique was going to be used now. Why \nnot mention it and try to work this out? Is this the beginning of the \nprocess or the end of the process?\n  Why not bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights? Why not, even though \nthe President indicated a month ago that he wanted to work this out? We \nsaid fine; we will try to work it out. A month has passed. Are we \nbringing that up? No. Not the Republican leadership. No. Oh, no. They \nare just dropping this right out here. ``We have the votes. We have the \nvotes and are going to pursue it.'' So they do.\n  We protect the public safety by a police force, the public health by \nregulating prescription drugs and food safety. We require seatbelts in \nautomobiles. When Americans are at risk, it is the duty of government \nto do whatever we can to protect them. That is our job. That is our \nresponsibility as public servants. That is why we have laws and \nregulations to protect our citizens in the workplace.\n  I was in the Senate during the years when we heard the same voices we \nare hearing from that side of the aisle opposing the OSHA program. I \nwill tell you this. OSHA has reduced the number of deaths in the \nworkplace by half over the period of the last 27 or 28 years. It has \nsaved an enormous number of lives, and it has protected health and \nwell-being. But we heard at that time: Why are we going to do that? \nThat is going to interfere with American business and their ability to \nproduce American goods. Don't you think American industry is concerned \nabout those workers? Of course they said they passed it.\n  Sure, there have been some actions OSHA has taken with which we don't \nall agree. But, nonetheless, if you look, particularly in the last \nseveral years, the record in terms of the number of lives that have \nbeen saved as compared to other times has been credible and defensible.\n  Over our history, and in the early years of the last century, we have \nfought long battles for the safety of factory workers. We struggled \nlong and hard to improve the working conditions of our mine workers--\none of the most dangerous jobs in America. We took steps to guard \nagainst child labor and other abusive practices.\n  Over the past 10 years, America has taken the next important step to \nprotect workers against the kinds of injuries that occur in the modern \nworkplace--so-called ergonomic injuries.\n  Yesterday, workers lost their limbs in factories. Today's workers \nsuffer crippling pain in their wrists and in their hands because of \ncomputer keyboards. That is an ergonomic injury.\n  Yesterday, workers were burned in steel mills. Today's workers \ndevelop chronic back injuries from standing too long behind the lunch \ncounter, carrying heavy trays of food, and sitting for long hours in \ntheir offices and chairs that harm their backs. Those are ergonomic \ninjuries.\n  The resolution before us today is a complete about-face in the long \nmarch of protecting our workers. In a single vote, we will tell \nmillions of Americans--mostly women--that their work doesn't matter. \nThis resolution is antiworker, antiwoman, antifamily, and it deserves \nto be soundly defeated.\n  We all know what is going on. We could have sat down and worked this \nout in a bipartisan way. If President Bush disagrees with this current \nregulation, he could issue a new one. But, instead, our Republican \nfriends took the course that hurt workers the most--banishing this \nimportant safety initiative to the dungeon.\n  If you do not like the last administration's approach to worker \nsafety, Mr. President, then change it. Don't destroy it--because the \nhealth and safety of millions of American workers is at stake. \nOtherwise, this may well mean that all the talk about a new civility in \nWashington is just a hoax. Instead of helping hard-working families, \nthis resolution is a big ``thank you'' to big business for all their \nsupport. It is politics at its worst.\n  It leaves the average American worker defenseless against today's \nworkplace injuries. With Republicans in control of Congress and the \nWhite House, it is trample-down economics for American workers. Let \nAmerican workers be on guard. Your rights and your dignity and your \nhard work are no longer respected. Today your safety is on the chopping \nblock. Tomorrow it is going to be your medical leave or your ability to \nspend more time with your families, for our Republican friends can act \ntoday on this issue with such disregard for your labors, your hard-won \nworkers' rights, your safety.\n  The Department of Labor's ergonomics rule is sound, sensible, and \nnecessary. I strongly oppose this resolution of disapproval. If \nCongress passes this resolution, it will have destroyed in 10 hours \nwhat it took the\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 10 painstaking years to \ncreate and will deprive workers of all of the protections from the No. \n1 risk to health and safety in the workplace.\n  I have both good news and bad news today. The bad news is that \nergonomic injuries are painful and often debilitating. They are common \nand they are caused by workplace practices.\n  The good news is that these injuries are readily preventable, and the \nergonomics rule offers an effective way to address workplace hazards.\n  The worst news is that Congress today will prevent OSHA from \nimplementing this or any other rule that will protect workers from \nthese significant risks to their health and to their safety.\n  My colleagues should make no mistake about the result of the \nresolution of disapproval that is before us. It is an atom bomb for the \nergonomics rule.\n  Supporters of this resolution insist they can use it to fix the \nergonomics rule and send it back to the drawing board. They are wrong. \nThe language of the resolution is clear and nonamendable and will \neliminate the rule altogether.\n  Until Congress gives it permission, OSHA will be powerless to adopt \nan ergonomics rule that, like this one, truly solves the problem. If \nthe resolution's supporters have their way, all of this will be done \ntoday without any opportunity for committee input or for reasoned \nconsideration on the Senate floor.\n  Our debate is limited to a maximum of 10 hours. This resolution is \nnot subject to motions to amend, to postpone, to move to other \nbusiness, or to recommit to committee. All points of order are waived, \nand appeals from decisions of the Chair are nondebatable.\n  This expedited process will not be used to disapprove a rule that an \nagency clearly lacks authority to issue. It will not be used to \ndisapprove a rule that lacks any basis in scientific evidence. It will \nnot be used to disapprove a rule that was adopted without adequate \nopportunity for public notice and comment. Instead, this fast-track \nprocedure will be used to eliminate a rule that goes to the heart of \nthe Federal Government's mission to protect workers' safety and \nhealth. That is supported by thousands of scientific studies. And that \nis the product of 10 years of study, 9 weeks of public hearings, and 11 \nbest practice conferences all over the country, bringing employers and \nworkers together to try to describe what is and isn't working. That's \n11 conferences all over the Nation, 9 weeks of public hearings, and \nclose to 4 months of opportunity for written comment from the public. \nThis is an unprecedented attack on our workers' fundamental right to \nsafe workplaces.\n\n  As long ago as 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole called \nergonomic injuries ``one of the nation's most debilitating across-the-\nboard worker safety and health illnesses.'' I wish we heard from the \nother side at least some recognition, some understanding, some \nawareness, some sensitivity to the workers who are being injured by \nergonomic injuries every single day in America. But we do not. It is \nall technical language: ``We don't want to interfere with workers' \ncompensation. There are 400 pages in this book over here. The \nDepartment of Labor says X, Y, and Z.''\n  We are talking about family members. We are talking about workers who \nare providing for their families, who are playing by the rules, trying \nto put in a good day's work in order to provide for their families. \nThey ought to be given the assurances about preventing these kinds of \ninjuries if we have the knowledge, the awareness, and understanding, \nand we can do it in an affordable way.\n  We will come back in a few moments and get into the costs on these \nissues. It is quite clear, if we are able to have an effective rule, \nthis will actually save money and increase productivity and lower the \ncost of workers' compensation.\n  Now this is what Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in 1990:\n\n       We must do our utmost to protect workers from these \n     hazards.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       By reducing repetitive motion injuries, we will increase \n     both the safety and productivity of America's workforce.\n\n  As all the study, data, and personal experience since have amply \nshown, she was right.\n  Each year, over 1.8 million workers report that they have suffered \nfrom ergonomic injuries. Another 1.8 million incur ergonomic injuries \nthat they do not report. What this means is simple: Over the 10 years \nof study OSHA devoted to this rule, America's working men and women \nendured over 18 million unnecessary injuries.\n  The average cost of these injuries--severe injuries--is anywhere from \n$25,000 to $27,000. I do not know what the value is in terms of denying \nsomeone their opportunity to use their hands, use their arms. What is \nthe cost if they cannot use their fingers, cannot use their wrists, not \nonly in the workplace but in terms of being able to pick up a child or \nbe able to walk with a child or play with a child when they are growing \nup--all of the personal kinds of important opportunities in life that \ngive individuals a sense of the joy of life?\n  What does it cost here? That is what we are debating. The Chamber of \nCommerce says it is too much. But 10 years of studies, evaluations, and \nbest practices said that this can be done, and done in a way that will \nsave money for American business.\n  You have two entirely different viewpoints. Do we have a chance to \nexamine them? No. They say: ``We have the votes.'' We have how many \nhours left now? Nine more hours left? Nine more hours left until we can \nfinish this rule off? That is the attitude of those who want to repeal \nthis rule.\n\n  The statistics also show how serious this problem is. More than \n600,000 workers lose a day or more from work each year because of these \ninjuries. Indeed, the Academy of Sciences estimates this number is even \nhigher, that over 1 million workers lose time at work because of their \nergonomic injuries.\n  This is the Academy of Sciences. No, they are not elected to \nanything. But they are the Academy of Sciences, universally respected. \nAnd that is what they found, I say to Senators--1 million a year. And \nin 10 hours we are throwing out rules that can provide protection for \nthese workers.\n  Ergonomic injuries account for over one-third of all serious job-\nrelated injuries and over two-thirds of all job-related illnesses. The \ninjuries are costly. In a definitive study released only 6 weeks ago, \nthe National Academy of Sciences estimated ergonomic injuries cost the \nNation $50 billion annually in workers compensation costs--$50 billion \nnow annually today if we do nothing. That isn't the Senator from \nMassachusetts saying that. That is the National Academy of Sciences \nsaying that: $50 billion if we do nothing, in terms of workers \ncompensation, absenteeism, and lost productivity.\n  In fact, ergonomic injuries account for $1 in every $3 that employers \nspend for workers' compensation costs. That is a cost of $15 to $18 \nbillion every year in workers' compensation costs.\n  These injuries are painful and often crippling. They range from \ncarpal tunnel syndrome, to severe back injuries, to disorders of the \nmuscles and nerves. Carpal tunnel syndrome keeps workers off the job \nlonger than any other workplace injury. This injury alone causes \nworkers to lose an average of more than 25 days, compared to 17 days \nfor fractures and 20 days for amputations.\n  These injuries affect all of us. Carpal tunnel syndrome afflicts \nnurses. It hurts truck drivers and cooks. It affects secretaries, \ncashiers, and hairdressers. It threatens any of us who use a computer \nor lift heavy objects or bend to pick things up. We are all at risk.\n  And even if each of us individually has not yet suffered a repetitive \nstress injury, we all know people who have. They are mothers, fathers, \nbrothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and neighbors--and they deserve our \nhelp. But contrary to what the good Senator from Oklahoma says, there \nare broad industries which are left out. This rule is a rather \nreasonable rule and quite narrow. It does not affect agriculture. It \ndoes not affect the maritime industry, railroads, or construction. \nThose industries are left out. They are left out for other reasons. I \ncan come back to them later.\n  So this idea of what is going to happen to workers' compensation and \nthe number of pages of the rule, and what is the cost going to be, and \nabout all the industry affected, we have to get down to the real facts.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n  Women are disproportionately harmed by ergonomic hazards. Women make \nup 47 percent of the overall workforce, but in 1998 they accounted for \n64 percent of the repetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of the \ncarpal tunnel cases.\n  I will show you this chart very quickly. I see others on the floor, \nSenator Feinstein and others, who will speak to this in greater detail.\n  Women are 47 percent of the total workforce. Of the total number of \ninjured workers, they are only 33 percent. But if you are looking at \nergonomic hazards, lost work time from repetitive motion injuries, in \n1998, women accounted for 64 percent of those who had repetitive motion \ninjuries and 71 percent of those who lost time for carpal tunnel \ninjuries. This is a rule about protecting women in the workforce, \nbecause of changes in terms of our new economy primarily, and for other \nreasons as well.\n\n  These women are not faceless numbers. We are talking about workers \nsuch as Beth Piknick from Massachusetts, who was an intensive care \nnurse for 21 years before a preventable back injury required her to \nundergo a spinal fusion operation and spend 2 years in rehabilitation. \nAlthough she wants to work, she can no longer do so. In her own words:\n\n       The loss of my ability to take care of patients led to a \n     clinical depression . . . My ability to take care of \n     patients--the reason I became a nurse--is gone. My injury--\n     and all the losses it has entailed--were preventable.\n\n  We are talking about workers such as Elly Leary, an auto assembly \nperson at the now-closed General Motors assembly plant in Framingham, \nMA. Like many, many of her coworkers, she suffered a series of \nergonomic injuries--including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. \nLike others, she tried switching hands to do the job. She tried varying \nthe sequence of the routine. She even bid on other jobs. But nothing \nhelped. Today, years after her injury, when she wakes up in the \nmorning, her hands are in a claw-like shape. To get them to open, she \nhas to run hot water on them.\n  We are talking about workers such as Charley Richardson, a shipfitter \nat General Dynamics in Quincy, MA, in the mid-1980s. He suffered a \ncareer-ending back injury when he was told to install a 75-pound piece \nof steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try to work, he \nfound that on many days he could not endure the lifting and the use of \nheavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented him from \nparticipating in basic activities. But the loss that hurt the most was \nhaving to tell his children they could not sit on his lap for more than \na few minutes because it was too painful. To this day, he cannot sit \nfor long without pain.\n  We are talking about workers such as Wendy Scheinfeld of Brighton, \nMA, a model employee in the insurance industry. Colleagues say she \noften put in extra hours to ``get the job done.'' As a result, Wendy \nhas lost the use of her hands, and is now permanently unable to do her \njob, drive a car, play the cello, or shop for groceries.\n\n  The ergonomics rule was too late to help Beth, Elly, Charley, and \nWendy. And there will be many, many more like them if Congress takes \naway the protections of the rule now.\n  This is because there is now conclusive, indisputable evidence that \nworkplace practices cause ergonomic injuries. Dr. Jeremiah Barondess, \nthe chair of the panel of experts that conducted the comprehensive \nstudy of the ergonomics issue for the National Academy of Sciences, has \npointedly stated that there is a ``clear causal relationship'' between \nworking conditions and ergonomic injuries.\n  And in case anyone has forgotten, this NAS study was the very study \nthat opponents of the ergonomics rule said would inform their views on \nthe issue. Time and time again, my colleagues across the aisle urged us \nto wait for more evidence that ergonomic injuries were a problem, that \nworkplace practices were responsible for these injuries, that these \ninjuries could be prevented. These were unjustified delaying tactics. \nBut if anyone thought there was any doubt at all about these issues, \nthey now have their answer. To suggest that these issues are debatable \nis, quite simply, preposterous.\n  Mr. President, I will come back later on. There are other points I \nwish to make. I note a number of my colleagues on the floor.\n  I underscore a very simple and basic thought: This rule has been in \nthe making 10 years, weeks of hearings and examination and evaluation, \nstudied by the Academy of Sciences and by every scientific group, \nsupported by virtually all of the health community that has expertise \nin these areas. There was a simple technique by which this rule could \nhave been altered or changed, a very simple technique. That is being \nrejected. If you are for some modification, any modification at all, \nyou ought to reject this proposal. That way, it will still be possible \nto bring about some changes in the ergonomic rules.\n  But instead, what we are being asked to do is to accept lock, stock, \nand barrel that we are going to reject this rule that will effectively \nclose out any opportunity to protect these workers for the first time \nin 30 years.\n  I cannot think of many health and safety rules and regulations which \nthe Chamber of Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers \nhas supported to protect American workers. If there are some, I hope we \nhave the chance to hear it from the other side. They have been \nbasically opposed to these regulations. They think they have the votes \nnow not only to modify it but to end this rule, which addresses the No. \n1 health and safety issue for American workers today. That is basically \nwrong. It was recognized as being a major problem by the wife of our \nformer Republican majority leader, Elizabeth Dole, over 10 years ago. \nThere has been nothing that has happened since that time to indicate to \nthe contrary.\n  On the contrary, there is constant scientific evidence to demonstrate \nthat this is a problem, that this rule has been carefully considered \nand, finally, that this rule, when it is implemented, will actually \nsave money because it will reduce workers' compensation, reduce \nabsenteeism, and increase productivity. That is why the Department of \nLabor in its evaluation finds that instead of this problem costing $50 \nbillion a year, we will actually save more than $4 billion a year.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to \ncomment, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for so well setting \nup the comments I have.\n  There was a reason for the Congressional Review Act being passed, a \ngood reason for it. You could even assume there was a good reason on \nthe basis that it was passed in a very bipartisan way. First, \ncosponsors of it were Mr. Nickles, the Senator from Oklahoma, and Mr. \nReid, the Senator from Nevada--one from each side. How good of a job \ndid they do of persuading you that this was a good law to put in place? \nI am not sure what precipitated it. I assume that some agency jerked \nthe Congress around, and Congress believed it was time to jerk them \nback to reality. Not one of you voted against the CRA.\n  There is a need to have an act such as the CRA. That need exists when \nan agency fails to listen to a single comment on the work they are \ndoing, when they are so sure of their work that they will not listen to \nhearings; that they will not listen to Congress; that they will not \nlisten to experts; that they continue to do exactly the same thing they \ndid before. Wait a minute. No, they did make some changes. They made it \nfar worse. They took the comments they got, and they opposed everything \nand incorporated things in this that were worse than in the law that \nwas passed.\n  We can't have agencies taking that kind of action. We know this is a \ndivided Congress. My bet is that there will still be a very bipartisan \naction to pass this resolution we are voting on today to eliminate the \nrule as was proposed, as was printed, as is now in effect.\n  There has been a suggestion that we should trim it. I could go along \nwith that. But where would you start? I am holding 600 pages of stuff \nthat the average American businessman cannot understand. Yes, he can \nhire technical experts who will help him with it at great expense. But \neven the technical experts are divided.\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n  This little document includes by reference eight more documents. This \nisn't the whole load that a small businessman has to carry around this \ncountry. Let me ask you if you have received those eight documents and \nread those eight documents. I can tell you conclusively, you have not. \nOne of those documents isn't even available. The people, when you call \nthem and ask for the document, say: Don't bother us anymore.\n  This is ridiculous. One document referred to in this rule you can't \neven get. Some of my colleagues say the rule is really a short rule. Is \nit 400 pages? Is it six pages? Is it eight pages? Is it 20 pages? You \ncan argue for all of those numbers. You can argue for 800 pages. But if \nyou really count what the small businessmen in America are going to \nhave to read, you will find that it is 800 pages. To say that this \ndocument is eight pages is statistically impossible.\n  If you agree this document is eight pages long, you think that the \nincome tax forms you fill out only require reading two pages of \nmaterial. That is exactly the same thing. When you fill out your income \ntax form, there are two pertinent pages to fill out, but there is a \nlittle manual that comes with them. If you don't pay attention to that \nmanual, you will mess up your taxes. You will be fined. Maybe you will \nbe thrown in jail. So you can't just look at the two pages, even if \nthey are the only ones you fill out.\n  So let's not argue about 8 pages, 20 pages, 400 pages, 600 pages, 800 \npages. Ask the small businessman how much he wants to read, and then \ntake a look at how much he is going to have to read.\n  Now, you and I can look through this, or we can have our staffs look \nthrough it, and decide what we think is pertinent. I tell you, the \nsmall businessman out there doesn't have that luxury. He can't say, \n``Somebody just show me the couple of paragraphs that affect my \nbusiness.'' He can't do that because this affects his business--this \nand eight more manuals, only seven of which are available at a cost of \n$220.90.\n  That is a lot of work for a small businessman. Trim it? Why didn't \nOSHA trim it. California has a one-page ergonomics rule. Why not OSHA?\n  Why is this rule bad? This rule was written for the people who are \nbad to the bone. You and I both know that in any profession, in any \nbusiness, and even with groups of employees, there are going to be \nabout 5 percent of the people who are ethically challenged. Five \npercent look for ways not to do exactly what they ought to do. That is \nboth the businessmen and the employees. Out of that 5 percent, you will \nfind that there are about 3 percent--this is included in that 5 \npercent--the reason they are ethically challenged is that they don't \ncare. No matter what you put in their manual, they don't care; they are \ngoing to do business as usual. Out of that 3 percent, there is about \none-tenth of a percent of people who are bad to the bone. That is on \nboth sides. That isn't just businessmen or employees. It might even be \na smaller number than that.\n  This rule is written punishing 99.9 percent of the people in this \ncountry--businesses and employees--to take care of one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the people who are bad to the bone. That is not the way we \nare supposed to do these rules. That isn't the right way to do it.\n  We have a little conflict in some of our laws. One of the conflicts \nwe have is that it is difficult to talk to the worker. You will hear \nexamples throughout the day of terrible things being done to workers. I \nknow of some of them. I have heard the speeches before on a lot of \nthem. I have even looked into some of them. I have talked to some of \nthese workers. Do you know we have a law that prohibits management from \ntalking to the employee about how his job could be more ergonomically \nsound, unless he is in a union?\n  Now, there is a little catch there. Actually, the employer still \ndoesn't get to talk to the worker who is doing the job because he is \nrepresented. It is the representative that they have to talk to. So \nthey don't get to listen to a worker who is doing the job. I listen to \nthem in Wyoming almost every weekend--they know how this job ought to \nbe done. And they have some of the simplest solutions. But they are not \nable to talk to employers about it because of the National Labor \nRelations Act. But this rule doesn't incorporate the solutions for the \nkinds of problems that you are going to hear today in a way that the \nsmall businessman can handle them.\n  Last July we had this debate and we passed an amendment, in a \nbipartisan way, that was avoided by the administration, pressed by the \nagency, and circumvented by the agency so this could be put into place. \nI will have some more words about how that was achieved.\n  I wish to make it perfectly clear that this vote is not about whether \nwe should have ergonomics protection. It isn't about that. Let me \nrepeat that. This vote is not about whether we should have ergonomics \nprotection. Of course we should. Of course we need it.\n  Have each of you worked in your offices to handle some of the \nergonomics problems there? I have. It is a necessity right where we \nwork. Does this rule work for us? No. And we have lots of staff. It is \njust the other people, just the small businessmen who have to memorize \nthe manual themselves.\n\n  My colleagues and I strongly believe in protecting the workers, \nprotecting the employees against musculoskeletal injuries--there is one \nof those $50 words from OSHA. We are not trying to kill ergonomics \nprotection. In fact, you heard my colleague from Vermont earlier say \nthat the Congressional Review Act clearly permits OSHA to issue another \nergonomics rule, and you have heard the words of the Secretary of Labor \nwho said she will continue to look at this issue and consider all the \nbest options for protecting worker safety, including a new rulemaking.\n  I look forward to engaging in that process with Secretary Chao. As \nchairman of the subcommittee dealing with work safety, I feel a special \nresponsibility to help employers protect American workers. I have no \ninterest in killing the ergonomics protection, and I would not vote to \ndo that. In fact, one of the highlights of last weekend was my meeting \nwith the Service Employees International Union in Wyoming and receiving \na certificate from them, on a national basis, for the work that I did \non safety with needle sticks--something that was extremely important in \nthis country, something that had been worked on for at least a decade.\n  Senator Kennedy and I, and Senator Jeffords, and others, talked about \nsome reasonable improvements that could be made. We got together on a \nbill. We put it together as a bill--not as a rulemaking by a bunch of \nunelected bureaucrats, not something as long as this rule. We agreed on \nit. Do you know what happened. It passed both bodies by unanimous \nconsent. It went to the President and, of course, the President signed \nit.\n  After years of working on it, we sat down and worked it out. I am \nsaying that we can work out ergonomics legislation so it will be \nbeneficial to everyone, particularly the ones doing the work. That is \nhow we are supposed to go about doing things, not through the process I \nam going to describe to you that OSHA went through and wound up with \nthis huge rule.\n  But we are not voting on the value of ergonomics protection today; we \nare voting on one thing, and one thing only, and that is this Clinton \nergonomics rule. This rule cannot be allowed to stand. If this were \nallowed to stand, it would not be of benefit to people who are working. \nIt was issued as a last political hurrah for the former administration. \nIt is the product of a rushed and flawed rulemaking, and it will not \nprotect workers.\n  The power for OSHA to write this rule did not materialize out of thin \nair. We in Congress did give that authority to OSHA, and it is time for \nus to take some responsibility for what OSHA has done this time. The \nCongressional Review Act gives us special procedures to do just that, \nand I am proud to be a part of today's historic innovation of the act.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Nickles, for passing the bipartisan \nCongressional Review Act, along with Senator Reid, and for his hard \nwork on the ergonomics issue. I also thank my colleagues, Senator Bond, \nSenator Hutchinson, and Senator Thompson, for their hard work on this \nissue.\n  This ergonomics rule is such an overbroad, overblown bureaucratic \nmess that I cannot imagine any action more in need of being taken than \ncongressional intervention.\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n  I am sure by the time we have had our 10 hours of debate, this rule \nwill be indefensible.\n  Many of my Democrat colleagues are criticizing the effort to overturn \nthe ergonomics rule. I wonder if any have actually read this gorilla of \na rule. Have they tried to understand it? Have they tried to implement \nit in their offices? Have they asked the small business people in their \nStates whether they will be able to implement it? Of course they \nhaven't. If they had, there is no possible way they would want this \nrule to remain in effect.\n  Let me explain specifically why Congress must act to revoke the \nergonomics rule. This rule violates sound principles of State and \nFederal law and, more importantly, common sense. I will talk more about \nthat later, as will my colleagues.\n  First, I will talk about how we got here and then we will better \nunderstand why this rule is so bad and needs to go. Simply put, OSHA \nrushed through the rulemaking process. Worse yet, they stacked the \nevidentiary evidence. They ignored criticisms--worse than that, they \npaid people to rip the criticisms apart. They changed the rules in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  Is it any wonder this flawed process produced a flawed rule? Use \nspoiled milk, you get a spoiled milkshake. Let's look at some examples. \nSince 1988, the average time OSHA has spent per rule has been 4 years. \nYet the ergonomics regulation was finalized in under 1 year by OSHA \ndespite the fact it generated more public comment than any other prior \nOSHA rule. Why the rush? The answer is clear: The history books were \nclosing on the Clinton Presidency so OSHA rushed to publish its final \nrule on one of the last possible days before the new administration to \nensure that the new administration would have no recourse. The rule was \npublished on November 16, put into effect on January 16. Is it any \ncoincidence that the inauguration was January 20? That is by \nconstitutional law. Everybody knew when the inauguration would be, when \nthe opportunity would come for a new administration to take a look at \nwhat has happened. This has been a rush. No, they rushed forward in \nspite of the fact that both the Senate and the House voted to impose a \n1-year delay on the rulemaking in a bipartisan way, in a civil way. \nResponsible rulemaking or political posturing? What was the agency \ndoing and thinking?\n  My Democrat colleagues love to say this rulemaking has been a 10-year \nprocess started by Republican Elizabeth Dole. Let's be perfectly clear. \nNo matter how long an issue is out there, the public has no way of \nknowing how OSHA will handle it, what OSHA will require, what OSHA is \ngoing to do, until OSHA actually publishes a proposed rule. That is the \nbeginning of the rule debate. We have all known there have been \nergonomics problems--ergonomics problems at work, at home, ergonomics \nproblems with our recreation. Something needs to be done in all of \nthose areas to eliminate the pain and suffering people go through. We \nhave all recognized that.\n  When did OSHA actually do something? They did it a little less than a \nyear before the final rule. In the case of ergonomics, OSHA let us in \non their plan a mere 358 days before they made it the law of the land, \none-quarter of the time they typically take.\n  Let's break it down even further. After the public comment period \nclosed on August 10, 2000, OSHA received over 7,000 comments with 800 \nvolumes of exhibits comprised of over 19,000 separate documents, each \nranging in size up to 700 pages. Say the average size of these \ndocuments is just 100 pages; that comes to 1.9 million pages of \nmaterial. That is pretty close to 2 million pages. But there were only \n94 days between the end of the public comment period and the date of \nthe OSHA-published rue.\n\n  How can the American people possibly have confidence that OSHA truly \nread, understood, analyzed, correlated, and responded to the 2 million \npages of material in 94 days? That is 20,000 pages a day, steady, \nconsolidated. Even if they don't consider it--which we know they \ndidn't--it takes a long time to get through 2 million pages of work. \nMaybe that is where they saved time because there isn't a single bit of \nevidence that a single concern made it to the final rule. In fact, the \nrule got worse. They didn't listen; they made it worse.\n  Maybe OSHA didn't think it needed to pay any attention to these \ncomments because it could get all the information it wanted from its \nhired guns. Yes, hired guns. At a most conservative estimate, OSHA paid \nover 70 contractors a total of $1.75 million to help it with ergonomics \nrulemaking. In particular, OSHA paid some 20 contractors $10,000 each \nto testify on the proposed rule. They not only testified on it; they \nhad their testimony edited by the Department. Does that show concern \nfor the problems of America? They brought them in for special sessions \nso they would be prepared for the same kind of atmosphere they would be \nin when they were presenting their testimony. They practiced these \npeople, which also made sure the testimony they were giving was the \ntestimony OSHA wanted given.\n  Then--and this is the worst part of it all--they paid those witnesses \nto tear apart the testimony of the other folks who were testifying, at \ntheir own expense.\n  Not being paid $10,000 by their government, coming to Washington \nwanting to testify on a rule, or sending their comments to Washington \nexpecting their comments to be read and considered: not much to ask of \na citizen, is it?\n  What does our government do? They pay contractors to rip apart the \ntestimony. These may be the same contractors who helped compile these 2 \nmillion pages of documents to see if there was anything worth putting \ninto the rule. That is not how our government ought to work. OSHA \nassisted the contractors with preparation of their testimony; they made \nsuggestions to them about what they should say; they held practice \nsessions to prepare them.\n  Regardless of whether these tactics actually violate any law, it \nclearly paints OSHA as a zealous advocate, not an impartial \ndecisionmaker. That is what we expect of our government: impartial \ndecisions--not rabid, zealous advocates.\n  OSHA should be weighing all of the evidence and making the best \ndecision for workplace safety, not blindly defending its own position \nat all costs--literally all costs, your costs and my costs, paying \npeople to present the testimony.\n  How can the American people have any confidence that the outcome of \nthis rulemaking was fair and unbiased? Look at the evidence. They \ncan't.\n  This perception is also strengthened by the fact that OSHA completely \nignored the many criticisms of the proposed rule and actually made it \nworse. For example, I held two hearings on OSHA's proposed rule last \nyear. Yesterday, I brought in a volume that included that, with lots of \ntestimony, lots of information, lots of letters.\n  During the first hearing, we examined a provision that requires \nemployers to compensate certain injured employees at 90 percent to 100 \npercent of their salary. OSHA calls this requirement a ``work \nrestriction protection,'' or WRP. But this provision sounds an awful \nlot like Federal workers compensation, doesn't it?\n  At the hearing, we heard testimony from a State workers compensation \nadministrator and two experts in insurance and workers compensation. We \nalso received written testimony from a large group of insurance \ncompanies. All of this testimony unequivocally showed that this \nprovision will wreak havoc with the State workers compensation systems.\n  All 50 States have intricate workers compensation systems that strike \na delicate balance between the employer and the employee. When I was in \nthe State legislature in Wyoming, that took up a good deal of the time \nwe spent in the Labor Committee, working on all of the history of \nworkers comp. It is decades old, and there are thousands of \nadministrators who have worked on this for years. OSHA doesn't have \nanybody who has worked on it for years. OSHA doesn't have anything in \nplace to take care of the kinds of things that are going to happen when \nthis rule starts generating workers comp payments.\n  All 50 States do have intricate workers compensation systems, and \nthey strike a delicate balance. Each party gives up certain rights in \nexchange for certain benefits. An employer gives up his ability to \nargue that a workplace accident was not its fault in exchange\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nfor a promise that the employee will not pursue other remedies against \nit.\n  Each State has reached its own balance through years of experience, \ntrial and error. Significantly, Congress has never taken this autonomy \naway from the States by mandating Federal workers compensation \nrequirements before. The ergonomics rule destroys the State's balance \nand completely overrides the State's rights to make an independent \ndetermination about what constitutes a work-related injury and what \nlevel of compensation injured workers should receive.\n  OSHA doesn't have the mechanisms or the manpower to decide the \nnumerous disputes that will inevitably arise because of the WRP \nprovision. All of a sudden, OSHA will have to decide disputes over the \nexistence of medical conditions, the causation, and the right to \ncompensation. What is going to happen to workplace safety and health \nwhile OSHA is busy being a workers compensation administration? Do you \nthink they are going to need some additional help on that? You bet they \nwill.\n  In addition, under WRP, employers must pay immediately and employees \ncan keep both the WRP payment and the workers compensation payment \nunless the employer sues the employee to recoup the double payment. Do \nyou think the employee will have the money to pay back the double \npayment?\n  What we mentioned in committee, and I have mentioned this personally \nto the people who were working on this rule, that it was set up so an \nemployee could be paid twice for being injured--I ask you, if you can \nmake more money by not showing up for work than you can by showing up \nfor work, would your boss expect you to be there? Even for the best \nintentioned person, this is a great temptation. And what we are hearing \nfrom the businessmen across this country. How do we administer this? \nHow do we make sure we are not doing double payments to employees? How \ndo we make sure that our workforce isn't being paid not to work? We \nwant to do what is right, but we do need workers.\n  Employees will be making more money by staying home than coming to \nwork, and without any medical diagnosis.\n\n  The rule is triggered with no medical diagnosis. Worse yet, under the \nWRP, the employer cannot get information from the doctor about how the \naccident happened? He can't get advice from the doctor who actually \nlooked at the patient, to see how to solve the problem. That is illegal \nunder the rule. If we really want to solve the problem for the person, \nwhy can't they talk to each other under this rule? Talking to people is \nthe way to get the solution, and OSHA prohibit it because they think \nall those employers out there are bad to the bone. They wrote this rule \nfor the one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this country who will \nnot be affected by the rule one bit.\n  It is no surprise that this WRP provision was vigorously opposed by \nthe Western Governors' Association, the Tennessee Legislature, the New \nYork Department of Labor, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor, and \nmany others. All these complaints are on top of the fact that WRPs \nviolate the OSH Act, a little problem OSHA chose to ignore.\n  Thirty years ago when Congress wrote the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act, it made an explicit statement about OSHA and workers \ncompensation. I will quote the act.\n\n       . . . supersede or in any manner affect any workmen's \n     compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any \n     other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or \n     liabilities of employers and employees under any law with \n     respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising \n     out of, or in the course of, employment.\n\n  This is almost as if to say: What part of ``no'' don't you \nunderstand? ``Nothing in this chapter shall be construed''--``in any \nother manner''--there are so many words in here that say you can't do \nworkers comp.\n  You will hear the other side mention a couple of areas where there \nhave been some WRP payments. You will find that those are instances \nwhere they can test for substances that can be isolated at the \nworkplace, where there was virtually no other possibility of them \ngetting the contamination somewhere else. They are in the cotton dust \nand the lead provision. These are very special cases where the exposure \ncan only happen at those workplaces.\n  That is not like this one, where the accident can happen--it happens \nover a period of time; it happens as a result of an accumulated effect, \nand, according to the National Academy of Sciences study, it is even \nbased on attitude at the moment. I would like to see people measure \nthat one.\n  Twice the provision uses the broad phrase ``shall not affect in any \nmanner'' to describe what OSHA should not do to workers compensation. \nAs someone with the privilege of being one of the country's lawmakers, \nit is hard for me to imagine how Congress could have drafted a broader \nor more explicit prohibition of OSHA's interference with State workers \ncompensation.\n  But did OSHA heed these numerous complaints and the potential \nillegality and the constant mention that has been made of it during the \nentire process, in comment letters, in hearings, and remove the rule? \nNo, it did not. They are all right here. It is on page 6885-4--I love \nthe numbering of the Federal documents--of the final rule.\n  In our second hearing, we examined the devastating effect the rule \nwould have on patients and facilities dependent upon Medicaid and \nMedicare. Testimony at that hearing demonstrated that the rule forces \nthese facilities to violate the law and could force them out of \nbusiness. In 1987, Congress passed the Nursing Home Act, recognizing \nthe importance of human dignity--the importance of patient dignity--the \nimportance of permitting patients to choose how they are moved and how \nthey receive certain types of care.\n  This act and corresponding regulations mandate this important freedom \nof choice for patients. The ergonomics rule, on the other hand, imposes \nmany requirements on all health care facilities and providers \nconcerning patient care and movement. Thus, these facilities and \nproviders may be forced to choose between violating the ergonomics rule \nor violating both the Nursing Home Act and patient dignity. We asked \nthem to come up with some kind of solution for that problem in the \nhearing.\n  Moreover, OSHA's rule forces impossible choices about resource \nallocation between patient care versus employee care. The only way for \nbusinesses to absorb the cost of this rule is to pass the cost along to \nconsumers. However, some consumers are patients dependent on Medicaid \nand Medicare--very important people we cannot leave out. The Federal \nGovernment sets an absolute cap on what these individuals can pay for \nmedical services. Thus, the facilities that provide care for these \npatients simply cannot charge a higher cost. They have to absorb the \ncost of the rule.\n  Simply put, these facilities and providers are unable to absorb the \ncost of the ergonomics rule. And there is no question these facilities \nwill face a cost. OSHA's own estimate of the cost of compliance in the \nfirst year will total $526 million for nursing and personal care \nfacilities and residential care. The industry is already having \ntrouble. The industry estimates that the per-facility cost for a \ntypical nursing home will be $60,000.\n  But my issue with this rule is not that it will cost these facilities \nso much. It is that it will cost elderly and poor patients access to \nquality care. The new expenses this rule will add simply cannot be \npassed on to the patients who depend on this program, and a cut in \nservice will be the only option. We have already seen what is \nhappening, particularly with rural medical practice costs of providing \nthe treatments that are limited. They are going out of business in my \nState.\n  Did OSHA do anything to address this problem? Did it resolve the \nlegal conflict? Did it explain how these facilities can comply without \nsacrificing quality of care and quantity of care? No. In fact, OSHA's \nown estimate of the cost of compliance with the final rule actually \nincreased over the proposed rule. And they stuck in a couple more \nthings. OSHA actually made this situation worse rather than listening \nto these vulnerable facilities.\n  This really disappoints me.\n  After the hearings were over, I met with the former Assistant \nSecretary for OSHA and talked to him about my concerns. Mr. Ballinger \nmade efforts in North Carolina in ergonomics and saw\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\na reasonable approach to it, and even recommended him to be the \nAssistant Secretary for OSHA. I was there at the nomination process and \nthe confirmation hearing. I asked questions about this. I thought we \nhad a person who was reasonable and who would listen. Perhaps he did. \nPerhaps the bureaucracy took control of him.\n  But I met with him after we had the hearings and before the rule went \ninto effect. I pleaded with him to solve the problems created by the \nproposed rule. And he said he would make significant changes. But it \nwas clear that he thought OSHA was an advocate for their original \nversion rather than an impartial decisionmaker weighing all the \nevidence fairly.\n  Now that I have seen the final rule, it is clear that OSHA saw blind \nadvocacy as more important than its duty to craft the best possible \nrule. I see no indication that he took my subcommittee's work or any of \nthe public comments to heart.\n  Perhaps more disturbing than OSHA's disregard for public comment is \nits denial of public opportunity to accept only certain elements of the \nfinal rule--another drastic attack on the American people. OSHA made \nsignificant substantial changes to the final rule without giving the \npublic an opportunity to comment on them.\n  What this could lead to if we don't reverse the rule today is the \nagency saying: Let's see. The easiest way to do this would be to leave \nthings out of the proposal and then hold the hearings and take the \ntestimony. And, when we are finished, we will do the final rule the way \nwe want to.\n\n  That is what OSHA did. The starting point wasn't so popular and it \ndrew significant adverse comment. But they didn't address it. They just \nwent on to another publication--one that was more stringent than with \nwhat they started.\n  The worst of these changes is OSHA's addition of eight new job hazard \nanalysis tools.\n  I can almost see your eyes starting to glaze over. If I started to \nread all of these additional pages to you, they would. But remember \nthat the small businessman has to take these into consideration. The \nguy out there who doesn't have the specialized staff that OSHA has is \ngoing to have to know these because they have included them in the \nrule.\n  OSHA's rule says to employers: If you want to be assured of avoiding \nfines and penalties, you have to reduce the ergonomic hazards in your \nworkplace below the level specified in one of eight tools contained in \nmandatory appendix D-1.\n  Doesn't that get you excited? The tool you use is dependent on the \ntype of work your business performs. But you have to figure out which \none for yourself.\n  Here are a couple of them.\n  We have the ACGIH hand-arm vibration--actually sharing a summary with \nthe small businessmen. It may be some help to them but not much.\n  GM-UAW risk factor checklist: Sounds like the kind of study you would \nwant to read to keep your mind active.\n  The push-pull hazard table, and the rapid upper limb assessment--do \nthose sound a little difficult? Yes; they are. They were written by \nergonomists for ergonomists. None of them were written for small \nbusinessmen. But the small businessman still has to understand them.\n  These tools are actually eight separate documents that were not \nwritten by OSHA, and they were not mandated in the proposed rule--only \nthe final rule. No member of the scientific community and none of the \nregulated public had an opportunity to comment on whether mandating \ncompliance with these tools is a good idea.\n  Adding insult to injure, as far as I can tell, OSHA does not provide \nthese documents. Instead, OSHA tells employers: You are on your own. Go \nask the publishers, the trade association, and the private companies \nthat wrote these tools to give them to you. So we gave it a shot.\n  Let me tell you it wasn't easy. It took three of my staff several \ndays, and there was still one document they were not able to obtain at \nall. Remember, these weren't free.\n  As for the rest of them, one of the documents is 164 pages long. That \nis in addition to the rule. It all depends on how thick the paper is. \nThe Government didn't use good paper. That probably saved us a little \nbit of money. Not doing the rule would save us a lot more.\n  So let's see what the local bakery has to comply with. I am going to \nread from The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists \nHand/Arm (Segmental) Vibration Threshold Limit Value (or TLV). This is \nstraight from the range of pages cited by OSHA in the mandatory \nappendix:\n\n       For each direction being measured, linear integration \n     should be employed for vibrations that are of extremely short \n     duration or vary substantially in time. If the total daily \n     vibration exposure in a given direction is composed of \n     several exposures at different rms accelerations, then the \n     equivalent, frequency-weighted component acceleration in that \n     direction should be determined in accordance with the \n     following equation.\n\n  As for the rest of them: One of these documents is one hundred sixty-\nfour pages long. For at least five others, there are separate monetary \ncharges--that's right, businesses have to pay to be able to read these \nfederally mandated documents. And several of these documents are \narticles in scientific journals written for ergonomists and engineers. \nBut the corner convenience store, local newspaper and your favorite \nbakery must comply with them all the same.\n  That is something we deal with on the floor of the Senate every \nsingle day, isn't it? I mean, why wouldn't our small businessmen be \nable to take this simple--simple?--calculus formula and figure out if \ntheir employees were getting too much vibration on the job?\n  It would be a lot simpler if they asked the employees if they were \nhaving vibration problems. But the law makes that difficult.\n  You cannot talk to the guy with the problem and say: Are the \nvibrations bothering you? What can we do to eliminate some of the \nvibrations? No. Instead, we have this thing about RMS accelerations, \nwith equivalent, frequency-weighted component acceleration, determined \nin conjunction with this very simple formula.\n  Now, I am sure everybody in Congress is going to be proud to go to \ntheir baker and say: We know you run some equipment that has \nvibrations. I want to help you understand this formula. Yes. It is not \ngoing to happen. When your baker sees this thing, I will tell you what \nhe will think you ought to do with this rule. There really ought not to \nbe anybody who votes for this rule, not the way it has been messed up \nthrough a process that ought to be helping people.\n  Do you see any evidence there was any attempt to help people? All we \nbuilt in was cost. We did not build in care. We did not take care of \nthe people of America. We did not save them from their ergonomics \nproblems. We put so much garbage out there that the businessman is \nsimply not going to be able to comply.\n  This isn't the kind of thing any of us ever anticipated we would be \nthrusting on the small businessmen of this country. In fact, it isn't \neven what we thought we would be thrusting on the workers of this \ncountry. Do you know what is going to happen in a bunch of businesses \nin this country. Instead of asking that employee what could be done, \ninstead of asking him how to solve the problem, they are going to hire \nsomebody who will automate the plant. People will lose their jobs. Yes, \nwe may hire somebody to run the automation, but that is not going to \ntake care of jobs in this country, the jobs of people who work hard \nevery day and know what they are doing and know the simple ways that \nthe process could be improved.\n  I tell you, not one of them is going to read this; not one of them \nneeds to read this. You do not need to read this to solve the problems \nin the workplace. There are none of us who do not want to see the \nergonomics problems reduced and eliminated. I tell you, business has \nbeen doing that. Yes, according to OSHA, over the last 5 years business \nhas reduced the number of ergonomics accidents by 22 percent. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics gives business a lot more credit than OSHA \nfor these numbers.\n  What would improve ergonomics in this country? I tell you, if we had \nthe same number of people working with businesses suggesting things \nthat would help the people in that business, instead of spending their \ntime writing\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nthis kind of stuff, we would have a lot more of the problems solved.\n  I am willing to work on coming up with an ergonomics rule that will \nwork to reduce injuries. I am not interested in seeing an ergonomics \nrule that is for the benefit of the jobs of bureaucrats. That is not \ngoing to help us.\n  I ask you, how in the world is any small business or any businessman, \nfor that matter, supposed to figure out all this stuff? They can't. \nBusinesses simply will not be able to comply with the requirements. But \nOSHA has not heard their stories because it deprived the American \npeople of the opportunity to comment on the requirements.\n  Rest assured, these problems are just the tip of the iceberg. You \nwill be hearing about more flaws from my colleagues in the coming \nhours. But if even one of these issues that I have raised troubles \nyou--and I think they should all trouble you deeply--then you must \nrecognize the desperate need for congressional intervention. That is \nwhy a bipartisan act years ago set up this process, so that Congress \ncould jerk an agency back to reality that has not been paying \nattention. There is a desperate need for congressional intervention.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. Let's show \nthe country that although Congress delegated rulemaking authority to \nOSHA, we have not abdicated our responsibility to the American people. \nI will watch out for the American people. I know my colleagues will, \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my \ncolleague from Wyoming--he chairs the committee with jurisdiction over \nworkplace safety, and I am the ranking minority member--I appreciate \nhim as a Senator. There is a different version of those hearings and a \ndifferent version about what is the right thing for us to do. I would \nlike to speak to that.\n  Each year, there are 1.8 million workers who suffer from ergonomics \ndisorders. Mr. President, 600,000 men and women have injuries so severe \nthey are forced to take off work. Obviously, there is a problem. If it \nis your son or your daughter or your brother or your sister or your \nhusband or your wife, it is very personal to you.\n  I think this is a class issue. I said it yesterday on the floor of \nthe Senate--and I have to say it again--I think precious few Senators \nreally understand what these statistics mean in personal terms because, \nfrankly, we are talking about a part of the population that is not well \nrepresented in the Congress, not well represented in the Senate. We are \ntalking about working-class people. I do not think most Senators have \nloved ones who are doing this work, whether it is blue-collar work or \nwhite-collar work.\n  As I say, 1.8 million workers every year suffer from work-related \nergonomics disorders--many of them women. I must say, I think some of \nthe discussion on the floor trivializes these injuries, trivializes \nthis pain, and trivializes the need for protection for people.\n  I do not know how many times I have heard from my colleagues that, of \ncourse, there should be ergonomics protection, that, of course, we \nshould do something--but it is never this rule; it is never that rule; \nit is never the next rule. Frankly, there are interests that for 10 \nyears have done everything they could to oppose any kind of rule \nproviding people at the workplace with this protection. That is what \nthis resolution is about. That is what this debate is about.\n  Keta Ortiz is a sewing machine operator in New York City. She was 52 \nwhen her whole life came crashing down. She ended up with cramps in her \nhands so severe that when she woke up, they were frozen like claws. She \nhad to soak her hands in hot water just to be able to move her fingers. \nThis went on for 5 years. Terrified of losing her job, she suffered \nagony beyond measure, beyond any measure most Senators know. Finally, \nshe had to give up her job. It took 2 years for her to get her first \nworkers comp check. She lost hers and her family's health insurance, \nand she now tries to get by on $120 a week in workers comp payments.\n  Shirley Mack from Spring Lake, NC, is a single parent with four \nchildren. Let's talk about people. You can put charts up, and you can \nmake fun of rules, and you can trivialize what this is all about, but \nlet's talk about people's lives.\n  Shirley Mack has worked since she was 5 and tried very hard to stay \noff public assistance. Her job was splitting chicken breasts in a \npoultry plant, working 8 or 9 hours a day, 5 days a week. I doubt \nwhether very many Senators have done that. I have not. Maybe some have, \nnot too many, though.\n  I am on safe ground, aren't I, colleagues, in saying that not too \nmany Senators have ever done this kind of work? She says she was one of \nthe faster workers but then her hands started hurting and going numb. \nTo avoid losing her job, she continued working, but then her hand \nstopped working. Her finger locked. Her hand grew numb and cold, and \nher arm stopped working. After a few days in the plant of not being \nable to work, she was fired.\n\n  I quote from her:\n\n       Now I go to bed in pain and I wake up with pain. It hurts \n     to hold my new grandson. I can't fix a big meal like I used \n     to or hang clothes or do yard work at all. I can't go to the \n     grocery store by myself anymore because I can't push the \n     cart. I can only really use my left hand so lots of things \n     like doing my hair and driving take longer and really hurt. . \n     . . I didn't want to go on assistance, but I am now disabled. \n     This carpal tunnel syndrome is very real.\n\n  Some of us are being very generous with the suffering of others. That \nis what this rule was all about--lessening the suffering of a whole lot \nof people in the workforce of the United States of America. Now with \nthis resolution, we are going to wipe out that rule, wipe out that \nprotection.\n  It is interesting: We are in this intense debate--or will be soon--on \nthe education bill regarding accountability for our schools, but when \nit comes to worker safety, all of a sudden accountability and standards \ngo out the window.\n  My colleagues have been holding up the Federal Register. They have \nbeen talking about the rule. The rule is eight pages. The rule is eight \npages. There is background; there is context; there are reasons for \ndoing it. This is the rule, eight pages. This whole book is not the \nrule; it is a lot of good background information on the rule.\n  I will discuss what this rule is about, 8 pages, 10 years in the \nmaking, starting with Elizabeth Dole, and now in 10 hours we are going \nto overturn it. By the way, for all my colleagues who say they are \ncommitted to doing something, they will do something, time is not \nneutral for these workers. These injuries are debilitating. It is a \nlife of hell. It is a life of pain. Now in 10 hours we are going to \noverturn this rule.\n  These standards, eight pages of a rule, represent a sound, \nreasonable, sensible approach. What does the rule basically say? After \n10 years of diligent work, initiated by Elizabeth Dole when she was \nSecretary of Labor, right up to now, what do we have? We have state-of-\nthe-art, flexible, commonsense rules for employers, helping them to \ndeal with this vexing problem of ergonomic disorders.\n  The requirements are not complicated: One, the standard simply calls \nfor employers to provide employees with basic information about \nergonomic disorders so that if you are working and you are experiencing \nthese symptoms, you know what is happening to you before it is too \nlate. Then the employer need not do anything more, that is it, unless a \nworker or an employee reports a disorder or a symptom which is a sign \nof the disorder. The worker says: I can barely move my wrist; my \nfingers are swelling; I am in pain. Then there is a problem.\n  First the employer lets the workers know, gives them information so \npeople can understand what might be happening to them. That is a \nterrible idea?\n  Then if the employee should come to the employer and say, I have a \nproblem, it is up to the employer to determine whether or not what has \nbeen reported is an ergonomic incident. There are clear criteria laid \nout. If that threshold is reached, then the employer is obliged to work \nwith his or her employees to identify and analyze the hazards and \ndevelop a program to deal with those hazards.\n\n  We would think, from hearing some of the Senators on the floor of the \nSenate, that OSHA has done a terrible\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nthing by promulgating a rule, based on 10 years of work, to provide \nsome protection for well over a million and a half workers every year \nwho face these disabling injuries, 600,000 of whom are not even able to \nwork part of the time because of these injuries.\n  Are these rigid, onerous, arbitrary rules? No, they are not. A lot of \nsmart businesspeople are already utilizing these standards. Tom Albin, \nwho is an ergonomist at 3M in St. Paul, MN, had this to say about what \n3M does in my State:\n\n       Our experience has shown that incorporating good ergonomics \n     into our manufacturing and administrative processes can be \n     effective in reducing the number and severity of work-related \n     musculoskeletal disorders, which not only benefits our \n     employee, but also makes good business sense.\n\n  Tom Albin is right; it is good business sense.\n\n       3M's evolving ergonomics process has been effective at \n     reducing the impact of these disorders on our employees and \n     our business. From 1993 to 1997 we have experienced a 50 \n     percent reduction in ergonomics-related OSHA recordables and \n     70 percent reduction in ergonomics-related lost time OSHA \n     recordables.\n\n  In other words, paying attention to ergonomics makes good business \nsense. It is cost effective. Estimates are that the $4.5 billion \nannually it will take to implement these standards will result in $9.1 \nbillion annually of savings which are recouped from the lost \nproductivity, lost tax payments, administrative costs, and workers \ncomp. You do the prevention. We have this rule. You have this standard. \nYou prevent injuries. You have more productivity. Workers are not \nabsent from work, and you have fewer workers comp claims. We have also \nlived to our values: We have provided protection for hard-working \npeople.\n  When my colleagues come to the floor and talk about this standard as \nif it is arbitrary and capricious, they leave out a little bit of the \nhistory of this. The fact is, many companies are saying, yes, we need \nto do this. Good businesspeople are saying, yes, we need to do this. It \nis preventative, and it saves money.\n  The results are not surprising. The National Academy of Sciences and \nthe Institute of Medicine report, which was requested by industry \ngroups and opponents of these standards--I haven't heard any discussion \nabout this--finds scientific support that, one, exposure to ergonomic \nhazards in the workplace causes ergonomic disorders; and, two, these \ninjuries can be prevented.\n  This is the report. If I were to list--and I don't have time because \nother colleagues will speak--the panel composition, it extends from \ninternal medicine to nursing to physiology to biomechanics to human \nfactors engineering, a most distinguished panel of men and women. The \nNational Academy of Sciences found a strong and persistent pattern, \nboth on the basis of epidemiological studies and biomechanical studies, \nthat indeed there was a huge problem in the workplace. Repetitive \nstress injuries are for real. People are disabled.\n  They also found that in fact if we want, we can take action to reduce \nthis pain and agony. We could change the design of tools and work \nstations, rotate jobs, lift tables, have vibration-dampening seating \ndevices. There are a whole set of ergonomic principles which can be \nused to reduce exposure to risk factors and, as a result, mean less \npain for many women and men in the workforce.\n  I have not heard my colleagues talk about this study. I know \nsometimes facts are stubborn things. I know sometimes we don't want to \nknow what we don't want to know. The NAS report goes on to affirm the \nbasic elements of the OSHA standard: management, leadership, employee \nparticipation, job hazard analysis and control, training, and medical \nmanagement. So my second point is that the case for these standards is \nstrong and unassailable.\n\n  My last point has to do with the rush to judgment that we are \nwitnessing today: Ten years of work, countless studies, untold time and \neffort overturned after 10 hours of debate. This resolution of \ndisapproval wasn't sent to committee, and this, despite the fact that \nwe have a new study hundreds of pages long, commissioned by the \nopponents of this rule that supports the essential elements of what \nOSHA ordered. This is the problem my colleagues have. They are doing \nthe bidding of some very greedy folks who say they don't want to have \nto spend any more money.\n  How generous we are with the suffering of others. So we had 10 years \nof study and the opponents wanted the National Academy of Sciences to \ngive us their best judgment. Well, they ended up supporting basically \nthe rules that OSHA ordered, which was what the opponents were opposed \nto. So now Senators don't have the study; they don't have the research; \nthey don't have the evidence. But I will tell you what they do have. \nThis is what they do have. They could come to the floor of the Senate. \nThe administration could do the same thing. The administration could \nstay OSHA's rule. The administration could reopen the rulemaking \nprocess, call for further studies; they could let the court processes \nunwind.\n  Instead, this effort is to kill the rule. This is scorched earth \npolicy to prevent OSHA from ever issuing a rule in ``substantially the \nsame form, unless specifically authorized by a subsequent act of the \nCongress.'' That is what this is all about.\n  Let me be clear about this. My colleagues are not interested in \nmaking any kind of accommodation. That is not what this is about. They \nare not interested in saying, yes, there are some parts in this rule we \ndon't like; let's see if we can fix them. What they want to do is avoid \naccountability for worker safety. That is what this is all about--that \nwe will avoid accountability. That is what is so egregious. That is \nwhat is so egregious about what is happening.\n  I finish this way. This is one interesting and telling week for--\nsometimes you speak on the floor of the Senate and you somehow hope you \nget the attention of people, and you almost hope people listen and you \ncan connect with the people in the country to somehow follow debate, or \nthey hear one thing you say.\n  I certainly wish to say this: For working people, for people who are \nnot the heavy hitters, not the big players, not the investors, don't \nhave all of the economic clout, don't lobby here every day in \nWashington, who are doing the work, who are faced with these kinds of \ninjuries and this kind of pain, these kinds of disabilities, men and \nwomen--but probably the majority are women--this is not a good week for \nthem because this resolution overturns 10 years of hard, diligent work \nto finally write a rule that will give working men and women some \nprotection in the workplace. And then if you can't work because you are \ndisabled by this injury--remember, a lot of people have no other \nchoice. A lot of people work at these jobs because they have no other \nchoice. They don't work at these jobs for the fun of it. We have \noptions. We can go to other work. They don't.\n  And then what we are going to do, starting tomorrow, assuming this \nresolution passes, is we are also going to say to the same people, now \nwe have overturned the rule, now we have moved away from protection--\nalthough Senators are saying, of course, we are concerned. Your concern \ndoesn't mean much because time is not neutral, and for a whole lot of \nfolks the injuries are now.\n\n  I keep hearing we are for another rule, another time, another place; \nbut every time big economic interests say, oh, no, we can't afford it.\n  My colleague from Wyoming, whom I respect, talked about nursing \nhomes. I hope that the choice is not between nursing homes or hospitals \nsaying, look, in order for us to be able to make it economically--I \nagree they have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to \nreimbursement. We have our health care providers saying the only way \nthey can survive economically is for the workforce to work jobs that \nare unsafe and continue to suffer and struggle with disabling injuries. \nThat should not be the tradeoff.\n  Does anybody wonder why we have a 40-percent turnover in nursing \nhomes every year? Part of it is the low wages and part of it is \noutrageous working conditions, taking care of our mothers and fathers \nwho built the country on their backs. One would think we would do well \nfor parents and grandparents and for the human service workers who take \ncare of them. We don't do well for the men and women who take care of \nour parents and our grandparents in nursing homes or in home health \ncare\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nwhen we do not take action to protect them and make sure they are safe.\n  I can only say that the supreme irony of this week is that now that \nwe take away the protection, if you are disabled and you can no longer \nwork, then what we are going to do, starting tomorrow, is pass the \nbankruptcy bill that is going to make it impossible for most people in \nthe country to any longer file chapter 7 and rebuild their lives. \nIncredibly harsh. Great for the credit card companies. It doesn't hold \nthem accountable for their predatory policies, for pumping these credit \ncards on our children and grandchildren. But, boy, when it comes to \nfamilies that find themselves in terrible economic circumstances \nbecause of a major medical bill, or because of the loss of a job, or \nbecause of a divorce, it is going to be practically impossible for \npeople to rebuild their lives.\n  So I say that working families get the shaft on the floor of the \nSenate this week and next week as well. I say that is a shame. But I \nsay that I believe in the intelligence of people, and my guess is that \ncitizens in the country will figure this out and they will have a \npretty good sense of who gets represented well here and who is left \nout.\n  I will finish with this sentence. I think, unfortunately, that even \nthough I don't believe it is intended, because Senators on the other \nside of this debate are good people--we just disagree--I think the \neffect of this resolution overturning 10 years of work, overturning \nthis rule, so important to protecting men and women in the workplace--\nthe effect is to make many working Americans, men and women, \nexpendable. We are making them expendable. We are saying to many \nworking class people in the country that you are expendable Americans. \nI am in profound opposition to that statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nTennessee may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposition \nthat in a democratic republic it is entirely appropriate for elected \nrepresentatives to have some say-so when a bureaucracy produces a rule \nthat so greatly affects people's lives.\n  As we get into our discussion, we can discuss some of these broad, \npowerful, greedy interests that have been referred to, and we can \ndiscuss exactly who is affected by this rule and whether or not all \nthese people fit that definition that our previous speaker has just \ncast on everyone who comes to us with concern about this rule.\n  I rise in support of the resolution of disapproval of OSHA's \nergonomics regulation. I do not make this decision lightly, but this \nregulation is so unworkable, and the process under which it was issued \nso unsound, I believe I have no choice but to support its disapproval.\n  This regulation is a perfect illustration of how political \ngamesmanship can subvert rational policymaking.\n  At the outset, I will address some of the claims made about this \nresolution of disapproval. Some assert that this resolution is an \nattack on worker safety. Some may even claim this resolution will bar \nOSHA from addressing the problem of musculoskeletal disorders. The \ntruth is, none of us oppose worker safety. Many of us have worked on \nthose assembly lines we hear so much about. Some have firsthand \nexperience with such matters.\n  This resolution prevents an irresponsible and unworkable regulation \nfrom taking effect. OSHA will still retain the freedom to address the \nproblem of musculoskeletal disorders, including through the use of its \ngeneral enforcement authority or by reissuing a reasonable regulation. \nJust because something has been worked on for many years does not mean \nthe final product produced at the last minute is a reasonable product. \nPerhaps a lot of good work went into this over the last 10 years, but \nwhat counts, as we have learned in so many other areas, is what \nhappened as it went out the door.\n  There is not enough time to discuss all of the flaws and problems \nwith this regulation. Many of my colleagues have discussed, and \nundoubtedly will discuss, some of these problems. They will show this \nregulation is the product of an unfair, biased process. The rule will \nunfairly burden businesses all across America, especially small \nbusinesses. Beyond the private sector burdens, this regulation will \ncost the U.S. Postal Service over $3.4 billion, plus $1.5 billion \nannually thereafter. My colleagues will also show this regulation is \nincomprehensible. This regulation is unworkable. All of this is cause \nfor concern. I am particularly concerned about the burden this \nregulation imposes on businesses in Tennessee. But I will not rehash \nall of these arguments in the limited time I have today. Instead, I \nwant to focus on how the Clinton ergonomics regulation would harm State \nand local governments and violate principle of federalism.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have the \nresponsibility to oversee Federal-State relations. Over the past \nseveral years, I have struggled with the Clinton administration over \nits federalism policy. This ergonomics regulation is consistent with \ntheir disrespect for the principle of federalism. By many measures, \nthis would be the most burdensome regulation ever imposed by OSHA. It \nwould amount to an enormous unfunded mandate. It would preempt \ntraditional State and local authority. It could seriously impair State \nand local governments across our country, and certainly in Tennessee. \nIt could hit hardest in many small and poor communities where local \ngovernments struggle to meet the needs of their citizens already.\n  Yet until the 11th hour, OSHA neglected to consider how its \nregulation would burden State and local governments and erode their \ntraditional authority. OSHA failed to properly consult concerned local \nrepresentatives or to fully explain the potential effect on State and \nlocal employers.\n  After spending years to study the impact of this mega-regulation, \nOSHA neglected to consider the economic impact of its proposed \nregulation on State and local governments. This is not a small \noversight, to say the least. When OSHA published its proposed \nergonomics standard in November of 1999, OSHA claimed ``few if any of \nthe affected employers are State, local, or tribal governments.'' Then \nOSHA heard the howls of protest and conceded that the regulation \ncertainly was going to impose very large and real burdens on these \ngroups.\n\n  Such small inconvenience did not slow OSHA's rush to ram out this \nregulation in final form in the last days of the Clinton \nadministration. OSHA simply cranked out a perfunctory economic analysis \nlast May and provided State and local governments a grossly inadequate \n30-day period to comment on OSHA's slipshod economic analysis. OSHA \nalso moved its July 7 hearing to consider the economic impact on these \nparties from Washington, DC, to Atlanta, GA, during a time when there \nwas a huge convention in Atlanta and rooms were scarce. Many interested \nparties, including representatives of local government, were not even \nable to attend due to the expense and inconvenience involved.\n  When it issued the final rule, OSHA admitted there would, indeed, be \neconomic burdens for State and local governments--to the tune of about \n$558 million each year. Other estimates are much higher. The Heritage \nFoundation estimated that the cost of the ergonomics proposal on State \nand local government would be about $1.7 billion.\n  When OSHA proposed this regulation, it claimed that the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act did not apply. In the preamble to its final rule, \nOSHA does not deny that the ergonomics regulation would impose an \nenormous unfunded mandate. But it glibly claims that the final rule is \nthe most cost-effective alternative. We have already seen many \ninstances where the Clinton administration thumbed its nose at the \nUnfunded Mandates Act. A GAO report I requested a couple of years ago \nconcluded that the Unfunded Mandates Act has had little effect on \nagency rulemaking. I think this episode cries out for reexamining the \nUnfunded Mandates Act.\n  I am concerned that many governmental entities--towns, water \ndistricts, volunteer fire departments, and so on--will not be able to \nsustain the cost of this unfunded mandate without increasing taxes or \ncutting vital services. Local governments simply do not have adequate \nresources to meet these far-reaching mandates from OSHA. This is true \nboth in Tennessee and across America.\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n  According to the National League of Cities, out of 36,000 cities and \ntowns in America, 91 percent have populations of fewer than 10,000. The \naverage annual budget of these small towns and cities is about $1.6 \nmillion. At the end of the day, there is simply no money for lawyers \nand ergonomics experts.\n  But the story does not end there. This standard preempts an area of \ntraditional State authority. State workers' compensation systems are \nbased on decades of experience and careful deliberation. We talk about \n10 years working on this rule. What about the many more years it has \ntaken to develop State workers' compensation laws that are totally \nabrogated by this rule?\n  In one fell swoop, OSHA would overturn the careful policy choices of \nthe States. This regulation supersedes existing State workers' \ncompensation programs despite the fact that the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act makes clear that OSHA may not supersede or in any way affect \nany workers' compensation law.\n  The rule's work restriction protection provisions, which require \nemployers to pay 90 percent of earnings and 100 percent of benefits to \nemployees unable to work, would effectively create a Federal system of \nworkers' compensation. The rule would also allow employees to bypass \nthe system of medical treatment provided by State law for workers' \ncompensation injuries and seek diagnosis and treatment from any \nlicensed health care provider.\n  Did Congress intend to delegate the authority to the bureaucracy to \nestablish a Federal workers' compensation law in this area and to \npreempt State laws that were formulated over the last decades? I don't \nthink so. By interjecting a special Federal compensation system for \nergonomic injuries into State compensation programs, the work \nrestriction protection provisions would provide preferential treatment \nfor people with musculoskeletal disorders as opposed to every other \njob-related injury or illness.\n  Some local representatives have argued that the work restriction \nprotection provisions could provide an employee who hurts his wrist \nplaying tennis more money in benefits than current benefits provide a \nlaborer who loses his arm.\n  To make matters worse, the work restriction protection provisions \ndouble the opportunity for fraud by failing to provide employers any \nrecourse for recovering workers' compensation payments from employees \nwho have already received their earnings and benefits through the work \nrestriction protection provisions. The double payment would take more \nmoney away from people with real injuries who have legitimate claims.\n  My concerns are shared by many State and local governments that face \nthis unfunded mandate and the erosion of their traditional authority. \nBoth houses of the legislature of my home State of Tennessee are \ncontrolled by the Democratic Party.\n  The Tennessee Legislature passed a resolution calling on Congress \n``to take all necessary measures to prevent the ergonomics regulation \nfrom taking effect.'' They are concerned that the ergonomics rule will \npreempt Tennessee's workers' compensation system, impose drastic \nrequirements on the state government, and cause hardship for many \nTennessee businesses. I agree, and I wish the Clinton Administration \nhad listened to the representatives of the people of Tennessee.\n  The concerns raised by Tennessee are shared by many other state and \nlocal governments. The National League of Cities, the largest and \noldest organization representing the nation's cities and towns, has \nopposed the regulation from the beginning. The Western Governors' \nAssociation passed a resolution detailing how the regulation would \nsupersede the entire complex of state workers' compensation provisions \nand conflict with state laws.\n  Mr. President, a couple of years ago, I fought the Clinton \nAdministration's attempt to repeal President Reagan's Executive Order \non Federalism and to replace it with a new Order that would have \ncreated new excuses for federal meddling in state and local affairs. \nIronically, the Clinton Administration tried to issue this executive \norder, which called for more consultation with state and local \ngovernment, without consulting with state and local governments at all. \nA firestorm of protest from state and local officials led the White \nHouse to adopt a new federalism order that mimicked the Reagan Order. \nThe Clinton Administration promised to consult more with state and \nlocal officials. But a year later, on the most burdensome regulation \never proposed by OSHA, the Clinton Administration did not address the \nproblems raised by state and local officials, did not seriously \nconsider the enormous impact of this unfunded mandate, and did not \ntrouble itself with the rule's disruption of complex areas \ntraditionally regulated by the states.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution of the Tennessee \nlegislature, a letter from Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist, and the \nletters from Mayor Victor Ashe of Knoxville and Mayor Charles Farmer of \nJackson, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Senate Joint Resolution 610\n\n       Whereas, Tennessee has enacted a comprehensive workers' \n     compensation system with incentives to employers to maintain \n     a safe workplace, to work with employees to prevent workplace \n     injuries, and to compensate employees for injuries that \n     occur; and\n       Whereas, Section 4(b)(4) of the federal Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 653(b)(4), provides that \n     ``Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or \n     in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to \n     enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common \n     law or statutory rights, duties or liabilities of employers \n     and employees under any law with respect to injuries, \n     diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the \n     course of, employment.''; and\n       Whereas, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (``OSHA''), notwithstanding this statutory restriction and \n     the constitutional, traditional and historical role of the \n     states in providing compensation for injuries in the \n     workplace, has nevertheless published a proposed rule that, \n     if adopted, would substantially displace the role of the \n     states in compensating workers for musculoskeletal injuries \n     in the workplace and would impose far-reaching requirements \n     for implementation of ergonomics programs; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule creates in effect a special \n     class of workers compensation benefits for ergonomic \n     injuries, requiring payment of up to six months of wages at \n     ninety percent (90%) of take-home pay and one hundred percent \n     (100%) of benefits for absence from work; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule would allow employees to bypass \n     the system of medical treatment provided by Tennessee law for \n     workers' compensation injuries and to seek diagnosis and \n     treatment from any licensed health care provider paid by the \n     employer; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule would require employers to treat \n     ergonomic cases as both workers' compensation cases and OSHA \n     cases and to pay for medical treatment under both; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule could force all manufacturers to \n     alter workstations, redesign facilities or change tools and \n     equipment, all triggered by the report of a single injury; \n     and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule would require all American \n     businesses to become full-time experts in ergonomics, a field \n     for which there is little if any credible evidence and as to \n     which there is an ongoing scientific debate; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule would cause hardship on \n     businesses and manufacturers with costs of compliance as high \n     as eighteen billion dollars ($18,000,000,000) annually, \n     without guaranteeing the prevention of a single injury; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule may force businesses to make \n     changes that would impair efficiency in distribution centers; \n     and\n       Whereas, this proposed rule is premature until the science \n     exists to understand the root cause of musculoskeletal \n     disorders, OSHA should not rush to make rules that are likely \n     to result in a loss of jobs without consensus in the \n     scientific and medical communities as to what causes \n     repetitive-stress injuries, and medical researchers must \n     answer fundamental questions surrounding ergonomics before \n     government regulators impose a one-size-fits-all solution; \n     now, therefore,\n       Be it Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred First \n     General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to take all necessary \n     measures to prevent the proposed ergonomics rule from taking \n     effect.\n       Be it further Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this \n     resolution be transmitted to the Speaker and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives; the President and the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate; and to each member of \n     the Tennessee Congressional delegation.\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           State of Tennessee,\n\n                                     Nashville, TN, March 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: I'd like to offer you my support for \n     Senate Joint Resolution 6, which disapproves the ergonomics \n     rule submitted by the Department of Labor.\n       I oppose unfunded federal mandates and believe in each \n     state's right to set workplace laws. The Ergo Rule is too \n     complex, too unworkable and would be far too costly for state \n     and local governments at a time when most state and local \n     governments are working to cut costs in an effort to continue \n     to provide quality, effective services without overburdening \n     taxpayers.\n       In addition, the ergonomics legislation would negatively \n     impact hundreds of Tennessee businesses. For these reasons, I \n     join you and the Tennessee Association of Business, the \n     Tennessee Apparel Corporation, the Tennessee Grocers \n     Association, the Tennessee Automotive Association, the \n     Tennessee Malt Beverage Association, the Tennessee Health \n     Care Association and Chattanooga Bakery Inc. in support of \n     Senate Joint Resolution 6.\n       If I can be of further assistance on this or other matters \n     please don't hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Sundquist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        The City of Knoxville,\n\n                                     Knoxville, TN, March 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fred: I am writing to advise you that I fully support \n     S.J.R. 6.\n       This regulation regarding ergonomics is ill advised and \n     will adversely impact local governments. It will, in fact, \n     impose another unfunded mandate on local governments that \n     would prove to be extremely costly for our taxpayers. It \n     would eventually result in reduced services and/or a property \n     tax increase.\n       This regulation is complex and unworkable. It is unclear \n     how state and local governments will be affected. In \n     addition, there can be no alternative position established \n     for personnel such as firefighters and police officers.\n       I am hopeful your efforts to stop this regulation from \n     taking effect will meet with success.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Victor Ashe,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              City of Jackson,\n\n                                       Jackson, TN, March 5, 2001.\n     Re S.J. Resolution 6.\n\n     Senator Fred Thompson,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: I urge you to support S.J. \n     Resolution 6 which allows for disapproval of the rule \n     submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ergonomics \n     regulation for the following reasons:\n       Tennessee has already enacted a comprehensive and effective \n     workers' compensation system that encourages employers to \n     provide a safe working environment and to compensate \n     employees for injuries that occur.\n       The proposed rule would displace the role of states in \n     compensating workers for musculoskeletal injuries in the \n     workplace.\n       It would require employers to compensate workers for \n     medical treatment under both the existing workers' \n     compensation rules and OSHA rules.\n       The rule would force manufacturers to unnecessarily alter \n     workstations and redesign facilities, which could cause undue \n     financial hardships on businesses without guaranteeing the \n     prevention of a single injury.\n       In some work environments such as fire fighting and police \n     activity it would be impossible to alter the components of \n     their job and remain effective.\n       It is unclear how state and local government employees will \n     be affected by the rule.\n       OSHA did not conduct a cost-benefit analysis revealing the \n     fiscal impact of the rule.\n       The rule is an unfunded mandate thereby placing the burden \n     of funding on states and cities.\n       In short the rule is costly and unworkable.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please advise \n     as to how I can provide further assistance of information.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                Charles H.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nrecognizing Senator Thompson be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate on the matter \nbefore us that has been the subject of the debate all morning--the \nresolution which would vitiate OSHA regulations on ergonomics. \nErgonomics is a dreadful name. I am trying to find a good definition \nfor it. It is probably causing some people to wonder what this debate \nis all about.\n  I am told that ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the \nworker and ergonomic injuries are repetitive stress injuries.\n  There have been some rather startling statistics regarding these \nstress-related injuries over the last number of years. The National \nAcademy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine report of January, \n2001, reported that in 1999, nearly 1 million people took time from \nwork to treat or recover from work-related ergonomic injuries. The cost \nof these injuries is enormous--about $50 billion annually. Many of the \npeople with ergonomic injuries we are familiar with, such as meat-\npacking workers and poultry workers, assembly line workers, computer \nusers, stock handlers and canners, sewing machine operators, and \nconstruction workers. While women make up 46 percent of the overall \nworkforce, they account for over 64 percent of these repetitive motion \ninjuries.\n  More statistics may be somewhat helpful here. According to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, 1.8 million ergonomic injuries are reported each \nand every year, and have been for well over the last decade as our \neconomy produced more jobs of the kind I just described. Six hundred \nthousand people have lost work time as a result of these injuries. \nErgonomic injuries cost businesses $50 billion a year. Finally, women, \nwho make up 46 percent of the workforce, account for a majority of \nthese injuries that are occurring in the workplace. These injuries are \ndebilitating. They are painful and the economic hardship caused by them \nis significant.\n  I can tell you firsthand about a woman who spent 30 years working in \nthe Senate, and worked with me for almost the last 20 years. She \ndeveloped carpal tunnel syndrome, a very painful injury. She was a \nvalued worker in my office and showed up for work every day. I do not \nrecall her ever being absent during the 20 years she spent with me. \nWhen she developed carpal tunnel syndrome, she was unable to perform \nher regular duties. But we found other work in the office for her to do \nuntil she was able to recover. She continued working in my office until \nshe retired.\n  I mention these statistics and numbers because I find it rather \nappalling that we are now in the business, if this resolution is \nadopted, of abolishing the rules that provide help for 1.8 million \npeople a year who are injured by repetitive stress injuries. It is the \nkind of protection workers ought to be getting under OSHA. I don't know \nof another time in the 20th century when we rolled back the clock on \nprotecting workers in this country from work-related injuries.\n  I know there were times when people fought the initial legislation \nthat provided protection. But I don't know if there was ever a time \nsince this Nation first decided it was in the national interest to \nprovide protection for people, that we have rolled back the standards \nin 10 hours of debate--10 hours. That is it, 10 hours of debate, after \n10 years of crafting these rules to provide these protections.\n  Let me tell you what is the greatest irony of all. Who started this \ndebate? Who proposed that we do something about this? It was the \nSecretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, who first brought up the issue that \nwe ought to do something about protecting people from these kinds of \ninjuries.\n  In fact, it was in August of 1990, in response to evidence that \nrepetitive stress injuries were the fastest growing occupation \nillnesses in the country, that Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole \nannounced the beginning of rulemaking on the ergonomics standards. Two \nyears later, in 1992, her successor, Lynn Martin, under yet another \nRepublican Administration, issued an advanced notice of proposed \nrulemaking\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\non these repetitive stress injuries. And not until substantial \nscientific study had been conducted did the Clinton administration \nrelease a draft of proposed standards in February of 1999.\n  However, before issuing the final rule, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration extended the comment period, at the request of \nsome of my colleagues and others, and held 9 weeks of public hearings. \nThey heard from 1,000 witnesses and reviewed 7,000 written comments. \nThe final standards were issued in November of 2000 and they went into \neffect on January 16, 2001.\n  So after 10 years of work by good people who did not bring any \nideological bent to this at all--at the suggestion of two Republican \nSecretaries of Labor--today, in 10 hours of debate, we are going to \nwipe all of this out.\n  I am not going to stand here and suggest to you that every dotted \n``i'' and crossed ``t'' in these regulations is perfect or right. I do \nnot claim that level of expertise to know whether or not that is the \ncase. But if it is not perfect, then let's fix it. Do not wipe all of \nthis out--not after 10 years of work. It would take an act of Congress, \nadopted by both Houses and signed by the President, in order for the \nAdministration to put some regulations back into effect to protect \npeople.\n  What are these regulations? I think it is also very revealing what \nthese standards are. The standards require that all covered employers \nprovide their employees with basic information about signs and symptoms \nof these repetitive stress injuries or ergonomics injuries, the \nimportance of reporting these injuries, risk factors associated with \nergonomic hazards, and a brief description of the ergonomics standard. \nThe employer has no further responsibilities under the rule unless an \nemployee reports an ergonomic injury or signs of symptoms of an \nergonomic injury that lasts for 7 days after being reported.\n  Then, if the employer determines, and I never heard of a rule set up \nlike this--if the employer determines that the ergonomic injury is \nwork-related, and that the injured employee is exposed to serious \nhazards, the employer must craft an appropriate remedy. Not some \nneutral board, the employer makes the determination.\n  To call this excessive stretches the imagination and credulity. These \nare not onerous standards. And if we want to fix some of them, then \nlet's try to do that. But to eliminate it altogether, --in 10 hours of \ndebate or less--after all of this work, I find terribly disappointing, \nto put it mildly.\n  We are only a few weeks into this new administration. There are ways \nin which you address problems. This is not a proper way to do so. There \nare 100 of us in this Chamber who care about these issues and who can \nwork on them. But to bring up a resolution like this and try to jam it \nthrough, and eliminate all this work, I think, is a great step \nbackwards. I am terribly disappointed that the leadership of this body \nhas decided to choose this route as a way of dealing with this issue.\n  There is more misinformation being heard about this particular issue \nthan anything else I can think of.\n  As I said, these injuries are debilitating. They are painful. People \nare losing work and time. Are we just going to wipe out all of these \nstandards, after 10 years of research, sound science and an \nunprecedented amount of time for public comment?\n  Employees have a right to expect a safe workplace. We fought long and \nhard in this country to provide these rights for people. And all along \nthe way, there were those who objected--whether it was child labor laws \nor safety and health standards, work conditions, or hours. \nUnfortunately, at every critical moment in history there have been \nthose who stood up and said: We can't afford to do this; that it is an \nonerous burden on the employers of this country to have to provide a \nsafe workplace. People ought to be grateful they have a job and not \ncomplain about the conditions under which they work or the injuries \nthey may incur at the workplace. At every moment in history, when \npeople have stood in this Chamber and elsewhere and fought on behalf of \nworking people, there have been people who have stood up and said: We \ncan't afford to do it. It is too complicated. And we are not going to \ndo it.\n  Those who are offering this resolution may succeed today, but the \nAmerican people will not forget it. And the 1.8 million people this \nyear--65 percent of them women--who are going to suffer, with no \nrecourse, will not forget it, either.\n  There is a process by which you can fix this law, if you want to. A \n10-hour debate on an unamendable resolution, after 10 years of work, is \nnot the way to go. It is not the way to go.\n  I urge the authors of this resolution to withdraw it before the vote \noccurs this afternoon and allow this Chamber and the Members to work on \nthis with the administration, and not reach some fait accompli that \nwipes out 10 years of work by intelligent, smart people who knew what \nthey were talking about. I would hope the leadership would see fit to \ndo so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the passion of my colleague \nfrom Connecticut. I have the utmost respect and admiration for him. I \nknow how strongly he feels about this. I know in his comments he was \nnot in any way insinuating those of us who take a different position \nthan he on this would not be concerned about workers, that we would not \nbe concerned about health and safety in the workplace because I want to \nassure him that this Senator from Arkansas, who supports the resolution \nof disapproval, feels very strongly, as I know the Presiding Officer, \nwho has worked long and hard on this issue, does, that the ergonomics \nissue needs to be dealt with but needs to be dealt with properly.\n  Frankly, you may have 7,000 comments, but if they are ignored, and \nthe rule is changed, then that process is flawed. Frankly, to question \nthe process we are now going through is to question the lawmaking \nauthority and the right of the Congress.\n  What has brought us to this point? It is the fact that there are \nagencies out there that have sought to do what we are constitutionally \nauthorized to do; that is, to make the laws and the policies for this \ncountry.\n  I want to take just a moment to commend the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Enzi, who made an eloquent and very accurate and detailed \nspeech earlier today. But, more than that, I thank him for the hearings \nhe has conducted and the information he has brought forward and \nelicited about how this process went forward, about witnesses who were \npaid, instructed, coached, practiced, to arrive at a preordained \noutcome. I thank Senator Enzi for the role he played as part of this \nprocess to which Senator Dodd was referring. Unfortunately, after \nhearing after hearing that was conducted, the outcome and the evidence \nthat was elicited was ignored by OSHA.\n  I commend Senator Nickles for his foresight years ago in sponsoring \nthe Congressional Review Act. With the CRA, we have a means by which we \ncan address an agency that goes amok and passes a rule that is not in \nthe interest of the American people.\n  I see Senator Bond, who has walked on the floor. He has worked long \nand hard and felt strongly about this issue and has played an important \nrole in bringing us to this day and allowing Congress the opportunity \nto assert its rightful role once again. Senator Thompson, who spoke \nearlier, has played an important role as well.\n\n  For the first time ever, the Senate will today utilize the CRA to \nvitiate and overturn an agency rule--that is, a several-hundred-page \nOSHA rule--that imposes the largest and most costly regulatory mandate \nin American history on the workplace. It is appropriate that this would \nbe the first use for the CRA.\n  My colleague from Connecticut said that under the rule the employer \nmakes the determination. Therefore, that is a good thing. That is one \nof the problems. Under the OSHA rule, the employer is going to be asked \nto determine health conditions, to determine whether or not the health \ncondition of his employee was caused by a workplace condition or \nsomething that happened outside the workplace. The employer is going to \nbe asked to have the wisdom of Solomon in making those\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nkinds of determinations. That does not make this rule better. It is a \nbig flaw in the rule.\n  My colleague also said that it is not onerous. I will let the \nAmerican people make the judgment of whether it is onerous or not. This \nis the rule. It has been said that it is only 8 pages out of what I am \nholding, but no one has suggested that the American businessperson will \nnot have to read and be familiar with every item in this 608-page rule.\n  These are the supplementary materials that the businessman himself \nmust buy. This is seven out of the eight. We could not get the eighth. \nThe cost for these items will run $221--money the employer must pay \njust to find out with what he has to comply. I will let the American \npeople and my colleagues determine whether that is an onerous burden. I \nbelieve it is.\n  For more than two centuries, the three branches of our Federal \nGovernment have respected the checks and balances. This is not just a \nconcept taught casually during our high school civics course. It is the \nmeans by which our American system of government has endured. The \nexecutive rulemaking process should be treated with respect. Without \nit, the laws we pass cannot be administered nor enforced.\n\n  However, the rulemaking process must also have checks. There must be \na means by which a rulemaking body that goes too far and exceeds their \nstatutory authority can be reined in by the elected representatives of \nthe people. This process is what we are involved in today.\n  How did we arrive at this point? How did we end up with a rule that \nis 608 pages long, incomprehensible to the average businessman, and \nwhere the businessman has to pay $221 to get the supplementary \nmaterials to find out with what he has to comply?\n  I suggest it starts with this mentality. This is a statement made in \nan interview by Martha Kent, former director of OSHA's safety standards \nprogram, a May of 2000 interview by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation trade journal. This is what she said:\n\n       I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I don't know \n     why, but that's very true. So as long as I'm regulating, I'm \n     happy . . . . I think that's really where the thrill comes \n     in. And it is a thrill; it's a high.\n\n  It may be a high for the regulator. It may be a thrill for the rule \nwriter, but it is no thrill for the small businessman with 20 employees \nor 30 employees or 200 employees who has to try to decipher what that \nthrill-loving rule writer meant.\n  That is how we have come to this point. In 1996, Congress and the \nPresident believed it was important enough to preserve this balance by \nenacting the Congressional Review Act. I am glad we have that tool \ntoday. We are having this debate to guarantee that rogue rulemakings do \nnot become governing law.\n\n  There is not one Member of this distinguished body who does not \nadvocate the safety and well-being of our workforce. Let me be clear. \nIf this rule was about employee safety and health, we wouldn't be \nhaving this debate today. Unfortunately, this standard was not meant to \nimprove working conditions but rather to place a $63 billion or a $100 \nbillion--depending upon whose studies you look at; the Small Business \nAdministration says it is up to $63 billion--annual mandate on \nemployers and, in so doing, circumvent State jurisdiction and require \nsmall employers to fulfill and to fully understand vague scientific \nsolutions to extremely complex medical conditions.\n  To all of those today who stand on the floor and champion workers' \nrights, this rule will result without doubt in sending jobs overseas \nwhere there are often no worker protections at all. There are going to \nbe jobs cut. There are going to be companies closed. There are going to \nbe jobs exported overseas. Americans will stand to lose those jobs, and \noverseas there are going to be workers with far fewer worker \nprotections who will inherit those jobs. That is why this debate is \noccurring and why our vote on this resolution is so imperative.\n  Recall that on Friday, November 19, 1999, Congress adjourned for the \nyear having completed its work for the first session of the 106th \nCongress. After we left town, OSHA announced the following Monday its \nnew ergonomics proposal. OSHA knew then that the clock had started \nticking to complete action within the next 13 months. OSHA, however, \ndecided it was in our best interest to shotgun the proposal through its \nhoops in 1 year's time, refusing to wait for the completion of the \n$890,000 NAS study which since then has been completed.\n  The Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, after \nweeks of evaluating the impact that this proposal would have if \nactually enforced, held the first Senate hearing examining just one of \nmany portions of OSHA's proposal, the work restriction protections. The \nWRP provisions would require employers to provide temporary work \nrestrictions, up to and including complete removal from work, based \neither upon their own judgment or on the recommendation of a health \ncare provider.\n  If the employer places work restrictions upon an employee which would \nallow them to continue to perform some work activities, the employer \nmust provide 100 percent of the employee's earnings and 100 percent of \nwork benefits for up to 90 days. If the employee is completely removed \nfrom work, the employer must provide 90 percent of the employee's \nearnings and 100 percent of benefits for up to 90 days. That is not a \nbad deal, much better than one would find under most State workers \ncompensation programs.\n  This certainly raises the question as to what the motive was for \nhaving WRP in the rule. Why didn't OSHA simply allow States to continue \nadministering this provision? How does OSHA help the employer determine \nif the employee's injury occurred from work-related activities versus a \ndisorder acquired from home? The fact is, the rule does not explain it, \nand OSHA never intended to answer these questions.\n  Suppose there is an employee whose job involves operating a keyboard. \nLet's suppose that in the course of time there is a repetitive motion \naffliction. Let's suppose that in fact there is an ergonomic result \nphysically for that worker. The complaint is made. It is discovered \nthat the worker usually, and on an ongoing basis, is on the Internet 2 \nor 3 hours a night after leaving the workplace. How is that employer to \ndetermine what is in fact the cause of that disorder? Under the OSHA \nrule, it doesn't really matter. If the workplace contributed even in \nthe slightest to the disorder, they then would be eligible for the \nremedies under the OSHA rule.\n\n  I could go on. The employee complains about a back strain. Is the \nback strain the result of sudden lifting of furniture at home, or is it \nthe result of some activity in the workplace? Under the OSHA rule, it \nis the employer who is liable to make those kinds of determinations and \nto provide relief.\n  In terms of State jurisdiction, the hearing that the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Enzi, conducted revealed that the WRP provision is a \ndirect violation of section 4(b)(4) of the 1970 OSHA act. Let me read \nthis. Senator Enzi went through some of this previously. Let me read it \nbecause it is so very clear.\n\n       Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or \n     in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to \n     enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common \n     law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers \n     and employees under any law with respect to injuries, \n     diseases or death of employees arising out of, or in the \n     course of, employment.\n\n  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or affect \nworkers compensation laws. I am like you, Senator Enzi. What part of \nthat do we not understand? This is the very act that established OSHA. \nThey now, in clear defiance of the statute authorizing their very \nexistence, have promulgated a rule and finalized a rule that violates \ntheir charter. They were explicitly told at the time the agency was \nestablished: You will not tamper with State workers compensation laws. \nThat is the State domain.\n  I hope all my colleagues, whatever your feeling about how we should \naddress ergonomics, will examine this single issue: Is it the right of \nany Federal agency to establish a national workers compensation law? Is \nthat the domain of a Federal regulatory agency?\n  I suggest that on both sides of the aisle the answer is no. If we are \ngoing to have a national workers compensation system, managed and \nadministered by the Department of Labor, then\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nit should go through this Chamber. It should be written and authorized \nby the Congress and signed into law by the President. It should not be \ndone in a rogue rulemaking process.\n  I believe we not only have seen an infringement in OSHA upon the \nrightful constitutional lawmaking authority of Congress; we have also \nseen a trampling of State jurisdiction in the area of workers \ncompensation laws. We specifically withheld from OSHA the authority to \nsupersede or affect State workers compensation laws. Congress did this \nbecause State workers compensation systems are founded upon the \nprinciple that employers and employees have both entered into an \nagreement to give up certain rights in exchange for certain benefits in \nthe area of work-related injuries and illnesses. Most often, employers \ngive up most of their legal defenses against liability for the \nemployees' injuries, and the employees give up their right to seek \npunitive and other types of damages in turn. The crucial factor that \nmakes State workers compensation systems possible is that the remedies \nit provides to employees are the exclusive remedies available to them \nagainst their employers for work-related injuries and illnesses. That \nwon't be the case come October 15, 2001, when employers must be in \ncompliance with OSHA's rule, unless we act today.\n  If you can receive 90 percent of compensation under OSHA's ergonomics \nrule, it will absolutely undermine, pull the rug out from under, State \nworkers compensation laws. It will destroy the trust and faith that has \nbeen developed at the State level. WRP provisions are in direct \ncontradiction to section 4(b)(4) and will shake the foundation upon \nwhich State workers compensation systems rest because they will provide \na conflicting remedy for employees with work-related injuries and \nillnesses.\n  Since WRP provisions will unquestionably differ from the current \nState compensation systems, there will also be confusion as to who is \nliable. As far as OSHA is concerned, that case is closed--the employer \nis guilty, no questions necessary.\n  This is precisely why Congress put section 4(b)(4) in the act 31 \nyears ago. But to be sure that this is what Congress had in mind, I dug \ndeeper and found the conference report filed December 16, 1970. As it \npertains to section 4(b)(4), it reads:\n\n       The bill does not affect any Federal or State workmen's \n     compensation laws, or the rights, duties, or liabilities of \n     employers and employees under them.\n\n  If the statutory language isn't clear enough, the conference report \nought to make it even more abundantly clear what the intent of Congress \nwas. All of this came out in the hearings so well conducted by Senator \nEnzi. There was no answer from OSHA. There was no explanation as to how \nthey were not tampering with State workers compensation laws.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, the law was clear, the report language is \nclear; how can this be misconstrued by OSHA? They are violating the \nvery law that established and authorized their agency.\n  Another factor that was overlooked, I believe, was the proposal's \nprice tag. There have been a whole slew of numbers tossed around, so I \nwill use what I believe to be the most reliable and conservative \nfigure--one put forth by the Clinton administration itself. According \nto their Small Business Administration, OSHA has grossly underestimated \nthe cost impact of its proposal.\n  The SBA ordered an ``Analysis of OSHA's Data Underlying the \nErgonomics Standard and Possible Alternatives Discussed by the SBREFA \nPanel.''\n  Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, Inc.--PPE--prepared the analysis \nand it was issued on September 22, 1999. PPE reported:\n\n       OSHA's estimates of the costs in its Preliminary Initial \n     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the draft proposed \n     ergonomics standard, as furnished to the SBREFA Panel, may be \n     significantly understated, and that OSHA's estimates of \n     benefits of the proposed standard may be significantly \n     overstated.\n\n  That is from the Clinton administration's Small Business \nAdministration. PPE further reported:\n\n       OSHA's estimates of capital expenditures on equipment to \n     prevent MSDs do not account for varying establishment sizes, \n     and seem quite low even for the smallest establishment size \n     category.\n\n  PPE attributed the overstatement of benefits that the rule will \nprovide ``to the fact that OSHA has not accounted for a potentially \ndramatic increase in the number of MSDs resulting in days away from \nwork as workers take advantage of the WRP provisions.''\n  OSHA estimated the proposal's cost to be $4.2 billion annually. That \nis almost laughable. PPE estimates that the costs of the proposed \nstandard could be anywhere from 2.5 to 15 times higher than OSHA's \nestimate--or $10.5 billion to $63 billion a year higher.\n  Business groups have done their own analysis and they put the number \nmuch higher yet, at over $100 billion per year.\n  Finally, the PPE report shows that the cost-to-benefit ratio of this \nrule may be as much as 10 times higher for small businesses than for \nlarge businesses.\n  It is not the large corporations that are going to be most impacted \nby this rule. My great concern is not so much for the large \ncorporations, which will be able to handle this in one way or another--\nthough it will certainly negatively impact our economy--my great \nconcerns are for the small businesses of this country.\n  AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said recently:\n\n       We will let our voices be heard loud and clear to let the \n     Bush administration, the Congress, and big business know that \n     working families will not be outmaneuvered by this political \n     power play.\n\n  I suggest it is not big business that I have heard most from; it is \nsmall businesses all across the State of Arkansas with anywhere from 20 \nemployees to 200 employees. The rule is a concern for working families. \nI am concerned about the working families whose primary breadwinner \nwill lose their job or see that job exported overseas.\n\n  ``Will not be outmaneuvered by this political power play''--one can \njudge where the political power play is; I suggest it was at OSHA--from \nan open debate before the American people on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is small business that will be most impacted.\n  According to the National Coalition of Ergonomics, an alliance of \nmore than 50 trade organizations that are opposed to the OSHA rule, the \nnew regulation will cost $6 billion annually in the trucking industry, \n$26 billion in the food industry, and $20,000 at every convenience \nstore across the country. According to the OSHA standard, the employees \nwho suffer ergonomic injuries, also known as MSDs, could get more \ncompensation than workers injured in other ways.\n  Let me mention one small businessman, Jim Zawaclo, president and \nowner of GR Spring and Stamping, Inc., an auto supplier in Grand \nRapids, MI, with about 200 employees. He estimates his company will \nspend as much as $10,000 between now and October in an effort to comply \nwith the law.\n  Let me get a little closer to home for me, Mansfield, AR. Complete \nPallet, Inc., a small company in Mansfield, which is a very small \ncommunity, recently wrote:\n\n       As a small business owner, I am alarmed at the implications \n     that the OSHA Ergonomics rule will have on my business and \n     Arkansas' economy in general.\n       It is my understanding that this ruling will force \n     ``ergonomic'' structuring of our small workforce and several \n     ``new'' forms to provide OSHA. I am not sure if you realize \n     the impact this will have on the small business person, so I \n     have taken the liberty of breaking down the cost figures for \n     you:\n       Paperwork/Secretarial $1,440.00, Yard rearrangement \n     ``ergonomic'' $150,000--For a total of $151,440.00 first year \n     loss experience. That first year out-of-pocket expense would \n     force me to close my doors. In turn closing my small plant \n     down would put twenty (20) people in the unemployment line \n     here in our great State of Arkansas.\n       I would greatly appreciate your vote ``YES'' on rejecting \n     OSHA's New Ergonomic rule.\n\n  That is one example, 20 employees, 20 lost jobs, another small \nemployer that bites the dust because of the regulatory burden imposed.\n  So we are talking $63 billion a year. Who covers that cost? OSHA has \na simple answer, as we heard in the hearings: Pass it on to the \nconsumer.\n  Senator Enzi has pointed this out as clearly as anybody, but I will \nreiterate it. You cannot always pass on the cost to the consumer. The \nclearest example of that is Medicare and Medicare-reimbursed \nbusinesses. The reimbursement is, as we know, capped by Federal law. \nThere is nobody to whom to pass the\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\ncost. Perhaps we should remember this when the Senate next considers \nyet another round of Medicare give-backs.\n  This ergonomics rule will only heighten the need for such relief and \njeopardize the already critical lack of health care in rural States \nsuch as Arkansas or Wyoming. I listened to proponents of this \nergonomics rule make the case, if we vitiate under the Congressional \nReview Act, thousands of additional employees will suffer.\n  Let's be clear, with or without the rule, OSHA can enforce current \nlaw. It states this in the ergonomics proposal on page 68267. Under \nsection 5(a)(1) of the 1970 OSH Act, commonly referred to as the \nGeneral Duty Clause, OSHA can enforce ergonomic violations, and \naccording to the proposal, ``OSHA has successfully issued over 550 \nergonomics citations under the General Duty Clause.'' It even lists a \nnumber of employers by name where they successfully enforced ergonomics \nviolations under the general duty clause.\n  So the vitiating of this rule does not somehow leave the American \nworker unprotected--far from it. I point out, without the rule, in \nrecent years we have seen a steep decline in injuries--even without the \nnew rule. These facts are available, though oftentimes I am afraid \npeople would rather ignore them. Since 1992, ergonomic injuries have \ndropped from 3 million a year to 2 million a year, and those are OSHA's \nown numbers.\n  Lost workdays have also decreased. This chart shows they have \ndecreased: 750,000 missed in 1992; about 500,000 will be lost this \nyear. That is progress. It is progress without a burdensome, expensive \nrule from OSHA.\n  Business has done a lot on their own. It is in the interest of the \nemployer to deal with ergonomics problems in the workplace. Even OSHA \nhas figures that 95 percent of employers are doing the right thing. The \nbad actors constitute only about 5 percent of the employers. Would it \nnot be far better to focus our attention upon the 5 percent of the bad \nactors as opposed to an across-the-board rule that would penalize all \nemployers and our economy as a whole?\n  There was an article in the Detroit News about a cashier whose hands \nrhythmically shuffle back and forth scans about 22 items per minute at \nthe supermarket where she has worked for 15 years. Many businesses--I \nwill not mention this particular supermarket chain--many businesses \nrecognized years ago that workers such as she were at risk for \nrepetitive stress injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and began \nreconfiguring healthy work environments.\n\n       Across America, stores added better scanners to prevent the \n     need to twist and double scan items. In offices, businesses \n     added wrist pads at computer keyboards and glare screens on \n     monitors. In warehouses, companies moved from hauling \n     equipment that needed to be pulled, and resulted in \n     back sprains, to automatic devices to push around heavy \n     skids of cargo.\n\n  I have many examples to give about major companies and what they have \ndone. I could talk at length about Wal-Mart and what they have done as \nwell as other Arkansas companies that have been proactive, without this \nvery intrusive and burdensome rule from OSHA.\n  The rule is replete with vague and subjective requirements where \nemployers must have an ergonomics plan in place to deal with such \nhazards. OSHA said it is being flexible by allowing employers to design \na plan that caters to their own workplace, but that same \n``flexibility'' also requires the employer to be an expert on ergonomic \ninjuries, an understanding that many physicians admit isn't an exact \nscience at all.\n  I share another true horror story from the State of Florida.\n\n       I am the V.P., Human Resources, for a company which has a \n     manufacturing plant as a subsidiary. Last year, one of our \n     employees developed a CTS problem with her wrists, allegedly \n     due to her job as a sawyer. We had her go through an \n     extensive evaluation process, and then did surgeries on each \n     wrist although we had conflicting medical data on the need, \n     and also went through a prolonged rehab process. We did \n     transfer her out of the saw department and gave her an \n     administrative job creating files, and delivering and picking \n     up the files within an office area. A physical therapist \n     consultant reviewed this job to insure no further risk of \n     injury before she was assigned to it. She is not allowed to \n     carry a load over 5 pounds based on her physician's advice \n     and she does follow that advice at work. About a week ago, \n     she reported that her elbows were very painful due to her \n     work situation. While she was discussing this with our \n     worker's comp HR person, one of her co-workers came by. He \n     said he had seen her on the weekend working at her mother's \n     vegetable stand unloading large boxes of produce and \n     complimented her on how hard she was working. We have since \n     determined that she works at least 8 hours a weekend, most \n     weekends, doing the hard labor at the stand. When asked about \n     this, she said it was none of our business what she did on \n     the weekend and that it had nothing to do with her elbows \n     hurting. We are still trying to get this one off our worker's \n     comp side and over to the medical plan where it belongs.\n\n  Whether that happens frequently or is a very rare occurrence, be \nassured it will happen more frequently under a national workers \ncompensation plan operated under the Department of Labor.\n  Finally, I want to discuss the vote we will take in a few hours and \nwhat it actually means. It would vitiate the effective rule, the \nunderlying premise of the CRA; it would prohibit OSHA from promulgating \nanother rule substantially similar to the effective rule so they could \nnot turn around and put us through this process again. It is what \nshould occur under the aforementioned flaws of the effective rule.\n  OSHA has admitted that 95 percent of American employers are acting in \ngood faith. Why have an ergonomics rule that has but one purpose, and \nthat is to place an unsustainable burden upon American employers? Why \nnot have a program that works cooperatively with 95 percent and uses \nthe general duty clause to enforce the remaining 5 percent that are \ndeemed bad actors? That is a rational alternative. Our Secretary of \nLabor has assured us she will address this in a comprehensive manner \nand in a fair manner.\n  This has been a proposal that, in my opinion, is not something that \nwas 10 years in the making but is something that has been shotgunned in \nits present form at the 11th hour. This agency, I believe, has strayed \nfrom a commonsense approach. It is the duty upon this Chamber, upon \nthis body, to pass this resolution to ensure that OSHA is placed back \non the right track. My colleagues have several sound reasons for voting \nin favor of the resolution. The effective rule is a $63 billion annual \nmandate on employers, or more. It circumvents State jurisdiction. It \nrequires small employers to fully understand extremely complex medical \nconditions, and it will undoubtedly send jobs overseas where there are \noften very few protections for workers.\n  I remind my colleagues once again of the statement that I began with, \na quotation from Martha Kent, who said, to her, regulating is a way of \nlife, regulating is a thrill, regulating gives her a high.\n  Our regulatory agencies play an important role, but they threaten \nliberties when they run amok, when they become a rogue rulemaking \nagency. There is more at stake than simply a rule in the vote that we \nhave on CRA. It is, at least in my mind, the issue of the separation of \npowers, the right of the elected representatives of the people to make \nthe laws for the land and when necessary to step in and say enough is \nenough to a regulatory agency that has gone too far.\n  OSHA, in this 600-plus-page rule, has gone too far. We must say \nenough is enough. Here we draw the line. We stop this rule. Start over. \nI hope that is what my colleagues will do as we vote on this resolution \nof disapproval.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question? As I understand \nit, is Senator Bond asking to speak after the Senator from California?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been waiting for about an hour, about \n45 minutes, and I would like to speak after the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What I would like to ask is if the Senator from Illinois \ncould speak after Senator Bond. We are just trying to give some notice \nto our Members. We are alternating back and forth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have a very different view of this \nmatter than that of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. This is \nthe first time the Congress of the United States will have removed a \nworker protection in the history of the United States. So\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nit is really a precedent-setting debate. It is also a debate, I think, \nabout which there is a great deal of misunderstanding.\n  In this new workforce of higher skills, of greater technology, this \nissue, ergonomics, encompasses the No. 1 workplace injury. Of course, \nmany of the victims of repetitive stress disorder are women. As a \nmatter of fact, about 70 percent of the victims are women.\n  As has been mentioned many times, the effort to do something about it \nbegan in a Republican administration with Secretary Elizabeth Dole, a \nvery fine woman. I have watched her. I have great respect for her. She \nbegan the promulgation of these rules which have just gone into place.\n  What I have heard is why we should not proceed with this. I am of \nanother opinion. I believe we should proceed with it. If there are \nchanges that need to be made, we should make those changes, but \nessentially this whole area is a pretty simple one.\n  Data entry employees use computer keyboards every day. Providing \nthese employees with a wrist pad at the base of the keyboard to reduce \nstrain on the wrist is what we are talking about. That is ergonomics. \nFurniture movers lift heavy objects and boxes on a daily basis. \nProviding them with training on how to lift with the legs and providing \nthem with back braces--that is ergonomics.\n  Today, I watched a young man push water jugs on a dolly, the water \njugs for our offices in the Senate. I watched him take out two very \nlarge bottles of water. I thought of him lifting these 8 hours a day, 5 \ndays a week, 52 weeks a year, without a brace, without knowing how to \nlift correctly. You can see the impact this repetitive motion would \nhave on the muscles and skeleton of an individual.\n\n  Each year, 600,000 Americans suffer work-related repetitive stress \ninjuries. Businesses spend $15 billion to $20 billion in workers \ncompensation costs alone. It is estimated that $1 out of every $3 spent \non workers compensation is related to these injuries. In my State, \nCalifornia, in 1998 more than 80,500 private sector workers suffered \nfrom repetitive stress injuries that were serious enough to cause them \nto lose time from work, and another 20,000 public sector workers \nstruggled also with these injuries.\n  The program standard states that employers must provide employees \nbasic information about these injuries, common signs and symptoms of \nthese injuries, and how to report them in the workplace. I don't think \nanything is wrong with that.\n  The standard requires employers to review jobs to determine whether \nthey routinely involve exposure to one or more of the five ergonomic \nrisk factors: repetition, force, awkward posture, contact stress, and \nvibration. If a job meets one of these five so-called action triggers, \nthe employer has two options. He or she can provide a quick fix by \naddressing the potentially harmful situation immediately. An example \nwould be an owner of a furniture company providing his employee who \nmoves furniture with a back brace, or a wrist pad for a data entry \noperator, or an adjustable chair for an employee who must sit at a \ncomputer for 8 hours a day.\n  If a quick fix isn't possible, the employer must develop and \nimplement an ergonomic program for that job and others like it. For \nexample, an employer could hire someone to come in and offer a training \ncourse to teach employees how to sit properly, how to use their arms \nand legs, how to lift from the legs, how to use a stepladder when \nlifting objects off a tall shelf, and so on.\n  The point I want to make is many businesses have already instituted \nergonomics programs. I respectfully submit to the speaker who preceded \nme, that may well be one of the reasons why some of these injury \nstatistics are, in fact, declining. Let me try to make that case.\n  As a result of labor negotiations with the United Auto Workers, Ford, \nGeneral Motors, and DaimlerChrysler, an ergonomic program was put in \nplace in 1994. The programs have been highly successful. The Bureau of \nLabor estimates that in just 1 year, 69,000 work-related injuries were \nprevented in these companies. Of these, 41,000, or over two-thirds, \nwere repetitive stress injuries.\n  The number of these injuries reported to the big three automobile \nmanufacturers dropped 12 percent over 1 year, and 33 percent over 5 \nyears. That shows the statistics go down, the claims go down as these \nprograms are in place.\n  Let me read from a letter from Xerox Corporation:\n\n       Our workers' compensation claims attributable to ergonomic \n     issues peaked in 1992. Since then, we have experienced a \n     steady decline in the number of cases, as well as the costs \n     associated with those cases. 1998 data indicates a 24 percent \n     reduction in the number of cases and a 56 percent reduction \n     in associated direct costs from the 1992 baseline. We \n     attribute this improvement to the reduction of ergonomic \n     hazards in our jobs and improved case management of \n     injured workers. Our ergonomic injury-illness rate in \n     manufacturing is currently 52 percent lower than OSHA's \n     estimated annual incidence.\n\n  This is a big company. The rate is 52 percent lower. That should show \nthat these programs are working.\n  Levi Straus, Coca-Cola, and Business Week are just a few of the \ncompanies that have cited cost savings and increased productivity as a \ndirect result of ergonomics.\n  Silicon Graphics, a computer company in Mountain View, CA, hired an \nergonomics consultant in 1994 after the company had 70 work-related \nrepetitive stress injury cases in 1 year. The company redesigned work \nstations to include adjustable tables, chairs, keyboards, and mouses. \nThe changes worked. Silicon Graphics reduced its work-related stress \ninjuries by 41 percent from 1994 to 1995 and by 50 percent from 1995 to \n1996. The program works.\n  Blue Cross: In 1990, 26 employees of Blue Cross of California were \nunable to do their jobs because of debilitating pain. As a result, they \nfiled workers compensation claims that cost the company $1.6 million. \nTo combat the problem, the company purchased adjustable chairs and work \nstations. Blue Cross also launched a training program to teach \nemployees how to use the new equipment and how to identify work-related \nstress injuries early. Guess what. The investment paid off. The number \nof these injuries dropped dramatically. Blue Cross of California \nreceived a $1 million insurance dividend in both 1992 and 1993.\n  Let me give you a city in my State--San Jose, a large, growing city. \nSan Jose experienced a large number of ergonomic-related back and neck \ninjuries during the early 1990s. To address the problem, the city \nanalyzed each of its jobs over a number of days to identify high-risk \nactivity. A training session was created to show workers how to work \ndifferently and reduce the risk of injury. That is ergonomics. Once \nagain, the efforts paid off. Back injuries fell by 57 percent and wrist \ninjuries fell by 26 percent. Ergonomics works.\n  Pacific Bell was spending approximately $53 million annually for \nworkers compensation benefits paid to 53,000 employees, 30,000 of whom \noperated video display terminals. The company developed an $18 million \nergonomics program providing education, training, brochures, and \ninterfocal eyeglasses for video terminal operators. The results were \nimpressive. Workers compensation claims dropped 33 percent. Ergonomics \nworks.\n  The benefits of the standard: The Department of Labor estimates these \nwork rules will prevent 4.6 million repetitive stress injuries in the \nfirst 10 years of its implementation, and 102 million workers will be \nprotected at 6.1 million worksites across the country. They estimate \ncompanies will save $9.2 billion a year in workers compensation claims \nsimilar to what has happened in Blue Cross, in Xerox, in Chrysler, in \nFord, in the city of San Jose, and in Pacific Bell. For each repetitive \nstress injury prevented, the Department estimates a direct savings of \n$27,700.\n  If what I think will happen happens when this vote is taken, and the \nergonomics standard is overturned, OSHA is barred from introducing any \nstandard that is substantially similar to the rule unless specifically \nauthorized by a subsequent act of Congress. This effectively kills a \n10-year effort.\n\n  Ironically, under the Congressional Review Act, no one is allowed to \nfilibuster this joint resolution of disapproval, but any future efforts \nto implement a new program would be open to filibuster.\n  If the standard is overturned, we are going to have to rely on \nindividual companies to implement their own\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nergonomics standards. Though some companies have done this, 600,000 \npeople still suffer work-related repetitive stress injuries a year.\n  The rate of these injuries is falling, but they are still the \nNation's biggest and most costly job safety problem. These injuries \nstill make up one-third of all lost work-time injuries suffered by \nAmerican workers and cost our economy close to $50 billion a year.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I have tried to outline where large \ncompanies have implemented ergonomics standards, and all of the \nstatistics coming from those standards have run in the right \ndirection--reduced claims, lower worker compensation payments, \ninsurance dividends, and so on and so forth.\n  I must say that I am profoundly disappointed by the fact that there \nare those in this body who would like to do away with worker protection \nfor the No. 1 workplace injury--repetitive stress motions.\n  I hope very much that this resolution will be disapproved.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why the Clinton \nadministration's OSHA ergonomics regulation is the absolute perfect \nregulation for the first use of the congressional disapproval mechanism \nunder the Congressional Review Act. This regulation is the poster child \nof bad regulation. It represents everything that can go wrong in \nregulatory rulemaking, and it gives us, under the CRA, an opportunity \nto exercise our responsibility as Congress to strike it down and tell \nthe new administration to do a better job in this area.\n  Contrary to what has been said by opponents of this resolution of \ndisapproval, this does not prevent the administration from going back \nand doing the job right. In fact, we expect that they will go back and \ndo the job right.\n  Repetitive motion injuries are painful. They are debilitating. They \nare undesirable. They cost employees pain, suffering, lost sleep, and \nlost wages. They cost employers lost time, lost effort, and lost \nrevenue.\n  I understand how serious they can be. I have a lot of friends who \nhave suffered these injuries. I know they are a serious problem.\n  I have talked to employers with small businesses who have lost work \nfrom employees. They regard them as members of their family. They have \nhad these repetitive motion injuries and are hurt personally by it, but \nthey are hurt in their business.\n  The Senator from California described what I think are some very \npromising actions that have been taken.\n  I am delighted we are beginning to find ways to lessen the incidence \nof ergonomic injuries. Businesses have been working with employees--\nemployers and employees working together--to lessen the impact because \neverybody knows they are bad. Everybody knows these injuries are \nharmful to the employee. But they also are harmful to the employer.\n  The Senator from California mentioned a couple things that can be \ndone. She talked about a keypad for somebody who sits at a keyboard all \nday long. If that works, that is great. This is the kind of information \nwe need to share with businesses, and particularly small businesses all \nacross the country. They want to lessen the impact of ergonomic \ninjuries.\n  She mentioned back belts. To say back belts are the answer, I am not \nsure that science is there because one of the women we contacted, who \nadvises small business, was concerned. She had heard that maybe back \nbelts are more harmful than helpful in lessening injuries for people \nwho have to bend over and pick up things. She spent 5 hours on the \nphone with different people in OSHA who came up with different answers \nto her question: Can I tell my small businesses they must require a \nback belt? They could not give her an answer. They referred her to the \ngeneral counsel. Unfortunately, under this regulation, if one of her \nbusiness clients happens to guess wrong, that employer gets hit with \nthe full sanctions of the law.\n  No, these 608 pages in the Federal Register are not helpful in \ntelling small businesses how they can take meaningful steps to lessen \nthe possibility that one of their workers or several of their workers \nwill have ergonomic injuries. What they outline is a series of \npenalties if the workers have an injury on the job, or if the workers \nhave an injury that is aggravated on the job, or even if the worker has \nan injury off the job and comes to work and it gets a little worse.\n  Five years ago, I introduced the Redtape Reduction Act--others \nremember it as the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act--\nto protect small businesses from overreaching regulations. I am proud \nto say it was unanimously supported in the Small Business Committee. It \ncame to the floor, and it was overwhelmingly supported. Senator Nickles \nadded the Congressional Review Act as an amendment for just this type \nof moment, this type of activity--when an agency has gone so far off \ncourse, there is no other remedy left but to force it to abandon its \noriginal approach and start over.\n  This is precisely the kind of regulation for which we overwhelmingly, \nin this body, adopted the Congressional Review Act because this \nmeasure, under review today, is a draconian, punitive measure that is \nincomprehensible, unfathomable, and ineffective.\n  Action under the CRA, as I said earlier, as some have tried to \nsuggest, does not try to prevent any other action by an agency in the \nsame area; it merely means the agency cannot make the same mistake \ntwice. By disapproving this version of an ergonomics regulation, under \nthe CRA we will merely be saying that OSHA cannot rely on that same \ntype of regulation again. Indeed, when we strike down the regulation, \nit will help OSHA by expediting the regulatory process. Instead of the \nagency having to go through a separate rulemaking to determine whether \nto make changes to the current regulation, they will be free to begin \nto develop an approach that will be reasonable for employers, \nresponsive to employees' needs, and based on sound science and the best \ninformation available, as soon as Congress completes action on the \njoint resolution of disapproval in S.J. Res. 6.\n\n  The Clinton OSHA ergonomics regulation is truly egregious in both \nsubstance and procedure. It will be devastating both to small \nbusinesses and their employers because it is incomprehensible and \noutrageously burdensome. Too many of the requirements are subjective \nand open-ended. For instance, an employer must implement \n``appropriate'' control measures, use ``feasible'' engineering \ncontrols, or reduce hazards to the ``extent feasible.'' These \nrequirements are like posting a speed limit on the highway that says, \n``Do not drive too fast,'' but you never know what ``too fast'' is \nuntil a State trooper pulls you over and tells you that you were \ndriving too fast.\n  Employers and small businesses simply will not know when they have \nmet the burden of this regulation until they are told by OSHA or sued \nby OSHA or have to settle a lawsuit brought by a trial lawyer who has \nseized on this new regulation as a source of specialization.\n  It is not surprising to me that immediately after this regulation was \npublished, billboards began springing up. I show you one in the St. \nLouis area, advertising for attorneys who would be willing to bring \nactions on behalf of employees who think they have carpal tunnel \nsyndrome: ``Such-and-such law center, representing workers with carpal \ntunnel syndrome. Toll free from St. Louis. Call for help.''\n  Guess who is behind this regulation. Guess who wants to see it go \ninto force. Never mind the States have set up workers compensation laws \nthat are designed to compensate people without going through lawsuits, \nto compensate them immediately for workers comp or workplace-related \ninjuries. This is a brand new industry. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the \nnext tobacco industry lawsuit. Never mind that these employees would be \neligible for benefits under workers compensation.\n  This regulation is like setting up a new lottery; somebody is going \nto strike it rich. Now everybody wants a shot at the pot of gold \notherwise known as the employer's liability insurance policy.\n  What do you think will happen to insurance premiums and workers \ncompensation premiums for small employers? They are going to go up. \nThey are going to go up substantially because they are going to have\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nto pay all these claims. OSHA never took these consequences into \naccount when it was estimating the cost of the regulation.\n  It is bad enough that this regulation is incomprehensible and vague, \nbut it also requires an employer to go beyond the text of the \nregulation to understand fully and comply with the regulation.\n  I held up this Federal Register Code. If you really are interested in \nit, you can find it, going from page 68262 to page 68870. That is 608 \npages of very fine print in the Federal Register. But the fascinating \npart about it is, there is appendix D. Appendix D says where you go to \nget the information. You can go to the ``Job Strain Index: A Proposed \nMethod to Analyze Jobs For Risk of Distal Upper Extremity Disorders.'' \nYou can go to the ``American Industrial Hygienists Association.'' You \ncan get another copy of the ``Applications Manual for the Revised NIOSH \nLifting Equations'' from the U.S. Department of Commerce Technology \nAdministration. You can get a copy of ``The Design of Manual Handling \nTasks: Revised Tables of Maximum Acceptable Weights and Forces'' from \nTaylor & Francis Inc. in Philadelphia. You can get a copy of the \n``Rapid Entire Body Assessment'' from the Elsevier Science Regional \nSales Office. You can get a copy of the ``RULA: A Survey Method for the \nInvestigation of Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders.''\n\n  The mom or pop operating a small business is going to have enough \ntrouble trying to get through 608 pages of the Federal Register. I \ndoubt if any of us recently have sat down to read 608 pages in the \nFederal register. I used to have to do that for a living. That is why I \nchanged my line of work. I got out of the practice of law because that \ndid not seem to be a useful idea.\n  There are an awful lot of people in small business who provide a \nproduct, who deliver a service, who probably do not care about reading \n608 pages of the Federal Register or applying to all those different \npeople to get all the different manuals they have. That is what they \nwould have to do under this regulation. They are highly technical \npieces written by ergonomists for technical and academic journals. They \nare not the stuff that helps a small business to provide jobs, to \nprovide services, and to provide a contribution to the economy and to \nthe family of the owner.\n  The final regulation is also a travesty to the rulemaking process. \nThe other side will say it has been in the works for over 10 years. \nThat is true. But the truth is, it was not until OSHA saw the clock \nrunning out that it got down to business and cranked out proposals in \nNovember of 1999 and moved heaven and earth to get it done 1 year \nlater.\n  To get it out in such a short time, OSHA cut corners at every \nopportunity. They padded the dockets with expert opinions bought and \npaid for with tax dollars, tax dollars designed to get the contractors \nto trash the opposing comments and to support what OSHA was trying to \ndo. They added materials to the dockets that were not available for \nreview before the comment period closed. They didn't provide adequate \ntime for commenters to develop their responses. They ignored a wide \nvariety of constructive comments and suggestions they received. The \nClinton OSHA even published the final rule with significant provisions \nthat have never been put out for public comment, violating what I have \nalways understood is a fundamental, cardinal principle of the \nregulatory process.\n  OSHA went into this rulemaking knowing exactly what it wanted to have \nand, in the end, didn't let logic, facts, fairness, congressional \nobjections, legitimate concerns from small business, or plain common \nsense get in the way.\n  The true disappointment about the ergonomics regulation and all of \nits surrounding problems is that it could have been avoided. Congress \ntold the Clinton administration in a bipartisan voice the last several \nyears not to proceed with the regulation. Instead, the Clinton \nadministration refused to accept the guidance of this legislative body \nand extended the negotiations over the final appropriations bills until \nthey could get the final rule out the door on November 14. Not only did \nthey trample on the separation of powers doctrine in so doing, but \nthere were programs waiting for annual funding which did not receive \ntheir money--which in many cases were increases--because the \nadministration wanted to be able to push through this flawed process \nand flawed approach to ergonomics.\n  In May 1999, I introduced a bill that would have avoided this mess. \nIt was called the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence Act, or \nSENSE Act. The bill would have forced OSHA to do something not too \nunreasonable, not too strange: Simply to wait for the results of a \nstudy then under way by the National Academy of Sciences on this \nsubject of ergonomics before proceeding with the regulation.\n  The study, requested by Congress and agreed to by President Clinton \nin the appropriations bill of the previous year, reviewed the available \nscientific literature to determine if sufficient evidence and data \nexisted to support OSHA's promulgating of a regulation on this issue. \nThe report was delivered to Congress on January 16 of this year, the \nsame day the Clinton ergonomics regulation took effect.\n  Had OSHA waited for the NAS study, they would have had the benefit of \nsome valuable analysis of the data on this most complex subject. The \nNAS panel concluded that there are a wide array of factors which play \nsignificant roles in whether an individual develops an MSD and that \nworkplace issues are only one of these factors and quite possibly not \neven the most significant one at that. As the panel stated:\n\n       None of the common MSDs is uniquely caused by work \n     exposures.\n\n  Instead, the study discussed whether someone will develop an MSD \nbased on the totality of factors that person may face, which is how the \nscientific literature handled the issue. The panel concluded that a \nwide range of personal factors played significant roles in determining \nwhether someone was likely to develop an MSD. Included in these were \nfactors such as age, gender, body mass index, personal habits such as \nsmoking, possible genetically determined predispositions, as well as \nactivities outside the workplace such as sports, household work, or \nexercise programs. These are factors over which an employer exercises \nno control and we certainly would not want them to exercise control.\n\n  The NAS study also concluded that psychosocial factors have a strong \nassociation with MSDs. Psychosocial factors include such conditions as \ndepression, anxiety, psychological distress, personality factors, fear \navoidance coping, high job demands, low decision latitude, low control \nover work, low work stimulus, low social support, low job satisfaction, \nhigh perceived stress, and nonwork-related worry, tension, and \npsychological distress. These psychosocial factors, even if work \nrelated, are beyond the reach of an OSHA regulation, meaning that \nOSHA's regulation will do little, if anything, to protect these \nemployees from developing MSDs.\n  Furthermore, the NAS study was unequivocal in calling for more \nresearch into the issues surrounding the assessment, measurement, and \nunderstanding of ergonomics and workplace exposures. Among the specific \nareas in which the NAS recommends more research is the quantification \nof risk factors.\n  The Clinton OSHA did have a simple solution for the perplexing \nproblem of how to determine whether a musculoskeletal disorder was \ncaused by workplace exposures. They defined all MSDs as work related. \nUnder this regulation, any MSD in the workplace contributed to by \nworkplace exposures or even a preexisting injury aggravated in the \nworkplace is to be considered work related. That is outrageously \nunfair. It goes beyond OSHA's mandate to protect workers from workplace \nhazards. It means that if an employee injures him or herself through \nrecreational activities such as bowling, exercising, using the Internet \nat home, planting trees, or any other workplace activities, and any \nworkplace activities aggravate these injuries and they meet OSHA's \ndefinition of frequency or duration, the employer will be required to \nimplement the Clinton OSHA ergonomics program.\n  Small businesses that I talk to and listen to as chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business are absolutely stunned and shocked by this \nrequirement. They are stunned that an agency of the Federal Government \ncould issue\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nsuch a sweeping and poorly designed rule. They are incredulous and ask \nquestions such as why didn't someone say or do something. The truth is, \nmany people have said the right things. They outlined the difficulties \nemployers would have with the rule, the faulty assumptions, but OSHA \nwas not listening.\n  The preamble to the final rule cites comment after comment that tried \nto explain to OSHA why the regulation was a mistake. OSHA seemed to \nregard these as mere speed bumps on the way to the finish line. This \nregulation may become the best example yet of the law of unintended \nconsequences. If allowed to stand, OSHA will end up undermining many of \nthe best intentions of thousands of employers, causing their employees \nto suffer in the process and wind up costing them jobs.\n  Small businesses can be shut down because of the cost of these \nregulations. Yes, this regulation may lower the incidence of workplace \nMSDs, but at least some of that lessening of MSD injuries will be \nbecause people will lose their jobs. Then they clearly won't have a \nworkplace musculoskeletal disorder. That is one very effective way \nto eliminate workplace ergonomic injuries, but it is not what we ought \nto be seeking.\n\n  A woman who runs a small business in Kansas City told me she won't be \nable to continue to pay 85 percent of her employees' health insurance \npremiums that she currently pays. She has a Web site and graphics \ndesign studio with 30 employees. She has already been buying new \nergonomically designed chairs at $800 apiece, along with new furniture \nto make it more comfortable for her employees. She provides a range of \nemployee benefits, a 401(k), dental benefits, but she told me: The \nbureaucrats in Washington think we have all this money just lying \naround to spend for this type of thing. That's is not true. The only \nplace I can get the kind of money to comply with this regulation is \ntaking it out of the benefits I give to my employees.\n  She said: I asked my friends on the other side, how has the Clinton \nergonomics regulation improved these employees' lives?\n  It isn't going to.\n  A man who runs a small business metal fabricating shop said this rule \nwill cause him possibly to drop his company's work with the local \nsheltered workshop, providing jobs for those with mental and physical \ndisabilities, because of the burdens of this OSHA regulation. Is that \nthe result OSHA wants? Certainly not. This is an unintended \nconsequence.\n  Many people may not realize, if they are not involved in small \nbusiness, small businesses get by with very tight cashflow. Large \nbusinesses can capitalize expenses for compliance. They can have squads \nof people who are trained to help overcome these, but a small business \ndoes not have that luxury. Even a few hundred dollars a month for a \nconsultant can make a significant difference.\n  Then there is the question of time. Time is money. Do they have time \nto read these regulations? Do they have time to go out and get the \nother books, comply with all the requirements? Adding this regulation \nand its complexities on top of other duties means less time doing what \nwill make their business grow, expand, and thrive.\n  Furthermore, many small businesses have never encountered an OSHA \nregulation like this before, which means it is not just another layer \non their safety programs, it is a whole world of OSHA regulations, like \nstarting off to climb Mount Everest on your first climbing experience. \nSmall businesses we hear from simply don't have the resources to expend \non this complicated a regulation with as little payoff as this will \nprovide.\n  The cost estimates of this regulation reveal the utter cluelessness \nof the promulgators of the regulation. OSHA says it would cost $4.5 \nbillion per year over 10 years. But everybody else who has looked at it \nsays they are off by orders of magnitude. The Small Business \nAdministration Advocacy Council of the Clinton administration found the \nearliest draft was underestimated by a factor of up to 15 times, even \nbefore OSHA added more requirements.\n  We are possibly talking about regulations costing $60 billion to $100 \nbillion a year. To inflate the benefits and thus make this regulation \nlook less burdensome, the Clinton OSHA assumed, with no supporting \nevidence, that imposing this standard on businesses would cure an \nadditional 50 percent more MSDs over the next 10 years. As I pointed \nout earlier, they may cure some of the MSDs by costing people their \njobs. No job, no job-related MSDs.\n  Let me be clear, I raise this discussion about the cost of this \nregulation not because small businesses are unwilling to spend money on \nthe safety of their employees--every small business my office has \ntalked to, and committee reached out to, already has a safety plan and \nsome level of an ergonomics program in place. They want to do what they \ncan do to stop the injuries of employees, which are costing them money. \nI raise the issue to make the point that OSHA went forward with this \nregulation without any reliable idea about what this will cost or what \nbenefits it will generate.\n  Not only was OSHA unable to say with any credibility what the costs \nand benefits of this regulation would be, but as has already been \npointed out, this gargantuan regulation was also unnecessary: MSD rates \nhave dropped by 22 percent over the last 5 years, according the \nDepartment of Labor Statistics. As the Senator from California pointed \nout, many leading businesses are making great strides in limiting \nergonomic injuries because they realize it is good employer-employee \nrelations to do so.\n  For that small percentage of businesses that may not be motivated to \nhelp their employees with ergonomic injuries, there is the OSHA general \nduty clause to protect employees from employers who abuse them.\n  The bottom line is that small businesses are in business to stay in \nbusiness. That means keeping their employees healthy. Employees often \nare more than mere workers--friends, neighbors, or even relatives. Any \nregulation from OSHA should first do no harm to both the employers and \ntheir employees. The Clinton OSHA ergonomics regulation fails this \nthreshold test. It is regulations such as these that create waves of \ncynicism and doubt about the Federal Government and that cause them to \nwonder whether those of us who have been elected to safeguard and to \nspeak up for their interests are asleep at the wheel.\n  For the first time in this CRA, we can say ``enough''--that OSHA has \ngone too far and has crossed the line of reasonableness. The Clinton \nergonomics regulation doesn't protect employees; it punishes employers. \nThe regulation is not responsive; it is irresponsible; and it must be \nstruck down. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of \ndisapproval and send OSHA a message that we will not tolerate this \njoyride of regulatory overreach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues who are concerned about efforts to demolish this important \nworker health and safety standard.\n  I listened carefully to the remarks of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Missouri, and I understand there are many serious concerns being \ndiscussed about this regulation and its impact both on our workforce \nand our employers. But I ask that we remember where this started 10 \nyears ago--in the previous Bush administration, under the leadership of \nSecretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole. We have held numerous hearings and \nstudies to determine the impact of our 21st-century worksites on \npeople's physical well-being.\n  OSHA is charged with the responsibility of setting standards for the \nworkplace to help protect citizens from harm. In its 30 years of \nexistence, OSHA has helped to save many lives and prevent countless \ninjuries. Despite such a track record, we know that OSHA faces almost \ncontinual opposition from those who do not agree with its mission and \nwho seek to undermine its work. This year, the opposition feels \nemboldened to strike at the heart of OSHA's latest efforts to protect \nAmerican workers.\n  We are, of course, talking about the ergonomics standard, which is \ndesigned to help more than 600,000 workers who experience serious \nworkplace injuries every year from repetitive motion and exertion. In \nenacting this standard, OSHA heard from thousands of witnesses and \nreceived the backing of the\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\nNational Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine.\n  The report to which my distinguished colleague from Missouri referred \nis this rather large report that was issued on January 18. I draw our \nattention to some of the conclusions and recommendations that were \narrived at. Let me just quote from it:\n\n       The weight of the evidence justifies the identification of \n     certain work-related risk factors for the occurrence of \n     musculoskeletal disorders in the lower back and extremities. \n     The panel concludes that there is a clear relationship--\n\n  I stress that--\n\n     between back disorders and physical load. That is, manual \n     material handling, load momentum, frequent bending and \n     twisting, heavy physical work, and whole body vibration. For \n     disorders of the upper extremities, repetition, force and \n     vibration are particularly important work-related factors.\n\n  Mr. President, destroying this standard would put many workers at \nrisk, but today I want to focus on women workers in particular because, \nas my friend and colleague Senator Feinstein said, women account for 64 \npercent of repetitive motion injuries, even though we make up only 46 \npercent of the workforce.\n  Earlier today, I was joined by a number of women who have suffered \nfrom these disorders. One was Kathy Saumier, who was a worker at a \nplastics plant in Syracuse, NY. Kathy worked on a production line where \nshe had to lift 40-pound boxes every 1 to 2 minutes while twisting and \nholding the boxes at an awkward angle in order to put the boxes on the \nconveyor belt.\n  With relatively small changes to the design of her work station, or \nwith automated assistance in lifting the boxes, she and many of her \ncoworkers could have been saved from such painful and time-consuming \ninjuries.\n\n  Kathy joined me and my colleagues from Maryland and California, \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Boxer, at a news conference to highlight \nour concerns about these issues as they particularly affect women. Also \nspeaking was Dianne Moriarity, who, for 18 years, worked as a school \nsecretary in New York. Because of her years of work in a badly designed \nwork station, both of her wrists and hands are damaged. She showed me \nthe picture of her work station. The computer was bolted in a certain \nway so it could not be moved. The space for the chair was such that it \ncould not be angled, and there was no place for her to be able to move \ncomfortably to fulfill her obligations at that worksite. She is in \nvirtually constant discomfort and needs regular therapy.\n  We also heard from Jennifer Hunter from Virginia, who worked for 20 \nyears in a chicken processing plant. She was required, as the chickens \nwent down the line, to make 1,400 cuts each hour. She spoke \nspecifically about what it took to prepare the filet of chicken breast, \nwhich so many of us enjoy and eat at home or order in a restaurant, and \nhow difficult it was at the speed of that line to be able to get those \ncuts in, and how her wrists had to be constantly moving.\n\n  She, too, has suffered serious health effects from that kind of \nrepetitive motion. As she told us today, we really need this standard \nso that workers are protected.\n  Heidi Eberhardt of Massachusetts worked at an Internet publishing \ncompany, writing, editing, and researching. She is only 32 years old. \nThis was her dream job. She was able to put her college education to \nwork. But because of the repetitive motion that was required over long \nhours sitting at her computer, she finds it impossible to perform some \nof the daily functions we all take for granted. She can't turn on a \nfaucet; she can't squeeze a toothpaste tube; she can't twist an ice \ncube tray or even open mail without severe limitations and pain. As \nHeidi said, this is not just about the people who are already injured; \nthis is about hundreds of thousands of workers who will become injured \nif there is no ergonomic standard for the workplace.\n  One of the reasons women are adversely affected by this workplace \nhazard is because women hold more than 80 percent of the jobs that \ninvolve repetitive motion injuries, jobs such as hotel cleaning, data \nentry, secretarial positions, sewing.\n  Those who are here today working to save this worker safety standard \nunderstand that our opponents believe it will impose a costly burden on \nbusiness. But as our distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia, pointed out, those businesses that have already implemented \nstandards have found they save money. They save money by keeping their \nworkers on the job, in good health, and more productive.\n  Certainly in New York we have found that businesses which have \nimplemented the standards have reaped rewards: businesses such as \ngarment manufacturers, Sequins International in Queens, or Xerox in \nRochester, a company that has had ergonomic standards in place since \n1988. We have found that these standards and the businesses that \nimplement them are taking not only better care of their workers but \nbetter care of their bottom line.\n  In addition to our concerns about the substance of the standard, we \nare also deeply concerned about the manner in which the opponents seek \nto destroy this important worker safety provision. Everyone is willing \nto work together to change or improve the standard. If there are \nlegitimate concerns that have been raised, there are certainly ways we \ncan go about working to ameliorate those concerns.\n  As my colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, put it so \nwell, this is an effort that is truly a legislative atom bomb. The \nCongressional Review Act has never been used before. It does more than \nrescind the worker safety standard. It does ensure that the Labor \nDepartment can never again put forth an ergonomic standard. It is, in \neffect, a gag rule on worker safety. By dropping this Congressional \nReview Act atom bomb, opponents will completely eliminate 10 years of \nbipartisan effort in two administrations, many hours of public review \nand witness testimony, and extensive research in less than 10 hours of \ndebate--10 years versus 10 hours.\n  I can appreciate the desire by some to make changes to the standard. \nBut I hope we can talk about ways that such changes would be \nconsidered, give the public a chance to be heard, and any changes would \nbe based not upon anecdote, not upon story after story but on science \nand on the legitimate concerns of both workers and businesses.\n  We should simply not bow to pressure groups and wipe this worker \nsafety standard off the face of our regulatory planet. We are here \ntoday to send a clear message that this is not the way to go about \ncreating a safe workplace or working with businesses to make it safer \nfor them to employ people across the vast sectors of the economy that \nuse repetitive motion. We particularly are concerned about the impact \nthis will have on women in the workplace.\n  We are also concerned this could mark the beginning of an erosion of \nprotection for workers in America; if you will, a legislative \nrepetitive motion that will undo safeguards that save lives.\n  In the 20th century, we made great advances in protecting workers. \nOften those advances came because of a tragedy, a terrible fire, a mine \ncollapse, a factory assembly line run amok, when all of a sudden it \nbecame clear that we were putting people's lives and well-being at \nrisk. This is a silent epidemic. There will not be a big newspaper \nheadline about a crash of ergonomics. We will see just the slow but \nsteady erosion of people's health and their productivity and their \ncapacity to get up and go to work and to go home and do what they need \nto do for themselves and their families.\n  This is an issue that goes to the heart of the new economy. How do we \nprovide for 21st century workers the protections we did finally work \nout after lots of effort? We should not go back. We should not turn our \nbacks on America's working families. We should, instead, defeat this \neffort to kill this vitally important standard and then utilize the \nprocedures available to us to go ahead and consider whatever the \nconcerns on the other side might be.\n  I ask our distinguished opponents to think hard about using this \nlegislative atom bomb and, instead, consider how we can, through \nexisting procedures, petition the administration to stay the regulation \nwhile further work is done. We can also petition the agency to modify \nor repeal the standards, and we can have OSHA initiate rulemaking \nprocedures to modify the rule in accordance with the Administrative \nProcedures Act. If the real point here is to\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nprotect small business and protect workers, there are ways of going \nabout that which are already provided for. It is hard to understand why \nwe would need to blow away 10 years of work, the findings of \nnonpartisan, objective scientists, and the stories that flood many of \nour offices from workers who are endangered, in order to deal with what \ncould be legitimate questions.\n  I certainly hope we are able to disapprove this resolution so we can, \ntogether, work on behalf of the American worker.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield such time as he desires to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 6, the resolution \nto disapprove the Department of Labor's regulations on ergonomics \nstandards. This isn't a new issue. Congress wrestled with ergonomics \nregulations for a decade. This isn't the solution we need. We can and \nmust do better.\n  Right off the bat, let's remember we all want a safe workplace for \nthe American workers. That is just common sense.\n  The debate today isn't about who is for or against workers or who is \nfor or against a safe place to work. It is, instead, about the most \neffective way to achieve the goal of workers, employers, and our entire \neconomy.\n  The Department of Labor regulation that we are voting on today has a \nnumber of problems. It is too regulatory, too burdensome on business, \nand it is not backed up by sound science. It needs an overhaul. We need \nto pass this resolution today to make sure that if and when the Federal \nGovernment passes a final ergonomics rule, it gets it right.\n  For years, Congress and the Department of Labor have been talking \nabout writing an ergonomics rule. This is nothing new. All of my \ncolleagues are familiar by now with this issue. But these regulations \nthat are about to go into effect are the product of a hurried, sloppy \nrulemaking process. After years and years of debate and study, it was \nrushed through at the 11th hour by President Clinton, just before he \nleft office.\n\n  I know everybody has seen this, but it is 608 pages--608 pages. It is \nnot even the same rules and regulations that were originally proposed.\n  We need to know that President Clinton was busy as a beaver before he \nleft the White House, working right up to the last minute trying to \npass as many new big Government regulations and to pardon as many \nfugitives as possible. The ergonomics regulations are just another \nexample of the frenzied last-minute push by the President to build a \nlegacy. It is not about getting the best workplace safety rules; it is \nabout President Clinton trying to pass as many new rules as possible \nbefore he had to leave town. That is not the right way to write \nregulations, and Congress has the oversight responsibility to do the \nright thing and take a hard, cold look at what he did.\n  What the President did just does not make sense. After years of \ndiscussing and debating, the worst thing he could have done was to \nfinally pass a new rule just for the sake of doing it. The Small \nBusiness Administration estimates that the ergonomics rule is going to \ncost American businesses $60 billion to $100 billion a year. That is \ntoo much money not to make sure that every ``i'' is dotted and every \n``t'' is crossed.\n  It is hard to pass a law and it is hard to pass a rule. Congress has \nset up that procedure on purpose to make sure things are done \nthoroughly and thoughtfully and sensibly, and new regulations that \ncould have a tremendous impact on employers and employees are not \nslapped together at the last minute. But that is exactly what happened \nwith the ergonomics rule, and the results could be disastrous for our \neconomy. Besides the sloppy process, one of the biggest problems with \nthis mad rush to pass a rule was that it ignored sound science. OSHA \nand Congress have been working on an ergonomic standard for the better \npart of a decade, and in 1998 we asked the experts at the nonpartisan \nNational Academy of Sciences to study the medical and scientific \nevidence to help determine what, if any, regulations were needed.\n  They finished that study in January and determined that more detailed \nresearch was needed before we write a final rule. Among other things, \nthe Academy said many factors such as age, gender, personal habits, or \neven job satisfaction could all play a part in workplace injuries, and \nthat we have to be careful to take everything into account in writing \nan ergonomics rule.\n  One size does not fit all. That is probably another reason why \nPresident Clinton was in such a hurry to pass the ergonomics rule last \nNovember. The new study was going to come out soon and he was worried \nabout what it was going to say. So instead of waiting for all the \nevidence, instead of waiting for the experts, he tried to jam the \nergonomics regulations down the throat of American business before all \nthe facts came to light. That is no way to run a Government or a \nrailroad.\n  But the biggest concern I personally have with the new regulations is \nnot about process, and it is not about science. It is about what the \nnew rules would mean in terms of dollars and cents out in the real \nworld. Before we do anything else, we have to be realistic and take a \nhard look at the bottom line and how this rule is going to hurt our \neconomy; how it could close businesses and lead to layoffs of real \npeople.\n  As I just said a few minutes ago, the SBA has already told us these \nnew regulations could cost up to $100 billion every single year. \nAccording to the Employment Policy Foundation, businesses in Kentucky \ncould expect to pay $1.3 billion annually. In my part of Kentucky, that \nis serious money. For a business that operates on the margin, where the \nowners and workers struggle every day to keep the doors open and the \nlights on, this sweeping new regulation could be the difference between \nlife and death--staying open or closing.\n  Over the years, I have heard many of my constituents speak about this \nissue, and many are afraid these new regulations could lead to layoffs \nor increased prices for products or to jobs moving overseas. That is \nsimply not acceptable.\n  I recently received a letter from Joe Natcher, who is President and \nCEO of Southern Foods in Bowling Green, KY. Southern Foods is a small \nbusiness that sells food, cleaning supplies, and other products to area \nbusinesses. He told me about these regulations and how they could \naffect his company. Mr. Natcher wrote:\n\n       As we begin our compliance efforts, it is clear that the \n     rule will severely impact productivity and profitability, \n     putting jobs at risk and increasing prices to our consumers \n     without providing any additional health and safety benefits.\n       Southern Foods does not just talk about safety and health \n     habits. We practice it every day. Additionally, we provide \n     training to all co-workers and have an active safety \n     committee. . . . The ergonomics rule threatens our company's \n     future and the jobs of the co-workers who depend on us.\n\n  Southern Foods is just one example from the thousands of Kentucky \nbusinesses that would be affected by these new regulations. As they are \nwritten now, the new regs would affect almost every single employer in \nAmerica, even if they had just one employee. No matter what their \nsituation, businesses will be forced to implement a complete ergonomics \nprogram if there is only one complaint. The cost and effort could be \nstaggering.\n  It is simple. More burdensome rules and regulations mean more time \nspent on paperwork and less time on business. Less work on business \nmeans less gets done, the bottom line shrinks. We know who is going to \npay--workers, in lower wages, fewer benefits, and layoffs.\n  I know many in the labor movement really want the new regulations, \nbut I am afraid they are looking at the regulation rules in a vacuum. \nThey might think this sweeping new rule is the answer to their prayers, \nbut in the end it is just going to hurt those they claim they want to \nprotect.\n  Finally, let me say if this resolution passes, it is not the end of \nthe discussion about ergonomics and improving the safety of the \nAmerican workplace. Instead, it leaves the door open for the Bush \nadministration to continue studying this issue and to come up with more \npractical and creative ways to accommodate workers and employees. Any \nnew regulations have to be\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\nsomething with which we all literally can live. The pending regulations \nwe have now are not.\n  I urge support for the resolution before us today and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, about 10 years ago--during the first Bush \nAdministration--Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole heard the stories and \nsaw the statistics about the serious ergonomic injuries that American \nworkers suffer.\n  For 10 years, the Department of Labor--in consultation with business, \nlabor, and Congress--has worked to enact a fair, enforceable rule to \nprotect America's workers from the real harm caused by ergonomic \ninjuries.\n  Now, with just a few hours of debate, some in this body are trying to \nundo a decade's worth of work.\n  In fact, their actions would preclude the Department of Labor from \nenacting a similar rule.\n  That sends a horrible message to America's working men and women. It \nsays--we know you're breaking your back--literally--day-in and day-out \nto put food on your table, but this Congress won't do anything to \nprotect you from a serious injury.\n  Today, many people wear down their tendons and their joints on the \njob. They go home after a long day of work and just want to pick their \nkids up and hold them. But they can't because of ergonomic injuries.\n  To them, this resolution that is before us says, ``Too bad. This \nCongress won't help you.''\n  Yes. This rule will have an economic impact on business in America. \nBut we must also consider the economic impact of injured workers.\n  If a family's primary breadwinner can't work because of an on-the-job \nergonomic injury--there is a serious economic impact to that family, \nthat community, and our country.\n  The human body has its limits, and this rule recognizes those limits \nand helps us become a safer, more productive workforce.\n  Last week, I received a letter from a constituent, Frank Lehn, from \nWashougal, Washington. Washougal is a great town--the kind of town that \nany parent would want to raise their kids in.\n  The gentleman who wrote me was a mill worker for 27 years--\n``performing extremely physical, manual-type labor''--as he describes \nit. In his email to me, he says:\n\n       The constant stress of my job on my body resulted in a \n     degenerative spinal disease, creating painful bone spurs \n     where the nerves exit my spine.\n       When I was finally unable to do my job, I was given a \n     disability retirement, and now live on an $800 monthly \n     pension.\n       The ergonomics standard now in place came too late to help \n     me, but I am greatly concerned about the future of the young \n     workers who are performing the same tasks I did day after day \n     for many years.\n       It is crucial that we do not allow this vital standard to \n     be weakened in any way.\n       During my years on the job, many of my co-workers suffered \n     painful injuries to their joints and muscles through no fault \n     of their own. They were all simply doing their jobs.\n       The many whose sweat and toil form the backbone of this \n     nation need strong laws to protect their safety and welfare. \n     Please oppose any effort to weaken or take away this nation's \n     ergonomics standard.\n\n  We should heed Frank's words, and the millions of other workers who \nhave stories just like his. In fact, ergonomic injuries are the single-\nlargest occupational health crisis faced by America's working men and \nwomen today.\n  This resolution, if enacted, turns our backs on the people who build \nAmerica, assist us at the grocery store, sew our clothes--the people \nwho keep our country running.\n  Let's be clear: Today's debate is just the latest step in a larger \nattempt to by some to deny progress on this issue.\n  Many Americans will ask: Who could be against such a common sense \nmeasure?\n  The answer: The current administration and many here in Congress.\n  They are trying to use the Congressional Review Act to undo a rule \nthat was called for by a Republican, and finalized by a Democrat, based \non 10 years of work.\n  Today, they are trying to undo this vital safety rule because they've \nbeen losing this debate on its merits for the last 10 years.\n  I hope that gives my colleagues pause as they consider how they will \nvote on this measure: a ten year, bipartisan effort versus a highly-\ncharged, highly-partisan debate for 10 hours.\n  The action we are contemplating today would strip the ergonomic \nstandard off the books forever, and require a further act of Congress \nto implement another one.\n  Let's look at one claim made by those who oppose this standard: The \nopponents claim we don't have enough facts.\n  Just two months ago, the National Academy of Sciences finished its \nsecond comprehensive study on ergonomics.\n  Their conclusion: Workplace practices do cause ergonomic injuries, \nand ergonomics programs can effectively address those practices that \ncause injury.\n  This was the second Academy study on ergonomics that upheld this \nconclusion.\n  In addition to the two studies by the Academy of Sciences, the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health studied \nergonomics.\n  It found there is ``clear and compelling evidence'' that \nmusculoskeletal disorders--or MSD's--are caused by certain types of \nwork. And it found that those injuries can be reduced and prevented \nthrough workplace interventions.\n  The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine--the \nworld's largest occupational medical society--agreed with those \nfindings and saw no reason to delay implementation. The studies and the \nscience are conclusive.\n  Other opponents claims that this isn't a significant problem. The \nfacts prove otherwise.\n  Each year, more than 600,000 private sector workers in America are \nforced to miss time from work because of painful MSDs.\n  These injuries hurt America's companies. Employers pay more than $20 \nbillion annually in workers' compensation benefits due to MSDs, and \nemployers pay up to $60 billion in lost productivity, disability \nbenefits and other associated costs.\n  The impact of MSDs on women in the workplace is especially serious. \nWomen make up 46 percent of the total workforce. They account for just \na third of the total injured workers, but women account for 63 percent \nof all lost work time due to ergonomic injuries, and 69 percent of lost \nwork time because of carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  Women in the health care, retail and textile industries are \nparticularly hard hit by MSDs and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  Women suffer more than 90 percent of the MSDs among nurses, nurse \naides, health care aides and sewing machine operators.\n  Women also account for 91 percent of the carpal tunnel cases that \noccur among cashiers.\n  Despite the overwhelming evidence of the impact of MSDs due to a lack \nof workplace standards, we are still debating the need for this rule.\n  The states are getting this right. Last year, my home state of \nWashington became the second state along with California to adopt an \nergonomics rule.\n  The rule in Washington state is helping employers reduce workplace \nhazards that cripple and injure more than 50,000 workers a year at a \ncost of more than $411 million a year.\n  It is estimated that it costs employers about $80 million a year to \ncomply with the standards. But when they comply, employers save about \n$340 million per year. Clearly, this is a cost-effective program.\n  Nationwide, the ergonomic rule is estimated to save businesses $4.5 \nbillion annually. That's because workers' compensation claims will fall \nand production will increase.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution. We should allow OSHA \nto get on with its job of protecting American workers from ergonomics \ninjuries. If individuals have problems with the rule, I suggest they \nseek to modify it through the administrative process or craft \nlegislation. Trying to use the Congressional Review Act, however, is a \ndrastic action by desperate people.\n  We should not allow 10 hours of debate to permanently invalidate a \nrule that took 10 years to implement and is clearly supported by \ncredible science.\n  Let's give America's workers the protections they need instead of \nmisusing this process to eliminate the safety\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nstandards that workers and their families rely on.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, for yielding to me. He was next in line.\n  I have sought recognition to comment on the pending issue on the \nCongressional Review Act as it relates to the pending ergonomics rule. \nThe issue before us at the moment has been a long, contentious one that \nI have had considerable contact with in connection with my \nresponsibilities as chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, which \nhas jurisdiction over the Department of Labor.\n  The issue of rulemaking on ergonomics has been around since a study \nwas ordered more than a decade ago by then Secretary of Labor Elizabeth \nDole. There have been a number of delays, as the issue has come before \nthe subcommittee on appropriations for the Department of Labor where \nefforts have been made to withhold funding, and then to seek additional \nstudies. There have been many studies, and there have been very \nsubstantial delays.\n  I am concerned about the need to provide further protection to \nAmerica's workers on repetitive motions and the other kinds of physical \nactivity encompassed by this ergonomics rule. But I am also concerned \nabout the complexity of the rule which is at issue here.\n  In an effort to try to get additional factors which would bear on the \nquestion of cost and on the question of complexity, I convened a \nhearing which was held this morning--late notice on the hearing, but \nthis matter has just been recently scheduled to be on the floor today.\n  We heard from three witnesses who provided a fair amount of insight \ninto the issue. We heard from Joseph M. Woodward, Esq., Associate \nSolicitor for Occupational Safety and Health at the Department of \nLabor; from Lynn Rhinehart, Esq., Associate General Counsel of the AFL-\nCIO; and Baruch A. Fellner, Esq., a partner at Gibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher--where his practice centers on employment law, with an \nemphasis on occupational safety and health; and he spoke, in essence, \nfor the Chamber of Commerce and the business interests.\n  In the course of this morning's hearing, I think it is fair to say \nthere was generalized agreement on the need for regulation. But, there \nwas total disagreement on the issue of what the cost of this regulation \nwould be and whether the regulation needed to be as complex as it is.\n  Mr. Woodward testified that the OSHA calculation was that the \nregulation would cost $4.5 billion, and there would be benefits of some \n$9.1 billion. Mr. Fellner testified that the cost could range from \nsomewhere around $100 billion to as much as $1 trillion. When I asked \nMr. Fellner what the benefits would be, if any, on the figure advanced \nby Mr. Woodward of $9.1 billion in benefits, contrasted with $4.5 \nbillion in cost, Mr. Fellner said there were no real benefits; and if \nany did exist, they would be subsumed by the enormous amount of cost.\n  In listening to these two witnesses testify, and in focusing on what \nthe role of the Congress is, the Senate is--and my role as a Senator in \ntrying to evaluate congressional review on agency rulemaking--I must \nsay that I did not get a whole lot of guidance from these witnesses, as \nthey testified as to what the cost factor would be.\n  When we got into the issue of the complexity of the rule, again, it \nis a very complicated matter. We focused on a couple of the rules in \nparticular--one, which was set forth on page 68848 of the Federal \nRegister, Volume 65, No. 220, Tuesday, November 14, 2000, specifying a \nrepetition rule:\n       Repeating the same motions every few seconds or repeating a \n     cycle of motions involving the affected body part more than \n     twice per minute for more than 2 consecutive hours in a work \n     day.\n\n  There was considerable debate in the hearing this morning, but, \nagain, not a whole lot of light shed as to what the real import was.\n  Mr. Fellner made a suggestion that there ought to be experts \nconvened--between 6 and 12 on each side--who would debate and discuss \njust exactly what this repetitive motion meant, to have some better \nappraisal and better understanding as to what the impact was on the \nindividual who is subjected to that kind of work.\n  Another rule which we considered at some length involved the force \nissue on the same page:\n\n       Lifting more than 75 pounds at any one time; more than 55 \n     pounds more than 10 times per day; or more than 25 pounds \n     below the knees, above the shoulders, or at arms' length more \n     than 25 times per day.\n\n  The analysis again leaves me somewhat in a quandary as to really the \nimport of the rule or exactly what its impact is and how important that \nis for the well-being of the employee, so that it is not an easy matter \nto make a calculation as to the import of those rules in terms of \nworkers' safety contrasted with what the cost of those rules would be.\n  I was concerned with the information heard this morning. We had an \nextensive informal meeting before going to the formal hearing, when the \npoint was made that there had been no public comment on the specific \nrule which related to the action level, which means the repetitive \nmotion for a period of time, and there had been no public comment on \nthe hazard resolution.\n  All of this, candidly, left me with the conclusion that there was a \nneed for promoting worker safety; but a concern as to whether the \nentire matter ought to be substantially simpler.\n  When we talk about the enormous volume, the regulations themselves \ncover 9 pages only, with 16 pages of factual backup, and then the \nbalance of several hundred pages on analysis and hearings.\n  The representation was made that if an employer is to really \nunderstand the rules to find out what has to be done, that employer is \ngoing to have to read the full text in order to have some real \nunderstanding.\n  An additional concern I have turns on what will the effect be if this \nresolution of disapproval takes effect with respect to any later \nrulemaking. The statute in question, the congressional review of agency \nrulemaking has a provision:\n\n       A rule that does not take effect or does not continue under \n     paragraph 1 may not be reissued in substantially the same \n     form. And a new rule that is substantially the same as such a \n     rule may not be issued unless the new rule is specifically \n     authorized by law enacted after the date of the joint \n     resolution disapproving the original rule.\n\n  From this language, I am concerned that a new rule may be subject to \nbeing invalidated if it is determined to be ``in substantially the same \nform.'' And I am concerned about the mischief that could come from \nvirtually endless litigation, with what whatever any new rule may be, \nif it conflicts with that statutory provision on interpretation that it \nis substantially in the same form.\n  I have conferred on this matter with my colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, who referred me to a joint statement which was made on \nthe enactment of the Congressional Review Act back on April 18, 1996, a \nstatement made by Senators Nickles, Reid, and Stevens, which \nconstitutes the managers' interpretation. On page 3686 of the \nCongressional Record for April 18, 1996, the following language is set \nforth:\n\n       If the law that authorized the disapproved rule provides \n     broad discretion to the issuing agency regarding the \n     substance of such rule, the agency may exercise its broad \n     discretion to issue a substantially different rule.\n\n  Then continuing somewhat later:\n\n       It will be the agency's responsibility in the first \n     instance when promulgating the rule to determine the range of \n     discretion afforded under the original law and whether the \n     law authorizes the agency to issue a substantially different \n     rule. Then, the agency must give effect to the resolution of \n     disapproval.\n\n  The substance of this appears to state that where the agency has \nbroad discretion, the agency can issue a new rule without falling under \nthe prohibition of being substantially the same; that it is the \nagency's determination as to what discretion they have.\n  I contacted the Secretary of Labor, Elaine L. Chao, about this matter \nyesterday and received a letter from her today saying in part:\n\n       Let me assure you that in the event a Joint Resolution of \n     Disapproval becomes law, I intend to pursue a comprehensive \n     approach to ergonomics which may include new rulemaking that \n     addresses the concerns levied against the current standard.\n\n  The key word there, of course is ``may.'' So that it is within the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of Labor and\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nthat, of course, would remain to be seen. The letter does signify, in \naddition to the conversation I had with Secretary Chao, her concern \nabout the entire issue and her determination to take a very close look \nat it, which is some assurance but obviously not totally dispositive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at a caucus discussion earlier today, I \nhad a brief colloquy with my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, which I would like to repeat the essence of now. That \nwent to the issue of whether this legislative prohibition against \nissuing substantially the same rule would be an effective bar or, as \none of the authors and having coauthored the statement of legislative \nintent, a new regulation would pass muster without a likely bar from \nthe limitation of substantiality or substantially the same.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my colleague, I remember when we put in \nthat language in the Congressional Review Act, we did it specifically \nbecause we didn't want to have Congress go to the trouble of \noverturning a regulation and then have the regulatory agency just \nbasically come back and rewrite the same reg. That is the reason we \nincluded that language.\n  I have no doubt, after reading Secretary of Labor Chao's statement, \nthat she is very concerned about ergonomics. She leaves the option open \nto reissuing another rule.\n  There are different ways of combating ergonomics without coming up \nwith a regulation of 835 pages. If she comes up with a different \napproach, it will be more cost effective. It will be more effective. I \nhave great confidence that it will be substantially different than the \nproposal we have before us today.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. So the essence of the Senator's position is that the \nprohibition against reissuing a rule ``substantially in the same form'' \nis not a real impediment to the Secretary of Labor and of the current \nadministration picking up the issue and coming out with a new \nregulation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right. I have great confidence \nthat when she addresses this, whether she uses the rulemaking process \nor uses other tools in the Secretary's office to address work-related \ninjuries, including ergonomics, it will be substantially different than \nthis. I certainly hope and expect that it wouldn't have a new workers \ncompensation, Federal workers compensation system that would be \nsuperior to almost every State's worker comp rules.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his response.\n  I have taken a few moments of the Senate's floor time today, having \nreserved actually some 15 minutes, to express my concerns. I am \ncontinuing to listen to the debate. I have received, as one might \nexpect with a constituency such as mine in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, a great many calls. I am continuing to weigh the issues.\n  I note the presence on the floor of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nwho had an idea about the potential for a 2-year delay, which might be \naccomplished with an amendment to another bill, such as the bankruptcy \nbill. These issues are complicated. Trying to balance the interests of \nthe working men and women of America with the interests of the \nemployers of America, especially small businesses, trying to figure out \nhow to have rules which are fair and just to all sides, is not an easy \nmatter.\n  I have expressed the concerns I have today. I continue to weigh this \nmatter as I listen to the floor debate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                            Secretary of Labor\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \n         Education\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter. It is my understanding that the \n     Senate will soon consider a Joint Resolution of Disapproval \n     pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration's (OSHA) ergonomics standard. As you are \n     aware, the Congressional Review Act of 1996 gives Congress \n     the authority to vitiate this standard and permanently \n     prevent OSHA from promulgating a rule in substantially the \n     same form.\n       Let me assure you that, in the event a Joint Resolution of \n     Disapproval becomes law, I intend to pursue a comprehensive \n     approach to ergonomics, which may include new rulemaking, \n     that addresses the concerns levied against the current \n     standard. This approach will provide employers with \n     achievable measures that protect their employees before \n     injuries occur. Repetitive stress injuries in the workplace \n     are an important problem. I recognize this critical challenge \n     and want you to understand that the safety and health of our \n     nation's workforce will always be a priority during my tenure \n     as Secretary.\n       I look forward to working with you throughout the entire \n     107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao,\n                                               Secretary of Labor.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might reply to my distinguished \ncolleague. Earlier today I listened to him and I think he approached \nthis issue in a very realistic and pragmatic way, particularly with his \nState having so much heavy industrial work in it. I am strongly in \nfavor of the resolution.\n  But I am concerned about the proposition of a 2-year delay. There are \na lot of people--and I will address that--who are actually at this \nmoment suffering a consequence of their repetitive physical action. Do \nwe really think 2 years would give Congress the time necessary to \naddress this problem? I think we can reach an accommodation with our \nnew Secretary of Labor addressing this and quickly get to a more \nrealistic set of regulations to promote worker safety from these \ninjuries.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might respond, I do not think it was \nthe intention to have any delay but only an intention to keep the \ncurrent rule in effect until a new rule could be promulgated or this \nrule might be revised. I would be very interested to work with my \ncolleague from Virginia on an expedited process. One of the suggestions \nI made with the witnesses I had this morning was to have the experts \ncome in to a hearing on my subcommittee and let's have at it. Let's \nhave it out. I would be interested to know what the Senator from \nVirginia thinks might be a timetable for getting a new rule.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that offer. I \naccept it. I am proud to represent the largest shipyard in the world. \nIt has enormous amounts of heavy construction going on daily.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Philadelphia Navy Yard was about to top you until \nsome disaster occurred there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, until I became the Secretary of the Navy, and we \nbegan to bring that down to size.\n  I say to my good friend, I believe the value of this colloquy and \ndelivery of the statements by Senators today is focused on the \nimperative need to stop the current promulgation of these regulations. \nI commend our distinguished colleague from Wyoming and our \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma for taking the lead on this. I \nwill support the resolution. I shall vote unhesitatingly today, \nwhenever the vote is arranged. We have to commit to the workers in \nAmerica that we will go to work with our current Secretary of Labor to \ndo our very best to come up with a realistic, commonsense set of \nregulations. You can count on this Senator for joining in that.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. 6 to \npreclude OSHA from enforcing ergonomics regulations advanced during the \nClinton Administration.\n  This Rule is likely the most far reaching and intrusive regulation \never promulgated by OSHA. Unless Congress acts, employers will be \nforced to sift through over 600 pages of new and complex ergonomics \nstandards.\n  The rule is full of flaws and ambiguities. As currently written, fair \nand just enforcement of these regulations would be near impossible for \nOSHA.\n  By disapproving this most recent OSHA regulation, it does not mean \nthat I discount initiatives to improve conditions for workers.\n  I know from personal experience and Americans know from their \npersonal experience that there are people in some workplaces who may \nsuffer simply because of the repetitive nature of their physical work.\n  Those people watching this debate know there is a problem. I concur \nthat there must be some corrective action to help these workers. I join \nmy colleagues in asking the Secretary of Labor to review this situation \nand\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nwork with Congress to develop a realistic and attainable ergonomics \nregulation. We have this obligation.\n  An ergonomics rule that is based on sound science. OSHA bases its new \nergonomics standards on the assumption that all repetitive motion \ninjuries are a result of work related factors. In fact, outside, non-\nwork related activities often contribute to repetitive motion \ndisorders. The necessary scientific research needed to develop \neffective standards is incomplete.\n  It is in the best interest of business owners to protect their \nemployees and maintain a safe and healthy work environment.\n  Mr. President, while I believe the government has a valid role in \nprotecting American workers, this rule is too large, assumes \nunrealistic thresholds, and will in the long run hurt American \nbusinesses and their workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. While the Senator is on the floor, I want to inquire \nwhether he, or perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma, or Senator Enzi, who \nhas done such an outstanding job working in the subcommittee, would \nhave any suggested timetable to which we might look on a new rule.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that would be very helpful if we could have a \nthought from the managers of this.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to comment on that because I am the \nsubcommittee chairman for employment, safety, and training. I have held \nsome of the hearings and have said repeatedly--particularly this \nmorning--that something needs to be done on ergonomics. I am willing to \nwork on it.\n  I mentioned that one of the highlights of mine last week was an award \nI received from the Service Employees International Union. I think that \nis the largest division of the AFL-CIO. The reason I got that award is \nthat I worked with Senator Kennedy on a needle-stick bill. Employees of \nthis country were injured by accidentally being stabbed by needles, and \njanitors when emptying trash were stabbed. The worst part isn't the \nfact that they got stabbed but all of the time it takes before they \nunderstand whether they are really infected or not.\n  We got together and did a reasonable bill that provided some \nincentives for people to do that--a different way of doing \nrecordkeeping and it passed by unanimous consent through both bodies. \nIn a very short period of time, we were able to do that.\n  In light of your question about some kind of a mechanism here for \npostponing this rule for 2 years, the option is, under the CRA, of \neliminating it now or staying with it. It is an up- or-down vote on \nthat proposition, not an amendable motion. It is impossible to say we \nwill put that in place.\n  I recommend that you do not keep the present one in place because \nsome people say it is not a perfect fit and we ought to trim it back. \nIf you have a tree that is rotten to the core, you don't try to prune \nit; you chop it down and you plant a new one. If you have a house built \non a bad foundation--and that is what the testimony shows--you don't \ntry to build the top part of the house up again; you start at the \nbasement. I think it can be done in a relatively short period of time \nbecause there has been all of this collection of information and there \nare people out there who are hurting.\n  I have said a lot of times if we actually talk to the people who have \nthe problem, we can get a solution. We are always talking to the \nexperts who talk to the people who have a problem. Somehow they seem to \ncomplicate those problems considerably. We haven't put in place--well, \nwe have put in place incentives for the employers already. It was \nmentioned in the Senator's hearing that some of the people had a net \ngain by doing these things. Of course, I don't know of a businessman in \nthis country who, if he couldn't get a net gain out of doing something \ngood, would not do it. So already in this country people are bringing \ndown the number of accidents. They are doing it because it is the right \nthing to do.\n  So we have a lot of support from the business community to come up \nwith the right way to do it. As I pledged this morning, I will be happy \nto work with everybody on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, everybody who deals with appropriations--you carry a big \nstick in dealing with appropriations--to come up with a solution for \nthis. We have to do it the right way.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, that is the \nbasis on which I am committed to him to do this. I am very encouraged \nby what you have advised. It is eminently fair. That type of attitude \nis one that can succeed in this Chamber and will help get through a \npiece of legislation which I think is needed now. We should not \npostpone its consideration, I think, for 2 years.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield, I think it might be useful, \nif possible, to have a suggested timetable to carry to the Secretary of \nLabor to try to have a target date to get this done.\n  Mr. ENZI. While I think it is an excellent idea to have a target \ndate, there are a lot of staff who are very competent on this who ought \nto be involved in putting something together so we have a work plan, \nand there is need for basic time for Senator Kennedy and me and other \npeople to spend some time talking. I don't think that putting a date on \nit in the pressure of a debate that is time limited is a good idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our agreement is to go back and forth. I \nwould like to be able to respond without my colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts losing his right to speak--to be able to respond to the \nquestions from the Senator from Pennsylvania. Would I be permitted to \nspeak for 4 minutes on this subject matter and then ask unanimous \nconsent that my colleague may speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Virginia is here \nand the junior Senator from Massachusetts, let me point out what a \nlogical response would be to the Senator from Virginia. All we have to \nhave is the President of the United States file in the Federal Register \nnow an objection to this particular rule and in 60 days this rule is \neffectively suspended.\n  There would be the opportunity then, if the Secretary of Labor \nworking with the chairman of the committee had particular objections, \nthat they would be able to make those recommendations; it would be in \norder. That is not what is being asked here in the Senate. We are being \nasked to give the death knell to this whole proposal. Under the CRA, \nthey cannot come back with a substantial equivalent rule.\n  It is fair to ask what the history has been with regard to \nergonomics. The fact is, since 1994 and 1995, there has been wholesale \nopposition to any ergonomics rules, under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. If you can demonstrate to me a single example where, \nat the Federal level or the State level, there has been any kind of \nsupport for those particular proposals from the business community that \nis leading the charge against it, your comments would make some sense. \nBut it doesn't happen to be that way, and you can't show it. I won't \ntake the time now away from the Senator from Massachusetts, but later I \nwill take the time to go over what the history has been in opposition \nto this particular rule. It is right there, going back since Elizabeth \nDole said there was a problem--day in and day out, battle after battle.\n  My good friend from Wyoming said California has a 1-page ergonomics \nstandard, and the industry opposed that one. The Senator from Wyoming \ncan't give us a single example of an ergonomics standard that has been \nsupported--not one. And to think we are going to lead the American \npeople on the basis of that exchange, that all we have to do is knock \nthis down and in a very short period of time we will have some \nopportunity to consider a good, effective program that is going to \nprotect the millions of Americans who tonight are at risk is asking too \nmuch of logic and understanding, I believe, from the American people. \nIt ``ain't'' going to happen.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have a new President, a new Secretary \nof Labor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then why not give it a chance? Where is this \nbipartisanship? We are trying to work out education,\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nbipartisanship on a Patients' Bill of Rights; but suddenly, 2 days \nlater, we read in the newspaper that this is the death knell for this \nparticular rule. Why not go back and say let's work that out? Why not \nwithhold this particular resolution, give us, say, 60 days, 90 days, a \nchance to work it out, and then, if we can't, go ahead with the \nresolution?\n  You haven't even given the opportunity or the respect or the courtesy \nto those who support that proposal to try to even work this out. And it \nis putting at serious risk the well-being, the health, and safety of \nworkers. Why not try it? OK, let's work out the minimum wage, work out \na Patients' Bill of Rights. You can work out everything, but protecting \nAmerican workers, that is the question we ask. Why not withhold this \nand give us 90 days to try to work that out? We will accept that \nchallenge.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that this not be on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We point out that the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, \nwho spent so much of his career over the last year or so on this \nsubject, clearly says it is like a house: We have to take it down to \nits very foundation and build it back up again. We have committed on \nthe floor to do just this, if I understand my colleague from Wyoming. \nAm I correct in that?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The reason we can't \nwait 60 or 90 days is that the CRA is time limited. Sixty working days \nfrom the time the thing was published is how long we have to reverse \nthis rule. So we are put under the rule that was passed by everybody in \nthis Chamber--not me, I wasn't here at the time, but everybody voted to \ndo it that way, so that we would have the right to jerk agencies back \nthat didn't listen.\n  They did not listen to anything said in the committee hearing that I \nheld, that the Senator attended. Without cooperation, with that club of \nthe President over his head, it was easy to see they didn't need to \nconcede any points. That is not cooperation. That is not civility. We \ncan get together and work on these things but not when one side thinks \nthey hold all of the ammunition.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if Senators wanted to have good-faith \nbargaining, we are glad to do it. We are glad to do it.\n  These recommendations represent the best in terms of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and the other scientific organizations that have \nknowledge and understanding. This is special interest legislation. This \nis a political payoff. Make no mistake about it.\n  The business community has the same groups opposing this tonight on \nthe floor of the Senate that have been opposing it since 1994--the \nNational Coalition of Ergonomics, Industry Front--organized to oppose \nergonomics standards with a war chest of $600,000.\n  In March 1995, business groups tried to stop OSHA from developing a \nproposed rule for ergonomics standards; in 1995 again, National \nCoalition on Ergonomics opposed OSHA.\n  Please give an example of what you are for, Senator. Give us an \nexample of what you are for.\n  It is silent over there. You haven't got an example of it. That is a \nreflection of the bankruptcy in their argument. They haven't had any \nexamples of what they are for. Give us an example of what State has \nvoluntary programs you would accept. Give us an example of an American \nbusiness. We have examples of programs in ergonomics. We have not heard \none statement of support for any one of them since this morning at 10 \no'clock, and you will not hear it when the time comes to vote because \nthey are not for it.\n  I take 15 more seconds to commend and thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Wyoming for his generous references--I think they were generous \nreferences--for our work on the needle-stick legislation. I pay tribute \nto him because he was the leader, in the Senate on that particular \nissue, and I welcome the chance to work with him.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for the force of \nhis arguments which underscore the bankruptcy of the position of those \nwho are in opposition.\n  I listened to my colleague from Wyoming a moment ago, and he \nsuggested we have to do this because of the CRA. If my colleagues are \nserious about improving the ergonomics rule, they have a number of \ndifferent options available to them. They could have a review and \nrevision of the regulation if they wanted to. They could call on the \nadministration to grant a stay against the regulation while further \nwork is done to assess their concerns. They could petition the agency \nto modify or repeal the ergonomics standard and the Department of Labor \ncould initiate a rulemaking procedure to modify the rule.\n  None of those things are being engaged in here. We have all heard of \ncrocodile tears. What we are hearing are crocodile promises about a \nwillingness to come back and revisit this issue when it has been \nvisited for 10 years. At every step along the way the record is \nabsolutely replete with examples of how they have stood in opposition \nto any kind of rule. So when we hear them talk on the floor of the \nSenate today that they are prepared to come back with some kind of a \nrule, it is directly contrary to every part of the record of past \nyears.\n  In March of 1995, the House passed a 1995 rescission bill prohibiting \nOSHA from developing or promulgating any proposed rule on ergonomics. \nIndustry members of the Coalition on Ergonomics lobbied heavily for \nthat measure.\n  In August of 1995, again, following intense industry lobbying, the \nHouse passed an appropriations bill prohibiting OSHA from issuing or \ndeveloping any standard on ergonomics. They had ample opportunity in \n1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and even now to come up with some \nnotion of what they are willing to accept.\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out--silence, absolutely \nno offer whatsoever. There is no need to move in the way they are \nmoving now except, I suppose, that it is entirely in keeping with their \napproach to labor over the course of the last weeks.\n  President Bush has been in office for 7 weeks. Already he has had a \npretty profound impact on the lives of workers in this country. On \nFebruary 17, he signed four antiworker Executive orders that would, \namong other things, repeal project labor agreements which are employed \nat the discretion of States, repealing those so that contractors would \nnot be required under any circumstances in many federally financed \nprojects to be unionized--a blatant, fundamental assault on union \nlabor.\n  He also dissolved the National Partnership Council which sought to \nget government agencies and unions to resolve their differences. Not a \nbad way to try to resolve the differences. That was a program we \nthought was working and offered a capacity to reduce the tensions. But, \nno, that is eliminated--revoked job protections for employees of \ncontractors at Federal buildings when the project is awarded to another \ncontractor. And now we are on the cusp of overturning yet another \ncritical worker protection that would help alleviate suffering for \nhundreds of thousands of people.\n  I believe this is an assault on the fundamental rights of workers, \nand their fundamental right is obviously to have a safe workplace.\n  Twenty-one thousand people in Massachusetts were injured last year as \na consequence of repetitious work motions or severe overstress as a \nconsequence of the kind of work and movement they have in their work. \nIt seems to me we are owed at least a good-faith offer of some outline \nin which our colleagues would feel this might be acceptable. What do we \nhear? We hear them say this law is too complicated.\n\n  Too complicated? The rule is about as simple as a rule could be. The \nemployer has enormous leverage in this rule. The employer gets to \ndecide whether or not a complaint by a worker is job related. The \nemployer makes that decision. How complicated is it to empower a worker \nto come to the employer in a specific amount of time, draw to their \nattention the signs and symptoms of an ergonomic injury, the \nresponsibility of reporting it, the employer has absolutely no further \nresponsibility under the rule unless the employee reports that \nergonomic injury and that injury lasts for 7 days after being reported.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n  If the employer then determined it was work related and they were \nexposed to a serious hazard, they craft an appropriate remedy.\n  That is precisely what our colleague from Wyoming just said he \nthought any employer in the United States would do. He just said if \nsomebody sees a worker is hurt or if somebody saw they were going to \nreduce their own costs and expenses as a result of reducing their \nemployees' exposure to danger, they would do it. That is literally what \nthis very simple law asks them to do. Instead, we are going to go on \nwith a situation where they could continue to delay and leave countless \nworkers in the United States exposed to danger with a cost of injuries \nat about $17 billion annually and a total cost to the economy of over \n$50 billion when we measure it by the compensation costs, the workers' \nmedical expenses, lost wages, and lost productivity.\n\n  We all understand what ergonomics are. We understand it is a fancy \nname for what happens to people who do certain kinds of jobs in our \ncountry that require multiple repetition of movement. We understand you \ncan avoid these risks.\n  On January 18 of this year, the National Academy of Sciences and the \nInstitute of Medicine released a report talking about these disorders. \nIt talked about the scientific evidence that documents what these kinds \nof injuries do. They also pointed out the extraordinary cost to our \neconomy.\n  One would think most of the businesses in the country would welcome \nan opportunity for a worker to simply walk up to them, explain that \nthey believe a particular injury they have is related to the work they \nare doing, that it has lasted for longer than 7 days, make an \nevaluation about it, and then determine what they are going to do. That \nis all this law requires. It is not complicated.\n  They have also compiled a report entitled ``Work Related \nMusculoskeletal Disorders'' which summarized 6,000 scientific studies \non ergonomics-related injuries, and it concluded that the current state \nof science shows that the people who are exposed to ergonomic hazards \nhave a higher level of pain, injury, and disability; that there is a \nbiological basis for these injuries, and that there exist today \ninterventions that can protect against those injuries.\n  There have been 10 years of effort to try to come to the point of \nconclusion with respect to those kinds of injuries. Yet we are finding \nthe resolution is not a bipartisan effort to try to pull people \ntogether and agree. It is not a bona fide effort to try to resolve the \ndifferences that may or may not exist. It is an effort to go ahead and \nliterally kill the capacity of the agency to issue this or to revisit \nit.\n  I would like to share very quickly a couple of stories of real people \nin my State. At the Cape Cod Hospital, Beth Piknick was a registered \nnurse with a 21-year career as an intensive care unit nurse. That \ncareer was cut short because of a preventable back injury that came \nfrom the responsibilities she was carrying out. The injury required \nmajor surgery, a spinal fusion, and 2 years of major rehabilitation \nbefore and after injury. That injury was devastating to Ms. Piknick, \nboth professionally and personally.\n  Prior to her injury, she had led an extraordinarily active life. She \nenjoyed competitive racquetball, water skiing, and whitewater rafting, \nbut, most importantly, she wanted to do her work and loved her work as \nan ICU nurse. That had been her career since 1971. The loss of ability \nto take care of patients led to clinical depression which lasted 4\\1/2\\ \nyears. She now administers TB tests to employees at the hospital, and \nher ability to take care of patients, the very reason she became a \nnurse, is gone.\n  Her injury could have been prevented. So can the crippling injuries \nsuffered by hundreds of thousands of other workers every year.\n  Another example--this story actually comes from Business Week, \nDecember 4, 2000. I quote from Business Week:\n\n       Sheree Lolos will never forget the night 5 years ago when \n     her arms went numb. She had spent her 8-hour shift as \n     usual, pouring a total of 12,000 pounds of plastic scrap \n     onto a conveyor belt at a windshield factory in \n     Springfield, MA. That night her arms tingled and burned. \n     The next day she and her supervisors shrugged off the \n     injury as temporary and she continued to work in coming \n     months--until she could work no more.\n\n  This was not somebody looking for an excuse or a way out. She worked \nuntil she could work no more.\n\n       Doctors later told her that lifting and pouring for up to \n     60 hours a week, week after week, had damaged the nerves in \n     her arms. So, today, at 44, Ms. Lolos says she can't even \n     wash her hair without pain. ``I cry in the shower because I \n     can't keep my hands over my head to wash out the soap.''\n\n  That injury also was avoidable. That injury at least ought to \nproperly be reportable to an employer, for the employer to make a \njudgment about whether or not there is a relationship, a judgment that \ncould very easily be made by a caring employer by simply listening to \nthe employee, contacting the doctors, and making a legitimate attempt \nto determine whether or not there is a cause and effect between the \ninjury the doctor has determined and that person's work.\n  What you have here is a message being sent that these kinds of \ninjuries and the lives of these workers and their ability to get \nredress are not as important as the interests that are being served on \nthe Senate floor in trying to defeat this effort.\n  An awful lot of businesses and trade associations have already \nimplemented these kinds of programs, and they have seen productivity \nrise as fewer hours on the job are lost. When businesses ensure that \ntheir workplaces are safe and they protect workers from these types of \ninjuries, the productivity across the board rises. When workers are \nhealthy, employers lose far fewer hours in their jobs. Programs \nimplemented by individual employers reduce the total job-related \ninjuries and illnesses by an average of 45 percent and lost work-time \ninjuries and illnesses by an average of 75 percent.\n  These numbers mean something because they indicate results and they \nprove that making the workplace safe is crucial not only to increasing \nworker safety but also to increasing the capacity of a business to \nflourish.\n  I would like to give another example of that. A company in western \nMassachusetts that makes most of the paper we use to print the American \ndollar, Crane and Company, located in Dalton, MA, signed an agreement \nwith OSHA to establish comprehensive ergonomics programs at each of \ntheir plants. According to the company's own report, within 3 years of \nstarting this program, the company's musculoskeletal injury rate was \nalmost cut in half.\n  Lund Silversmiths, a flatware manufacturer in Greenfield, MA, was \ntroubled by very high workers compensation costs. One OSHA log revealed \nthat back injuries were the No. 1 problem in three departments. By \nimplementing basic ergonomic controls, lost workdays dropped from more \nthan 300 in 1992 to 72 in 1997, and total workers compensation costs \nfor the company dropped from $192,500 in 1992 to $27,000 in 1997.\n  So all this talk about workers compensation costs or the cost to \nbusiness going up simply does not stand up against the measured \nexamination of what has happened in those companies that have seen fit \nto try to raise their standards and respect the injuries that are done \nto workers through certain kinds of work.\n  The changes envisioned by the law we are voting on actually increase \nproductivity. It saves businesses money and makes more money for our \neconomy overall. This standard is a win-win for workers and for \nmanagement. The fact is, it is almost common sense, if you examine the \nexperience of most of those companies that have engaged in a reasonable \napproach to it.\n  I have heard some complaint on the floor by some people who try to \nsuggest this supersedes workers compensation laws. The fact is, the \nprovisions of this standard are not compensation, they are assurances \nthat workers are not going to face financial disincentives to report \nmuscular disorders. Work restriction protection, in stark contrast to \nworkers compensation, is only a preventive health program, and the \ncriteria for restrictions under the ergonomic standard have no \nrelationship to the criteria for compensation, nor do they have any \nbearing on whether an injury or an illness is compensable.\n  OSHA has been including work restriction protection in its health \nstandards for more than 20 years, and we know, as others have pointed \nout, the attorneys general of some 17 States--\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nArkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, \nKentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, New \nYork, Oklahoma, Washington, and Wisconsin--have all filed comments with \nOSHA stating that worker restriction protection provisions of the \nergonomics standard would not affect or supersede the workers \ncompensation laws in their States.\n  To the best of my knowledge, there is no attorney general on record \nsaying that it will.\n  The ergonomics regulation is not a new phenomenon. And it is not \nsomehow the latest fad that represents some effort to try to enlarge \nrights beyond what they ought to be in the workplace.\n  Ten years ago, as we have heard, under a Republican President, \nSecretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole committed the Department of Labor to \nbegin working on this standard. That was in response to a growing body \nof evidence at that point in time which showed that these repetitive \nstress disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, were the fastest \ncategory of growth in occupational illnesses. Ten years now, and all of \nthe records show countless numbers of efforts to prevent a legitimate \ninitiative to make progress on this issue with any kind of alternative, \nany acceptable language, anything that suggests legitimacy in an effort \nto work out a compromise.\n  So many of us are, indeed, extraordinarily skeptical when we hear in \nthe Chamber today that somehow what has not taken place for 10 years, \nwhat has been shown to be exactly the opposite of what is promised, \nwhich is an outright effort to kill any kind of standard whatsoever, is \nsuddenly now going to be replaced by some act of good faith.\n  I repeat, if there was a legitimate effort to try to avoid the sort \nof draconian measure of the Congressional Review Act, which is an all-\nor-nothing, or an up-or-down vote, with this limited amount of debate, \nwe could have done something else. If we were serious about improving \nthe ergonomics rule, we could have simply taken action to review and \nsomehow revise the regulation in a reasonable way. We could see the \nadministration say we are not going to ask for this draconian effort on \nthe floor. Why don't we have a stay? Or, as my colleague from \nMassachusetts pointed out, we could have, I think, a 60-day period \nbefore the implementation by merely putting a protest in place.\n\n  There are any number of ways in which we could approach this \nquestion. We could petition the agency itself to modify or repeal the \nstandard.\n  But, once again, there has been no showing whatsoever about why the \nsimple standard of a worker going to an employer and suggesting that \nthe particular illness or problem they have is work related should not \ninitiate from this benevolent employer that the Senator from Wyoming is \nreferring to, a legitimate effort to find out whether what they asked \nthat employee to do in that plant is somehow causing them injury. If it \nis causing them injury, as they ought to be able to determine by a fair \nanalysis from medical reports as well as an analysis of the work \nitself, they could make the determination to do what they think is \nappropriate.\n  There is no order to them of what to do. There is no mandate from \nWashington. There is no requirement of the long arm of government \ntelling them with specificity what their options are. There is just a \nlegitimate, commonsense, decent approach to the problems of a worker in \na workplace that, as my colleague from Wyoming said, any decent \nemployer ought to engage in.\n  What is happening here is an effort to deny decency to tens of \nthousands in Massachusetts, 600,000 on a national basis--maybe a \nmillion workers--who suffer annually. We could avoid that if we were to \nvote properly on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana 7 \nminutes, and then I ask unanimous consent to recognize the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Voinovich, for 7 minutes following Senator Breaux's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me some \ntime.\n  I rise as one who is going to support the resolution of disapproval \nbut at the same time also speak to the fact that I think there are \nproblems in the workplace that justifiably call for us to be involved \nin crafting solutions which would reduce or even eliminate those \nproblems.\n  I am impressed by the study of the National Academy of Sciences \nwhich, incidentally, came after some final regulations were already \npromulgated, which point out that it is a problem that affects as many \nas 1 million people a year losing time and costing as much as $50 \nbillion annually in lost productivity.\n  Yes, there is a problem out there. Yes, there should be something we \ncan do to address it. I suggest that while there is something we could \ndo, this is not the right approach. It is the reason why I am going to \nsupport the resolution of disapproval.\n  My colleague mentioned that this rule is very simple and easy to \nunderstand. I would suggest that is not correct.\n  I was reading it. It is always dangerous when you actually read these \nregulations. I read the regulations, and I got to one part where it \nsaid, ``Industries and jobs this standard does not cover.'' That will \nbe interesting. Let me read that. It says, ``Industries and jobs this \nstandard does not cover. Agricultural employment and operation.''\n\n  I said: My goodness, we are exempting agriculture from the \nregulations.\n  I went to another section, and it said, ``Industries and jobs this \nstandard covers.'' Lo and behold, it covers agricultural services, soil \npreparation, and crop services, including crop planting, cultivating, \nand protecting the crops. It also improves crop harvests. Those things \nsound an awful lot like agricultural practices to me. Yet in the other \npanel it says, agricultural employment and operations are not covered. \nBut everything you have to do to plant crops and harvest them and \nprotect them is, in fact, covered.\n  I went down and read some more. It says, ``Maritime employment and \noperations are not covered.''\n  Then I looked over to the other column. It said, ``Boat building and \nrepair is covered.'' That is sort of a maritime type of industry if \nthere ever was one.\n  So I read it again. It said, ``Maritime employment and operations are \nnot covered.'' Commercial fishing in the other column is covered. That \nis sort of a maritime endeavor when you are commercially fishing in the \nocean.\n  I get confused when it says shipbuilding and repair is not covered \nbut, on the other hand, boat building and repair is covered. If it is a \nship, you are not covered, but a boat is covered.\n  If you are an agricultural worker, you are not covered. But if you \nare engaged in crop harvesting, planting, and protecting a crop, then \nyou are covered.\n  By any measure, I think this is not clear. It is not simple; it is \nvery confusing.\n  More than that, I am concerned about an administrative procedure or \nprocess where we can do by administrative decision what legislators who \nare called upon to legislate cannot do to see how what we do affects \npeople because I think it clearly affects a State's workers \ncompensation laws. I am very concerned about that.\n  If you go to the back of the rules that we are looking at, it very \nclearly says something I think is understandable. It says, ``Work \nrestrictions protection: Employers must . . .''--not may, not can, not \nshould but ``employers must provide work restrictions protection to \nemployees who receive temporary work restrictions.''\n  This means maintaining 100 percent of earnings and full benefits for \nemployees who receive limitations on their work activities in their \ncurrent jobs or transferred to a temporary alternative duty job, and 90 \npercent of the earnings and full benefits to employees who are removed \nfrom work. That is good for 90 days or less, whichever comes first.\n  That tells me they may not replace your State workers compensation \nrules, which, in my State and most States, provide about two-thirds \ncompensation for injuries in the workplace, which I strongly support, \nbut it certainly is in addition to it. It is a supplement. It is more \nthan the workers compensation laws provide. You have the workers \ncompensation laws taking\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\ncare of certain types of problems in the workplace. Then you have an \nentirely new program that States are going to have to implement. And \nwho is going to pay for it? Is the State going to be required to put up \ntheir share for the new program? Do the States have the money to do \nthat? How much is it going to cost Louisiana, which is struggling to \nfind enough money to participate in the Federal Medicaid \nprogram, because we did not have enough State funds to meet or match \nthis? They look at an unfunded mandate, an additional supplemental \nbenefits package that we have not enacted in Congress but that has been \nallowed to go forward because of an administrative rule process which I \nthink is the wrong way to do it.\n\n  I differ from some who say, we don't want to do anything. I think we \nshould do something to address these rules. I will be addressing \nlegislation tomorrow in a bipartisan fashion which will say that, \nnotwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Department of Labor \nmay issue a new rule relating to ergonomics, so long as there are \naffirmative requirements and the new rule does three things: First, \nthat it is directly related to injuries that occur in the workplace. \nThat is what we are trying to effect.\n  I do not want someone who is injured in a water-skiing accident on \nSunday to go to work on Monday and complain that the back problem was \ngenerated in the workplace. If it was in the workplace, fine, but if it \nwas from something outside the workplace, and not directly related to \nthe injury, I question whether it should be part of the process.\n  The second requirement of the legislation will be that the agency \nresponsible for enforcing this new rule must have some type of \nmechanism to certify when an employer is in compliance. Right now, one \nof the big concerns is that employers do not know whether they come \nunder the rules or not. There should be some mechanism to ensure that \nwhen they are in compliance, they can get certified by the appropriate \nagency that they have met the standards and should not be subjected to \nany other action because they have been certified as being in \ncompliance.\n  The final thing it does is it says simply that in issuing a new rule, \nthe Department of Labor shall ensure that nothing in the rule expands \nthe application of State worker compensation laws. This goes back to \nthe question of putting in new provisions, new monetary provisions, for \nworkers without having the Congress take an action in that regard.\n  This is a new supplemental workers comp program that this rule \nestablishes. I do not think we ought to do that without an act of \nCongress. We can argue whether it should be done or not.\n  I think this legislation really answers the question of whether we do \nall of this or whether we don't do anything. I am suggesting we do \nsomething that makes sense. I think the way to get to this legislation \nis to pass the resolution of disapproval of what I think has been a \nrule that has been brought to this body but without the proper \nattention to detail that I think is so important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux, for his \nanalysis, and also for his well-thought-out position. Also, I thank \nSenator Dorgan for his cooperation in scheduling the speeches.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Ohio as much time as he desires--7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis consideration.\n  I might say that my remarks were not done in conjunction with Senator \nBreaux from Louisiana, but they are similar to the points he made \ntoday.\n  On November 14 of last year, OSHA published one of the broadest, most \nfar-reaching regulations ever put forth by that agency. OSHA and other \nsupporters of the ergonomics regulation have indicated that \nimplementing this regulation is necessary to protect the health and \nwell-being of the men and women of our Nation's workforce. This would \nbe accomplished by establishing procedures designed to lessen the \nincidence of repetitive-motion injuries and other musculoskeletal \ndisorders, or MSD's, in the workplace.\n  In my view, OSHA's efforts to safeguard the workplace against these \nkinds of injuries ultimately will prove more harmful than helpful to \nhard-working men and women throughout the Nation. In addition, this new \nrule could actually have the unintended consequence of hurting the \npeople it is designed to help.\n  When one takes a closer look at how the regulation was developed last \nyear, and at the provisions of the regulation itself, it is not \nsurprising to see that the Senate is poised to vote to disapprove this \nregulation.\n  To be sure, OSHA has never finalized a rule of this magnitude in just \n1 year's time. This final regulation is over 600 pages in length, and \nits impact covers more than 100 million employees and 6.1 million \nbusinesses in the United States. Even prior to its final publication, \nmany employers had complained to me and to OSHA about the draft \nregulation's excessive length, confusing language, and potentially \nonerous mandates.\n  Despite having generated more public comments than any prior OSHA \nrule in history, the Clinton administration's OSHA appointees rushed \nthrough the rulemaking process. There has been some speculation that \nthese appointees believed that quick action was the only choice they \nhad to get the rule finalized.\n  These individuals at OSHA even managed to thwart the will of \nCongress, which approved an amendment last year delaying implementation \nof the regulation for 1 year. This ``in-your-face\" attitude was \ndeliberately confrontational. It was as if the previous administration \nsaid: We don't care what Congress wants, we are going to do what we \nwant anyhow, and that's the way it goes. In their undertakings, they \nignored legitimate concerns voiced by Members of Congress and the \nbusiness community and ram-rodded this controversial, burdensome and \nexceedingly costly regulation.\n  On the subject of cost--I think this is an important issue--we have \nno real ``hands-on'' figure. OSHA estimates the cost complying with the \nregulation will be $4.5 billion annually. The U.S. Small Business \nAdministration--not the NFIB or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but the \nFederal Small Business Administration--has estimated the true cost of \nthe regulation could be about $60 billion per year. And other analyses \nputs the figure as high as $100 billion annually.\n  Why has this rule caused so much controversy? Well, under this new \nrule, an employer would be required to implement a full-fledged \nergonomics program if an employee were to report a symptom--a symptom--\nof an musculoskeletal disorder, as long as the symptom is aggravated, \nbut not necessarily caused by workplace tasks.\n  In other words, if an employee comes to work with a sore neck from \nplaying sports over the weekend, and his or her work ``aggravates'' the \nsymptom, then an employer would have to develop a whole ergonomics \nprogram.\n  This could require employers to change an employee's workstation, \nchange his or her equipment, shorten shifts, hire additional employees, \nor alter work practices. So, the employer is responsible for all of \nthese changes and their costs even if the symptom is caused by factors \nor activities that exist outside of the workplace.\n  But there is more. In responding to a symptom of a muskuloskeletal \ndisorder, the employer must pay for visits to up to three separate \nhealth care professionals by the employee complaining of the symptom. \nHowever, the rule prohibits the diagnosis from including any \ninformation about the condition that may have been caused by factors or \nactivities outside the workplace.\n  In fact, an employer can't even inquire about an employee's outside \nrisk factors. That is absolutely incredible.\n  I am especially concerned about the regulation undermining a State \nworkers' compensation systems, which is prohibited under the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act. For instance, if a condition is \ndetermined to be work-related, the employer must provide full\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\nbenefits and 100 percent of an employees pay for up to three months \nwhile he or she is in a light-duty job, or 90 percent of pay and full \nbenefits while not working. This is known as the regulation's Work \nRestriction Protection provision. This provision completely overrides \nthe state's right to make its own determinations about what constitutes \na ``work-related'' injury and what level of compensation injured \nworkers should receive. What's more, it establishes a federally-\nmandated workers' compensation system for ergonomics only.\n  Ergonomics remains an uncertain science. While a recently completed \nNational Academy of Science study reveals that musculoskeletal \ndisorders are a problem in the workplace, much remains to be learned \nabout the causation and potential remedies associated with repetitive-\nmotion injuries. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences' study \nindicated that a number of non-work related ``psychosocial'' \nconditions, including stress, anxiety, and depression, could cause \nthese conditions.\n  The tendency I see in Congress and in Washington is the belief that \nno one but Washington cares about the citizens of this Nation--not the \nlocal governments, not the State governments, and most definitely not \nthe businesses. I think that is insulting.\n  It is ludicrous to think that State and local governments do not \ncare, and any employer worth his or her salt is going to go out of \ntheir way to create the best working conditions for their employees. \nThese individuals will do whatever possible to cut down the costs \nassociated with work-related injuries and absenteeism.\n  As Senator Kerry from Massachusetts said, many businesses have gone \nforward with ergonomics programs. They know it is good for their \nemployees, and they know it is good for the bottom line.\n  In fact, prior to the regulation's publication, many employers had \nvoluntarily implemented workplace ergonomics programs. These programs \nare having an effect; OSHA itself has reported a 22 percent decrease in \nergonomics injuries in the last five years. But what supporters of this \nregulation are saying is, even though more and more businesses are \nrealizing that ergonomics is a good thing to do, we need to mandate a \n``heavy-handed'' set of rules on the entire Nation and not think about \nthe consequences of these actions. In my view, if they had, they would \nnot have rushed through a regulation that will admittedly cost billion \nand billions of dollars to implement.\n  Instead, Congress and the administration need to take a more careful \nand balanced consideration of ergonomics in the workplace. We should be \nworking with all parties--American businesses, labor, and State and \nlocal governments--to develop a workable ergonomics standard that \nconsiders all costs and benefits and protects the health and welfare of \nthe American workforce. I believe such an approach would be the most \neffective solution to the situation that Congress is faced with today.\n  Passage of the resolution before the Senate will give us the \nopportunity to proceed with a clean slate instead of letting-stand a \nregulation that is burdensome, confusing and unsound.\n  I'm confident that, working with our new Labor Secretary, Elaine \nChao, with the Bush administration, with my Congressional colleagues \nand other interested parties, we can come up with a better way to \napproach this issue.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution \nbefore us related to ergonomics.\n  First, about the word ``ergonomics.'' It sounds like a course that \none intentionally skipped in high school, but it is much more serious. \nIt relates to a worker's injury on the job, a worker's injury that, \nunfortunately, affects in America every year a million people who take \ntime away from work to treat and recover from these work-related \nergonomic injuries.\n  I come to this debate perhaps in a little different position than \nsome of my colleagues because I come to it with some work experience in \nmy life that has familiarized me with this problem as well as \nexperience as an attorney representing people who have been injured on \nthe job. When I was a college student, I worked in a slaughterhouse in \nEast St. Louis, IL, Hunter Packing Company. It was a great job for a \ncollege student because it paid pretty well, but it was a tough job. It \nwas dirty. The hours were long. I went to it every day realizing I was \nsaving enough money to get through school.\n  In the 12 months that I worked in that slaughterhouse, I came to \nunderstand what it means to work on an assembly line. It was a hog \nproduction facility. The hogs that were brought forward for slaughter \nand processing were on a chain. The union I belonged to, the Meat \nCutters and Butcher Workers, had negotiated a contract with the packing \ncompany. The contract said that 1 hour's work equals 240 hogs. During \nthe course of a day of 8 hours, we were expected to process 1,920 hogs. \nOf course, if we could speed up the line, we might get off work in 6 \nhours. Every day we tested ourselves, or someone did, to see how fast \nwe could process those hogs to go home.\n  The line would break down. We never quite knew what would happen. Day \nafter day I would stand there on this line and watch these animal \ncarcasses come flying by as I did a routine job on every single one of \nthem. I was one of many employees in that facility.\n  I came to respect a hard day's work, the men and women who got up \nevery day and did this. I also came to respect the danger of that job. \nSome of the dangers were obvious. On that line one day a man I was \nstanding next to passed out and was taken away; he died of a heart \nattack. Other people cut themselves with knives. Others suffered back \ninjuries, neck injuries, and injuries to their hands. I would see this \nevery single day. I came to appreciate a little more than some that \nworking for a living in America can be dangerous unless there are \npeople to protect you. In this case the protection came from a labor \nunion doing its best to make the workplace safe.\n  It also came from Congress and the State legislatures that were \nresponsible for a safe workplace. I came to appreciate that \nresponsibility when I was elected to Congress in 1982 and to realize \nthat I have a burden and a challenge, as a Congressman and a Senator, \nto make certain that the laws we pass are consistent with maintaining \nthe safety of the workplaces across America.\n  My second experience, as an attorney in Illinois, was on workers \ncompensation claims. I have listened to some of the statements made on \nthe floor of the Senate today. I have to shake my head. Some of the \npeople who are arguing against this bill have literally never tried a \nworkers compensation case. For instance, there have been arguments made \nthat under this ergonomics rule, it is not necessary that one is \ninjured in the workplace to recover.\n  Time out. One of the first premises, when you go to a workers \ncompensation case for someone injured on the job, is whether or not you \nwere an employee. That is the first question. The second question is \nwhether or not your injury was work related. If you can't get past \nthose two hurdles, your case is thrown out, period.\n\n  Many of the employers on the other side of these worker injury cases \ntried to argue that the person wasn't an employee or doing an employee \nfunction at the time of the injury or, if he had an injury, it happened \nsomeplace other than the workplace.\n  That is not going to be changed by this ergonomics rule. What this \nrule will do is establish a standard of care for employees across \nAmerica. A million American employees each year lose time from work to \ntreat or recover from the injuries we are discussing. These injuries \naccount for fully one-third of all workplace injuries that are serious \nenough to keep workers off the job--more than any other type of injury.\n  Those who oppose this rule and will vote for this resolution of \ndisapproval are ignoring this reality. They are saying that regardless \nof the injuries to American workers, we should do nothing about it, \nnothing. The net result of voting for this resolution of disapproval is \nto put an end to the debate over whether we will continue to protect \nworkers at America's workplaces.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  That is a sad commentary. It is a sad commentary on this Congress--\nwhich started off with all sorts of promise, an evenly divided Senate \nthat would work in a bipartisan fashion--that here, in one of its very \nfirst actions, it has decided to remove a protection in the workplace \nfor millions of American workers.\n  The cost of these injuries is enormous. Many companies come by my \noffice and argue that they just can't afford to make the changes \nnecessary to make their workplace safer. We estimate it would cost \nabout $50 billion a year, these employers are currently paying out, for \npeople who are injured in the workplace. There is no money being saved \nin an injured employee. Not only does it damage or even destroy the \nlife of the worker, you lose the productivity, skill, and experience of \nthat worker, and you pay for attorneys and for doctors and for \ncompensation for that injured employee. It is penny wise and pound \nfoolish for business to ignore the fact that safety in the workplace is \nprofitable, profitable not only for the business but for all the people \nwho work there.\n  Yet the business interests that have lined up today to defeat this \nhave, frankly, turned their back on that reality. I am not surprised, \nwhen I look at what has happened over the last several weeks with the \nnew administration, that this attack on the protection of workers in \nthe workplace is coming to us today for consideration. We have already \nhad a number of decisions made by the new Bush administration which \nhave been clearly against the best interests of working men and women.\n  On January 31, the Bush administration suspended for at least 6 \nmonths the contractor responsibility rule. This was a rule finalized at \nthe end of the Clinton administration and already in effect which \nrequired Government contracting officers to take into consideration a \ncompany's record of complying with the law--civil rights laws, tax \nlaws, labor laws, employment laws, environmental laws, antitrust laws, \nand consumer protection laws--before awarding a Federal contract.\n  I introduced a bill in the 106th Congress that would have done \nessentially what this rule did. I believe if you break the law with \nregard to someone's civil rights, if you harm the environment, or if \nyou defraud the Federal Government, you should not be able to compete \nfor Federal contracts.\n\n  It is curious to me that one of the first acts of office by President \nBush was to literally suspend this law for 6 months. With a stroke of \nthe pen, President Bush has said it is OK to defraud the Federal \nGovernment, to pollute our Nation's streams, and then go on and bid for \nGovernment contracts, to be considered a good corporate citizen when it \ncomes to awarding contracts that pay tax dollars.\n  Along with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Lieberman, I sent a \nletter to OMB Director Mitch Daniels asking him why the administration \ntook this action. I have not received a response.\n  This points out the mindset of this administration; that when it \ncomes to businesses that break the law, they are prepared to look the \nother way. Sadly, this is part of the argument being made today. If a \nbusiness decides to have an unsafe workplace and employees are in fact \ninjured, it is the belief of some that it is none of the Government's \nbusiness; that we should somehow absent ourselves from the discussion. \nI believe otherwise.\n  Let me tell you about a couple other things that have been done by \nthe Bush administration in the early days. One of them relates to \nproject labor agreements. Project labor agreements are nothing new. \nThey have been around since 1930. They are negotiations at the outset \nof a Federal, State, or local construction project between contractors, \nsubcontractors, and the unions representing the crafts that are needed \non the project. Under a project labor agreement, or PLA, they try to \nreach an agreement on the terms and conditions of employment for the \nduration of the project, establishing a framework for labor management \ncooperation.\n  These project labor agreements have been around for 70 years. They \nbenefit the Federal Government and the taxpayers because they \ndramatically lower the cost of construction projects for these \ntaxpayers.\n  So what did President Bush do about these project labor agreements? \nHe repealed them. Gone. With the stroke of a pen, President Bush \neliminated project labor agreements. He even received a letter from a \nRepublican Governor, John Rowland of Connecticut, urging him not to \nrepeal it. Let me quote John Rowland's position on project labor \nagreements:\n\n       Public sector labor agreements have been in use for over \n     seventy years and have proven to be extremely valuable tools \n     used by public entities to manage large construction \n     projects.\n\n  President Bush ignored the Governor of Connecticut. He ignored 70 \nyears of precedent. He decided that instead of pushing for labor-\nmanagement cooperation for the benefit of taxpayers, he would eliminate \nthese project labor agreements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from \nGovernor Rowland printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear President Bush: It is my understanding you are \n     considering issuing an Executive Order that may impact \n     project labor agreements on federally financed or assisted \n     construction projects. Public sector project labor agreements \n     have been in use for over seventy years and have proven to be \n     extremely valuable tools used by public entities to manage \n     large construction projects. The State of Connecticut has \n     successfully implemented project labor agreements for many \n     public projects that came in ahead of schedule and under \n     budget.\n       Project labor agreements provide many economic benefits to \n     the government owner. PLAs eliminate any uncertainty with \n     respect to the supply of and cost of labor for the life of \n     the project. This can generate significant cost savings and \n     is especially important at the present time when there are \n     substantial shortages of skilled construction workers. PLAs \n     set standardized conditions and predetermined wages for all \n     crafts on the project. This allows contractors to bid the \n     work with labor as a constant.\n       With the greater certainty of estimated costs, cost \n     overruns and change orders are reduced, keeping final \n     expenses closer to the estimated cost of the project. Access \n     to an immediate supply of skilled craft workers results in \n     the likelihood that jobs will be completed on schedule. In \n     addition, PLAs are negotiated to reflect the special needs of \n     a particular project, including specific hiring requirements \n     for local residents and minority and female employees.\n       Past experience supports the use of PLAs. Huge federal \n     projects such as the Grand Coulee Dam in Colorado, the Shasta \n     Dam in California, the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, \n     Cape Canaveral in Florida and the Hanford Nuclear Test Site \n     in Washington State were all built under project labor \n     agreements. More recently, the PLA used on the Boston Harbor \n     Project is credited with helping reduce costs from $6.1B to \n     $3.4B, with 20 million craft hours worked without time lost \n     to strikes or lockouts.\n       I hope you will see the benefit of implementing project \n     labor agreements in our nation's large construction projects.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John G. Rowland,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The President also, in the first few days he was in \noffice, on February 17, signed an Executive order requiring Government \ncontractors to post notices stating that employees cannot be required \nto become union members in order to retain their jobs, and that those \nwho don't join the union may object to paying the portion of agency \nfees that aren't related to collective bargaining. Contractors who fail \nto comply with this Executive order and fail to post these notices can \nbe barred from bidding on Government contracts.\n  Interesting, isn't it? The President has said if you violate \nenvironmental laws, civil rights laws, or employment laws, we will \nstill want you to do business with the Federal Government. But if you \nfail to post a notice in the workplace advising people they don't have \nto become union members to work on the job, you can be disqualified \nfrom Government contracts.\n  Another Executive order--the third one--rescinds a 1994 Clinton \nadministration order requiring building service contractors in Federal \nbuildings who have taken over work previously performed by another \ncontractor to offer continued employment in the same jobs to qualified \nemployees of the displaced contractor. Typically, we are talking about \nlow-wage workers, janitors, or cleaning crews who will now lose jobs on \nFederal worksites when the Federal Government changes contractors.\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\n  The list, I am afraid, goes on. The message is clear for working men \nand women: This new administration takes a totally different view on \nprotecting workers in the workplace than the Clinton administration of \nthe last 8 years. Whether it is holding contractors of the Federal \nGovernment to the standard of obeying the law, whether it is making \ncertain that we protect low-wage workers in the workplace, these sorts \nof things are not going to be held sacred nor protected by the Bush \nadministration.\n  Here we come today to the floor with this whole question about safety \nin the workplace. This question of ergonomics is one that has been \ndebated at length. It pains the Republicans, who by and large oppose \nthis ergonomics rule, to realize that the first Secretary of Labor to \npoint out this national problem that needed to be solved was none other \nthan Elizabeth Dole, the wife of former Senator Robert Dole, and \ncertainly a loyal Republican. She understood, as Secretary of Labor, \nthat these injuries were important enough to merit study by the Federal \nGovernment in the promulgation of rules and standards to protect \nworkers in the workplace.\n  But no sooner did she make this proposal than the business interests \nwho were opposed to this protection of workers started a crusade \nagainst them. A crusade usually resulted in delaying the rule going \ninto effect or demanding a study to justify the rule in the first \nplace.\n  These ergonomic injuries, to date, have injured over 6 million \nworkers in America. They range from such things as carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, which many people have suffered from, to severe back injuries \nand disorders of the muscles and nerves. According to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, ergonomic injuries account for 34 percent of the \ninjuries that caused employees to miss work in 1997. Truck drivers had \nthe highest median days--10--away from work. Electricians, plumbers, \npipefitters, and transportation attendants, each had 8 days.\n  Women are disproportionately affected by ergonomic injuries. In 1997, \nwomen made up 46 percent of the workforce and accounted for 33 percent \nof workplace injuries. Yet they accounted for 63 percent of repetitive \nmotion injuries that resulted in lost time. Eighty-six percent of the \nincrease in injuries due to repetitive motion are borne by women; 78 \npercent of the total increase in tendinitis cases were suffered by \nwomen.\n\n  I have one example, the nursing profession, a profession in which we \nare having a difficult time filling vacancies, which alone accounted \nfor 12 percent of all of these types of injuries reported in 1997.\n  It is estimated that 25 to 50 percent of the workforce are Hispanic \nand African American workers. So minority workers will be particularly \ndisadvantaged by the passage of this resolution ending this workplace \nsafety. Who has endorsed this ergonomics standard? Former Labor \nSecretaries Elizabeth Dole, Robert Reich, and Alexis Herman; the \nAmerican Nurses Association; the American Academy of Orthopedic \nSurgeons; the National Academy of Sciences; the American Public Health \nAssociation; the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and \nHealth; and many others.\n  Tom Donahue is currently the President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. It is no surprise that he opposes this ergonomics rule. He \nsaid in his quote that the rule is ``one of a flurry of onerous \nmidnight regulations hastily enacted by the outgoing Clinton \nadministration.''\n  I disagree with Mr. Donahue. To say this rule just arrived on the \nscene at the last moment is to ignore 10 years of history.\n  I guess, beyond that, back in 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed \na person at OSHA to look into these types of injuries. It has been said \nby Mr. Donahue and the Chamber of Commerce that the ergonomics standard \nis not supported by sound science. But after thousands of studies, \nliterally 2,000 studies, including two by the highly respected National \nAcademy of Sciences, the numbers are in; the data is there. The real \nlife stories weren't just flukes. We can't ignore the fact that there \nis strong scientific evidence that certain activities in the workplace \nlead to injuries that cause pain, suffering, and loss of work.\n  Let me also point out the Chamber of Commerce says the standard in \nthis rule is impractical; that it applies ``to any job that requires \noccasional bending, reaching, pulling, pushing, and gripping.'' That is \nnot the case. This ergonomics standard does not apply to agriculture, \nconstruction, and maritime industries, as well as most small businesses \nacross the country. Also, the Chamber of Commerce has grossly \nexaggerated the cost of compliance with this ergonomics standard, \nsaying it could cost as much as $886 billion over 10 years.\n  This is not the first time the Chamber has inflated the cost of a \nFederal standard to protect workers in an effort to defeat it.\n  It appears today they may have the votes to get the job done based on \ndubious statistics. The real average cost for an employer to change the \nworkplace to make it ergonomically correct and safe is $150. A single \ninjury claim by a disabled or injured employee can be approximately \n$22,000. Penny wise or pound foolish? Will we protect workers by \nsending them home safe and healthy at the end of the day by making a \nslight change in the workplace or will we invite injury and say we will \npay the lawyers and the doctors and let the workers' lives be \nforgotten.\n  This Congressional Review Act, which brings us here today, was one of \nthe vestiges of the so-called Contract ``on'' America that was \npromulgated by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich in his glory \ndays. It appears that the Gingrich ghost is still rattling around the \nU.S. Capitol because if the components of this ergonomics rule have \nbeen waived, we will with one fell swoop put an end to this rule for \nperpetuity, or at least during the duration of the Bush administration.\n\n  This resolution cannot be amended or filibustered. A Senator can't \nput a hold on the resolution. No more than 10 hours of debate are \nallowed and it passes with a simple majority. You wonder where the \nRepublicans in the Senate and President Bush will turn next.\n  In the past, they have said they want to eliminate overtime. They \nthink the 40-hour workweek is not sacred. People should work more than \nthat and not be paid overtime. They have come up with the Team Act \nwhich basically allows those who are antagonistic to organized labor to \norganize around them. They have called for something called paycheck \nprotection to take away the power of individual members of labor unions \neven to contribute to political campaigns to support the candidates of \ntheir choice.\n  I am afraid this resolution and this debate really tells us that \nworking people in America are in for a tough time over the next 4 \nyears. It certainly reminds us that elections have consequences, and \nthat if a President who is elected has no sympathy for the working \nfamilies; that the election of the President can change the course and \ndirection of our policies in protecting workers in the workplace.\n  It is a sad commentary that we have forgotten how important it is \nthat we who enjoy the benefits of a great economy must always realize \nthat there are hard-working men and women who get up every single day \nand go to work, do a good job, and only expect the basics--fair \ncompensation for hard work, no exploitation in the workplace, and a \nsafe place to work.\n  The Republicans on the floor--a few Democrats will join them--have \nforgotten the third one, the requirement for safety in the workplace. \nFor them, these are faceless people who are just statistics. They are \n``business costs'' to be borne. I think it is much more. It is a \nquestion of whether, in fact, we value labor.\n  In my own home State of Illinois and some of the cases I am aware of \nwe have had workers--mothers, for example, with small children--who \nworked for a company for many years, lifting things from one place to \nthe other, different sizes and weights of boxes, including Madeleine \nSherod of Rockford, IL. At Valspar Corporation, which makes paint, she \nwas lifting cartons of paint back and forth with a weight of 20 to 90 \npounds each. She performed this job for at least 13 years. Her first \ninjury occurred about 15 years ago, and she was diagnosed with carpal \ntunnel syndrome. She had surgery to relieve the pain.\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\n  As a mother of five, her ability to perform the normal tasks as a \nparent were hindered. She was unable to comb her daughter's hair, wash \ndishes, sweep floors, and other day-to-day tasks working moms must \nperform.\n  A few years after working there, she had another injury and was \ndiagnosed with tendonitis and had tendon release surgery. And even \ntoday, she wears a wrist brace to strengthen her wrist. Being extra \ncautious is part of her everyday life.\n  She recently found a lump on her left wrist and is preparing for a \nthird surgery.\n  The reason I raise this is that the workers at Valspar, and at \ncompanies across America, deserve protection in the workplace.\n  Another business very near Rockford, IL, in the town of Belvedere, is \nan assembly plant for the Neon automobile owned by DaimlerChrysler. I \nvisited that plant several years ago. I was impressed with all the \nrobots, shiny cars, and the good work ethic in the plant. I came back a \nfew years later and was impressed even more to find they had changed \nthe workplace to make it easier so workers would not have to bend down \nto pick up a fender for construction of a car, and they would not have \nto jump into an automobile on the assembly line and try to wrestle an \ninstrument panel in place. Things had changed in the workplace. A few \nsimple machines resulted in a much easier workday for the men and women \nwho work there.\n  I salute DaimlerChrysler and other such companies that have made \nchanges in the workplace that are in their best interests, too. \nHealthy, productive employees are the best thing a company can have. To \nignore that reality, as was the case with Valspar, is to invite injury \nand pain for the workers, less productivity, more cost for medical \nbills and for worker compensation claims.\n  Perhaps the Republicans who are opposing this work safety rule don't \nrealize it, but they are increasing the costs of business. They are \nmaking workers' injuries a compensable charge against any visit that \nwill cost them in terms of how much they have to spend to be \nsuccessful.\n  I salute not only DaimlerChrysler but also Caterpillar Tractor, the \nlargest manufacturer in my State, which from 1986 to 1989 started \nnoticing a high incidence of back injuries. They went into their plants \nat a worker training program, made changes in the height of worktables \nand fixtures and eliminated excessive employee bending and twisting. \nNew tool designs were put in place, new materials to reduce lifting and \nrepetitive motions. As a result of that decision and that effort by \nCaterpillar Tractor in 1990, the incidence of back injuries decreased \nby 27 percent.\n\n  DaimlerChrysler, as I mentioned earlier, over a 3-year period during \nwhich one million instrument panels were installed, had no workers \ncompensation claims reported. Installation of the panel can now be \nperformed by two employees instead of five or six.\n  A pharmaceutical operation changed their work processes and found out \nby 1994 that lost time accidents had decreased from 66 to 4, and \nrecordable injuries decreased from 156 to 60. Workers compensation \nlosses decreased tenfold. A safe workplace is a good investment. It is \nnot only the moral thing to do; it is an economically smart thing to \ndo.\n  The President, with his Executive orders, and the efforts by my \nRepublican colleague here to eliminate this ergonomics rule, basically \ntry to turn their backs on this reality.\n  I will vote against this resolution. I feel I have an obligation to \nthe men and women working in my State to make sure their workplace is \nsafe, that they come home from that workplace after a hard day's work \nwell compensated and well regarded. I don't believe employees in this \ncountry are disposable items. These are real live men and women trying \nto raise families and make this a great nation. For us to ignore that \non the floor of the Senate and to repeal this ergonomics rule is to \nturn our backs on worker safety. It may be the first time in the \nhistory of this country since the days of Franklin Roosevelt we have \ndecided to take a step backward in protecting the men and women who go \nto work every day.\n  If you value work, you should value workers. If you believe a safe \nworkplace is a good standard in a country as good as America, you \nshould vote against this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate most \nof the afternoon. I have heard three or four of the speeches on the \nfloor this afternoon and listened to those who oppose what we are doing \nwith this rule, as if they are the only ones who worked in their lives.\n  When I was a young lad on the farm, I would have loved to have had \nthis rule that says you can only lift 25 pounds 25 times a day. I would \nget my hay work done pretty quickly. Those bails weighed 75 pounds, and \nif I only had to move 25 of them a day and the day was ended, you were \ndone, I would have gone for this in a big way.\n  I pay special recognition to my friend from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. His \nwork on the Small Business Committee and his work in this issue has \nbeen stellar. Ergonomics and this rule caught the scrutiny of a lot of \nfolks who serve in this Congress. It would have gone on had it not been \nfor one thing: the disingenuous approach by the previous administration \nto put this rule into place.\n  These rules and regulations are being enforced and were put in place \nby Presidential fiat, not by legislation passed by a national Congress. \nIn the principle of self-government, this is exactly the wrong way we \nrepresent the people of this Nation. This particular rule is being \nobjected to by so many in Congress not over whether it is basically bad \nor basically good. It is because of the way it was done.\n  The Labor Department put out a rule for comment. We remember that \nrule. But when the rule was finally put in and after the comments were \nreceived, after all that was done, what went into the Federal Register \nwas a bill or rules and regulations of a different order.\n  It was written by unelected Federal employees who were accountable to \nno one. Everybody says it is 10 years of work, and 9 weeks of taking \ncomment, and then on to the Federal Register. The problem is there are \n600 pages issued on a rule that probably will in some way or other be \namended to take care of ergonomics in the workplace.\n  My State of Montana just came out of an era of 15 years of a workers \ncompensation fund that was under attack.\n  It was costing the citizens of Montana an unreasonable amount of \nmoney because of lump sum settlements. Eight years ago, a new Governor \ntook over and did some things to make it right, to make it affordable.\n  I was a county commissioner. We had a nursing home that was under the \nauthority of the commissioners of Yellowstone County, MT. There is no \ndoubt about it, keeping employees, and especially nurses and those \nskilled people it takes to take care of our elderly, was tough to \nmanage. It was a hard job but also very expensive as far as the \noperators of that facility are concerned, for the simple reason workers \ncompensation rates were just going through the roof. We finally got \nthat under control, and now it is operating where employees and \nemployers are satisfied with the workers comp fund in the State of \nMontana.\n  Basically, this rule and this regulation on ergonomics nationalizes \nworkers compensation. It overrides States rights and the funds that are \nfound in those States. In fact, an employee, even one hurt off the job \nif the job contributes to the pain of that injury, could be almost a \ndouble dipper. The rule is very vague. And of course it takes an \nattorney to figure it all out. So we could have a field day here.\n  No employer wants to permit an employee to work in an unsafe place or \nunder unsafe conditions. It doesn't make a lot of sense for an employer \nto train an employee, make him a valuable part of that company or \ncorporation or that team, and then allow him or her to work in a \nworkplace where ergonomics would limit the employment life of that \nemployee. It does not make sense at all. That is not good management, \nand I think American corporations understand that.\n  So I rise today in support of the enforcement of this particular law, \nespecially one that was put in place in 1995 and supported by all. \nThose who support the law will tell everybody, but they will not \nsupport the enforcement.\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\n That doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.\n  I think on this particular issue it is time for those who supported \nthe administration, which did the majority of its work by rule and \nfiat, to do their work and write a rule on ergonomics that makes sense, \nso I support S.J. Res. 6.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa is going to be here \nshortly to be recognized. We had two Senators from that side go on. I \nwould like to take maybe 4 minutes, and then by that time the Senator \nfrom Iowa will be here to make his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there have been a great many statements \nthat, when this rule was promulgated, it didn't take into consideration \nany of the points that were being raised by business. That, of course, \nis completely hogwash. We know there is an ergonomics crisis in the \ncountry. Most of the time, the ergonomics rules would go into effect in \norder to try to protect workers; right? Not these rules and regulations \nthough. Even though the employer need not act under the rule until \nthere is, first of all, an injury. An injury has to trigger it. That is \na major difference, and that was a tip in terms of business.\n  What was the second tip in terms of business? The second tip in terms \nof business is, who makes a judgment whether the injury is work \nrelated? Is it the employee? No, it is the employer. The employer makes \nthe judgment whether the injury is work related.\n  Who makes a judgment, once we find out there is an injury, and it is \na result of ergonomics, and it is work related, about whether that \nparticular individual is going to continue to be employed or whether \ntheir work will be shifted in a way so they do not suffer continued, \nongoing additional injury? Is it the employee? No, it is the medical \nofficials of the employer.\n  My goodness, you could not ask for an ethic or rule that bent over \nfurther to take into consideration the interests of the employer. We \ndon't hear any discussion on the floor of the Senate of the particulars \nof the rule. All we hear is, ``We are not going to cede the power of \nelected officials to bureaucrats.'' We do it every day. We do it every \nday in the Food and Drug Administration that has requirements to make \nsure pharmaceutical drugs are going to be safe and efficacious. If they \nare not safe and efficacious, they are not approved, they don't get the \napproval of the regulators.\n  When was the last time we elected a chair of the FDA? We do not do \nit. They are appointed by the President. We confirm them, but they are \nnot elected officials.\n  Who looks out after health and safety in other inspections that take \nplace? It is not elected officials. It is those who are appointed. We \nhave heard that same speech eight times today. We heard eight times how \nthese officials at OSHA are not elected. I hope we can come, as we are \ngoing into the final hours, to have a different view.\n  I see my friend from Iowa on the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I add to what the Senator from \nMassachusetts just said, how about the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nthe Food Safety and Inspection Service that inspects all our meat \nplants and processing plants? These are not elected either, but we \ntrust them to maintain a safe and wholesome food supply in America.\n  I have been working on this ergonomics rule in the appropriations \nprocess since Elizabeth Dole first addressed the issue 10 years ago. \nOne of the reasons I worked on it is that I have seen it firsthand. I \nhave seen people I know, close friends of mine, who have suffered these \nkinds of injuries because of the kind of work they do. I remember what \nthe former Republican Labor Secretary said when she first ordered the \nergonomics studies. She said repetitive strain injuries are ``one of \nthe nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and \nhealth illnesses of the 1990s.''\n  She was right. We have study after study that shows 1.8 million of \nAmerica's workers suffer from repetitive strain disorders each year; \n600,000 of them suffer from injuries so serious they lose time from \nwork. These injuries drain $45 billion to $50 billion a year in human \nand economic costs.\n  Some employers have ergonomics programs in place because they are \ngood employers and they are smart. They know what the bottom line is. \nThey know ergonomics is a good business practice. But 60 percent of all \ngeneral industry employees work in places that have not yet addressed \nergonomics risk factors.\n  Who are those workers? They are cashiers, nurses, nursing home \nattendants, cleaning staff, assembly workers in manufacturing and \nprocessing plants, computer users using keyboards on a daily basis, \nclerical staff, truck drivers, meat cutters--these are the people who \nare affected. Nearly a third of all serious job-related injuries are \nmusculoskeletal disorders, and women workers are the hardest hit. Women \nmake up 46 percent of the workforce, but in 1998 they accounted for 64 \npercent of repetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of those reported \ncarpal tunnel syndrome cases. So voting to repeal the ergonomics rules \nmeans turning our backs on America's working women who are trying to \nprovide for their families. Wiping this rule out with no amendments and \nwith limited debate is a blow to the working women of America.\n  This bill before us, this measure we have before us that we are about \nto vote on today--make no mistake about it--is an anti-women \nbill, because it hits the women of America the hardest, and because \nthey are the ones who are doing the kind of jobs that are most affected \nby repetitive motion injuries.\n\n  That is what the Congressional Review Act would do. It would affect \nthe women of this country. The Congressional Review Act resolution is \nan extreme measure that has never been used before. It passed in 1996. \nWe all know what the congressional intent was, which was to repeal \nrules that were either hastily issued without scientific basis, or that \nclearly overreached an agency's mandate. That was the intent of it.\n  The ergonomics rule doesn't fit into either category. It is based on \nhundreds of scientifically backed studies, including two major studies \nby the National Academy of Sciences. In fact, our Republican friends--\nthe opponents of this rule--kept calling for more studies of ergonomics \nand these repetitive stress disorders. What did we do? We authorized \nanother National Academy of Sciences study in 1997. Then the \nRepublicans wanted to delay the rule until the study came out. The \nstudy came out in January. Once again, the National Academy of Sciences \nfound that there was scientific evidence that workplace exposures cause \nMSDs, and that the kinds of measures required by the OSHA's mandate are \nthe most effective means to prevent these injuries. This rule falls \nunder OSHA's mandate to protect America's workers from workplace \ninjuries.\n  We always want to have studies done. Usually I hear my Republican \nfriends say we can't do this or that until we have a good scientific \nbasis. That is fine. I think we should have a good scientific basis for \nwhat we do. Here we have the scientific study. We have hundreds of \nscientific studies that have found the same thing. Now--with this \nmeasure--they're saying the studies don't matter.\n  I don't understand why we're even using this extreme measure that we \nhave before us when opponents of ergonomics have two other avenues they \ncan use to modify or even repeal the rule. They could request this \nadministration--the Bush administration --to review the rule to modify \nor even repeal it. Of course, they also have the court system. They \nhave already filed 31 petitions contesting the rule in the U.S. Circuit \nCourt in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Iowa to \nwithhold for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I would be glad to withhold.\n  Mr. REID. I have been told by the Senator's staff that he may have 4 \nor 5 minutes more. Is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not more than that.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur today on \nadoption of S.J. Res. 6 at 8:15 p.m., and that paragraph 4 of rule XII \nbe waived, and\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nthe time between now and then be divided as follows: Senator Kennedy or \nhis designee in control of 80 minutes; Senator Nickles or his designee \nin control of 40 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask it be 80 minutes plus the Senator from Iowa being \nable to complete his statement because we interrupted him. It would be \na couple more minutes. But it would be close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wonder why we are jumping the gun with \nthis resolution when there are already other avenues open to repeal a \nrule which took a decade in the making. Why are we using a measure that \nwould in a sense prevent any similar rule from even being issued unless \nCongress mandated it? It is an extreme measure. We should oppose it. It \nviolates the original intent of the CRA. It violates the spirit of how \nwe do business in the Senate with amendments and timely debate.\n  The eight-page ergonomics rule is complaint based and flexible \naccording to each workplace and job. It will save employers billions of \ndollars every year by preventing the debilitating injuries to their \nworkers.\n  As has been said, this is a preventive measure. What is wrong with \nprevention? We ought to be more involved in both preventing illnesses \nand in preventing injuries. But no.\n  I understand the votes are on that side of the aisle, plus a few on \nthis side, I understand, to overturn this. So what we will do is \ncontinue to spend billions and billions of dollars every year patching, \nfixing, and mending; spending billions of dollars in workers \ncompensation, spending billions of dollars in Medicaid and perhaps \nMedicare later on to take care of people who have suffered \nmusculoskeletal disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome, and repetitive \nmotion disorders.\n  We are penny wise and pound foolish around this place.\n  Again, if businesses think this is onerous--and I have looked at the \nrule and it is not--we are going to have a big tax bill coming through \nhere.\n  Why don't we provide businesses tax relief if they have to comply \nwith this, if they can show it costs money? I would be in favor of \ngiving them whatever tax writeoff they need to comply with the \nergonomics rule because again it would be money better spent than \ntrying to patch, fix, and mend lives later on, not to mention the human \nsuffering that comes along with this.\n  This is an unwise move we are making in the Senate. I have been \nlistening to the debate off and on during the day. Of course, I \nfollowed some of the reports in the media about this. I got to thinking \nto myself that if OSHA issued a rule today that mandated that workers \nin the construction industry had to wear hard hats, it would never get \nthrough the floor of the Senate. If they issued the rule to say that \nconstruction workers will wear hard hats, we would have opponents ready \nto repeal it.\n  No one would think of going on a construction site without wearing a \nhard hat, least of all the workers, because both the industry and the \nlaborers know how much it has done to save lives, save injuries. And, \nyes, save money.\n  This is the same with ergonomics.\n  Talk about shortsightedness. This is something that will save lives \nand save human suffering. It will prevent injuries, cost us less money, \nbe good for business, good for America, and especially good for our \nworking women.\n  I guess the railroad train is on the track. They are riding the \nhorse. As I understand it, they have the votes to repeal it. But I say \nit is a dark day for the working people of America, and especially a \ndark day for the working women in America who are going to continue to \nsuffer in the workplace the kind of injuries that will cause them a \nlifetime of suffering and a lifetime of not being able to fully use \ntheir abilities in the workplace.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my chairman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator review for the membership again why \nthis has to be all or nothing? As I understand the current situation, \nall the President would have to do, if he wanted to change the rule, is \nfile in the Federal Register and wait 60 days. There would be notice \nthat there were going to be changes in the rule and the process would \nmove forward with public comment and the administrative practices and \nprocedures would move ahead. There could be adjustment and changes, and \nOSHA could take account of the 9 years of rulemaking, the study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, the months of hearings, and the \nscientific reports that have been accumulated. Why not follow that \nroute in a sense of bipartisanship?\n  Is the Senator not troubled, as I am, with this take-it-or- leave-it \nattitude? We thought we were going to have a bipartisan effort in order \nto work through some of our differences. The Senator is a member of our \neducation committee. We are working in a bipartisan way.\n  He was there early this morning at 9 o'clock, talking with the \nrepresentatives from the White House on these issues.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We were trying to work out, on the Patients' Bill of \nRights, a bipartisan effort. Now, when it comes to protecting workers, \nwe have to take it or leave it--no effort to accommodate, no effort to \ncompromise, no effort in the area that has been identified as the most \ndangerous for workers in this country from a health and safety point of \nview. And they say: ``Just take it or leave it.'' Ten hours of debate, \nand we go out of the Senate with an effective ``trophy'' for the \nChamber of Commerce on this.\n  Can the Senator express his own view about this dilemma we are in?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think what the Senator has said is absolutely correct. \nThat approach makes too much sense. For example, it does seem to me \nthat if we are rational, reasonable, human beings, and that we do want \nto work in a bipartisan fashion, which is the only way we are really \ngoing to be able to accomplish anything this year--except something \nsuch as this, which is rammed through on account of a fast-track \nprocedure--if we truly want to work in a bipartisan fashion, then we \nought to be talking about, if there are problems some people have in \nthe ergonomics rule, well, then, the logical, reasonable, responsible \nway would be, as Senator Kennedy has said, to let the administration \npropose some modifications that would be published in the Register.\n  There would be a 60- or 90-day--I forget which it is--hearing period \nin which outside interests could come in and testify as to whether they \nthought that part of the rule was bad or good or should be modified. At \nthe end of that hearing process, the administration could then propose \nchanging that, modifying that, to meet the objections some people may \nhave.\n  That seems to me to be the responsible way to proceed, not this kind \nof fast-track Congressional Review Act that we have on the floor of the \nSenate today whereby we have 10 hours of debate with no chance of \namendment.\n  Maybe there are some reasonable modifications that might be made to \nthe ergonomics rule. Maybe there are. I do not know every little item \nin the rule. I do not pretend to know every little item in the rule. \nMaybe there are some. But if there are, this is not the way to \nproceed--to just say: its all or nothing. Let's just throw it out the \nwindow--after more than 10 years of work.\n  When these kinds of things happen on the Senate floor, and in the \nCongress, I can begin to understand more and more why the American \npeople are losing faith in us, why they do not think we really pay \nattention to them and their needs, why they believe we may be out of \ntouch with the common people of America. Because I think the average \nAmerican would understand that there is a reasonable, responsible way \nof approaching this. And what we are doing here today is unreasonable, \nirresponsible, illogical, and harmful--harmful to perhaps some of the \nleast powerful people in this country.\n  Is this rule going to affect Members of the Senate or the House? No. \nIt will not affect our staffs. It is not going to affect people of \nhigher income. Let's face it, most of the people who suffer from these \ninjuries are some of the lowest paid people in America. They are the \npeople who are working in our meatpacking industries, our poultry \nplants, who are making low wages,\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nworking at tough jobs. They are our cashiers and our clerks and our \nkeyboard operators, our cleaning women--the people who clean the \nbuildings at night, our janitors. They are our nursing home people. \nThese are some of the lowest paid and some of the hardest working \npeople in America. This is who it affects.\n\n  That is why we should not support this resolution to repeal the rule. \nThat is why we should proceed in a responsible, reasoned manner. Let \nthe President suggest some modifications, have the hearing process, and \nmove ahead that way. What we are doing here today is unreasonable and \nshould not be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought I was next. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, if it counts against your time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have tried to accommodate a timeframe here for this \nfor other Members. The other side has used 40 minutes longer than we \nhave. My understanding is that the 80 and 40 minutes were going to be \nat the end of Senator Harkin's statement. That is what I agreed to. Now \nI am told by the Parliamentarian that the latter part of his statement \nis all being taken out of my time because it is in response to a \nquestion.\n  I had a limited amount of time left. I have been here all day, and I \nam quite prepared to accommodate those who want to set the time, but I \nobject strenuously to that interpretation.\n  I would like to just renew the request that has been made by the \nSenator from Wyoming that we have the 80- and 40-minute allocation that \nwas meant earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. We talked about doing that as of 6:15, which would have \nmade the vote at 8:15, which is what the hotline has gone out for. How \nabout on that 10 minutes used, if each of us put up half of it and we \nstill have the vote at 8:15?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was not part of that discussion. I \nhave not used a lot of time. I have some strong feelings on this \nsubject, but clearly I have not been here on the floor because there \nhas been a great debating team on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that an editorial of \nNovember 21, 2000--that was a Tuesday--in the largest paper in New \nMexico, the Albuquerque Journal, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Nov. 21, 2000]\n\n               OSHA Determined To Rush Rules Into Effect\n\n       Employers are sweeping the corners for workers in a tight \n     labor market and striving to increase productivity levels \n     that already are the envy of the world.\n       Does this sound like the sort of business climate in which \n     employers would ignore ergonomic problems that sap \n     productivity or create hard-to-fill vacancies?\n       The U.S. Department of Labor, which still subscribes to an \n     antique notion of proletariat oppressed by capitalists, seems \n     eminently capable of disregarding the present reality even as \n     it acknowledges it.\n       Charles N. Jeffress, head of Labor's Occupational Safety \n     and Health Administration, says companies in the United \n     States and abroad have developed policies on ergonomics that \n     have reduced injuries caused by repetitive tasks.\n       Of course they have and done so without being hammered by \n     OSHA because it makes good business sense. Such injuries cost \n     employers in terms of lost productivity, lost experience and \n     training when workers leave a job, and higher worker's \n     compensation expenses.\n       But companies figuring out what works best in their \n     particular operation is not good enough for OSHA, which is \n     preparing to throw a one-size-fits-all regulatory blanket \n     over workplaces from sea to shining sea. And not to be \n     outdone by private-sector productivity doing it just as fast \n     as is bureaucratically possible over the objections of \n     elected members of the legislative branch.\n       Last winter, congressional leaders like Sen. Pete Domenici, \n     R-N.M., had to fight to get businesses time to review the \n     proposals and submit public comment that supposedly is taken \n     into consideration by OSHA in the final drafting of rules.\n       The controversial prescription for U.S. industry was \n     pivotal in the pre-election posturing over the spending bill \n     covering labor, education and health. Although that package \n     awaits post-election action by Congress, OSHA plans to hustle \n     the new rules into effect Jan. 16. That's before the National \n     Academy of Sciences completes a workplace ergonomics study \n     less likely to be biased by ideology or constituency \n     loyalties. It is also just days before a new administration \n     that might have a different perspective takes the reins of \n     office. Must be a coincidence.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senator from the State of \nIowa has it all wrong when he cites this as one of the reasons the \nAmerican people are discouraged with what we do here--that if they \nwatch this process, they will be discouraged. Quite to the contrary, if \nthe American people knew what was going on in this set of regulations \n600 pages long, issued just before the President walked out of the \nWhite House, dramatically affecting thousands upon thousands of small \nbusinessmen, who do not have the wherewithal to even look at these 600 \npages' worth of regulations, they would ask: What was going on in the \nWhite House that just left?\n  They had hearings, they had proposed regulations, and all of a sudden \nthey drew up a new set as they walked out the door that has a dramatic \nimpact on every single small business in my State, hundreds and \nhundreds of them, perhaps a few hundred million dollars' worth of \nimpact on them. And they had no hearings in Congress, no statutory \nproposal to change the law that is changed by these regulations. And \nall of a sudden, they wake up and they are supposed to be subject to \nthese regulations through OSHA, a department of our Federal Government \nthat at least in the last 8 years has been seen by most small \nbusinesspeople in the United States as against their interests without \ndoing any good for the public. That is how they see OSHA most of the \ntime.\n  So having said that, I want to say that what we are doing now, under \nthis very interesting statute--that got passed up here because I do not \nthink those on the other side of the aisle thought we would ever be to \na point where we would use it and have a President in the White House \nwho would sign the resolution we adopted--I think they thought it is \njust a giveaway, just a throwaway; that is, this legislation providing \nfor review in Congress, and the submission to the President, of a rule \nthat would set aside the regulations.\n  I think it is a reality check. I think it is saying to OSHA, and the \nformer President, and the Department of Labor: Take some more time. We \nwant the job done right. We do not want it one-sided. We want it fair.\n  Frankly, in the typical bureaucratic fashion that so much besets \nOSHA, they issued this rule on November 14--600 pages long, weighing \nmore than 2 pounds. That is not a very typical document that small \nbusinesspeople have the opportunity, the time, or the resources to \nevaluate. But you can count on it, they will be in some major class \naction lawsuits, or who knows what else the trial lawyers will find as \na nest egg within the 600 pages of this regulation.\n  Having said that, I will read a few paragraphs from an editorial in \nthe Albuquerque Journal. It is considered a fair newspaper and this is \nwhat they said in their editorial:\n\n       Employers are sweeping the corners for workers in a tight \n     labor market and striving to increase productivity levels \n     that already are the envy of the world. Does this sound like \n     the sort of business climate in which employers would ignore \n     ergonomic problems that sap productivity or create hard-to-\n     fill vacancies?\n\n  A very good question in this editorial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Continuing from the editorial:\n\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\n\n       The U.S. Department of Labor, which still subscribes to an \n     antique notion of a proletariat oppressed by capitalists, \n     seems eminently capable of disregarding the present reality \n     even as it acknowledges it. . . .\n       [OSHA] says companies in the United States and abroad have \n     developed policies on ergonomics . . .\n       But companies figuring out what works best in their \n     particular operation is not good enough for OSHA, which is \n     preparing to throw a one-size-fits-all regulatory blanket \n     over workplaces from sea to shining sea.\n\n  That is the relevant part of their editorial. It had some more in it \nthat is in the Record. I suggest, in addition to what I have just \ndescribed about the regulation, it is very expensive. We seem to pass \nthese kinds of rules and regulations thinking there is no end to what \nthe American economy can pay, whether it is $4 billion or $200 billion \nor $500 billion or $100 billion. The American economy will just hum \nalong and continue paying. Frankly, I think we will see tonight that \nthose who represent the people, in particular, small businesses, are \ngoing to say that is not true. Enough is enough. I hope we use this new \nlaw tonight and then I hope the Department of Labor and those \ninterested in ergonomics regulations will proceed with due caution to \nadopt a more fair and better set of regulations that will protect \neverybody, not just those who want to make onerous regulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank our leader on this and so many other issues, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, for yielding the time to me.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Durbin, \nWellstone, and Harkin, and so many others, to state my opposition to \nS.J. Res. 6, which uses a novelty, the Congressional Review Act, to \nhalt the Department of Labor's final rule on ergonomics.\n  S.J. Res. 6 states:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of \n     Labor relating to ergonomics and such rule shall have no \n     force or effect.\n\n  Not compromise, not just one size should not fit all, but no effect, \nno rule. Many of my colleagues have come to the Chamber and spoken \nabout how this CRA resolution is not aimed to kill the ergonomics rule; \nrather, it pulls the rule to allow for additional time to further study \nthe issue. Maybe my friends who have made that point haven't carefully \nread the congressional review of agency rulemaking, title 5, chapter 8 \nof the United States Code, or perhaps they hope we haven't. Let me take \nthis opportunity to read it aloud for everybody now. Section 801(b) \nstates:\n\n       (1) A rule shall not take effect or continue if the \n     Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval, described \n     under section 802, of the rule. (2) A rule that does not take \n     effect under paragraph (1) may not be reissued in \n     substantially the same form, and a new rule that is \n     substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, \n     unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by \n     a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution \n     disapproving the original rule.\n\n  This is not a review. This is a killing. If the opponents of the \nresolution wanted a review, they could, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts said a few minutes ago, in questioning the Senator from \nIowa, call on the Secretary of the Department of Labor and request a \nreview under the Administrative Procedures Act. That would mean that \nergonomics would still breathe life. That would mean that we might \nmodify certain provisions of which we might not approve. It would not \nend it.\n  The truth is, some of my colleagues are hoping that 10 hours of \ndebate and one 15-minute rollcall will abolish over 20 years of \nresearch and nearly $1.5 million of taxpayer money to fund \ncongressionally mandated studies on ergonomics.\n  I have heard the arguments my colleagues have made this afternoon. \nFirst, that we need more study of ergonomics. Ergonomics is not a new \nissue. Between the Government and the private sector, there have been \nover 20 years of research aimed to better understand worker injury and \nworkplace safety. It is 2001, and I am hearing my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle say these regulations are premature. But in \n1990, then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole directed the Department of \nLabor to examine the repetitive stress injury category of occupational \nillnesses, which statistics showed were the fastest growing type of \nworker injury.\n  That was back in 1990. They were then the fastest growing type of \ninjury because of changes in the workplace.\n  In the 1980s, 20 years ago, there were articles and studies in \nmedical journals that addressed ergonomics. The New York Times ran an \narticle on September 4, 1985, which discussed the widespread growth of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive stress injury. New? These are not \nnew. In fact, businesses from my State came in my office last week and \nexplained to me they began studying repetitive stress injury as early \nas 1979, 21 years ago.\n\n  In truth, to many who work, who suffer these injuries, the final \nergonomics rule has come too late. This standard could have been \nimplemented many years ago and helped hundreds of thousands of workers \nif it were not for the numerous attempts by Congress to halt Department \nof Labor action on this issue.\n  Opponents also argue it will cost employers $100 billion a year. Not \ntrue. OSHA estimates the cost at $4.5 billion and predicts savings to \nemployers of $9 billion a year in productivity loss and workers \ncompensation.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics in my State of New York reported that \nmore than 48,000 workers had serious injuries from ergonomic hazards in \nthe workplace, and that was only the number of private sector \nemployees. There were an additional 18,444 public sector workers who \nhad injuries serious enough for them to lose time from work. Here we \nare, in this--thank God--productive 21st century, we are trying to find \nways to make workers more productive. We have millions of person days \nlost in terms of working because of ergonomic injuries, and we shy away \nfrom dealing with the problem.\n  Speaking of workers compensation, opponents of ergonomics claim this \nnew standard will supersede workers compensation law. Not according to \nthe attorney general of my State. Eliot Spitzer has joined with 16 \nother attorneys general to file comments with OSHA saying the new \nergonomic standards will not affect or supersede the worker \ncompensation laws in their States. If we allow this resolution to pass, \nall we will really have accomplished is saddling American workers, \nAmerican businesses, American citizens with a huge burden: the cost of \nlost wages and productivity for hundreds of thousands of individuals \nwho report work-related MSDs each year.\n  Change is never easy. It is always simple to get up there and say: \nLet it continue as it is. Yes, there are some businesses that are doing \nthis work now. Most are not, to the detriment not only of themselves \nbut to the detriment of America. Change is difficult, but if we didn't \nchange, we would not be the leading economy and the leading country of \nthe world.\n  Modify? Why not. Eliminate, put a dagger through the heart of \nergonomics after 20 years of study? We shouldn't do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose this ergonomics standard, will \nreconsider their position, and not undo 20 years of effort to help \nsafeguard the health and safety of American workers, which is \nundoubtedly our most precious resource.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on November 14, 2000, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its final ergonomics \nprogram standard. This program will spare 460,000 workers from painful \ninjuries and save approximately $9.1 billion each year. This new \nstandard took effect on January 16, 2001, and will be phased-in over \nfour years.\n  While OSHA has issued its final ergonomics program standard and this \nnew standard has taken effect, some of my colleagues are still trying \nto eliminate this rule. They may claim that it is unwise to issue such \na standard because it is based on unsound science and has been rushed \nthrough the regulatory process. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am here today to remind my colleagues that OSHA \nworked on developing ergonomic standards for over 10 years. It is not \nsomething new. It has been around since world War II, where the \ndesigners of our small plane cockpits took into consideration the \nplacement of cockpit controls for our pilots.\n  We, in Congress, must not forget our commitment to America's workers. \nWe must reduce the numbers of injuries suffered by our workers. We \ncannot continue to look the other way when each year more than 600,000 \nworkers suffer serious injuries, such as back injuries, carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, and tendinitis, as a result of ergonomic hazards. In 1999, in \nthe State of Hawaii, more than 4,400 private sector workers suffered \nserious injuries from ergonomic hazards at work. Another 700 workers in \nthe public sector suffered such injuries. These injuries are a major \nproblem not only in Hawaii, but across the nation. It affects truck \ndrivers and assembly line workers, along with nurses and computer \nusers. Every sector of the economy is affected by this problem. The \nimpact can be devastating for workers who suffer from these injuries.\n  This Resolution of Disapproval is not the right approach. It would \nbar OSHA from issuing safeguards to protect workers from the nation's \nbiggest job safety problem. I remind my colleagues that there are \nnormal regulatory procedures that can be utilized if the Administration \nhas concerns over the existing program standards. The Resolution of \nDisapproval is not necessary.\n  American families cannot afford the repeal of this long awaited \nregulation. More importantly, American workers cannot afford losing \nthis important worker protection. Injuries that result from ergonomic \nhazards are serious, disabling, and costly. Carpal tunnel syndrome \nresults in workers losing more time from their jobs than any other type \nof injury. It is estimated that these injuries account for an estimated \n$20 billion annually in workers compensation payments.\n  Many of these injuries and illnesses can be prevented by allowing \nthis standard to be fully implemented. In fact, some employers across \nthe country have already taken action and put in place workplace \nergonomics programs to prevent injuries. However, two-thirds of \nemployers still do not have adequate ergonomic programs in place.\n  We have an opportunity to prevent 460,000 injuries a year and save $9 \nbillion in workers' compensation and related costs by voting against \nthis resolution. This resolution is unnecessary and unwarranted. \nCongress should remember and honor the commitment made to the nation's \nworkforce when it established OSHA in 1970 and vote against the \nResolution of Disapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wanted more time, but I think almost \neverything has been said, except only in Washington can we have the \nopinion that no good decision is made unless it is made in Washington, \nDC. We had a news conference some time ago--in October--about what the \nregulations cost the American people. The average family of four right \nnow pays $6,800 a year just for these regulations.\n  In the Clinton administration, the average number of pages of \nregulations per day in the Federal Register was 319. The previous \nrecord was 280 pages.\n  I remember when OSHA first started. I was in the State senate at that \ntime. I remember when I was in Michigan and I held a book up and said--\nI was going to talk to the National Association of Manufacturers. I \nsaid: I bet I can close down anybody in here just with these \nregulations.\n  One guy called me on it and we went out and closed him down. \nOverregulation is an extremely burdensome thing.\n  I think as far as the extreme broad reach of this program, single \nincident trigger--all these points have been made. I want to just bring \nit closer to home and share with you a couple of things and ask that \nthey be put in the Record. We have had over 1,000 letters from the \nvarious businesses and others who believe their businesses have been \nthreatened.\n  I ask unanimous consent these excerpts of letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The OSHA ergonomics rule threatens our company's future and \n     the jobs of the employees who depend upon us. It will result \n     in increased food prices for Oklahoma consumers.--Ron Cross, \n     Stephenson Wholesale Company, Inc. Durant, OK.\n       Please support the CRA to repeal the OSHA Ergonomics \n     Regulations. The rule may have had good intentions, but the \n     way it was executed was terrible. I own a small business and \n     do not need much more government weight on my back to induce \n     me to just pull the plug and shut it down.--Jeff Painter, \n     Claremore, OK.\n       It would greatly increase costs in my practice.--Dr. Bob \n     Barheld, McAlester, OK.\n       And if I am forced to pay 100% of employees' pay and \n     benefits while they're on ergonomics leave for three months \n     aka the `work restriction protection' requirement, I'll be \n     out of business. Doris Lambert, Quick Lube, Lawton, OK.\n       We are greatly concerned by OSHA's final ergonomics \n     regulation. If fully implemented in its current form, this \n     regulation will likely impose huge administrative burdens, \n     require the purchase of expensive new equipment, and dictate \n     the reconfiguration of many of our facilities. It may \n     actually cost jobs--while not ensuring that a single \n     workplace injury will be prevented.--V.E. Hartnett, Con-Way \n     Southern Express, Oklahoma City, OK.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis Congressional Review Act. This was put together back in 1996 at a \ntime when we decided that maybe it was time for Congress to get a \nhandle on the bureaucracy and time that we had a successful trial of \nthis CRA, and I ask you to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. We have heard a \ngood deal of rhetoric on the part of those who have opposed this \nregulation.\n  We have heard that the rule is 600 pages long. This is eight pages. \nIt can be found in the November 14, 2000 Federal Register starting at \npage 68846.\n  Mr. President, in reviewing this, I daresay it might take someone 15 \nor 20 minutes to read through it. We have heard a great deal about how \ncan any business in this country be able to understand what is expected \nof them. I daresay anybody who has been watching this debate and has \nthe opportunity of looking through the Congressional Record tomorrow \nwill be able to get through these in very quick order.\n  I just looked, for example, at the basic screening tool which is the \nstandard which would be used by employers. It is very clear. It sets \nforth the risk factors the standard covers. It talks about repetition \nand about the amount of repetition that might be evidenced in an \nergonomic injury. Then it goes down to the issue of force. Most people, \nsmall businessmen or large businesses, are going to be able to \nunderstand these standards, which cover lifting more than 75 pounds at \nany one time, more than 55 pounds more than 10 times a day, or more \nthan 25 pounds below the knees and above the shoulders or at arm's \nlength more than 25 times a day.\n  I think most people with a high school education could understand \nwhether their workers were at risk. The rule also addresses awkward \npostures. They have three different illustrations, such as repeatedly \nraising or working with hands above the head or elbow, above the \nshoulders, more than 2 hours total per day; kneeling or squatting more \nthan 2 hours total per day--kneeling and squatting are not very \ndifficult to understand; working with the back, neck, or wrist, \ntwisting more than 2 hours total per day. Those are the three criteria \nfor awkward positions.\n  Most people can understand that. It is very readable and \nunderstandable. Then the rule goes back to contact stress, using the \nhand or knee as a hammer more than 10 times per hour, more than 2 hours \ntotal per day. It just goes on, and it is very understandable, Mr. \nPresident, and that is really what this whole proposal is all about.\n  All we have to do is ask the more than 1 million workers in our \nsociety, the great majority of whom are women, who have trouble using \ntheir fingers, wrists, arms, shoulders, backs, and lower backs. They \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nwhat is happening to them in the workplace. This is no great challenge. \nHow can we ever expect anybody to understand what is happening? Very \nsimple. As we have seen from every report, it is happening and putting \nmore than 100 million Americans at risk every day in more than 6 \nmillion workplaces. It is happening to at least 1 million Americans, \naccording to the Academy of Sciences, who are losing work every day. \nThey understand it.\n  This idea that we have to go through 700 pages is just baloney. Here \nare the regulations. They are understandable, they are comprehensible, \nthey are clear, and they are reasonable. They are completely opposed by \nthe Chamber of Commerce that has spent millions of dollars trying to \ndefeat the rule because they would put at risk American workers in the \nworkplace, and that is wrong.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor the time and especially for his tremendous leadership and eloquence \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nOccupational Health and Safety Administration's final ergonomics \nstandard, and to express my opposition to the attempt to overturn this \nstandard by using the Congressional Review Act.\n  After more than 10 years of research, public hearings, and public \ncomments, OSHA's final ergonomics standard was published in the Federal \nRegister on November 14, 2000. The standard took effect on January 16, \n2001, extending basic protections to workers across our Nation.\n  Each year, more than 1.8 million American workers suffer from \nworkplace injuries caused by repetitive motions including heavy \nlifting, sewing, and typing. These injuries have an impact on every \nsector of our economy, and are particularly prevalent among women \nbecause many of the jobs held predominately by women require repetitive \nmotions or repetitive heavy lifting. These preventable injuries cost \nmore than $60 billion annually, $20 billion of which is from workers' \ncompensation costs.\n  In addition to costing American businesses millions of dollars, \nrepetitive stress injuries are costing American workers their health \nand, in some cases, their mobility. This means that some workers will \nlose the ability to do certain activities--activities ranging from \nsimple tasks like fastening buttons to more meaningful things including \npicking up a child or participating in sports.\n  In past Senate debates on this issue, one of the chief arguments \nagainst an ergonomics standard has been that more scientific research \nwas needed to prove the connection between repetitive motions and the \nphysical injuries being suffered by hundreds of thousands of workers \neach year. Even though there was already a significant body of research \noutlining the need for national ergonomics standards from sources \nincluding the National Academy of Sciences, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health, and the General Accounting Office, \nopponents of a Federal standard argued that the standard needed to be \ndelayed until another NAS study was issued.\n  That NAS study is out, and its conclusions are clear: There is a \nconnection between repetitive motion and physical injury, and these \ninjuries are preventable. According to the study:\n\n       The weight of the evidence justifies the introduction of \n     appropriate and selected interventions to reduce the risk of \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the low back and upper \n     extremities. They include, but are not confined to, the \n     application of ergonomic principles to reduce physical as \n     well as phychosocial stressors. To be effective, intervention \n     programs should include employee involvement, \n     employer commitment, and the development of integrated \n     programs that address equipment design, work procedures, \n     and organizational characteristics.\n\n  Further proof can be found in existing ergonomics programs. Companies \nacross the country have reduced the instances of preventable workplace \ninjuries by designing and implementing their own ergonomics programs. \nIn my home State of Wisconsin, the popular maker of children's \nclothing, OshKosh B'Gosh, redesigned its workstations. This commonsense \naction cut workers' compensation costs by one-third, saving the company \napproximately $2.7 million.\n  Another Wisconsin company, Harley-Davidson, cut workplace ergonomics \ninjuries by more than half after implementing an ergonomics program.\n  An employee of a health care facility in my hometown of Janesville, \nWI, said the following about the joint efforts between her management \nand fellow employees to design a program to combat the back injuries \nthat are all too common among health care workers:\n\n       I am here today to tell OSHA that working in a nursing home \n     is demanding and hazardous work. Those hazards include back \n     injuries as well as problems in the hands, arms, shoulders, \n     and other parts of the body . . .. I am also here to testify \n     that the injuries and pain do not have to be part of the job \n     . . .. Together [management and labor] have identified jobs \n     where there are risks of back injuries. After getting input \n     from employees, the employer has selected equipment that has \n     improved the comfort [and] the safety of patients as well as \n     the employees.\n       . . . What we are doing at the [nursing home] is proof that \n     it is possible to prevent injuries with a commitment from \n     management and the involvement of employees. Our injury \n     prevention program is a win-win for everybody: Management, \n     labor, the patients, and their families. I urge OSHA to issue \n     an ergonomics rule so that nursing home workers across the \n     country will have the same protection that we have at the \n     health care center.\n\n  There are many other success stories in Wisconsin and around the \nUnited States.\n  I commend the efforts of those companies which have proven that \nresponsible ergonomics programs can--and do--prevent injuries resulting \nfrom repetitive motions. Unfortunately, though, not all American \nworkers are protected by ergonomics programs like those I have \ndescribed.\n  For example, one of my constituents who testified at an ergonomics \nevent in my state has endured three surgeries over a ten-year period to \nrepair damage to his spine caused by repetitive motions at his job. In \nhis testimony, this man said,\n\n       Pain is my constant companion and I still need pain \n     medication to get through the day. It is an effort just to \n     put my socks on in the morning. I will never be healthy and \n     pain free.\n\n  Another one of my constituents described the impact that an injury he \nsustained at work--while lifting a 60-80 pound basket of auto parts--\nhas had on his once-active lifestyle:\n\n       This pain has limited me in many ways . . .. I used to \n     teach soccer to kids. Now I can't walk more than half an hour \n     without pain in my legs and spine. I have to prepare myself \n     for fifteen minutes in the morning just to get out of bed.\n  Injuries such as those suffered by my constituents--and indeed by \nworkers in each one of our States--will be prevented through OSHA's \nergonomics standard.\n  What we are talking about is an impact on real people. They are our \nconstituents, our family, our friends, our neighbors. We should not \noverturn a standard that will help to stop preventable injuries from \nforever changing the lives of countless Americans who are working to \nprovide their families and themselves with a decent standard of living.\n  I recognize that some industries and small businesses are concerned \nabout the impact, financial and otherwise, that this standard will have \non them. I have written to OSHA on behalf of a number of my \nconstituents to communicate their concerns, and I will continue to \ncommunicate their concerns regarding the implementation of this \nstandard.\n  Overturning this standard under the Congressional Review Act is not \nthe answer. This resolution does not simply send this standard ``back \nto the drawing board'' as some have suggested. If we adopt this \nresolution of disapproval, we will be stripping away all the \nprotections that went into effect on January 16, 2001. It will be as if \nthe 10 years of research, public hearings, and public comments that \nwent into the drafting of this standard had never happened, and OSHA \nwill not be permitted to work to promulgate another ergonomics standard \nuntil specifically and affirmatively told to do so by the Congress.\n  Let's be clear what a vote on this issue is. A vote for this \nresolution is a vote to block any Federal ergonomics standard for the \nforeseeable future. It is a vote to erase protections that will help to \nprevent hundreds of thousands\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nof workplace injuries this year alone. It is a vote to require \nbusinesses to continue to spend millions of dollars in workers \ncompensation and other costs resulting from senseless injuries that \ncould have been prevented.\n  The Congressional Review Act, which allows no amendment, and which \nallows only limited debate, is no way to legislate. We should not be \ndoing business this way in the Senate, but we do, and we all know part \nof the reason why--the wealthy interests who seek to influence the \ndecisions we make on this floor. Thanks to the soft money loophole, \nwealthy interests with legislative agendas can donate unlimited amounts \nof soft money to both of our political parties. The results are an \nundeniable appearance of corruption that taints the work of this \nSenate, and the ergonomics debate is a perfect example. There are \ncertainly plenty of wealthy interests weighing in on the ergonomics \nissue. So I think it is time I called my first bankroll of 2001 by \nsharing with my colleagues and the public some of the unregulated soft \nmoney donations being made by interests lobbying for and against \noverturning the ergonomics rule.\n  Take the American Trucking Association, which has also been a \ngenerous soft money donor to the political parties. Along with its \naffiliates and executives, the American Trucking Association gave more \nthan $404,000 in soft money in the 2000 cycle.\n  They have weighed in against the ergonomics rule, and they do so with \nthe weight of their soft money contributions behind them. The same is \ntrue for a host of other associations fighting to see the rule \noverturned: in the last cycle, the National Soft Drink Association and \nits executives gave more than $141,000 in soft money, the National \nRetail Federation doled out more than $101,000 in soft money, and the \nNational Restaurant Association ponied up more than $55,000 in soft \nmoney to the parties.\n  To be fair, I will also mention the other side of the soft money \ncoin, the unions that have lobbied to keep the rule in place. They \ninclude the AFL-CIO and its affiliates, which gave more than $827,000 \nin soft money in the last election cycle, and the Teamsters Union and \nits affiliates, which gave $161,000 during the same period.\n  Repetitive motion injuries can and should be prevented. I strongly \nbelieve that we should have a national standard that affords all \nworkers the same protections from these debilitating injuries. We \nshould not overturn this standard. The health and mobility of countless \nAmerican workers is at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the hundreds of thousands of workers \nwho suffer from repetitive motion injuries each year by opposing this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this resolution which \nseeks to overturn OSHA's new standard that protects workers from \nworkplace injuries. It is bad for American workers and bad for our \neconomy.\n  This resolution would prevent OSHA from implementing an ergonomics \nstandard that would establish basic safety standards for American \nworkers. This standard would protect workers from on-the-job injuries \ncaused by working conditions that involve heavy lifting, repetitive \nmotions or working in an awkward or uncomfortable position.\n  American workers deserve a safe workplace, yet each year more than \n600,000 people suffer ergonomics injuries. Who suffers most from \nergonomic injuries? Women. Women represent only 46 percent of the \nworkforce, but they suffer 64 percent of the repetitive motion \ninjuries.\n  Who are these women? They're the caregivers--like the home health \ncare worker who bathes a housebound senior or the licensed practical \nnurse who cares for us when we are hospitalized. They are the factory \nworkers who build our cars and process our food. They are the cashiers \nand sales clerks who are the backbone of our retail economy. And they \nare the data entry clerks who keep our high-tech economy moving \nforward.\n  There are terrible human costs to these injuries. Women account for \nnearly 75 percent of lost work time due to carpal tunnel syndrome and \n62 percent of lost time due to tendinitis. These are painful, \ndebilitating injuries that prevent you from doing even simple \nactivities like combing your hair or zipping your child's jacket.\n  We can't measure the pain and suffering of workers who are injured at \nwork, but we can measure the economic costs. These injuries cost our \neconomy over $80 billion annually in lost productivity, health care \ncosts and workers compensation. In fact, nearly $1 out of every $3 in \nworker's compensation payments result from ergonomics injuries.\n  OSHA's ergonomics standard wasn't slapped together at the last minute \nor in the dark of night. The effort was initially launched by Labor \nSecretary Elizabeth Dole in 1990 and the standards have been in \ndevelopment over the past 10 years. During the development phase there \nwere 10 weeks of public hearings and extensive scientific study, \nincluding the National Academy of Science's study which concluded that \nworkplace interventions can reduce the incidence of workplace injuries.\n  The result of this long and careful study is the OSHA ergonomics \nstandard issued last November. These standards would require all \nemployers to provide their workers with basic information on ergonomic \ninjuries--including their symptoms and the importance of early \nreporting. These standards would take action whenever a worker reports \nthese activities and employers would be required to correct the \nsituation. Correction could mean better equipment or better training.\n  What will OSHA's new rule mean? It would prevent 300,000 injuries per \nyear and it would save $9 billion in workers compensation and related \ncosts. It's outrageous that the first major legislation considered by \nthe Senate this year would turn the clock back on worker safety. This \nwould be the first time in OSHA's 30 year history that a worker health \nand safety rule has ever been repealed.\n  As a great nation, it is our duty to protect our most valuable \nresource--our working men and women. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing this resolution.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nresolution that would overturn worker safety regulations designed to \nprevent ergonomic injuries. OSHA's new ergonomic standard addresses the \nnation's most serious job safety and health problem--work related \nmusculoskeletal disorders. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nin 1999 more than 600,000 workers suffered serious workplace injuries \ncaused by repetitive motion and overextension. These injuries can be \npainful and disabling, and can devastate people's lives. Workers in a \nwide variety of jobs and locations are affected, from textile workers \nin New Jersey to white collar workers throughout our nation. These are \nreal people and their lives are being affected in very real ways. At \nthe same time, their injuries impose huge costs on our economy as a \nwhole, roughly $50 billion a year.\n  Mr. President, OSHA has been working to address ergonomic problems \nfor 10 years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. In \nfact, the agency first began its involvement under Labor Secretary \nElizabeth Dole. At the time, Secretary Dole called repetitive strain \ninjuries, and I quote, ``one of the nation's most debilitating across-\nthe-board worker safety and health illnesses of the 1990's.''\n  Unfortunately, after going through a very lengthy rulemaking process, \ncritics of OSHA's efforts have continually put roadblocks in the \nagency's path. These critics have questioned the seriousness of the \nergonomics problem and called repeatedly for additional scientific \nstudies. It's been a strategy of denial and delay.\n  Now, however, there's no longer an excuse for inaction. This January, \nthe National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine released a \nreport documenting the severity of the problem. The report confirmed \nthat workplace exposures do, indeed, cause musculoskeletal disorders \nand that OSHA's approaches to the problem are effective. This should \nnot have been a surprise to anybody, but now its undeniable.\n  Mr. President, I realize that many businesses are concerned that \nOSHA's regulations will impose costs. And it's true that, according to \nthe Department of Labor, employers will pay roughly\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n$4.5 billion annually. Yet, Mr. President, employers also will reap \nsignificant savings when employees avoid repetitive motion and other \ninjuries--savings that are estimated to exceed $9 billion annually, \nmore than twice the up-front costs.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear: I am not ready to endorse every dot \nand comma in OSHA's regulations. But even if some of the burdens of \nOSHA's regulations are excessive, the answer is not to completely \neliminate the regulations. It's to fix them, either administratively \nor, if necessary, through appropriately crafted legislation. By \ncontrast, this resolution adopts a sledge hammer approach. It will kill \nthe entire OSHA regulations and effectively block the agency from \npursuing any other regulation that is substantially similar. That just \ngoes too far. I am new to the Senate and have spent most of my adult \nlife in the private sector. So I want to emphasize that I know most \nbusinesses, or at least most successful businesses, do care about their \nemployees. They want to do the right thing. And they realize that \nbusinesses do better when employees are healthy.\n  Unfortunately, some businesses are less responsible. And it's our job \nto protect their workers. Because if we don't do it, nobody will. And \nthe result will be more injuries, and more needless suffering. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this resolution. And I want to thank Senator \nKennedy and many of my other colleagues for their leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration's, OSHA, recent rule on \n``Ergonomics.'' I have said in the past and I will say again, this rule \nfalls short of sound science and good policy. In fact, this ergonomics \nrule is a poison pill for American industry and its workers in the \nmidst of a slowing economy.\n  In theory, an ergonomics regulation would attempt to reduce \nmusculoskeletal disorders, such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, muscle aches \nand back pain, which, in some instances, have been attributed to on-\nthe-job activities. However, the medical community is divided sharply \non whether scientific evidence has established a true cause-and-effect \nrelationship between such problems and workplace duties. We need to \nunderstand the sound scientific basis to support such a costly and \nburdensome rule. It is in the interest of employers and employees to \nreduce, to the greatest extent possible, the painful, time-consuming \nand profit-consuming impact of ergonomics injuries.\n  Unfortunately, the regulation assumes that employers aren't already \ndoing everything possible to take care of the health and well-being of \nemployees. In fact, recent data seems to indicate that the number of \nwork-related injuries is declining. In the last seven years, the \nincidence of injuries attributed to ergonomics has gone down by a \nthird, 26 percent in carpal tunnel syndrome and 33 percent in \ntendonitis.\n  OSHA finalized this rule during the 11th hour of the Clinton \nadministration. As a result of OSHA's last minute actions, small \nbusiness owners across the country have faced unnecessary confusion, \nfear and misunderstanding regarding their explicit responsibilities, \nthe compliance standards and the liability that they may face as a \nresult of the new rule.\n  It is still unclear how these new regulations will be viewed in light \nof State workers compensation laws. Most believe that it overrules \nthese state laws and as a consequence, workers claiming ergonomics \ninjuries will be allowed to collect more than what would traditionally \nbe allowed under the workers compensation laws in their States. In \naddition, the regulations are extremely unclear as to what must cause \nthe on-set of the injury. For example, if you are a member of a \nsoftball league on your own time and you develop a repetitive motion \ninjury from swinging the bat that is further agitated by your work as a \ncomputer programmer, you could conceivably claim that you have suffered \nan ergonomics injury.\n  This ergonomics rule is conservatively estimated to cost Americans \n$4.2 billion a year. Hundreds of small businesses will surely fold \nunder the weight of this burdensome regulation. Too often the people \nwho suffer the most from unfettered government regulatory actions are \nnot only the small business owners, but their employees, the very \npeople that OSHA purports to protect by this rule.\n  We do have a recourse. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress \nhas the final say. I would like to encourage my colleagues to weigh the \noptions and hopefully come to the same conclusion that I have: These \nregulations are a poison pill for American industry and American \nworkers.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, repetitive stress injuries are a \nserious problem in the workplace of the 21st century. Workers affected \nby repetitive motion injuries range from poultry employees to nurses to \nthe growing number of employees who spend their day in front of the \ncomputer.\n  Repetitive stress injuries are not only extremely painful to workers, \nthey also strain our economy due to lost productivity. According to the \nNational Academy of Sciences, approximately one million workers a year \nsuffer severe repetitive stress injuries that cause them to miss time \nat work. Given the widespread occurrence of these debilitating injuries \nand their impact on the economy, it is appropriate for the government \nto take steps to protect workers.\n  In January, the previous Administration enacted a regulation to help \nprevent repetitive these injuries in the workplace. The issue before \nthe Senate is whether Congress should enact a ``disapproval \nresolution'' to invalidate this new regulation.\n  Over the course of the past few weeks, numerous Missouri workers have \nexpressed their desire for protection from repetitive motion injuries \nin their workplaces. Likewise, many business leaders are concerned that \nthe current regulation is overly broad, and that the cost of \nimplementation will be prohibitively expensive.\n  This is obviously a complex and difficult issue. It deserves a \nthoughtful approach by which all interested parties can express their \nviews and the full range of expert opinion can be evaluated.\n  This issue comes to the Senate under a procedure that does not allow \nfor the type of careful and detailed decision making required for such \nan important topic. Under the Congressional Review Act, a vote in favor \nof a ``disapproval resolution'' will cancel the ergonomic regulation. \nSuch a resolution would also prohibit the Department of Labor from \ndeveloping new ergonomic regulations in ``substantially the same form'' \nas the current regulation.\n  Since this is the first time the Congressional Review Act has been \nused, I asked Labor Secretary Chao for assurances that the Department \nof Labor would take steps to provide legal protections to workers from \nrepetitive stress injuries if Congress canceled the ergonomics \nregulation. Secretary Chao could not provide such assurances.\n  Secretary Chao did not assure me that the administration would issue \nlegal protections, commit to a timetable for addressing this issue, or \nprovide a description of the changes in policy that would be sought.\n  Furthermore, it is clear that if Congress does not cancel the \nregulation, the Department still has many options at its disposal. It \ncould suspend the current rule, conduct an administrative review, and \nmake appropriate changes.\n  Since this is such an important issue, the prudent course is for both \nworkers and employers to engage in an open and full dialogue in an \neffort to reach consensus. I do not believe that overturning the \ncurrent regulation would contribute to this process. In fact, it could \nprematurely end the government's efforts to protect workers from \nserious injuries. Consequently, I will vote against the resolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to express my frustration \nwith the OSHA ergonomics standard.\n  Let me be clear that I am not frustrated with this rule because it \nattempts to improve workplace safety. Musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs, \nare clearly a serious problem. They account for nearly a third of all \nserious job-related injuries. As this issue has come before the Senate, \nI have been a consistent supporter of finding a workable solution to \nthe ergonomics issue. I have voted to let the Administration move \nforward with the rule-making process while new scientific evidence is \nbrought to light.\n  I believe, however, that this OSHA Ergonomics Standard is not the \nsolution we've been looking for. This rule\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\nis constructed in a way that places a potentially heavy financial \nburden on many small businesses in Montana at a time when those \nbusinesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Instead of issuing \na rule that places the burden primarily on businesses, let us work to \nestablish a rule that works with the business community, that helps \nprovide both a better work environment for workers and assists \nbusinesses in making necessary adjustments.\n  Let us also level the playing field. The OSHA Ergonomics Standard \ndoes not apply to employers covered by OSHA's construction, maritime or \nagricultural standards, or employers who operate a railroad. These \nexemptions could create unfair advantages in certain industries. That \nis not right.\n  Additionally, the OSHA Ergonomics Standard supercedes state worker's \ncompensation plans, against OSHA's own provision that it not \n``supercede or in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law.'' \nClearly, any standard should be coordinated with state worker's \ncompensation provisions.\n  Finally, let us address MSDs proactively. The OSHA Ergonomic Standard \nis a reactive rule. Workers must explicitly wait for symptoms to occur \nbefore they can voice a complaint. Let's instead take what we already \nknow about MSDs in the workplace and work to prevent MSDs altogether.\n  My vote is not a vote against health and safety in the workplace. I \nwill remain a strong proponent of efforts that protect workers from \nworkplace risks. My vote is a vote for finding a better way to balance \nthe needs of business and labor, and a vote to keep undue financial \npressures off of Montana's already struggling economy, especially our \nsmall business community.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to state at the outset that I \nsupport Federal workplace safety regulations to ensure that all \nemployees are protected against hazards that exist in their place of \nemployment.\n  I also believe that OSHA should be permitted to impose an ergonomics \nstandard on employers to reduce the number of muscular skeletal \ndisorders, MSDs, that can be linked to repetitive motions that workers \nperform as part of their job. However, to be effective such a standard \nmust be reasonable in scope and proportional to the number of reported \nmuscular skeletal disorders that occur in a particular workplace.\n  I do not support the ergonomics rule we are debating today because it \nfalls short of that standard. After talking to literally hundreds of \nconstituents and touring dozens of factories and plants in my state, I \nam convinced that the current ergonomics rule is unreasonable in terms \nof the requirements it imposes on businesses and unworkable with regard \nto the vagueness of the standards with which employers are expected to \ncomply.\n  The complaints I hear the most are that the cost of compliance is \nvirtually unlimited and that even employers who make good faith efforts \nto meet the standard can never be certain they've done enough because \nthe rule is unclear about when compliance is met. It will take months, \nmaybe years, for the courts to unravel the true meaning of this rule. \nAnd it is my belief that rule making should not be left up to the \ncourts. Frankly, I think those who oppose this rule have a valid \nargument and therefore I intend to support the Resolution of \nDisapproval.\n  I do not think, however, that the debate on a Federal ergonomics \nstandard should end with this vote. The vast majority of business \nowners I've spoken to about this issue are taking genuine, affirmative \nsteps to facilitate a safe and productive working environment for their \nemployees. After all, it's in their best interest not to have workers \nwho are injured and unable to perform capably.\n  I intend to hold them to their word by introducing legislation that \nwill require OSHA to draft a new ergonomics standard within 3 years. If \nthe current standard is not workable, and I do not think it is, then I \nbelieve OSHA has an obligation to work with employers and employees to \nwrite a revised rule that will reduce the number of MSDs in the \nworkplace without penalizing businesses that want to do the right \nthing.\n  In closing, I want to express my disappointment with the take it or \nleave it approach pursued by the Senate Leadership in this matter. In \nrecent weeks we've heard a lot about working together in a bipartisan \nfashion from the President and Senate leaders, but we certainly have \nnot followed that course of action today. I wish my colleagues on the \nother side had demonstrated a willingness to find a middle ground in \nthis debate but the only option we have been given is an all or nothing \nvote with no alternatives. That is not my definition of bipartisanship \nand I do not think it is a productive way to build trust across the \naisle. I hope my colleagues will work harder in the future to make \ntheir pledges of bipartisanship a reality.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I approach the debate on this \nresolution with a considerable degree of disappointment. To put it \nbluntly, it should not have come to this.\n  It is absolutely clear that there is a need for workers to gain \nprotection for ergonomic injuries. All one has to do is spend time in \nany workplace environment to see the stresses that can lead to serious \nback, shoulder, arm, and wrist injuries. These injuries are just as \nreal, and in many cases just as debilitating, as more obvious injuries \nthat are more likely to be covered under state worker's compensation \nlaws.\n  In 1990, then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole recognized the need \nto provide protection from these injuries and directed the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration, OSHA, to issue a rule. After ten \nyears of research, debate, and comments from the business community, \nlabor, and Congress, that rule was issued last November.\n  The rule has many virtues. One of its most prominent advantages is \nthat it focuses on prevention. For the first time, it requires \nemployers to take measures to educate and train their employees on how \nto avoid ergonomic injuries. It is backed up by sound science that \ndemonstrates how ergonomic injuries occur, and helps provide the means \nto prevent them. These provisions alone will help keep millions of \ninjuries from occurring, sparing workers pain and suffering, and their \nemployers lost productivity. In addition, workers who suffer these \ninjuries finally would receive compensation while they receive \ntreatment and, according to 17 state Attorneys General, this does not \ninterfere with their existing worker's compensation laws.\n  I also would concede, for all the virtues of this rule, that it has \nsome serious problems. It places a particularly onerous burden on small \nbusinesses, which may not have the resources to fulfill all of the \nrule's requirements. A better crafted rule would provide some relief \nfor small businesses. The rule also is highly ambiguous with respect to \nits application to agricultural workers. While it says that \nagricultural workers are exempt from the rule, it is not at all clear \nwho that includes. Are workers in nurseries, on-farm packaging and \nprocessing plants, or other jobs done in a farm setting covered by this \nrule? I am told by those in the agriculture community that there is \ngreat confusion on this question. A better crafted rule would provide \nclarity on this point. There is also confusion about how a particular \ninjury may be classified as ergonomic, if there is a dispute between a \nworker and an employer. I agree with those in the business community \nwho have expressed these and other concerns.\n  So the rule has virtues, and it has problems. My sense is that we \nneed a rule, but that the rule needs improvement. Unfortunately, the \nchoice we face on this vote is not whether we should improve the rule, \nbut whether there should be such a rule at all. Under the Congressional \nReview Act, we are given only one choice yea or nay on the rule. And if \nwe vote to disapprove the rule, we have effectively killed any chance \nof ever providing workers with the protection they need. That is \nbecause once we kill it, OSHA is prohibited from ever coming forward \nwith a rule that is deemed to be ``substantially similar.'' This is a \nhighly flawed process for evaluating a somewhat flawed rule. It leaves \nus no option to make recommendations on how this rule can be made \nbetter.\n  Given our options, the best approach, in my view, is to vote to \nsustain the rule, and then work with the Administration to issue new \nguidelines to revise, clarify, and tighten up imperfections. I \nunderstand that Secretary of\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\nLabor Elaine Chao already has indicated a willingness to work with \nCongress to address ergonomic injuries. The best way for us to do that \nis by improving the existing rule, not blowing it up.\n  Given the choice that we are presented with by this resolution, I \ncannot in good conscience cast a vote that will effectively eliminate \nthe possibility of ever protecting workers from ergonomic injuries. I \nwill vote against this resolution and, if it is defeated, I will commit \nto work with my colleagues and the administration to correct the flaws.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this joint \nresolution introduced under the Congressional Review Act to overturn \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's ergonomics rule. It \nis truly unfair and unjustified, after 10 years of study and delay, to \neliminate this regulation which will bring needed protections to \nAmerica's working men and women, tens of millions of them.\n  It was more than a decade ago that increased numbers of injuries and \nworker compensation claims led Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to ask \nfor a rulemaking on an ergonomics standard. At the time, Secretary \nDole, a member of the previous Bush administration, insisted on, and I \nquote, ``the most effective steps necessary to address the problem of \nergonomic hazards on an industry-wide basis.''\n  We are not talking here about an imagined problem or phantom \ninjuries. We are talking about the nation's most vexing workplace \nhealth and safety crisis. We are talking about the very real back, \nwrist and other musculo-skeletal pain and injuries that force a million \npeople to lose time from work each year and that send 600,000 of them \nin search of medical treatment. We are talking about workplace injuries \nthat sap an astonishing $50 billion from the economy each year in lost \nwages and productivity. In Connecticut alone, 13,500 private sector \nemployees and 2,200 public sector workers suffered from musculo-\nskeletal disorders in 1998, the last year for which statistics are \navailable.\n  Just two months ago, the National Academy of Sciences and the \nInstitute of Medicine published the comprehensive and definitive study \nCongress had asked for two years ago. It concludes unequivocally, and \nI'm quoting here: ``. . . there is a relationship between exposure to \nmany workplace factors and an increased risk of musculo-skeletal \ninjuries . . .'' and ``the evidence justifies the introduction of \nappropriate and selected interventions to reduce the risk of musculo-\nskeletal disorders.''\n  It just doesn't get any clearer than that. And yet, supporters of \nthis resolution are still resisting implementation of an ergonomics \nstandard, as they've consistently done since Secretary Dole's call for \na regulation that would protect workers 10 years ago. Despite \nconvincing scientific evidence, from the Department of Labor, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Academy of Sciences, a \nvigorous campaign that for years denied millions of workers common-\nsense relief from their suffering still persists, five months after the \nstandard has been issued. The buzzer has sounded. The game is over. We \nshould all now be getting together to make this common-sense regulation \nwork.\n  This ergonomics rule is a reasonable one. It does not prescribe \ncontrols. In fact, an employer need not make any workplace changes \nuntil a worker suffers an injury and the employer concludes it is work \nrelated. The kind of changes we are talking about include low-cost \nsolutions such as raising or lowering a work station or chair to \neliminate awkward postures, putting wider grips on hand tools, \nor modifying work schedules to include rest breaks or job rotation.\n\n  We know these kinds of adjustments work because many employers have \nsuccessfully experimented with them voluntarily. In 1992, for example, \na grocery store chain headquartered in Connecticut projected $2 million \nin worker compensation costs at its east coast stores. The safety \nmanager estimated that work-related musculo-skeletal disorders cost \nfrom $9,000 to $18,000 per claim and accounted for 54 percent of \nillnesses at the company. After the company implemented an ergonomics \nprogram to purchase adjustable work tables, semi-automatic wrapping \nmachines, vertical scanners and special training for warehouse workers, \nclaims decreased by 50 percent. Workers are protected and money is \nsaved. Incidentally, such voluntary employer-initiated ergonomics \nstandards are ``grandfathered in'' by the OSHA rule.\n  The problem is, many employers have done nothing, despite a 10-year-\nlong public process, including weeks of hearings and testimony from \nthousands of witnesses, and final issuance of the rule last November. I \nknow that some of my colleagues think the common-sense protections \ncontained within this rule are too costly for business, or too \nburdensome, administratively. But my own close examination convinces me \nthat the cost-benefit analysis tips clearly to the benefit side. \nAlthough OSHA estimates implementation of the regulation will cost \nemployers $4.5 billion a year, that is outweighed by the estimated $9.1 \nbillion in estimated savings in compensation, medical expenses, and \nadded productivity. OSHA estimates the average cost of fixing each \nproblem job will be just $250--a small price to pay to relieve the \nconstant physical pain so many workers suffer and to keep those workers \nproductive. Keep in mind, these official calculations don't even take \ninto consideration the intangible benefits that will accrue to healthy \nemployees and their families.\n  I'd like to add a final word about the process which brings the rule \nback before us today. The Congressional Review Act, approved in 1996 as \nan alternative to more onerous regulatory reform legislation, gives \nCongress the power to pass resolutions disapproving of recently adopted \nfederal regulation. Here in the Senate, it establishes fast track \nprocedures limiting committee consideration and floor debate.\n  But the CRA has never actually been used to strike down a rule and I \ndon't think we should set that precedent today. Not only are we being \nforced to make a hurried decision, without benefit of committee \nhearings and reasoned judgment. This resolution of disapproval contains \na sweeping termination of the entire rule, with no exceptions or \ndirection on how to fix it. In other words, OSHA's hands would be tied \nin the future, forbidding the issuance of any rule ``substantially the \nsame.''\n  There is a more appropriate forum for the technical, scientific, \neconomic or legal arguments opponents wish to make against the rule and \nthat's the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nwhere 31 petitions brought by opponents of the rule are pending. \nFurthermore, opponents may petition the Bush Administration to stay, \nmodify or even repeal the rule, which OSHA can do through a new \nrulemaking, if it concludes such an action is warranted.\n  So, I'd say to my colleagues, even if you have concerns about the \nterms of the ergonomics rule, you should oppose a disapproval \nresolution under the Congressional Review Act. There are other, better \nways to protest this regulation, if protest you must. This resolution \nopens a procedural door under the CRA that a lot of us should want to \nkeep closed.\n  OSHA has listened hard to both sides of the debate and adjusted, \naccommodated and readjusted for 10 long years. Last year, the federal \ngovernment finally fulfilled its responsibility to protect millions of \nAmerican workers by approving OSHA's ergonomics rule. We must not \nundermine the progress we have made and jeopardize the safety and well-\nbeing of the millions of Americans who rely on us to do the right \nthing. I ask that each of my colleagues carefully consider the facts on \nworkplace injuries and their debilitating toll on both workers and \nemployers. Then consider the hurt and pain we can so easily prevent by \nupholding this ergonomics rule and defeating this unfortunate \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nopposition on procedural grounds to the resolution of disapproval of \nOSHA's ergonomics standard. This worker protection measure, initiated \nby then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in 1990, is aimed at helping \ndiminish the roughly 600,000 repetitive motion and overexertion \ninjuries incurred each year in the workplace. Using a resolution of \ndisapproval to erase the standard is unnecessary and severe. Revisions \nto the\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nexisting standard are needed, but they will not be realized by the \npassage of this measure.\n  While many businesses have taken steps to remedy repetitive motion \nand overexertion injuries, the problem persists and needs to be \naddressed. The measure currently under consideration, the resolution of \ndisapproval, does not offer much in the way of sensible solutions. In \nfact, it is a resolution that resolves nothing, it may actually \nexacerbate the problem by prohibiting OSHA's ability to issue similar \nmeasures in the future to address problems caused by repetitive motion. \nIn my view, it is a misuse of the process to force a vote that will \nshort-circuit these regulations. At the very least, it is an unusual \ndelegation of responsibility to the legislative branch by the executive \nbranch when administrative responsibilities are available.\n  While I plan to vote against the resolution of disapproval, I do have \na concern about OSHA's current ergonomics rule, and I have asked \nSecretary Chao to initiate as soon as possible the administrative \noptions available to her to revise the current rule. Businesses have \nraised concerns about a number of aspects of the rule, such as its \nscope; its impact on ergonomics programs businesses already have in \nplace; its effect on state workers' compensation laws; and the cost of \ncompliance. I am particularly concerned about the impact of compliance \non small businesses in Nebraska and elsewhere.\n  However, it is my experience that administrative options provide \ngreater opportunity to reach reasonable consensus on issues addressed \nthrough federal regulation. This is why, rather than supporting the \nextreme measure before us today, I have asked for the Administration to \nexercise its administrative authority.\n  By supporting the resolution of disapproval, Congress ignores \nadministrative measures which could produce a more reasonable response. \nThese concerns can be addressed most effectively by an administrative \nrather than a legislative approach. Both businesses and their workers \nwould benefit from a sensible administrative solution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nWyoming has 26 minutes, and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts has 48 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had some comments about the \nimportance of the kinds of protections being debated in the Senate this \nevening; that is, the ergonomics protections. These are the regulations \nto protect against ergonomic injuries.\n  We have had a good deal of criticism of OSHA in the past, criticism \nof regulations that have been issued to try to protect American \nworkers. I know there are many who have spoken in support of this \nresolution, in opposition to the ergonomics rule, who have been \nstrongly critical of OSHA over a long period of time.\n  Let me mention a few facts. According to the National Safety Council \nand the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job fatality rate has been cut \nby 75 percent since 1970. That is 220,000 lives saved since the passage \nof the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Injury rates have also \nfallen. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 11 \ninjuries and illnesses per 100 full-time workers in 1973; by 1998, it \nwas 6.7 per 100 workers.\n  Declines in workplace fatalities and injuries have been greater in \nthose industries where OSHA targeted standards and enforcement \nactivities. In manufacturing, the fatality rate has declined by 66 \npercent and the injury rate by 37 percent since the passage of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act. Similarly, in construction, the \nfatality rate has declined by 78 percent, the injury rate by 55 \npercent.\n  Now some examples of rulemaking and what the results have been. We \nknow now there is a problem. Secretary Dole, more than 10 years ago, \npointed it out. We have the Academy of Sciences that accumulated the \nfacts to demonstrate it, and we have millions of Americans who have the \nergonomic injuries that reflect it.\n  Look at what has happened other times OSHA has taken action. After \nOSHA issued a standard on grain handling, the number of fatalities in \nthis dangerous industry dropped from a high of 65 in 1977, before the \nstandard was in place, to 15 in 1997, a 77-percent decline.\n  OSHA's lead standard has prevented thousands of cases of lead \npoisoning in lead smelting and battery manufacturing. Since the lead \nstandard was issued, the number of workers with high blood-lead levels \nhas dropped by 66 percent.\n  Thousands of construction workers were buried alive in trench cave-\nins before OSHA strengthened the trenching protections. Fatalities have \ndeclined by 35 percent, and hundreds of trench cave-ins have been \nprevented.\n  Before OSHA issued the cotton dust standard, several hundred thousand \ntextile industry workers developed brown lung, a crippling and \nsometimes fatal respiratory disease. In 1978, there was an estimate of \n40,000 cases amounting to 20 percent of the industry's workforce. By \n1985, the rate dropped to 1 percent.\n  This is the record. This is what happens when you issue sound \nregulations to protect American workers in the workforce and in the \nworkplace. Thousands of lives have been saved. Millions of Americans \nhave been helped. This is the record. That would be the case with \nregard to ergonomics if the regulations went into effect. But we are \ntold no, no, no.\n  What price are you going to put on 220,000 American lives? What price \nare you going to place?\n  According to the Academy of Sciences, we are spending $50 billion a \nyear on ergonomic injuries. They are not Democrats. They are not \nRepublicans. They are looking at the facts. Mr. President, $50 billion \na year is what we are spending at the present time.\n  Here we have Business Week--not a Democratic magazine, maybe a \nRepublican magazine--that says it is common sense to put in the \nergonomics regulations and the financial savings will be considerable. \nBusiness Week talking about the same regulations we have had \npromulgated as a result of study after study by the National Academy of \nSciences and others.\n  Yet we are being told tonight we cannot have them, they are too \ncomplicated--too complicated. We just reviewed them. They are simple, \nunderstandable, and they will save American lives.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey on the floor, and I yield him 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding \nand commend him for his leadership on this issue.\n  So many millions of Americans have only us between their work, the \nlabor that they may love or do, a necessity to feed their families, and \nthe inevitability of injury if we do not act.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has noted, indeed, the irony that 10 \nyears ago it was Secretary of Labor Dole who, responding to reports of \nincreased repetitive stress injuries in the workplace, responded by \ninitiating the development of these standards. Secretary Dole called \nthe issue ``one of the Nation's most debilitating across-the-board \nworker safety and health issues.'' Good for her. She was right then, as \nwe are right now.\n  Opposition by industry and their allies in the Congress has at \nvarious times stopped, delayed, forced needless studies--anything--to \nstop the development of a standard designed only to protect the health \nand the safety of working Americans.\n  During these delays, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued reports \nshowing that the number of work-related ergonomic injuries was \nincreasing. Senator Kennedy just cited these numbers. In 1997, they \nreported that ergonomics-related injuries accounted for one-third of \nall lost workday injuries and illness --one-third, amounting to \nthousands and thousands of people unable to perform their labors, \nsustaining serious injury.\n  Finally, last year while the National Academy of Sciences worked on \nits own second congressionally ordered study, Congress allowed OSHA to \ndevelop and issue an ergonomic standard. After 9 weeks of public \nhearings, 1,000 witnesses, 7,000 written comments, 10 years of study \nand debate, OSHA issued the standard this past January. How many \nstudies, how many more years, how many more consistent conclusions? The \nCongress had a right to ask\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nfor the studies. Maybe it was proper to be deferential, to let time \npass until we understood the issue better. But can there be anyone in \nthe Senate, after 10 years of debate and all these studies, through \nDemocratic and Republican administrations, who genuinely doubts any \nlonger the health impact on the American worker?\n  It leads one to believe it is not a doubt about the health of our \nworkers. In my judgment, it is a question of fidelity with their cause. \nThe nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences twice reported a clear \nrelationship between work-related activities and the occurrence of \ninjuries such as back strains. According to the National Academy, \nworkplace ergonomic injuries have led to carpal tunnel syndrome, back \ninjuries, permanent nerve damage in the hands, neck pain, and \ntendonitis. Many of the workers who suffer from these injuries are \ncrippled by debilitating wrist, shoulder, and back pain. Some have had \nto change jobs or even stop working.\n\n  This, obviously, is not good for workers. But can anyone actually \nargue this is good for business? Workers needlessly crippled, missing \nthousands and thousands of hours of work, needing replacement, costly \nmedical treatment? If you didn't care about the workers, why would you \nstill be here arguing this? This isn't good for the workers. This isn't \ngood for business. This just isn't good for the country.\n  There should be no constituency for those opposing these standards. \nThe NAS studies provide us with the science to show just how important \nthis issue is. The point is, if you didn't have the studies, if you \nhadn't studied it again, the injuries and the way they affect lives and \nthese businesses--we are replete with examples.\n  After 14 years as an information technology analyst for the New \nJersey courts, Susan Wright started to develop numbness and tingling in \nher fingers. Here is my study: When she turned a doorknob, Susan would \nfeel something akin to an electric shock in her hands. By 1998, she had \nundergone two operations. Susan's operations were a success and her \noffice has recently had ergonomics training to prevent future injuries \nsuch as Susan's.\n  But not every story ends with a success. Another constituent of mine, \nPattie Byrd of Trenton, has a permanent disability in her right hand \nfrom constant work-related computer use.\n  Susan's and Pattie's injuries could have been prevented. The loss of \ntheir labors in their place of employment was not necessary. The cost \nof training replacements was not necessary. The lost efficiency was not \nrequired. Their pain and their medical expenses were not necessary. It \nall could have been avoided, and that is what these standards are for.\n  They are not limited to computers or office workers. It is a problem \nfor every sector of the economy. They affect industries ranging from \nmeat packing to nursing to truck driving to construction.\n  In the Nation, 1.8 million people report work-related injuries such \nas carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, and back injuries each year; 1.8 \nmillion. Last year more than 600,000 of those injuries were serious \nenough to cause them to miss work, which is why we stand here, not just \nfor the workers--as if that were not good enough--but this is a massive \nproblem in the economy, for the functioning of our businesses, our \noffices in every sector of the economy.\n  The new OSHA standard is expected to prevent hundreds of thousands of \nthese injuries. After 10 years and 6 million unnecessary ergonomic-\nrelated injuries, it is now time. Critics still argue that the OSHA \nstandard is based on bad science. Others fear the standard will cost \ntoo much for business. The facts simply do not bear out these concerns. \nThe National Academy of Sciences report requested by this Congress \nreaffirmed the scientific evidence underlying the standard is strong.\n  If you weren't going to accept the results of the study, why did you \nask for it? If you don't believe in the National Academy of Sciences, \nwhy do we fund them? If you were not going to accept all these years of \nanalysis, all these independent and objective reviews, why did we wait?\n\n  One gets the impression that it is not the evidence, it is not the \ncredibility of the studies, that nothing is going to meet the threshold \nwhere this Congress will act to protect American workers. Maybe that is \nthe worst commentary of all.\n  It is estimated this standard will cost $4.5 billion annually. Maybe. \nBut it can also save $50 billion a year in compensation payments, lost \nwages, and lower productivity. The costs associated with the OSHA \nstandard will be minimal compared to the savings.\n  It is right for these workers. It was a good commentary on this \nCongress and the previous administration that we acted. It will \nsimilarly be a bad commentary on our sensitivity to our people, the \nworkers of our country, and a bad commentary on this Congress if now we \nact to undo that which we did, which was right, after so many years of \nwaiting, after such overpowering evidence.\n  The workers of this country deserve an advocate. It is said that \nevery powerful special interest in America has some advocate in this \nCongress. On this night we determine who are the advocates--who will \nstand for the average American worker who faces these injuries, this \nloss of wages, this pain and suffering? Let me make my position clear. \nThere have been enough studies, enough time has passed, enough people \nhave suffered. Let the standards stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment and congratulate my \ncolleague, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, for his leadership on this issue. \nHe has been shepherding the floor, along with Senator Hutchinson from \nArkansas, and they have done a great job. I think there has been \nilluminating debate. I also wish to congratulate my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, on this issue. We do disagree on a couple \nof issues, but he is still my friend. I respect him.\n  I feel very strongly that we as Senators should protect the \nlegislative functions of Congress and the constitutional division of \npowers between the legislative branch and the executive branch. \nCongress, according to the Constitution, is supposed to write the laws. \nIn fact, article I of the Constitution says that Congress shall write \nall laws. The tenth amendment of the Constitution says all other laws \nare for the States and for the people. Nowhere in the Constitution does \nit say the executive branch, the branch that was charged with enforcing \nlaws, is to legislate.\n  I tell my colleagues and I urge my colleagues who are maybe \npredisposed to vote no on this resolution of disapproval to consider \nthis very carefully. In a free democracy, a democracy where we have \nelected representatives to represent our constituents, we do not have \nand we cannot allow unelected bureaucrats to pass laws.\n  The law of the land, the bill that created OSHA, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act of 1970, is still the current law of the land and \nit states--this is the conference report:\n\n       The bill does not affect any Federal or state workmen's \n     compensation laws, or the rights, duties or liabilities of \n     employers and employees under them.\n\n  That is still the law of the land. Very clearly in the statute it \nsays we are not passing workers comp. It says we are not creating a \nFederal workers compensation system. It says we are not superseding or \nchanging the State workers comp laws.\n  I refer my colleagues to this regulation. It states:\n\n       You must provide that the employee with work restriction \n     protection which maintains the employee's employment rights \n     and benefits in 100 percent of his or her earnings--\n\n  That is compensation. It goes on--\n\n       You must provide [talking about employers] that the \n     employee with work restriction protection which maintains the \n     employee's employment rights and benefits in at least 90 \n     percent of his or her earnings.\n\n  That is compensation. That is workers compensation for not working. \nThat has only been done at the State level. Now we have a Federal \nworkers comp law. That is not consistent with the existing act. In \nother words, the Clinton administration's department of OSHA is \nbreaking the law. They are exceeding the law. They do not have the \nconstitutional authority to enact a Federal workers compensation \nsystem.\n  I heard one of my colleagues say that is not a Federal workers \ncompensation\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nsystem. The heck it is not. You are paying people not to work. You are \npaying people for injuries. That is workers compensation. That is \ncovered by State laws. That is covered, for every single State in the \nNation has worker compensation laws.\n  This one, it just so happens, has compensation that has higher levels \nthan any State in the Nation.\n  Those are the facts. How in the world can we as a legislative body \ndelegate that to some unelected bureaucrat in the Department of Labor? \nWe did not. We have never done it. As a matter of fact, we prohibited \nit. But the Clinton administration tried to do it anyway. They tried to \njam it through on January 16.\n  I heard some people say you are using this Congressional Review Act \nas, I believe Senator Clinton said, a legislative time bomb to undo \nthis legislation that people have been working on for 10 years. The CRA \nwas written and was supported, I might mention, by every person in this \nbody because it passed by unanimous consent, so that Congress would \nhave a chance to review these laws.\n  If there is an economic impact of $100 billion, Congress had better \nhave an input so it can prevent it, stop it, or overturn it. Because we \nare elected officials, we should be held accountable.\n  Who is the legislator in OSHA who wrote this regulation? Who is going \nto hold them accountable? They are gone. As a matter of fact, the \nClinton administration showed contempt of Congress and contempt of the \nnew administration by trying to jam through this enormously complex, \nburdensome, and expensive regulation with 4 days left in their \nadministration.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts said this regulation is only eight \npages. I count the pages a little differently. This little part of the \nregulation is 608 pages, which is interesting. The regulation that was \npromulgated by the Clinton administration in 1999 was 310 pages. Look \nat what happened in that year. Yes, they had a few hearings; 1 year \nlater, 608 pages. It about doubled.\n  Guess what. It is a lot more complex than this. My colleague said it \nis only eight pages. Let's look a little closer at some of the details \nand some of these pages. I guess this goes beyond eight pages. It talks \nabout job hazard analysis tools. We have tools for the job strain index \nand one for revising the NIOSH lifting equation. That is referred to. \nThat wasn't part of the eight pages. If you look at it in the \nregulation, you need to pull that up. We pulled it up. We found the \nNIOSH regulation.\n  There are 164 pages. They came up with standards for lifting. As a \nmatter of fact, they have lifting equations. If you lift anything, I \nguess you go to this NIOSH standard--164 pages. You get lots of \ninformation on how much you can lift.\n  This is all part of the standard--these little equations here.\n  I believe some people said you can read these regulations in a matter \nof 20 minutes.\n  I will insert this one page in the Record, and I defy anybody to tell \nme what it means:\n\n       The multitask lifting analysis consists of the following \n     three steps: Compute the frequency independent RWL, FIRWL, \n     and the frequency independent lifting index. That is FILI \n     values for each task using the default PM of 1.0.\n       Compute the single task RWL. That is the STRWL, and the \n     single task lifting index, STLI, for each task. Note in this \n     example that interpolation was used to compute the FM value \n     for each task because the lifting frequency rate was not a \n     whole number. Remember the task in order of decreasing \n     physical stress as determined from the STLI value starting \n     the task with the largest STLI.\n\n  I could go on and on and on. This is almost funny. But it is not \nfunny because we don't change it, and if we don't stop this regulation, \nand stop it tonight, everybody in America is going to be trying to \nfigure out what STLI means, and what all of these other little acronyms \nstand for, and so on. And they are going to say: You mean to tell me we \ncan't move 20 pounds of force? We can't lift items more than 75 pounds? \nYou mean to tell me that every single grocery store in America is going \nto be in gross violation of these standards? You mean that every single \nperson involved in bottling or every single person involved in moving \nis going to be in gross violation of these standards and we will never, \never be able to comply with these ridiculous standards that were jammed \nthrough in the last 4 days of the Clinton administration? We are going \nto make them violators of the law and fine them or we are just going to \nsay hire lots more people. Is that the purpose of it?\n  Let's look at the next standard. Here is one dealing with vibration. \nI think this was referred to earlier. This deals with vibration. I ran \na manufacturing plant. I will tell you that any manufacturing plant in \nAmerica has a lot of vibration, sanding, grinding, and people doing a \nlot of different types of motion that require vibration.\n  Again, this was not included in Senator Kennedy's pages. I think \nthere are only 22 pages, but it is pretty complex. I look at the \nformula for complying with this. I used to do very well in math, I \nmight mention, in college. But, for the life of me, it is going to take \nsomebody a lot smarter than I. Maybe colleagues who support this \nregulation can figure out what this equation means where T is equal to \nwhatever that equation says. We are going to tell Americans who have \ncompanies that have vibration, grinding, and motion that they have to \ncomply with this ridiculous formula--that thousands of businesses are \ngoing to have to comply with this? That is in this regulation that \nsomebody said was eight pages. It is in this 800-and-some pages that \nare in the regulations.\n  Some people said: Where do you get 800 pages? The regulations \npromulgated 608 pages. But they refer to several studies including \nstudies like this that add up to another 227 pages, at least. It is \nactually more than that, because one of the studies we can't even get a \ncopy of. I have excellent staff, but no one can get a copy of it. We \ndon't know how many pages are in one of those referred to in the job \nhazardous analysis tool to which they referred.\n  They give Web sites so people can download so they can get this kind \nof equation and basically say comply, because the big hand of the \nFederal Government is going to come in and hit you hard if you do not. \nAs a matter of fact, they will tell you that you have to change your \nbusiness, maybe relocate your business, or redesign your business. \nSomebody from OSHA is doing all of this. Somebody who is unelected can \nput that kind of mandate on every business in America, presumably \nbecause they know better. They know better than the State in workers \ncomp? Again, it is in violation of the law because some bureaucrat was \nable to come up with that? I just totally disagree.\n  I heard a couple of Members comment saying: Wait a minute, the people \nfighting for this are fighting for special interests--the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, or NFIB. Hogwash. \nThe only thing that was special interest was the Clinton administration \ntrying to jam this regulation through in the last 4 days of the \nClinton administration. This is the special interest. This regulation \nis the special interest that the Clinton administration was trying to \njam through.\n\n  Congress, thank goodness, passed a law that said we can review in an \nexpedited form regulations that cost a whole lot of money. That is the \nreason we are using the CRA. Some people said: If you use that, you \ncan't even talk about this regulation and ergonomics is dead forever. \nThat is not what the Secretary of Labor said. The Secretary of Labor \nsaid:\n\n       I intend to pursue a comprehensive approach to ergonomics, \n     which may include new rulemaking that addresses the concerns \n     levied against the current standard. This approach will \n     provide employers with achievable measures that protect their \n     employees before injuries occur. Repetitive stress injuries \n     in the workplace are important problems. I recognize this \n     critical challenge and want you to understand that safety and \n     health in our Nation's workforce will always be a priority in \n     my tenure as Secretary.\n\n  In other words, she is going to work to reduce work injuries. I will \nwork with her, and I think every Member of the body should.\n  What we shouldn't do is promulgate a regulation and say: Here it is. \nYou are stuck with it. It may cost over $100 billion a year. We don't \ncare how much it costs.\n  That is ridiculous. Let's work with the new Secretary of Labor. Maybe \nwe don't need to repromulgate a new regulation. Maybe we can do a lot \nof things that will reduce workplace injuries\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nwithout saying to States that we don't care what your worker comp laws \nare, we are going to come up with a Federal workers comp.\n  If this is so good, if we are successful in repealing this, which I \nhope we will tonight and I hope soon in the House, if my colleagues \nwant this to become the law of the land, I encourage them to introduce \nit as legislation. I am only assistant majority leader, but I will \nencourage my colleagues to have hearings on this. If they really think \nwe need a Federal worker compensation law, let's have a hearing on \nit. Let's discuss it. Is that what the Federal Government should do? At \nleast I will be comfortable that it is going through the legislative \nprocess.\n\n  My biggest objection to this is that the Clinton administration could \nnot get something through by legislation, so they did it by regulation. \nI find that in contempt of Congress; I find it in contempt of the \nConstitution, in violation of the Constitution, in violation of the \nOSHA law that was written in 1970, as I plainly showed just a moment \nago.\n  Some people are born to regulate. The author of this legislation \nstates exactly that. Martha Kent, who was the former Director of the \nOSHA Safety Standards Program, in May of 2000, in an interview that she \ngave with the American Industrial Hygiene Association, said this:\n\n       I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I don't know \n     why, but that's very true. So long as I'm regulating, I'm \n     happy. . . . I think that is really where the thrill comes \n     from. And it is a thrill; it's a high.\n\n  She may love to regulate. She also got into the legislative business. \nWe are in the legislative business. We should protect our legislative \nrights. Her legislation may be well intended, but it is not very good. \nIt is enormously expensive. It needs to be stopped. And then let's work \ntogether to see if we can do some things in a bipartisan fashion \nthrough the legislative process, through the normal process--not \njamming a reg through in the last couple days of a lame duck \nadministration--and come up with some things that will help American \nworkers.\n  This bill does not help American workers. This bill would result in a \nlot of businesses going bankrupt, a lot of people losing their \nbusinesses, unemploying people. That is not healthy. That is not good \nfor the American workforce and certainly not good for technology.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution.\n  I again notify my colleagues there will be a vote at 8:15 tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nyielded 12 minutes and is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I had a chance to debate this resolution earlier \ntoday. But after hearing my colleagues throughout the day, I want to \nrespond one more time. While I am on the floor, I want to thank Senator \nKennedy for his great leadership on this resolution, and, for that \nmatter, for always being there for working people in the country.\n  In my hand are reports from a lot of different businesses in \nMinnesota--I mentioned three of them earlier--that have an ergonomics \nstandard, a very successful standard. Interestingly enough, that is \nexactly what this OSHA rule is patterned after--best practices by the \nprivate sector. I also hold in my hand this report by the National \nAcademy of Sciences which is titled ``Musculoskeletal Disorders.'' \nAgain, this is precisely what many of the critics of this rule wanted. \nThey wanted the Academy to do a study. The Academy did a study and they \nfound out some enormous problems in the workplace.\n  The Academy also found out there were, indeed, practices that could \nbe put in effect that could make a huge difference in terms of \nlessening the injuries, lessening the disability, lessening the pain. \nInterestingly enough, again, this OSHA rule is really a reflection of \nthis Academy study.\n  I think I have decided, after listening to this debate, that for some \nof my colleagues--who are friends; but this is a policy disagreement--\nit never will be time for this kind of protection for our workforce, \nfor the many men and women in our workforce. There are more women than \nmen in the workplace.\n  I cannot believe that so many of my colleagues have been so exercised \nthroughout the day that OSHA, an agency that has the mission of looking \nout for the health and safety of workers in the workplace, would \npromulgate a rule dealing with really one of the most serious problems \nin the workplace today--repetitive stress injury.\n  I cannot believe the shock that I hear from Senators who are in favor \nof this resolution, that OSHA, of all of the agencies, should \npromulgate a rule which deals with repetitive stress injury and would \nprovide protection to men and women at the workplace.\n  This is the mission of OSHA. This is a rule that has been 10 years in \nthe making--going all the way back to Elizabeth Dole and up to now.\n  I really think this debate is about another issue, which I want to \nraise in the few minutes I have remaining. I am trying to understand \nthe intensity of the opposition, since many of the arguments I have \nheard made, I do not think fit with a lot of the facts, fit with 10 \nyears of work. I am trying to figure out why the rush to judgment. Why \nare my colleagues so determined to overturn this rule which provides \nprotection for people? And here is what I have decided.\n  I think in many ways this opposition is opposition to the mission of \nOSHA. This legislation was not without controversy. And really, when we \nstarted talking about occupational health and safety, it was a bit like \nenvironmental protection. In fact, these are environmental issues. This \nis the environment at the workplace.\n\n  What we said, when we created OSHA some 30 years ago, was that the \nprivate sector is what makes the economy go. And the private sector can \nmake a profit; and that can be good, up to the point where you are \nputting people at the workplace--or for that matter, the water, or the \nair, or the land--in jeopardy.\n  Then what we said was, commercial logic stops, and public interest \nlogic starts. That is what is upsetting many of my colleagues. What we \nhave here is a rule that is all about public interest. What we have is \na rule that says it is important for the private sector to be as \nsuccessful as possible; but there comes a point when hard-working \npeople are injured at the workplace--quite often disabled, quite often \nin pain, quite often in pain for the rest of their lives, and never \nable to work again--when we get to that point, the commercial logic \nstops and the public interest logic starts.\n  Of course, unfortunately, because I worry about the result tonight, \nfor many working people, many ordinary citizens do not own the capital; \nthey do not own the big companies. They just work hard. They work at \nthese jobs. Do you know what else. People know they are going to be in \ntrouble. They know what the repetitive stress is doing to them. They \nknow what the effect is on their lower back from the lifting. They know \nit. They know they are going to be in trouble. They know they could be \ndisabled.\n  But this is a class issue. These men and women do not have the \noptions that Senators have, and, frankly, most of our families have, \nand most of our friends have, which is to easily go to other work. They \ndo not have that option.\n  So these ordinary citizens--which I do not mean in a pejorative sense \nbut in a positive way--look to us. They look to Government. They look \nto Government to be on their side.\n  I think it is a tragedy that this resolution could very well pass \ntonight. I think it is unconscionable that this resolution could very \nwell pass tonight. I believe, once again, the message of passing this \nresolution tonight is to say to many citizens in our country, who are \nnot the big players and the heavy hitters--and they are not powerful, \nand they are not high income, and they do not have a lot of lobbyists--\nI think the message to them is: You are expendable.\n  We have heard about the cost--$100 billion. I am trying to figure out \nfrom where in the world that comes. That is a theoretical estimate, as \nfar as I can tell, looking at the figures and trying\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nto figure out how anyone arrived at that. I do know that OSHA says it \nis $4.5 billion, but that is offset by savings.\n  I have heard other Senators talk about savings--savings in that now \npeople can work; savings in that people do not have to go for workers \ncomp; savings in that people will be more productive.\n  Do you know what I think is the greatest savings of all? The greatest \nsavings of all, which apparently does not get figured into any of the \ndollars, is when you can have women and men who can work to support \ntheir families, work without being injured, without being in pain, \nwithout being disabled, being able to live their lives, being able to \nsupport their families.\n  That is what this rule is about. Don't trivialize this question. That \nis what this rule is about. I hope my colleagues will vote against this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  To hopefully dispose of some of the differences that have been \nexpressed this evening about the size of the rule, I stand by the \nactual OSHA standard, which is 8 pages long. It is written in plain \nEnglish. It is accompanied by 16 pages of fact sheets and appendices. \nThe remaining 583 pages that are being mentioned here as part of the \n600 pages comprise the preamble and background materials required by \nthe regulatory process.\n  It is interesting how the regulatory process requires that. That is \nas a result of what they call the SBREFA and other laws that Congress \nhas passed, as well as of Executive Orders of President Reagan and \nformer President Bush. This material is required. If my colleagues \nwould like to do something about it, let us get the Administration to \nchange that. Otherwise, this material will be required to be submitted.\n  I am a believer in OSHA. I mentioned earlier the progress that has \nbeen made. Let me mention very quickly what some of the results have \nbeen as a result of the work of OSHA between 1973 and 1998.\n  In the area of manufacturing, you had 15 deaths per 100 full-time \nworkers in 1973. In 1998, that was down to 9.7. In the construction \nindustry, the number was 19.8 in 1973. In 1998, it was 8.8, virtually \nhalf. In total, the case rate in mining, 12.5 percent in 1973; 4.9 \npercent in 1998. These are real results. These are lives saved.\n  You have a similar record in terms of illnesses and occupational \nhazards. That is the result.\n  I am not saying that every time OSHA promulgates a regulation it is \nnecessarily right, but what you have heard today on the floor of the \nSenate is a wholesale assault on the Occupational Health and Safety \nAdministration.\n\n  It does make a difference whether we have Administrators of OSHA who \nare committed to OSHA or whether they are not. Under the Reagan \nAdministration, injury rates increased from 7.6 per hundred in 1983 to \n8.9 per hundred in 1992. We had Administrators who were not committed \nto OSHA. During the Clinton Administration, we had a reduction in \ninjury rates from 8.6 per hundred in 1993 to 6.3 per hundred in 1999. \nThis is the lowest rate in OSHA's 30-year history. These are lives that \nare saved. These are illnesses that are prevented. These are \nprotections for America's workers. That is what this issue is about.\n  We hear, well, we didn't elect those people over at OSHA. We haven't \nelected the people at the FDA who promulgate the rules and regulations \nto make sure our pharmaceuticals will be safe and efficacious. We \nrequire them to be so. We rely on those rules and regulations. There \nare regulations to ensure the safety of medical devices and cosmetics.\n  We look to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue rules and \nregulations to require safety in toys. We look to the FAA to protect \nour airline passengers. We look to the Clean Air Act and the Clean \nWater Act to make sure the air we breathe and the water we drink will \nbe pure. The officials at EPA who issue regulations to do this are not \nelected. They promulgate regulations. As a result of regulations, we \nhave the safest food in the world. We have the best pharmaceuticals in \nthe world. We have the best medical devices. We have the purest air and \nwe have the cleanest water. Period. We have the safest workplaces. \nPeriod. That is as a result of regulation. Period.\n  That brings us to what we are faced with tonight. We have a rule that \nis targeted on the No. 1 health and safety issue affecting workers in \nthe workplace. As has been pointed out all day, this does not come as a \nsurprise. And it was not in the last 4 days of the Clinton \nadministration. It was the result of more than 10 years of study.\n  The fact is, those who are effectively eliminating this rule have to \nunderstand what all of us understand: Over the last 10 years, every \nsingle attempt to try to promulgate rules and regulations has been \nopposed and fought every step along the way. This has been illustrated \nby many of our colleagues. There have been add-ons, riders to various \nappropriations. There have been attempts to block new regulations right \nfrom the very beginning.\n  We are not coming to this as an institution with clean hands because \nwe know the forces that have been out there for the last 10 years \nopposing any ergonomics regulations. They are opposed to rules and \nregulations promulgated by OSHA, but they are also opposed to rules and \nregulations that are voluntary, developed by various business groups. \nThe business community and the Chamber have been out there opposing \neven those voluntary efforts. They have been opposing every State \nregulation.\n  It would be one thing to say we don't really need it because the \nStates are already doing it. They are not doing it because of the power \nof the special interest groups that have been resisting it. We haven't \nheard, after all day long, one single example of one ergonomics \nregulation that is supported by those who want to eliminate this rule. \nNot one. I have listened. I have waited. I have sat here all day long. \nThere is none, not a single one, because they are not for any of it.\n  And there is another misleading argument that has been made by my \ncolleagues with regard to states. They claim that the ergonomics rule \nundermines state workers' compensation laws. This is false. The WRP \npayments required by the rule are not workers' compensation. Seventeen \nstate attorneys general have written telling us that.\n  WRP is preventative. Workers will not report ergonomic injuries if \nthey will lose money to support their families. Only if those injuries \nare caught early can people be saved from permanent disabilities.\n  WRP and workers' compensation are entirely separate. The employer's \ndoctor decides whether a worker gets WRP. All standards for eligibility \nfor workers' compensation remain unchanged.\n  The standards which protect workers from lead, benzene, cadmium, \nformaldehyde, methylene chloride and MDA include WRP, and the federal \ncourts have said it's perfectly fine.\n  But we would kill this rule because its opponents have the votes. \nThis idea that, well, tomorrow we will pass a nice resolution to get \nthe Department of Labor to work out something, they ought to be able to \ndo it quickly and everything will be hunky-dory, is baloney. There \nisn't the slightest chance in the world of it.\n  This is the first time in 30 years that an OSHA rule is being \noverturned, as it is here tonight. We ask ourselves why, why are we \ndoing this when we know that there is a real problem? It isn't just us \nwho know it is a problem, it is the millions of Americans who are \naffected and hurt every year that say it is a problem. Every group that \nhas studied it has said it is a problem. Every women's group in the \ncountry knows it is a problem. They are the ones who are bearing the \nburden. Seventy percent of all the injuries happen to women in our \nsociety.\n  It is a big problem. According to the Academy of Sciences, $50 \nbillion worth of a problem. We know the problem is out there. We know \nthere have been months, years of study, hearings, study after study \nafter study out there to try to come forward with these regulations.\n  Now, in a matter of a few hours today, we are virtually dismissing \nthem. The proposal that is supported by the Republicans will deny OSHA \nthe opportunity to promulgate meaningful regulations in this area. The \nstatute\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nwill not permit them to issue substantially similar regulations. We \nwill not be providing those protections. It is a major weakening in \nterms of the protections for American workers.\n  This it is for the 100 million American workers who today, tonight, \nand tomorrow go to workplaces, the more than 6 million workplaces \nacross the country. If we are not going to protect them now, there is \nno one who is going to protect them.\n  We have a recommendation that has been studied and reviewed. We know \nwhat is at risk. If we do not do this, we know the people who are going \nto be constantly hurt, working families being hurt day in and day out \nin the future.\n  This is our last chance. Unless we protect them, the result is going \nto be devastating.\n  This resolution is antiworker, antiwoman, and, basically, I believe, \na political payoff for groups that have been involved in fighting this \nand making the contributions to undermine the safety and security for \nAmerican workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is wrong, Mr. President. I hope it will not pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the time \nallocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for the extraordinary work, his leadership, the \ncommitment he has made, and the passion and eloquence he has again \ndemonstrated on this issue. No one cares more deeply about working \npeople and has committed more of his public life to working people than \nhas he. This fight, again, is an illustration of the deep, passionate \ncommitment he holds for working Americans. I congratulate him and thank \nhim.\n  As others have noted, it was in 1990, over 10 years ago, then-Labor \nSecretary Elizabeth Dole announced that the Federal Government would \ntake what she called ``the most effective steps necessary'' to reduce \nergonomic hazards that injure and cripple millions of workers every \nyear.\n  It took 10\\1/2\\ years of research and three exhaustive studies, but \nwe finally have a modest, reasonable ergonomics rule. And now, only \nafter 10 hours of debate, with no public hearings, we are on the verge \nof wiping out that 10 years' worth of work.\n  Before we vote on this misguided measure, let me be very clear. Men \nand women across this country will be injured and crippled because of \nthe pressure for this quick political victory. Millions more will have \nto live with the same pain that Shirley Smith lives with tonight.\n  Mrs. Smith is the mother of four. She used to work in a poultry \nprocessing factory in North Carolina. She cut chicken breasts on a \nfast-moving line, using a dull knife, until she could not hold the \nknife anymore. At 41 years old, she was disabled by her work. She can't \nwork anymore. She can't do a lot of things anymore. Listen to her \nwords:\n\n       I go to bed in pain. I wake up in pain. I can't do things \n     like I used to--like playing football with my kids. I can't \n     fix a big meal like I used to, or hang up clothes, or do yard \n     work at all. I can't even go to the grocery store because I \n     can't push the cart alone.\n\n  Shirley Smith is, unfortunately, just one in a million. One in a \nmillion.\n  The most recent report by the National Academy of Sciences found \nthat, in 1999 alone, 1 million people took time away from work to treat \nand recover from work-related ergonomic injuries--a million people. \nThat is 300,000 people more than live in the entire State of South \nDakota.\n  More workers lose time from work because of ergonomic injuries than \nany other type of workplace injury. That is a fact, not an assertion. \nOne out of every three workplace injuries serious enough to keep \nworkers off the job is caused by ergonomics.\n  The cost of these injuries is staggering. When you add \nup compensation costs, workers' medical expenses, lost wages, and lost \nproductivity, it comes down, conservatively estimated, to $50 billion a \nyear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common types of \nrepetitive motion injuries, causing workers to lose more time from \ntheir jobs than any other type of injury, even amputation. The loss to \nbusinesses is immense. The cost to workers is even worse.\n\n  Repetitive stress injuries are serious injuries. They can cause \npermanent crippling and unending pain. Women are especially at risk. \nWhile women make up 40 percent of the overall workforce, they account \nfor more than 64 percent of repetitive motion injuries. Two out of \nevery three women hurt on the job are hurt because of ergonomic job \nhazards.\n  Opponents of this ergonomics rule condemn it as an eleventh hour \nrulemaking by an outgoing administration. Let me tell you, that is not \ntrue. This all started, as I said a moment ago, by a Republican, the \nSecretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, when she announced, at the \nbeginning of the rulemaking process in August of 1990, that something \nhad to be done.\n  In 1992, her successor, also a Republican, then-Secretary Lynn \nMartin, issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on ergonomics. \nFor the next 7 years, the Federal Government examined virtually every \nstudy done on ergonomics and workplace injuries. And before issuing a \nfinal rule, OSHA extended the comment period just to be sure they had \ngiven everybody a chance to comment. They held 9 weeks of public \nhearings, heard more than a thousand witnesses, and reviewed over 7,000 \nwritten comments. The rulemaking process was public and, obviously, it \nwas exhaustive.\n  Only after doing all of that did OSHA issue its final rule last \nNovember. This ergonomics rule reflects an extraordinary amount of \npublic comment and advice and the latest scientific understanding of \nworkplace injuries. Both the National Academy of Sciences and the \nNational Institute For Occupational Safety and Health--the leading \nexperts--agree: ergonomic hazards in the workplace cause injuries. \nMoreover, these experts agree that minor modifications to the workplace \ncan prevent ergonomic injuries. So if ergonomics is as big a problem as \nwe have been now told and if the minor modifications called for in this \nOSHA rule can help, then why not allow it to work?\n  The rule the Department of Labor crafted is sensible, flexible and \nmodest. To begin with, it exempts many industries such as agriculture \nand construction. In industries that are covered, the rules contain \nonly one universal requirement--one. It requires employers to inform \nworkers about signs and symptoms of ergonomic injuries and give them a \nway to report such injuries. That is it.\n  Only if an employee is injured, and the employer determines the \ninjury is work related, is the employer required to take measures to \naddress the job hazards. And when it is all said and done, it is the \nemployer who determines what constitutes an appropriate remedy. This, \nto me, is the most remarkable aspect of it all--who is the arbiter of \nthe decision about work-relatedness and what must be done to remedy the \nsituation? The employer. The employer is the one who decides whether an \nemployee has a work-related injury. The employer makes the decision \nwhether and how to address the problem.\n  Does that sound onerous to you? Does it really sound like a one-size-\nfits-all approach? I find it hard to believe that anybody could answer \nyes to those questions. But even if you do believe those things, this \nresolution of disapproval is exactly the wrong approach. Instead of a \ndeliberative and thoughtful review, the Congressional Review Act is an \nall-or-nothing approach. After 10 years of work, it all comes down to \n10 hours of debate and not one hearing. With so much at stake, it \nstrikes me that this is exactly the wrong way to proceed.\n  There has to be a better way. There is a better way. Instead of \nthrowing out this rule, OSHA could go back to the drawing board today, \nunder this administration's guidance, and change the ergonomics rule in \nany way, shape, or form they wish. They could do it today. They could \nstart that process today.\n  Under current law, all they have to do is publish a notice of intent \nto reopen the rule in the Federal Register and provide an opportunity \nfor public comment, period. Instead of encouraging that sort of \ninclusive process,\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nthis resolution constrains OSHA's ability to regulate in this area in \nthe future. We know that.\n  Backers of this resolution insist that it merely requires OSHA to \nrework its rule. I hope they are correct. I hope they are correct.\n  I hope that Secretary Chao will take seriously her responsibility \nunder the Occupational Safety and Health Act to ``assure, so far as \npossible, every working man and women in the Nation safe and healthful \nworking conditions.'' I hope she will read the rich record that was \ndeveloped to support this rule.\n  I hope she will direct the Labor Department to work aggressively to \ncraft a new rule. I trust she will not be misled by those who oppose \nergonomic standards.\n  I take for granted simple tasks such as cooking dinner with my wife, \ndressing myself, opening doors, and turning the page of a book. Shirley \nSmith can't take these things for granted. For her, and millions of \nother Americans who have been disabled on the job, these simple tasks \nrequire heroic strength. By repealing this rule, we are letting her \ndown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am not going to go over the familiar \narguments that are real, that this is about the wrong way to go about \nthis. This debate reminds me of a famous expression attributed to \nOliver Wendell Holmes: Prejudice is like the pupil of the eye: The more \nlights you shine on it, the more tightly it closes.\n  This is like a religious argument. This is like a holy war. This is \nlike the debate we are going to hear on the bankruptcy bill: a lot of \nhyperbole and talk about how bad this is.\n  The fact of the matter is these arguments sound very familiar. In \nfact, in the many years I have had the honor of serving in the Senate, \nI have heard them often. Every time we debate the wisdom of raising the \nminimum wage so low-income workers can make a viable living, we hear it \nis going to put people out of business. The fact is it never happens. \nIt does not stop my earnest colleagues from making the exact same \narguments again and again every time we raise the issue.\n  It is not just in the context of debating the minimum wage that I \nrecall arguments about businesses facing the prospect of having to shut \ndown to comply with Federal rules and regulations. In fact, virtually \nevery time OSHA issues a ruling, claims are made about the enormous \ncosts businesses will incur.\n  In 1974--and I am dating myself--when OSHA issued the ruling to \nreduce worker exposure to vinyl chloride, the cancer-causing gas, we \nwere warned that the entire plastics industry would fold.\n  I add my voice to those who are appalled that the Senate is even \ndealing with the issue of reversing OSHA's rule.\n  It was during the Administration of President George Herbert Walker \nBush that the Labor Secretary, Liddy Dole, began the 10-year long \nprocess that resulted in OSHA putting forth this regulation to protect \nAmerican workers.\n  During that 10-year period, every interested party--from business to \nlabor, scientists and academics, politicians, lobbyists and ordinary \ncitizens--had more than ample time to raise whatever concerns they had. \nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration weighed the arguments \nand came out with a regulation designed to protect millions of American \nworkers whose jobs often lead to various injuries and ailments.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues may disagree with this \nregulation. And they have every right to do so. They may even go so far \nas to support those who already have gone to court to file legal \nchallenges, or they may decide to work on legislation that might in \nsome way amend or negate OSHA's rule. That would be an appropriate way \nto proceed.\n  But this rushed debate is beneath the Senate. We puff out our chests \nwhen people refer to us as ``the worlds greatest deliberative body.''\n  Where's the deliberation?\n  Where are the hearings?\n  Where are the witnesses?\n  How can we act with such impunity after 10 years of work that took \ninto account every expert out there, including the input of the \nNational Academy of Sciences?\n  I am not indifferent to the arguments made by my friends in the \nbusiness community. I know they feel that there are costs involved in \nimplementing this rule, and these costs are real.\n  I ask my friends to look at some facts. Injuries to workers are not \nbad just for those individuals. There are real losses to employers in \nterms of higher insurance costs and lost productivity.\n  Most business men and women understand this and are responsive \nbecause it makes good business sense. I have heard from those \nexpressing their concerns with the OSHA regulation, but these Delaware \nbusiness people who are out in front of the curve, who have already \ntaken precautionary measures to protect their workers, who will not be \ngreatly affected because they value their employees and want to protect \nthem from potential job-related harm.\n  Let me conclude by responding directly to my colleagues who argue \nthat adhering to these guidelines is so onerous and expensive that it \nwill put many companies out of business.\n  These arguments sound familiar. In fact, in the many years I've had \nthe honor to serve in the Senate. I have heard them often. Every time \nwe debate the wisdom of raising the minimum wage so that low-income \nworkers can make a livable wage and climb above the poverty line, we \nhear the argument that unemployment rates will surely rise.\n  The fact it never happens does not stop my earnest colleagues from \nmaking the exact same argument again the next time we have that debate.\n  It is not just in the context of debating minimum wage that I recall \nthe argument about businesses facing the prospect of having to shut \ndown to comply with a Federal law or regulation.\n  In fact, virtually every time OSHA issues a ruling, claims are made \nabout the enormous costs businesses will incur. In 1974, when OSHA \nissued a ruling to reduce worker exposure to vinyl chloride, a cancer-\ncausing gas, we were warned the entire plastics industry would fold.\n  The industry said it would cost from $65 to $90 billion to meet the \nnew standard. OSHA estimated it would cost one billion dollars. Who was \nright?\n  Neither.\n  OSHA overestimated by a factor of four. The plastics industry got \nbusy and eliminated the vinyl chloride hazard at a cost of just under \n$280 million. They were off in their estimates by many billions of \ndollars.\n  The same thing happened when OSHA proposed limiting worker exposure \nto cotton dust, and again with formaldehyde, and again with lead, and \non and on. We hear about astronomical dollar figures and the threat \nthat businesses and entire industries will come to an end.\n  Then, later, we learn that businesses, using their creative skills, \ncome up with innovative measures to deal with the challenge, and solve \ntheir problems in a cost-effective way.\n  I say to my colleagues, let's not get caught up in hyperbole. If \nthere are legitimate questions, there are remedies under our democracy. \nAfter 10 years of consideration, we cannot roll back these worker \nprotections in just a few hours of debate and then continue to refer to \nthis institution as a ``deliberative body.''\n  We might as well just get rid of OSHA entirely if we roll back this \nregulation. I know some of my colleagues think that is not such a bad \nidea, but I cannot believe a majority of my colleagues think American \nworkers, and the institutions of government we revere, do not deserve \nbetter than what is proposed today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator's time has expired. \nWho yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the remaining time will be used by the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from South Dakota has stated it so well in\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nthe final moments of this debate. We are being urged in the Senate, at \nthe start of this administration, to reach out our hand and try to find \ncommon ground on public policy issues. We are attempting to do that in \nareas of education, health care, and in many other areas. That is what \nwe want to do with this regulation.\n  We would like to have the process followed where the President makes \na petition in the Federal Register and then there will be an \nopportunity to review this rule and do it in a sensible, responsible, \nbipartisan way, but not to throw out 10 years of work. That is what we \nare asking. That is what we are requesting. That is what we think is \nreasonable and responsible to protect the lives and well-being of our \nfellow Americans.\n  On the other side, if they refuse to do so, they are effectively \nsaying that the interest of the workers, primarily women, can be \nsacrificed on the chopping block of political expediency. That is \nunacceptable.\n  If the safety of workers is going to be compromised tonight, what \nwill it be tomorrow? Will it be the safety of our food supply, the \nsafety of our air, the safety of our water, the safety of our \nprescription drugs, the safety of medical devices, the safety of our \nairports? What will it be tomorrow?\n  This is the wrong way to proceed. We are saying let's reach out and \ntry to work this out. Let's not cast the interest of the workers on the \nchopping block. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of our time. I \nask unanimous consent, since I have listened so many times to the \nexample of the chickens and the processing of the chickens, that the \nresponse by the Senator from Arkansas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 6, 2001]\n\n                           Stressed Politics\n\n       In the final days of the Clinton Administration--and with \n     apparently as much attention to detail as the pardon \n     process--more than 600 pages of ergonomics regulations were \n     hastily finalized. These regulations would force every \n     employer to adopt a complete ergonomics program if just one \n     ``symptom'' of stress is found in an employee, even if that \n     employee developed the injury in athletics or weekend \n     gardening.\n       This week, however, after 65 years of increasingly \n     abdicating its lawmaking responsibilities to federal \n     bureaucrats, Congress may finally assert its authority and \n     rescind Mr. Clinton's unworkable ergonomic regulations. \n     Forcing a rewrite of repetitive stress injury rules would not \n     only save billions, but also shock bureaucrats into the \n     realization that if their rule making is too sloppy or \n     unscientific there are ways of stopping them.\n       The debate that begins today in the Senate was made \n     possible by the 1996 Congressional Review Act. It allows a \n     simple majority of both houses of Congress to reject federal \n     regulations that have an impact of at least $100 million a \n     year. In part because the regulations must be rescinded \n     within 60 days of final promulgation, Congress hasn't really \n     used the weapon. That goes some way toward showing how \n     outrageous these last gasp Clinton ergonomics regulations \n     must be.\n       Indeed, a glimpse at the details of the regulations reveals \n     just how unreasonable they are. For instance, employers must \n     pay for up to three doctor visits for employees complaining \n     of repetitive stress injury and the doctor can report no \n     information about whether the condition was caused outside \n     the workplace. Businesswoman Tama Starr recounts other \n     glaring problems with the regs in her nearby essay.\n       President Clinton's own Small business Administration \n     estimates that the regulations will cost firms between $60 \n     billion and $100 billion a year. But the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Administration is nonetheless able to claim the \n     cost would be only $4.5 billion a year by factoring in \n     dubious projections of health care cost savings.\n       Believe it or not, the AFL-CIO calls repetitive stress \n     injuries ``the number one job safety injury issue in \n     America'' and is calling in its chits with Democrats by \n     demanding they vote to uphold the regulations. As of now, \n     Republicans have enough Democratic votes to prevail, but \n     pressure to keep the regs is mounting. Among their most \n     devout backers are trial lawyers, who look at ergonomic \n     litigation as the potential Next Frontier of jackpot justice.\n       Today's ergonomics debate in the Senate could send a signal \n     to both employers and employees alike that regulatory reform \n     is possible. It also will show which of the moderate \n     Democratic Senators who talk a good game about reducing \n     burdens on business will vote the same way. Employers should \n     pay close attention to how Senators Liberman, Edwards and \n     Kerry--all of whom are potential presidential candidates--end \n     up voting.\n       We have no doubt that ergonomic injuries are a growing \n     problems in some occupations. Icing OSHA's unworkable 600 \n     pages of regulations will still permit the Bush \n     Administration to issue ``guidelines'' to prevent injuries \n     while it rewrites the rules. Should the Congressional Review \n     Act be triggered, for once it will be the federal bureaucracy \n     that will have to adapt its desires to the marketplace rather \n     than the otherway around. That alone makes today's debate and \n     vote worth weighing in on.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nfrom the Chicago Tribune be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 6, 2001]\n\n                     Roll Back the OSHA Work Rules\n\n       Last November, the Clinton administration did an end-run \n     around Congress and rushed into place a set of massively \n     costly rules to govern repetitive-stress injuries in the \n     workplace. Member of Congress have an opportunity this week \n     to rescind those rules and take an orderly, science-based \n     approach to ergonomic injuries.\n       They should do just that.\n       Repetitive-stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome \n     are, no doubt, a serious problem. But the Clinton team's \n     answer was to blame the workplace for causing them and ask \n     questions later.\n       The rules effectively make employers wholly liable for \n     injuries that employees may have suffered outside of work, \n     but which may be aggravated by work. They override existing \n     state workers' compensation laws, mandating higher payments \n     for ergonomic-related complaints. In short, they amount to a \n     simplistic--and expensive--meat-ax solution for a complex \n     scientific puzzle that researchers still don't fully \n     understand.\n       They come at a huge cost. Although the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Administration puts the price tag on its rules at \n     $4.5 billion, the Economic Policy Foundation gauges the cost \n     to business at a staggering $125.6 billion.\n       In their lame-duck haste, the Clinton team decided not to \n     wait for a detailed report on ergonomic injuries that had \n     been commissioned by Congress and was being prepared by the \n     National Academy of Sciences.\n       The new workplace rules took effect Jan. 16. The report--\n     which was intended to inform any debate about such rules--was \n     released Jan. 17.\n       The study provides some ammunition to both sides in this \n     debate. It found that most common musculoskeletal disorders--\n     accounting for 70 million visits to doctors' offices a year--\n     are caused by work conditions as well as ``non-work \n     factors.'' According to the study, ``the connection between \n     the workplace and these disorders is complex, partly because \n     of the individual characteristics of workers--such as age, \n     gender and lifestyle.''\n       That study should now be the focus of debate--and still can \n     be.\n       The Congressional Review Act, passed in 1996, allows \n     Congress to get rid of regulations within 60 days of the time \n     they're issued by federal agencies. If a ``resolution of \n     disapproval'' is approved by a majority in the House and \n     Senate and signed by the president, the rules are history. \n     The act also prohibits the regulations from being reissued in \n     ``substantially the same form.''\n       A Senate vote could come as early as Tuesday.\n       It is in the best interests of employers and employees to \n     make workplaces as safe as possible. That keeps workers \n     healthy and saves money. But this was bad rule-making. Time \n     for Congress to undo it.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, throughout the day we have heard mention of \nnewspapers that have said using this Congressional Review Act is the \nright way to go, what OSHA has proposed is the wrong way to go. We had \nthis debate in July. We said OSHA was not listening, they were \nproposing an ergonomics rule that would not work, and in a bipartisan \nway, this body adopted an amendment to an appropriations bill that said \nthey could not do it for a year. That was to give us some time to work \non it.\n  That passed on the other side, and then, through the conference \nprocess, it got messed up to the point where it was moot. That was \npassed by both bodies.\n  That should have been a warning to OSHA that we were concerned about \nthe way they were doing the rule, that they were not listening to \nanybody. OSHA forced a flawed process, and they wound up with a flawed \nrule. That is rogue rulemaking, and we cannot allow it to happen.\n  I am so thankful that Senator Nickles and Senator Reid worked on a \nbill 5 years ago that makes this action possible. That was a bipartisan \nact to make sure that if agencies did something we did not like, \nespecially in\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nlight of the fact that we are charged with seeing that those agencies \nlet us pass the laws, this was our opportunity to say: You did it \nwrong; we are going to jerk the chain and make sure we do it right. \nThat puts a huge responsibility on us. I do not think there is anybody \nin this body who does not think there is an ergonomics problem, but \nwhat we want is a solution that will help the worker, not just cost \nmoney.\n  This is a little book of some of the hearings my subcommittee held. \nWe have addressed these issues. It is in part where we know for sure \nthat OSHA did not listen. We held hearings on the things they were \ntalking about and did not find any testimony in favor of some of the \nthings they were proposing.\n  As one listened to the debate today, one would think every employer \nwas trying to hurt their employees. If they do, they cannot stay in \nbusiness; they need employees. During the course of the testimony given \nby the assistant director of OSHA, I was fascinated to see, since I had \nbeen in the shoe business before, that two New Balance shoe \nmanufacturing facilities cut their workers compensation costs from $1.2 \nmillion to $89,000 per year and reduced their lost and restricted \nworkdays from 11,000 to 549 during a 3-year period.\n  I had to ask the assistant director just what kind of a fine process \nthey had to have in place to get these people to do this magnificent \nwork. It is one of many examples. There are many examples in here of \nemployers who have done the right thing and made huge differences to \ntheir workers, as there are examples of individuals who have been hurt \nby work ergonomics.\n  I had to ask: How much did you have to fine these New Balance shoe \nfolks to get them to do that outstanding work?\n  You will not be surprised to find out that his shocked answer was: We \ndid not have to fine them. Of course, you do not have to fine them. You \nhave to help them find solutions. That is what this rule misses.\n  It does not help anybody to know exactly what to do, particularly if \nit is a small businessman. They have to carry around 2 pounds' worth of \nregulations and learn them well enough--it is not just 2 pounds; there \nare all those other additions to it I mentioned--they have to learn \nthem well enough to do the job or they get fined substantially because \nthis rule is about fines. This rule is not about helping people and the \nsmall businessmen.\n  The Senator from Iowa mentioned earlier he did not really know the \nrule that well, but then he does not have to because we cannot be fined \nunder this. We do not have to meet these same obligations. Every small \nbusinessman in this country is going to have to know that stuff or pay \nthe price.\n\n  We heard how 10 years of effort went into this. Every time people \nmention that I think about my dad interviewing people for the shoe \nbusiness. One of the things he always asked was how much experience \nthey had. A lot of times they had a lot of experience--10, 20, 30 years \nof experience in the shoe business. One of the things he always told me \nwas that sometimes after he hired them he found out what they had was 1 \nyear of experience, 30 times.\n  That is what they got on OSHA. Until they actually get to the point \nwhere they publish something that people can look at and evaluate, you \ndon't have but 1 year's experience 10 times.\n  If it is flawed, it is still flawed. If it is a rotten tree, rotten \nto the core, you can't just prune it. If it has a bad foundation, you \ndon't want to build on it. So we can't take what has been done and work \non it.\n  Now, another comment made today is the employers have all of this \npower, the employer can say what is happening. Let me state what the \nemployer can't do under this rule. If somebody gets injured, he cannot \ntalk to the doctor and find out how he got injured and how he could be \nsaved from it because he is not allowed to investigate that. That has \nalways been a capability under workers compensation. The employer has \nalways been able to find out what hurt his employee and how he could \nchange it.\n  Another thing that is mentioned is this is only 8 pages of rules. I \nhave to remind Members, whether it is 8, 400, 600 or 800--and it really \nis 800--it is not like filling out your tax forms. If you do a simple \nform, you probably only have to do 2 pages, but if you only pay \nattention to those 2 pages, you don't pay attention to all the pages \nand regulations that come with it, you are not going to get it done \nright. I challenge anybody to be able to fill that thing out without \nlooking at a single reference. Again, thousands of pages.\n  That is what we are doing here, forcing on the American small \nbusinessman thousands and thousands of pages of work. We showed some of \nthe formulas they have to have. I think everybody ought to have to be \nable to translate that formula before they vote against the Review Act \ntonight.\n  It has also been mentioned that we spent millions of dollars for the \nNational Academy of Sciences to do studies. I have to say, some of the \nquotes from the National Academy of Sciences remind me of some of the \nthings that people do with the Bible--a little bit of selective \nreading.\n  I have to say something about OSHA. We said wait. Did they wait? No, \nthey didn't wait. Now we hear all the quotes about how the National \nAcademy of Sciences said it is OK to do this rule. Well, read that and \nI don't think you will agree that the National Academy of Sciences \nthinks that is the proper way to go.\n  But remember, OSHA didn't even wait to find that out. They were so \nadamant, so focused on doing exactly what they wanted to do; they \ndidn't listen to us; they didn't listen to any of our staff; they \ndidn't listen to any of the committees. They went ahead and did what \nthey wanted to do.\n  I talked about a flawed process. They paid people to testify; they \nbrought them in and practiced them; they rewrote their testimony; they \npaid them to tear apart testimony. What galls me the most, they paid \nthem to tear apart the testimony of the people testifying on the other \nside.\n  We cannot let that happen in the United States. People have to have \ntheir own right to testify without being taken on by government money.\n\n  As I mentioned, this bill was pushed by OSHA through a forced process \nand they wound up with a forced rule. We cannot let that rule stand. I \nask Members to vote for the resolution and to vote against the OSHA \nrule.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my deep sadness \nfor the families and victims of yesterday's high school shooting \ntragedy in California.\n  Yesterday, Charles ``Andy'' Williams, a 15-year-old high school \nstudent, snapped. By all accounts, this was a child who was a frequent \nvictim of bullies and was picked on by others at school. A troubled \nchild is a sad reality in America today, but a troubled child with a \ngun is a tragedy waiting to happen.\n  Gun safety is not the only issue this tragedy highlights. We need to \nencourage adults and students to listen more carefully and take swifter \naction when young people make threats of gun violence. We need more \ncounselors in our Nation's schools who can help young people deal with \nthe pressures of growing up. But we also must prevent troubled children \nfrom obtaining firearms.\n  Once again, I come to the floor to renew my plea--the American \npeople's plea--for Congress to do the right thing, to pass commonsense \ngun safety legislation. We can continue to throw our hands in the air, \nshrug our shoulders, and hope this problem will go away by itself--\nsadly, we know better--or we can begin to face the reality of our \nsituation: We live in a country populated by 281 million people and an \nestimated 200 million firearms.\n  Our Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate the design of a \ntoy gun, to make sure it will not pinch the finger of a child, but the \nNational Rifle Association has made sure that this same agency has no \nauthority to regulate the safety of a real gun that could blow off a \nchild's finger or worse.\n\n  Anyone--let me repeat, anyone--can walk into a gun show today and \nwalk out with an unlimited supply of firearms--no documentation, no \nbackground check, no questions asked. And yet we express surprise when, \nyear after year, our children are left defenseless as they attempt to \ndodge bullets at their schools. We use words such as ``tragedy'' and \n``shock'' to describe the aftermath of school shootings, when we know \nthey are foreseeable--we know they are foreseeable.\n  Some in this Senate have argued that the reasonable gun safety \nlegislation we have proposed on this side of the aisle will not reduce \ngun violence. They said the same thing about the Brady bill, too. They \nwere wrong then; they are wrong now.\n  It is not enough to wait for deaths caused by gun violence and then \n``enforce the law'' against those who violate it. We must work to \naggressively prevent gun violence before it happens, not merely enforce \nthe law after the school shootings.\n  We must cut off the avenues for children to obtain firearms.\n  The American people are very clear on this issue, but Congress drags \nits feet, offering empty excuses for why we cannot pass any gun safety \nlegislation. And what are the excuses? A background check at a gun show \ncannot be passed by Congress, according to the NRA, because it violates \nthe second amendment. Requiring a child safety lock to be sold with a \nhandgun somehow, according to the NRA, imposes an unreasonable burden \non gun stores and manufacturers. A 3-day waiting period for a handgun--\nwell, the NRA says that clearly violates our second amendment \nconstitutional right.\n  This is a phony facade and a phony argument, one that continues to \nendanger our children in the one place in their lives they should \nexpect to be safe at every moment--at school. In all likelihood, after \nthe headlines on this most recent shooting will die down, this Congress \nwill return to blissful ignorance with respect to the gun problem in \nAmerica. But how many more tragedies, such as the one we have seen in \nCalifornia yesterday, have to happen before Congress finally takes \naction? How many?\n  Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control reveal that gun \nviolence takes the lives of over 30,000 Americans every year, including \n4,000 children. No other nation on Earth has this many gun deaths. When \nwill this problem be big enough for Congress to care? Maybe at 35,000 \ndeaths, 40,000, 100,000? What will it take?\n  I watched yesterday while this California shooting tragedy unfolded, \nand I couldn't help but recall Columbine. Only 2 years ago, I walked \ninto that Cloakroom and watched the live television coverage of \nstudents and teachers running and hiding in an effort to escape open \ngunfire at a school in a ``safe neighborhood.'' I remember the terror \nand shock on their faces. I remember the child hanging out of the \nwindow with one of his arms extended and bloody. I remember the \nfunerals of the 12 young students and the teacher who died as a result. \nAlmost 2 years have passed since the Columbine tragedy. Now we have \nanother high school tragedy in another safe neighborhood, but still \nCongress refuses to enact sensible gun safety legislation.\n  Last May mothers across America celebrated Mother's Day, not by \nstaying home with their families and cooking their favorite dish or by \ngetting breakfast in bed. They went out and marched. They marched \nagainst gun violence. I joined them on the shore of Lake Michigan as \nhundreds, maybe thousands gathered to make it clear to Congressmen and \nSenators alike that they had had enough as mothers. They called on \nCongress to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. Several of my \ncolleagues and I participated in the march. These moms are mad. They \nwill have their day.\n  This is a new Congress with a 50/50 split. We found time in this new \nCongress to consider voiding worker safety legislation. We will find \ntime in this Congress to deal with bankruptcy, clamping down on those \nwho file for bankruptcy but not on the credit industry. And now, sadly, \nwe will find time for a lot of other issues other than gun safety. We \nhaven't heard any clamor from the other side about the need to address \ngun violence. Mothers are burying their children before they have a \nchance to raise them while this Congress stands idly by.\n  Commonsense gun safety legislation, that is all the American people \nare asking for. As yesterday's shooting tragedy in California tells us, \nthis Congress must act and act now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In Vermont, \nwhere special education referrals grow at a rate of about 3.5 percent \nper year. With the cost of special education rising at a rate that \nVermont's 287 school districts can not sustain, the number one \neducation issue that will be discussed at these town meetings will be \nFederal funding of special education. Vermonters, like so many \nAmericans across the country, understand that these costs must be paid. \nAll of our children, those with disabilities and those without, need \nand deserve the services and supports that will ensure that they meet \ntheir educational goals.\n  In 1975, responding to numerous Federal Court decisions involving \nlawsuits against a majority of the States, and growing concerns about \nthe unconstitutional treatment of children with disabilities, Congress \npassed Public Law 94-142, now known as the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. IDEA rightly guaranteed all children with \ndisabilities a constitutionally required ``free and appropriate public \neducation.'' As a freshman Congressman, I was proud to sponsor that \nlegislation and to be a member of the Conference Committee that \nnegotiated the differences in the House and Senate bills.\n  In passing Public Law 94-142, Congress recognized that education is \nnot free. We recognized that children with disabilities often require \nspecialized services to benefit from education. Congress assumed that \nthe average cost of educating children with disabilities was twice that \nof educating other children. At that time, 25 years ago, Congress \nauthorized the Federal Government to pay up to 40 percent of the \nadditional costs associated with educating children with disabilities. \nThat amount--often referred to as the IDEA ``full-funding'' amount--is \ncalculated by taking 40 percent of the national average per pupil \nexpenditure, or APPE, times the number of children with disabilities \nbeing served under IDEA Part B in each state.\n  While some may question whether Congress made a commitment or set a \ngoal, I am here to tell you, as someone who was there at the time, we \ndefinitely made a pledge to fully fund the Federal share of special \neducation. Thanks to teachers and administrators, advocacy \norganizations, parents of children with disabilities, and the children \nthemselves, I believe that together we have made tremendous strides in \nassuring that we keep that promise.\n  Since I became Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee in 1997, there have been significant increases in special \neducation funding. In fact, special education funding has increased by \n174 percent since 1996. For Vermont, the Federal share has increased \nfrom $4.5 million to $13.2 million. Even with this substantial \nincrease, the Federal Government still contributes less than 15 percent \nof the APPE.\n  Failure to live up to the commitment of Congress means that the \nmajority of the funding for special education for 8,000 Vermont \nstudents, and 6.1 million students across the country, currently comes \nfrom the States and from local school budgets.\n  Last year, I led three congressional efforts to increase special \neducation funding. In April 2000, I sponsored an amendment to the \nbudget resolution. This amendment would have mandated that the Federal \nGovernment increase spending for special education by $2 billion each \nyear, for 5 years. The amendment, which would have raised Federal \nspecial education funding from $5 billion per year to close to $16 \nbillion per year, failed by three votes. In its place, the Senate \napproved, by a vote of 53 to 47, a substitute amendment that made my \namendment a nonbinding sense of the senate resolution to fully fund \nspecial education. This was definitely not the outcome I was seeking. \nHowever, it was the second time the Senate has gone on record in \nsupport of fully funding the Federal Government's share of special \neducation costs. After two decades in which full funding of IDEA was \nregarded as more of a pipe dream than a commitment to be honored, \nCongress finally seems to be taking its obligation seriously.\n  Today, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing legislation \nthat will provide for mandatory increases in special education funding \nat $2.5 billion a year for each of the next 6 years. This bipartisan \neffort sets the course to achieve full funding for Part B of IDEA by \nfiscal year 2007. The enactment of this bill will give relief to school \ndistricts, resources to teachers, hope to parents, and opportunities to \nchildren with disabilities. It will free up State and local funds to be \nspent on such things as better pay for teachers, more professional \ndevelopment, richer and more diverse curricula, reducing class size, \nmaking needed renovations to buildings, and addressing other needs of \nindividual schools. To me, passage of this bill will provide the \nultimate in local educational flexibility.\n  Last week, Representative Burton, Chairman of the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform, held a hearing on IDEA. Every witness that testified \nidentified insufficient special education funding as the number one \nbarrier that prevents schools from fully meeting the needs of children \nwith disabilities. Every congressional Representative who attended the \nhearing spoke to the issue. Representative Hooley and Representative \nBass have both introduced bills in the House to fully fund Part B of \nIDEA.\n  In 1975, we made a commitment to fully fund the Federal Government's \nshare of special education costs. If, 25 years later, in this era of \neconomic prosperity and unprecedented budgetary surpluses, we cannot \nmeet this commitment, when will we keep this pledge?\n  School districts are demanding financial relief. Children's needs \nmust be met. Parents expect accountability. There is no better way to \ntouch a school, help a child, or support a family than to commit more \nFederal dollars for special education. Personally, I do not believe \nanyone can rationally argue this is not the time to fulfill our \npromise.\n  In America, education is viewed as a right. Across the country, our \nGovernors, school boards, education professionals, and families of \nchildren with disabilities identify fully funding for special education \nas their number-one priority. The American people have a right to ask \nus, ``if not now, when?'' Six million American students with \ndisabilities have a right to a free and appropriate public education. \nThey deserve to participate in the American dream.\n  This issue will not go away and neither will I. I intend to do all I \ncan to make sure we keep our promise to fully fund the Federal share of \nspecial education. As we proceed with new initiatives and requirements \nfor schools, let us also dedicate increased Federal funds to meeting \nour existing obligations to children with disabilities, families, and \nthe State and local education agencies that serve them. I believe this \nis the most important education issue before our Nation, and I will \ncontinue to fight for it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the ``Helping Children \nSuccess by Fully Funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA, Act.'' This is a bi-partisan effort to help our states \nprovide a free and appropriate public education to children with \ndisabilities. As I've said time and again, disability is not a partisan \nissue. We all share an interest in ensuring that children with \ndisabilities and their families get a fair shake in life.\n  Currently, the State Grant program within IDEA receives $6.34 \nbillion. Estimates by the Congressional Research Service suggest that \nthe program needs to be funded at $17.1 billion for fiscal year 2002 to \nmeet the targets established in 1975. Our amendment would obligate \nfunding for IDEA annually in roughly $2.5 billion increments over the \nnext six years and would put us on track to meet our goal of 40 percent \nfunding.\n  In the early seventies, two landmark federal district court cases, \nPARC v.\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills v. Board of Education of the \nDistrict Court of Columbia, established that children with disabilities \nhave a constitutional right to a free appropriate public education. In \n1975, in response to these cases, Congress enacted the Education of \nHandicapped Children Act, EHA, the precursor to IDEA, to help states \nmeet their constitutional obligations.\n  Congress enacted PL 94-142 for two reasons. First, to establish a \nconsistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal \nprotection clause of the 14th amendment with respect to the education \nof kids with disabilities. And, second, to help States meet their \nConstitutional obligations through federal funding. The Supreme Court \nreiterated this in Smith v. Robinson: ``EHA is a comprehensive scheme \nset up by Congress to aid the states in complying with their \nconstitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped \nchildren.''\n  It is Congress' responsibility to help States provide children with \ndisabilities an education. That is why I strongly agree with the policy \nof this bill and the infusion of more money into IDEA. As Senator \nJeffords has said before, this is a win-win for everyone. Students with \ndisabilities will be more likely to get the public education they have \na right to because school districts will have the capacity to provide \nsuch an education, without cutting into their general education \nbudgets.\n  The Supreme Court's decision regarding Garret Frey of Cedar Rapids, \nIowa underscores the need for Congress to help school districts with \nthe financial costs of educating children with disabilities. While the \nexcess costs of educating some children with disabilities is minimal, \nthe excess costs of educating other children with disabilities, like \nGarret, is great.\n  Just last week, I heard from the Cedar Rapids/Iowa City Chamber of \nCommerce that more IDEA dollars will help them continue to deliver high \nquality educational services to children in their school districts. \nThis bill would provide over $300 million additional dollars to Iowa \nover the next six years. I've heard from parents in Iowa that their \nkids need more qualified interpreters for deaf and hard of hearing \nchildren and they need better mental health services and better \nbehavioral assessments. And the additional funds will help local and \narea education agencies build capacity in these areas.\n  In 1975, IDEA authorized the maximum award per state as being the \nnumber of children served times 40 percent of the national average per \npupil expenditure, known as the APPE. The formula does not guarantee 40 \npercent of national APPE per disabled child served; rather, it caps \nIDEA allotments at 40 percent of national APPE. In other words, the 40 \npercent figure was a goal, not a commitment.\n  As the then ranking minority member on the House Ed and Labor \nCommittee, Rep. Albert Quie, explained: ``I do not know in the \nsubsequent years whether we will appropriate at those [authorized] \nlevels or not. I think what we are doing here is laying out the goal. \nIgnoring other Federal priorities, we thought it acceptable if funding \nreaches that level.''\n  One of the important points in the Congressman's statement is that we \ncannot fund IDEA grant programs at the cost of other important federal \nprograms. That is why historically the highest appropriation for \nspecial education funding was in FY79, when allocations represented \n12.5 percent APPE.\n  Over the last six years, however, as Ranking Member on the Labor-H \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues across \nthe aisle to almost triple the IDEA appropriation so that we're now up \nto almost 15 percent of the funding formula.\n  This bill would help us push that number to 40 percent without \ncutting into general education programs.\n  We must redouble our efforts to help school districts meet their \nconstitutional obligations. And this increased funding will allow us to \nincrease dollars to every program under IDEA through appropriations. \nEvery program under IDEA must get adequate funds.\n  As I said, we can all agree that states should receive more money \nunder IDEA. I thank Senator Hagel, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Dodd for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1890-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1890-S1894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECONCILIATION AND DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced Senate Concurrent \nResolution 20, a budget resolution for fiscal year 2002 that stays the \ncourse with an emphasis on paying down the national debt. The \nresolution creates two reserve funds for tax reduction, one if the CBO \nreports the economy is in a recession and the other if CBO determines \nwe have a true surplus. The resolution does not contain any \ninstructions to committees with regard to reconciliation.\n  There has been a great deal of speculation, fueled by statements made \nby the Senate Republican Leadership, that the reconciliation process \nestablished in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, would be used to \nenact the massive $1.6 trillion tax cut proposed by the President. This \nis an abuse of the budget process and contrary to the original purpose \nof the Act which was to establish fiscal discipline within the Congress \nwhen it made decisions regarding spending and tax matters. I am the \nonly original member of the Senate Budget Committee and have served on \nthe Committee since its inception in 1974. In fact, I chaired the \nSenate Budget Committee in 1980 and managed the first reconciliation \nbill with Senator Domenici, then the ranking minority member.\n  It disturbs me to see how the reconciliation process, designed to \nreduce the debt, is now being used to rush a huge tax cut through the \nCongress with limited debate and little if any opportunity to amend. An \nexamination of the legislative history surrounding passage of the 1974 \nAct makes it clear that the new reconciliation process was intended to \nexpedite consideration of legislation that only reduced spending or \nincreased revenues in order to eliminate annual budget deficits. This \nview was supported by over two decades of practice in which Congress \nused the Act to improve the fiscal health of the federal budget. If \nCongress insists on enacting a massive tax cut, it should consider that \nbill in the normal course, not through the reconciliation process which \nmakes a mockery of the Congressional Budget Act and its intended \npurpose. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlegislative history of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and a \nhistory of the use of the Senate reconciliation process.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Arguments Against the Use of Reconciliation to Consider Tax Cut \n                              Legislation\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       I. The legislative history of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 makes clear that the newly created reconciliation \n     process was only intended to expedite consideration of \n     legislation that reduced spending or increased taxes in order \n     to eliminate annual budget deficits.\n       II. The authors of Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     attempted to create a comprehensive new framework to improve \n     fiscal discipline with minimum disruption to established \n     Senate procedure and practice.\n       III. The provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     that provide expedited procedures to consider the budget \n     resolution and reconciliation bills have always been \n     construed strictly because they severely restrict the \n     prerogatives of individual Senators.\n       IV. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been amended \n     numerous times to provide Congress the tools to improve \n     fiscal discipline and over two decades of practice make clear \n     that the reconciliation process has been used to reduce \n     deficits.\n       V. The use of the reconciliation process to enact a massive \n     tax reduction bill, absent any effort to reduce the deficit, \n     is inconsistent with the legislative history of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, contrary to over two \n     decades of practice and undermines the most important \n     traditions of the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Legislative History of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974\n\n       The contentious battles with the Nixon White House over the \n     control of spending in 1973 and the chronic budget deficits \n     that occurred in 25 of the previous 32 years convinced the \n     Congress that it needed to establish it's own budget process. \n     The Congress enacted the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     which was considered landmark legislation and the first \n     attempt at major reform of the budget process since 1921. \n     Through this effort the Congress sought to increase fiscal \n     discipline by creating an overall budget process that would \n     enable it to control federal spending and insure federal \n     revenues\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n     were sufficient to pay for the operation of the government. \n     The budget reconciliation process was an optional procedure, \n     established under the 1974 Act. From it's inception, the  \n     reconciliation process was to facilitate consideration of \n     legislation late in the fiscal year to eliminate projected \n     deficits by changing current law to lower federal spending \n     or to increase federal revenues in conformance with the \n     spending ceiling and revenue floor established in the \n     annual budget resolution.\n       Any analysis of the reconciliation process must be done in \n     the context of the crisis the Congress faced in 1973 and the \n     legislative history surrounding passage of the bill. The \n     national debt had grown from approximately $1 billion at the \n     turn of the century to almost $500 billion by 1973. The \n     Congress was confronted by a President using his impoundment \n     authority as a budget cutting device and to assert his own \n     priorities on spending. In a message to Congress on July 26, \n     1973, President Nixon requested the enactment of a $250 \n     billion ceiling on fiscal 1973 expenditures. The request was \n     renewed later in the year in conjunction with legislation to \n     raise the temporary debt limit. Congress rejected the \n     proposed spending ceiling because it would have surrendered \n     to the President its constitutional responsibility to \n     determine national spending. However, Congress recognized the \n     need for permanent spending control procedures and in Section \n     301(b) of Public Law 92-599 it established a joint committee \n     to review--\n\n     * * * the procedures which should be adopted by the Congress \n     for the purpose of improving congressional control of the \n     budgetary outlay and receipt totals, including procedures for \n     establishing and maintaining an overall view of each year's \n     budgetary outlays which is fully coordinated with an overall \n     view of anticipated revenues for that year.\n       From the beginning there was concern that any new budget \n     process not impede the traditional role of the committees \n     that had jurisdiction over these matters nor dramatically \n     change the way each house of Congress conducted it's \n     business. Consequently, 28 of the 32 members of the Joint \n     Study committee came from the committees on Finance, Ways and \n     Means and from the Appropriations Committee of both houses. \n     The Joint Committees issued a final report on April 18, 1973 \n     which was the starting point for the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Operations and the House Rules Committee in \n     their work on the 1974 Act.\n       The sixteen members of the House that participated in the \n     Joint Study Committee introduced H.R. 7130, the Budget \n     Control Act of 1973, on April 18, 1973. The bill contained a \n     simple reconciliation process and authorized a year end tax \n     surcharge bill to increase taxes if the actual deficit was \n     greater than projected or the actual surplus for that fiscal \n     year was less than projected. The legislation provided for a \n     narrowly targeted tax bill that would increase revenues \n     sufficient to bring them in line with spending. H.R. 7130 was \n     reported by the House Rules Committee on November 20, 1973 \n     with a substitute amendment which modified the section on tax \n     reconciliation and added a new section to create a \n     reconciliation bill to rescind appropriations. The trigger \n     for reconciliation was simplified in the reported version of \n     the bill which required rescission of appropriated funds \n     if actual spending was greater than the spending aggregate \n     in the resolution and, or a tax surcharge bill if actual \n     revenues were less than the revenue aggregates in the \n     resolution. It was a minimalist approach to bring spending \n     into compliance for that year with the budget resolution \n     by rescinding funds appropriated earlier that year or by \n     enacting a simple tax surcharge bill for receipts \n     shortfalls.\n       The House Rules Committee Report described the \n     reconciliation process as follows:\n       The September 15 concurrent resolution (and any permissible \n     revision) would be considered under the same rules and \n     procedures applicable to the initial budget resolution. This \n     final budget resolution would reaffirm or revise the figures \n     set forth in the first budget resolution and in so doing \n     would take account of the actions previously taken by \n     Congress in enacting appropriations and other spending \n     measures. The final budget resolution may call upon the \n     Appropriations Committees to report legislation rescinding or \n     amending appropriations or the House Ways and Means and \n     Senate Finance Committees to report legislation adjusting tax \n     rates or the public debt limit. Congress may not adjourn \n     until it has adopted the final budget resolution and any \n     required implementing legislation.\n       Such implementing legislation would be contained in a \n     budget reconciliation bill to be reported by the House \n     Appropriations Committee. If the total new budget authority \n     contained in the appropriation bills or the budget outlays \n     resulting from them are in excess of the totals set forth in \n     the final budget resolution, the Appropriations Committee \n     would include rescissions or amendments to the appropriations \n     bills in its budget reconciliation bill. This reconciliation \n     bill would contain a provision raising revenues to be \n     reported by the House Ways and Means Committee if estimated \n     Federal revenues are less than the appropriate level of \n     revenues set in the final budget resolution. (House Report \n     93-658, p. 40)\n       The Section by Section analysis of the bill in the House \n     Rules Committee Report was more explicit:\n\n  Sec. 133. Budget reconciliation bill to be reported in certain cases\n\n       This section requires the House Appropriations Committee to \n     report a budget reconciliation bill (containing any necessary \n     rescissions or amendments to the annual appropriations bill \n     for the fiscal year involved) if the total budget authority \n     or budget outlays provided by such bills exceeds the \n     applicable level established by the final budget resolution.\n\nSec. 134. Budget reconciliation bill to include tax measure in certain \n                                 cases.\n\n       The section requires the House Ways and Means Committee to \n     report (as a separate title in the budget reconciliation \n     bill) a tax measure to raise the additional revenue needed if \n     the estimated revenues for the fiscal year involved are less \n     than those set forth in the final budget resolution. (House \n     Report 93-658, p. 8).\n       The House Rules Committee rejected many of the most \n     restrictive provisions in the bill as introduced and \n     enunciated five principles that guided its consideration of \n     the bill in Committee. The following excerpt from the House \n     Committee Report demonstrates how important it was to the \n     committee to craft a bill that improved fiscal discipline \n     without riding roughshod over the prerogatives of members and \n     dramatically altering the way in which the House and Senate \n     functioned:\n       Your committee decided to remove these restrictive \n     procedures and yet devise an alternative that accomplishes \n     the important need for budget control. Our work has been \n     guided by a number of principles.\n       First has been the commitment to find a workable process. \n     Not everything that carries the label of a legislative budget \n     can be made to work. If the 1947-49 debacle is not to be \n     repeated, the new process must be in accord with the \n     realities of congressional budgeting. The complicated floor \n     procedures contained in the Joint Study Committee bill have \n     been eliminated because they would inhibit the proper \n     functioning of Congress.\n       Second, budget reform must not become an instrument for \n     preventing Congress from expressing its will on spending \n     policy. The original bill would have ruled out many floor \n     amendments, it would have also stunted the free consolidation \n     of appropriation measures, it would have bound Congress to \n     unusual and oppressive rules, and it would have given one-\n     third of the Members the power to thwart a majority's effort \n     to revise or waive such rules. Points of order could have \n     been raised at many stages of the process and legitimate \n     legislation initiatives would have been blocked. The constant \n     objective of budget reform should be to make Congress \n     informed about and responsible for its budget actions, not to \n     take away its powers to act.\n       Third, budget reform must not be used to concentrate the \n     spending power in a few hands. All members must have ample \n     opportunity to express their views and to vote on budget \n     matters. On few matters is open and unfettered debate as \n     vital as the budget which determines the fate of national \n     programs and interest. While it may be necessary to establish \n     new budget committees to coordinate the revenue and spending \n     sides of the budget, these committees must not be given \n     extraordinary power in the making of budget policies.\n       Fourth, the congressional budget must operate in tandem \n     with and not override the well-established appropriations \n     process. Though its power of appropriation, Congress is able \n     to maintain control over spending. The power has been \n     exercised responsibly and effectively over the years and \n     it should not be diluted by the imposition of a new layer \n     of procedures. The purpose of the budget reform should be \n     to link the spending decisions in a manner that gives \n     Congress the opportunity to express overall fiscal policy \n     and to assess the relative worth of major functions.\n       Fifth, the budget controls procedures should deviate only \n     the necessary minimum from the procedures used for the \n     preparation and consideration of other legislation. Undue \n     complexity could only mean the discrediting of any new reform \n     drive. While we must not err with the simplistic approach \n     taken in 1947-49, neither must we load the congressional \n     budget process with needless and questionable details. (House \n     Report 93-658, p. 29)\n       Senator Sam Ervin, Chairman of the Senate Government \n     Operations Committee introduced S. 1541, to provide for the \n     reform of congressional procedures with respect to the \n     enactment of fiscal measures on April 11, 1973. In explaining \n     the need for the legislation Senator Ervin stated:\n       ``The congressional procedures with respect to spending the \n     taxpayer's dollar are, to say the least, in dire need of a \n     major overhaul, and have been for quite some time. Since \n     1960, Federal spending has tripled, the inflation rate has \n     tripled, the dollar outflow abroad has quadrupled, and the \n     dollar has been devalued twice--the first such devaluation \n     since 1933, in the heart of the Great Depression. It has been \n     52 years since Congress has done anything about shaping its \n     basic tolls for controlling Federal expenditures. The Budget \n     and Accounting Act of 1921 was the last major reform of the \n     congressional budgetary procedure, yet we are now spending \n     nearly 100 times what we were spending yearly in the \n     1920's.'' (Congressional Record, April 11, 1973, p. 7074)\n       While S. 1541, as introduced, contained no reconciliation \n     procedures, the bill reported by the Senate Government \n     Operations Committee on November 28, 1973 included a somewhat \n     convoluted enforcement process that\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\n     relied on the rescission of appropriated funds and if that \n     could not be accomplished, across the board cuts in spending. \n     The bill as reported, summarized the reconciliation process \n     as follows:\n       Reconciliation process: determination of the total of the \n     appropriations enacted; in the event budget resolution \n     ceilings are exceeded, reductions in certain of the \n     appropriations should Congress desire in order to conform to \n     the budget resolution; consideration and adoption of a second \n     budget resolution should Congress desire to spend at levels \n     in excess of the original ceilings established earlier; \n     adjustments in certain appropriations to conform to the \n     latest budget resolution; in the event of impasse on any of \n     the foregoing steps, a pro rata reduction of all \n     appropriations to conform the ceilings enacted in the \n     latest budget resolution. (Senate Report 93-579 p. 17)\n       The Senate bill was subsequently referred to the Senate \n     Rules Committee on November 30, 1973. Senator Robert C. Byrd, \n     the Assistant Minority Leader and a member of the Rules \n     Committee assembled a working group that made extensive \n     revisions to the bill reported by the Senate Government \n     Operations Committee. The group consisted of representatives \n     of the Chairmen of the ten standing committees of the Senate, \n     four joint committees, the House Appropriations Committee, \n     the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Senate \n     Legislative Counsel. The Senate Rules Committee sought a more \n     practical approach that minimized the impact on existing \n     Senate procedure and practice. The Senate Rules Committee \n     Report stated:\n       ``The amendment in the nature of a substitute formulated by \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration retains the basic \n     purposes and framework of the bill. However, it makes a \n     number of changes designed to tailor the new budgetary roles \n     and relationships more closely to the existing methods and \n     procedures of the Congress. The intent remains to equip \n     Congress with the capability for determining Federal budget \n     and priorities. However, the Committee sought to devise a \n     balanced and workable process that recognizes the impact of \n     budget reform on committee jurisdictions, legislative \n     workloads, and floor procedures.'' (Senate Report 93-688 p. \n     4)\n       This is consistent with the view of the Senate Government \n     Operations Committee which had reported the bill earlier that \n     Congress. The Government Operations Committee Report stated:\n       ``The changes proposed by the Committee, are, for the most \n     part, designed to add a new and comprehensive budgetary \n     framework to the existing decision making processes, with \n     minimum disruption to established methods and procedures.'' \n     (Senate Report 93-579 p. 15)\n       The Rules Committee explicitly rejected a reconciliation \n     process that relied solely on rescission of appropriated fund \n     to eliminate deficit spending. Section 310 of the reported \n     bill authorized the Budget Committee (1) to specify the total \n     amount by which new budget authority for such fiscal year \n     contained in laws under the jurisdiction of the various \n     committees was to be changed and to direct each committee to \n     recommend such changes in law, (2) if that is unfeasible, \n     direct that all budget authority be changed on a pro rata \n     basis (3) specify the total amount by which revenues are to \n     be changed and to direct the Finance Committee to recommend \n     such changes and (4) specify the amount which the statutory \n     limit on public debt was to be changed. The bill reported by \n     the Senate Rules Committee broadened the application of \n     reconciliation to all committees, not just appropriations. \n     It required that all committees with jurisdiction over \n     direct spending be required to participate in budget \n     reductions and allowed for the inclusion of tax measures \n     to eliminate budget deficits. The Rules Committee report \n     specifically identified revenue shortfalls as a major \n     contributor to budget deficits. Approximately one and one-\n     half pages were devoted to a discussion of revenue \n     shortfalls in the two page description of the \n     reconciliation process. The following is an excerpt from \n     the report describing reconciliation and emphasizes the \n     importance the committee attached to examining the tax \n     base and increasing revenues when necessary:\n       Perhaps the most significant weakness in the bill referred \n     to the Committee was the failure to give sufficient attention \n     to the revenue aspect of Congressional budgeting. This is not \n     surprising in light of the fact that criticisms of \n     Congressional spending provided the principal impetus to the \n     development of this legislation. But it is a serious omission \n     when the source of the large Federal deficit (in the years \n     preceding the creation of the Joint Study Committee on Budget \n     Control) is more clearly identified.\n       On closer inspection, this large and unexpected addition to \n     the debt--which some observers believe contributed to the \n     inflationary pressures--resulted largely from the revenue \n     side of the balance sheet, and not from higher spending. The \n     difference between budget estimates and actual receipts for \n     those three years is $27.7 billion, or 65% of the difference \n     between estimated and actual deficits.\n       These three years are typical only in that there were three \n     consecutive shortfalls in revenue. Moreover, for each year, \n     the administration submitted a later estimate, which was even \n     further from the actual results that the original budget \n     estimate. The typical overestimate or underestimate for a \n     given year is not far different from those for 1970-1972. \n     And, for fiscal policy purposes, an error in either direction \n     may be equally significant.\n       Difference between revenue estimates and actual receipts \n     can, of course, be explained by several factors. One is the \n     failure of the economy to perform at predicted levels. But \n     there are cases where the estimates were wide of the mark, \n     even when the economic forecasts were relatively accurate. \n     There is also the action of Congress in not following the \n     President's recommendations to increase taxes, or in reducing \n     taxes when he has not proposed it. In any case, it is clear \n     that a sound congressional budget policy cannot be based on \n     the assumption that control of spending levels is sufficient \n     to achieve desirable economic results. (Senate Report 93-688 \n     p. 868-9)\n       During floor consideration of S. 1541, the Senate adopted \n     the amendment proposed by the Senate Rules Committee, in lieu \n     of that of the Senate Government Operations Committee. The \n     House and Senate passed their respective bills without \n     amendment to the reconciliation proceedings reported by the \n     House and Senate Rules Committees. The Senate incorporated \n     its amendment into H.R. 7130, and went to conference on \n     the House bill. The conference committee reported the bill \n     and retained much of the Senate language regarding the \n     scope of reconciliation with the exception of the \n     provision authorizing pro rata reductions in spending \n     bills. While the reconciliation process has evolved since \n     1974, Section 310(a) of the Act regarding the scope of \n     reconciliation has not changed significantly. The \n     conference report was adopted overwhelmingly by both \n     houses and signed into law to become Public Law 93-44.\n       The conference committee on H.R. 7130 adopted the Senate's \n     language regarding the scope of reconciliation and included \n     in the statement of managers a scant summary of the new \n     process. It was not necessary to elaborate since both the \n     House and Senate Rules Committees were explicit in their \n     reports that reconciliation was to be used at the end of the \n     fiscal year to reduce spending or increase taxes in order to \n     eliminate budget deficits. It is inconceivable, given the \n     legislative history of the 1974 Act and the budget crisis \n     confronting the Congress, that the conferences would create \n     an expedited process to either reduce taxes or increase \n     spending. Under the Act, Congress was required to adopt two \n     budget resolutions. Congress would pass its first budget \n     resolution at the beginning of the session that would provide \n     non-binding targets and create the budgetary framework for \n     the appropriations and other spending bills. Subsequently, \n     Congress would pass the necessary spending bills. Congress \n     was then required to pass a second budget resolution no later \n     than September 15 which could be enforced by reconciliation \n     allowing the Congress to consider a bill or resolution to \n     bring spending and revenue into compliance with the second \n     resolution.\n       In addition to a reconciliation bill, the conference \n     committee created an alternative reconciliation process that \n     authorized the delay in the enrollment of previously passed \n     appropriation and entitlement bills until the amounts were \n     reconciled with the budget resolution. The reconciliation \n     resolution would direct the Secretary of the Senate or the \n     Clerk of the House to correct the enrollment of previously \n     passed bills prior to submitting them to the President for \n     signature. This optional reconciliation process, added in \n     conference strongly suggests that the conference were not \n     trying to expand the scope of reconciliation, but instead \n     were looking for a quick way to make minor, last minute, \n     changes to previously passed legislation in order to avoid \n     budget deficits during the last two weeks of the fiscal year.\n\n\n                The Abuse of the Reconciliation Process\n\n       The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was intended to \n     provide a process that complemented existing House and Senate \n     rules not supplant them. There is ample support in the House \n     and Senate Committee reports for the proposition that the \n     authors of the Act wanted to minimize conflict with existing \n     proceedings. There has been a constant tension between \n     expediting the consideration of the budget and maintaining \n     the important rights members enjoy under the Senate rules and \n     precedents. The hallmark of Senate procedure is the \n     ability of members to engage freely in debate, to offer \n     amendments and the thread that ties all Senate procedure \n     is the importance placed on preserving the rights of any \n     minority in the Senate. This, and this alone, is what \n     distinguishes Senate procedure from that of the House of \n     Representatives and forces Democrats and Republicans to \n     come to a consensus when considering major policy matters. \n     Since the reconciliation bill would be considered late in \n     the session and would be narrow in scope providing \n     expedited procedures which severely limit debate and the \n     ability to amend seemed like a reasonable trade off in \n     1974.\n       The Congressional Budget Act has been amended numerous \n     times since 1974 in a continuing effort to impose greater \n     fiscal discipline on budgetary matters. Congress has \n     abandoned the practice of adopting a second budget resolution \n     and now passes one binding resolution that can include \n     reconciliation instructions if necessary. Additional \n     enforcement mechanisms have been added that can be employed \n     during the fiscal year when considering tax and spending \n     bills that should have made it less likely that Congress \n     would need to act at the end of the year to reconcile the \n     fiscal goals contained in the\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\n     budget resolution with the legislation it passes during the \n     year.\n       Just the opposite has occurred and Congressional leaders \n     soon realized that reconciliation could not be used to make \n     major changes in revenue and direct spending laws because of \n     the compressed time for debate and the severe restrictions \n     imposed on individual Senators. Despite the continued reforms \n     and the improving fiscal health of the federal budget, there \n     is still a strong interest in enacting, through expedited \n     procedures, major legislation that has nothing to do with the \n     deficit reduction. Because of procedural protections, \n     reconciliation bills have proven to be almost irresistible \n     vehicles for Senators to move all types of legislation.\n       This abuse of the reconciliation process has been rectified \n     in the past by Congress collectively insisting that the \n     Senate's traditions be maintained. In 1981, the Senate Budget \n     Committee reported a reconciliation bill, S. 1371, the \n     Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, which contained hundreds \n     of pages of authorization provisions that had no impact on \n     the deficit. The bill was viewed by the Senate authorizing \n     committees as a convenient vehicle to pass numerous \n     authorizations, many of which could not be passed as free \n     standing bills. Both Republicans and Democrats viewed this as \n     an abuse of the reconciliation process. Then Majority Leader \n     Howard Baker called up and adopted an amendment which was co-\n     sponsored by Minority Leader Robert C. Byrd, and the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member of the Budget Committee, Senators \n     Domenici and Hollings which struck significant parts of the \n     bill. The following is a colloquy during debate on the \n     amendment:\n       Mr. Baker. Aside from its salutary impact on the budget, \n     reconciliation also has implications for the Senate as a \n     institution . . . I believe that including such extraneous \n     provisions in a reconciliation bill would be harmful to the \n     character of the U.S. Senate. It would cause such material to \n     be considered under time and germaneness provisions that \n     impede the full exercise of minority rights. It would evade \n     the letter and spirit of rule XXII.\n       It would create an unacceptable degree of tension between \n     the Budget Act and the remainder of Senate procedures and \n     practice. Reconciliation was never meant to be a vehicle for \n     an omnibus authorization bill. To permit it to be treated as \n     such is to break faith with the Senate's historical \n     uniqueness as a form for the exercise of minority and \n     individual rights.''\n       Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, if the reconciliation bill is \n     adopted in its present form, it will do violence to the \n     budget reform process. The reconciliation measure contains \n     many items which are unrelated to budget savings. This \n     development must be viewed in the most critical light, to \n     preserve the principle of free and unfettered debate that is \n     the hallmark of the U.S. Senate.\n       The ironclad parliamentary procedures governing the debate \n     of the reconciliation measure should by no means be used to \n     shield controversial or extraneous legislation from free \n     debate. However, language is included in the reconciliation \n     measure that would enact routine authorizations that have no \n     budget impact whatsoever. In other cases, legislation is \n     included that makes drastic alterations in current policy, \n     yet, has no budgetary impact.\n       The reconciliation bill, if it includes such extraneous \n     matters, would diminish the value of rule XXII. The Senate is \n     unique in the way that it protects a minority, even a \n     minority of one, with regard to debate and amendment. The \n     procedures that drive the reconciliation bill set limits on \n     the normally unfettered process of debate and amendment, \n     because policy matters that do not have clear and direct \n     budgetary consequences are supposed to remain outside its \n     scope. (Congressional Record, June 22, 1981, P. S6664-66)\n       The traditions and precedents of the Senate were adhered to \n     during consideration of President Reagan's tax and spending \n     cut proposals in 1981. Appropriately, Congress used the \n     reconciliation procedures to implement the spending cuts \n     contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. \n     However, the President's tax cuts were brought before the \n     Senate as a free-standing bill. More than one hundred \n     amendments were debated and disposed of in twelve days of \n     debate.\n       On October 24, 1985, the Senate debated and adopted the \n     Byrd Rule by a vote of 96-0, as an amendment to the \n     Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. The \n     rule was expanded in an effort to further limit the scope of \n     the reconciliation process to deficit reduction and became \n     Section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act. The following \n     are excerpts from the debate on the amendment:\n       Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, the Senate is a deliberative body, \n     and the reconciliation process is not a deliberative process. \n     It (is) not a deliberative process. Such an extraordinary \n     process, if abused, could destroy the Senates deliberative \n     nature. Senate committees are creatures of the Senate, and, \n     as such, should not be in the position of dictating to the \n     Senate as is being done here. By including material not in \n     their jurisdiction or matter which they choose not to report \n     as separate legislation to avail themselves of the non \n     deliberative reconciliation process, Senate committees \n     violate the compact which created both them and the \n     reconciliation process.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mr. Domenici. Mr. President, as I was saying, I commend the \n     distinguished minority leader. Frankly, as the Chairman of \n     the Budget Committee, I am aware of how beneficial \n     reconciliation can be to deficit reduction. But I am also \n     totally aware of what can happen when we choose to use this \n     kind of process to basically get around the Rules of the \n     Senate as to limiting debate. Clearly, unlimited debate is \n     the prerogative of the Senate that is greatly modified under \n     this process.\n       I have grown to understand that this institution, while it \n     has a lot of shortcomings, has some qualities that are rather \n     exceptional. One of those is the fact it is an extremely free \n     institution, that we are free to offer amendments, that we \n     are free to take as much time as this U.S. Senate will let us \n     to debate and have those issues thoroughly understood both \n     here and across this country. (Congressional Record, October \n     24, 1985, p. S14032-37)\n       On October 13, 1989, the Senate exercised a stringent \n     application of the Byrd Rule. Majority Leader Mitchell, on \n     behalf of himself, and Minority Leader Robert Dole, offered a \n     leadership amendment to strike extraneous provisions from the \n     reconciliation bill, S. 1750. The amendment went further than \n     the text of the Byrd Rule in order to limit the scope of the \n     bill to deficit reduction matters. The debate follows:\n       Mr. Mitchell. Mr. President, the purpose and effect of this \n     amendment may be summed up in a single sentence. The purpose \n     of the reconciliation process is to reduce the deficit.\n       The amendment is lengthy, consisting of many pages, words \n     and numbers, but it has that fundamental objective. As I said \n     when I addressed the Senate a week ago Thursday, the \n     reconciliation process has in recent years gone awry. The \n     special procedures included in the Budget Act as a way of \n     facilitating deficit reduction items became a magnet to other \n     legislation which is unrelated to the objective of reducing \n     the deficit.\n       Mr. Domenici. There are a few things about the U.S. Senate \n     that people understand to be very, very significant. One is \n     that you have the right, a rather broad right, the most \n     significant right, among all parliamentary bodies in \n     the world to amend freely on the floor. The other is the \n     right to debate and to filibuster.\n       When the Budget Act was drafted, the reconciliation \n     procedure was crafted very carefully. It was intended to be \n     used rather carefully because, in essence, Mr. President, it \n     vitiated those two significant characteristics of this place \n     that many have grown to respect and admire. Some think it is \n     a marvelous institution of democracy, and if you lose those \n     two qualities, you just about turn this U.S. Senate into the \n     U.S. House of Representatives or other parliamentary body. \n     (Congressional Record, October 13, 1989, p. S13349-56)\n       In recent years, the use of reconciliation has changed. The \n     procedural protections of the reconciliation process are not \n     being used to enact stand alone legislation that simply \n     reduces taxes. In 1996, the FY 1997 budget resolution \n     contained reconciliation instructions to create three \n     separate reconciliation bills that if enacted would have \n     resulted in a net reduction in the deficit. The House and \n     Senate committees were authorized to report three separate \n     bills, one to reduce Medicaid costs through welfare reform, \n     the second to reduce Medicare costs and the third to reduce \n     taxes. Democratic Leader Daschle argued that this was an \n     abuse of process because it directed the Finance Committee to \n     reconcile several subject matter specific spending bills and \n     for the first time contained instructions to reconcile a \n     stand alone tax reduction bill. The conferees knew that \n     consideration of a tax reduction bill in reconciliation was a \n     great departure from past practices and the statement of \n     managers accompanying the conference report justified it by \n     arguing that the reconciliation tax cut bill was one of three \n     reconciliation bills when taken together would still provide \n     overall deficit reduction. The report states: ``while this \n     resolution includes a reconciliation instruction to reduce \n     revenues, the sum of the instructions would not only reduce \n     the deficit, but result in a balanced budget by 2002.''\n       However, during floor debate on the FY 1997 budget \n     resolution, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Domenici went \n     far beyond the justification for tax cuts contained in the \n     conference report and argued that a 1975 incident involving \n     Senator Russell Long, supported what seemed to be a novel \n     idea in 1996, that reconciliation was not intended solely for \n     deficit reduction and could be used to enact tax cuts. A year \n     after the 1974 Act was passed, Senate Finance Committee \n     Chairman Russell Long came to the floor and announced that a \n     small $6 billion bill to reduce taxes was a reconciliation \n     bill, even though there was never any reference to \n     reconciliation as the Finance Committee moved the bill \n     through the Senate. In fact, the budget resolution was passed \n     six months after the tax bill in question had passed the \n     House and been referred to the Senate Finance Committee. Note \n     the exchange that took place between Senator Muskie, the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and Senator Vance \n     Hartke regarding the use of this new process:\n       Mr. Hartke. In other words, the chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget has made an assumption that this is a \n     reconciliation bill.\n       Mr. Muskie. No, may I say, the chairman of the Committee on \n     Finance has told me it is a reconciliation bill.\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\n       Mr. Hartke. The chairman of the Finance Committee can make \n     a statement, but that does not make it the situation. The \n     Committee on Finance has not acted upon this being a \n     reconciliation bill. There is no record of its being a \n     reconciliation bill; there is no mention of it in the report \n     as being a reconciliation bill. Therefore, I think a point of \n     order would not be well in regard to any amendment, because \n     it is not a reconciliation bill. This is a tax reduction \n     bill. I can see where the Senator may assume, but it is an \n     assumption which is not based on a fact.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mr. Hartke. I am not chasing my tail. I will point out, \n     very simply, that in my judgment, this is a case where two \n     Senators have gotten together and agreed that this is a \n     reconciliation bill and there is nothing in the record to \n     show that it is a reconciliation bill. (Congressional Record, \n     December 15, 1975, p. ?)\n       This 1975 incident was ignored and not relied upon until \n     1996, during consideration of the FY 1997 budget resolution \n     when it was used by the Republican Leadership to prop up the \n     argument for a stand alone tax reduction bill in \n     reconciliation. Prior to that, it was viewed as an aberration \n     that occurred at a time when Congress was trying to figure \n     out how to implement the new Budget Act. The 1975 incident \n     was never viewed as a valid precedent on reconciliation, \n     since it basically contradicted two decades of practice where \n     the sole focus of reconciliation has been deficit reduction. \n     The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget \n     Committee, Senators Hollings and Domenici did not give any \n     credence to the 1975 incident when they announced in 1980 \n     that the budget resolution under consideration that year, \n     would be the first time Congress attempted to use the \n     reconciliation process provided in the Budget Act. Senator \n     Hollings, then the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \n     made the following statement.\n       ``Today, we will take another step in the practical \n     application of the Budget Act's design. The reconciliation \n     procedure has never before been employed. The action we take \n     today will set an important precedent for making the budget \n     stick.'' (Congressional Record, June 30, 1980)\n       Senator Domenici concurred with his Chairman and made the \n     following statement:\n       ``Mr. President, I rise today to support the reconciliation \n     bill that is now before the Senate. This is an historic \n     moment, both for the institution and for the budget process \n     that this institution devised for itself in 1974. The first \n     attempt to use the reconciliation provisions in the Budget \n     Act was made last fall on the second budget resolution for \n     fiscal year 1980.'' (Congressional Record, June 30, 1980)\n       In addition, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act in 1985 \n     which further clarified the scope of reconciliation and made \n     moot, any arguments that the 1975 incident opened the door to \n     a broader application of reconciliation. Section 310(d) was \n     added to the Congressional Budget Act to severely restrict \n     amendments to reconciliation bills that did not have the \n     affect of reducing the deficit. The language of Section \n     310(d)(2) is as follows:\n       (2) It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     amendment to a reconciliation bill or reconciliation \n     resolution if such amendment would have the effect of \n     decreasing any specific budget outlay reductions below the \n     level of such outlay reductions provided (in such fiscal \n     years) in the reconciliation instructions . . . or would have \n     the effect of reducing Federal revenue increases below the \n     level of such revenue increases provided (for such fiscal \n     years) in such instructions relating to such bill or \n     resolution. . . .\n       While the provision limits floor amendments, the clear \n     inference when read in the context of the overall section is \n     that reconciliation dealt only with decreasing spending or \n     increasing taxes and any amendment offered during \n     reconciliation had to have an offset so as not to thwart \n     deficit reduction.\n       In 1966, during consideration of the FY 1997 budget \n     resolution, Democratic Leader Daschle made several inquiries \n     of the Chair and the responses by the Presiding Officer could \n     be used to argue for a broader application in the use of \n     reconciliation. However, the point of order raised against \n     the budget resolution by Senator Daschle, the ruling of the \n     Chair and the subsequent appeal, all of which carry much more \n     weight in Senate procedure, were quite narrow and allowed \n     this precedent to be distinguished in order to preserve the \n     integrity of the reconciliation process. The point of order \n     raised by the Democratic Leader, given the particular \n     reconciliation instructions at issue can be summarized as \n     follows: It is inappropriate to consider a stand alone \n     reconciliation bill to cut taxes, even if the net impact of \n     the three reconciliation bills taken together reduced the \n     deficit. The point of order raised by the Democratic Leader \n     was not sustained and the appeal of the ruling by the full \n     Senate was not successful. Note the point of order and the \n     ruling of the Chair.\n       Mr. Daschle. I argue that, because it creates a budget \n     reconciliation bill devoted solely to worsening the deficit, \n     it should no longer deserve the limitations on debate of a \n     budget resolution. Therefore, I raise a point of order that, \n     for these reasons, the pending resolution is not a budget \n     resolution.\n       The Presiding Officer. All right. The Chair will rule that \n     the resolution is appropriate and the point of order is not \n     sustained. (Congressional Record, May 21, 1996, p. S5415-7)\n       The Senate's decision in 1996 to use reconciliation to \n     consider a stand alone tax cut bill, even in the context of \n     overall deficit reduction, was a major departure from the \n     past practice and over two decades of experience in applying \n     the Act. The 1996 precedent can and must be distinguished \n     from recent efforts to use reconciliation to enact tax cuts \n     where there is absolutely no attempt at deficit reduction. \n     The procedural issues raised by using the reconciliation \n     process to enact tax reductions, absent an overall effort to \n     reduce the deficit, have not yet been joined by the Senate \n     and remain an open question.\n       While the reconciliation instructions of the FY 1997 budget \n     resolution taken as a whole arguably met the intended deficit \n     reduction goals, recent reconciliation instructions have \n     completely perverted the intent of the 1974 Act. In 1999, the \n     reconciliation process was used by the Republican leadership \n     to allow for a $792 billion tax cut to be brought to the \n     Senate floor. Unlike the FY 1997 budget resolution, no \n     argument was made that the tax cut would actually lead to \n     increased revenues or spending reductions. It was the first \n     time that reconciliation instructions were issued and a \n     revenue bill reported pursuant to those instructions, \n     mandated a worsening of fiscal discipline for the federal \n     government. Again, in 2000, reconciliation was used to limit \n     consideration of a major tax cut proposal that had nothing to \n     do with deficit reduction.\n       There has been a great deal of speculation, fueled by the \n     Senate Republican Leadership, that President Bush's tax plan \n     will be brought to the Senate floor with reconciliation \n     protections. It is expected the legislation will provide for \n     at least $1.6 trillion and perhaps as much as $2.6 trillion \n     in tax cuts over 10 years. The legislation is not expected to \n     contain any reductions in spending and the result of the \n     proposed tax bill will be a worsening the fiscal position of \n     the federal government. If Congress provides sufficient room \n     in the FY2002 budget resolution to enact tax reductions there \n     is absolutely no reason to consider the bill in \n     reconciliation, except to completely preclude the minority \n     from participating in fashioning the bill.\n       The Senate is at a point, as it was in the 1980's, when the \n     use of reconciliation to enact legislation unrelated to \n     deficit reduction, threatens to undermine the most important \n     traditions and precedents of the Senate and make a mockery of \n     the congressional budget process. In a recent article \n     entitled, ``Budget Battles, Government by Reconciliation,'' \n     in the National Journal on January 9, 2001, the author, Mr. \n     Stan Collender, an expert on the federal budget process, who \n     served as senior staff member of the House Budget Committee \n     in the 1970's states:\n       ``. . . At this point, there is talk about at least five \n     different reconciliation bills--three for different tax \n     proposals and two for various entitlement changes. Still more \n     are being considered. Taking advantage of the reconciliation \n     procedures in this way would not be precedent-shattering, \n     though it would clearly be an extraordinary extension of what \n     has been done previously. Nevertheless, it would be the \n     latest in what has become a steady degradation of the \n     congressional budget process. Reconciliation, which was \n     created to make it easier to impose budget discipline, would \n     instead be used to make it easier to get around other \n     procedural safeguards with the result being more spending and \n     lower revenues.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1894-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1894-S1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE FUTURE OF PROJECT IMPACT\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nin President Bush's decision to discontinue funding for the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency's Project Impact.\n  Project Impact is a nationwide public-private partnership designed to \nhelp communities become more disaster resistant. Each year, Congress \nappropriates literally billions of dollars in disaster relief money. \nProject Impact is our only program that provides financial incentives \nand support to State and local governments that want to mitigate the \ndamage of future disasters.\n  Project Impact involves all sectors of the community in developing a \nmitigation plan that meets that community's unique needs. One of the \nprogram's pilot projects is in Wilmington, NC. In that coastal \ncommunity, the city government has teamed with the State and county \ngovernment and private groups like Lowe's Hardware Store to retrofit \nschools and shelters to make them less vulnerable to the frequent \nhurricanes that plague my State. The University of North Carolina at \nWilmington also provides support for the city's efforts. That is the \ngreat thing about the Project Impact communities--they are using all \navailable agencies and organizations to ensure safe and smart \ndevelopment.\n  Project Impact is a relatively new program, but it has already shown \nimportant results. In his recent budget\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nsubmission to Congress, the President described Project Impact as \n``ineffective.'' I strongly disagree, and there are community leaders \naround the Nation that would take exemption to this description. For \nexample, one of the first Project Impact communities was Seattle, WA. \nExperts agree that without the area's mitigation efforts spurred by \nProject Impact, the damage from last week's earthquake could have been \nmuch worse.\n  We cannot stop a hurricane, an earthquake, or a tornado. But we can \nsave precious lives and limited Federal resources by encouraging States \nand local governments to take preventative measures to mitigate the \ndamage. By discontinuing funding for Project Impact, this \nadministration will severely undercut ongoing mitigation programs in \nall 50 States. Most importantly, by discontinuing this program rather \nthan working to refine it, the administration sends a dangerous signal \nto States and local governments that the Federal Government no longer \nsupports their efforts.\n  I call on President Bush to reassess the benefits of this program and \ninclude it in his final budget he sends to Congress. For the nearly 300 \nProject Impact communities that are working to make their communities \nsafer, fully funding Project Impact is the least we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1895-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ONE OF DELAWARE AND THE NATION'S FINEST\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Delaware, officially called ``the \nFirst State'' is sometimes called, ``the Diamond State'' and ``the \nSmall Wonder'' because of the amazing quality Delawareans bring and \nhave brought to this Nation. One of the gems in the Diamond State is a \ncompany hidden near the center in the small town of Frederica, DE. That \ncompany is ``ILC Dover.'' ILC is best known as the sole designer, \ndeveloper, and manufacturer of the Apollo and Shuttle Space Suits.\n  The man who has outfitted America's astronauts for 40 years and \nhelped make manned space flight possible--serving the past 17 years as \npresident and general manager of ILC--is retiring. Homer Reihm, better \nknown to his friends and co-workers as ``Sonny,'' is a local legend. It \nwas Sonny Reihm who was ILC's program manager for the Apollo program on \nJuly 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong wore ILC's space suit on the Moon.\n  ILC has continued to be true to its space heritage by making the \nsuits worn by astronauts in the Shuttle and Space Station missions. As \nAmerica has gone further into space, so has ILC, most recently by \nproducing the Pathfinder Airbags that landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. \nIn 1998, in recognition of ILC's history of excellence in the service \nof America's space missions, Sonny Reihm accepted NASA's top quality \naward--known as the George Low award--honoring ILC's 100 percent \nmission success in planetary and space environments.\n  While Mr. Reihm's career has paralleled the NASA space program, under \nhis leadership ILC has gone much farther to produce important advances \nfor the military including the M-40 series protective masks used by our \nsoldiers since the end of Desert Storm, the Demilitarized Protective \nEnsemble, Aircrew protective mask systems, collective protection Chem-\nBio shelters, and lighter-than-air Aerostats used for monitoring and \ndetection. ILC has leveraged these initiatives into commercial \napplications of protective suits, flexible containment devices for the \nPharmaceutical industry, and advertising airships like the blimps seen \nso often at ball games.\n  Sonny Reihm is a Delawarean through and through. He was born and \nraised on a farm in the Middletown/Odessa/Townsend area of Delaware. He \ngraduated from the University of Delaware in 1960. Upon graduation, he \njoined ILC as a project engineer when ILC was bidding on the Apollo \nprogram. After leading the effort to successfully field the Apollo \nSpace Suit, Mr. Reihm became the general manager of ILC in 1975. His \nmandate was to diversify the company to survive the post-Apollo \nmission, while still holding true to ILC's tradition of serving America \nwith its unique technical knowledge. Almost ten years later, in 1984, \nafter meeting the diversification challenge, Sonny became President and \ngeneral manager of ILC. From 1975 to today, he helped build ILC from a \n25-employee corporation, to a major business player in our State and \nNation. With 450 employees today, ILC continues to provide needed \ninnovations for NASA, for the military, and for other American \nbusinesses.\n  As outstanding as it has been, Sonny Reihm's business success is only \none portion of his larger commitment to public service. He has served \nlocal and national communities throughout his life through his \ninvolvement in the University of Delaware Board of Trustees, the \nDelaware Manufacturing Association, the National Defense Industrial \nAssociation, the Soldier Biological Chemical Command Acquisition Reform \nInitiatives, the USO in Delaware, and the United Way.\n  On a more personal note, I am proud to call Sonny and his wife Nancy \ndear friends. After his long, prodigious--indeed astronomic--career, \nSonny has earned many years of enjoyment in his retirement with his \nwife, two daughters and grandchildren. He exemplifies the commitment to \nexcellence and the national good that make Delaware the Small Wonder \nand keep this Nation strong. It is my honor today to salute him and his \nmany years of business and community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1895-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1895-S1896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, today is the 11th Annual National \nSportsmanship Day, which is a unique program that champions \nsportsmanship and enhances student leadership and academic skills. The \nobject of the 2001 National Sportsmanship Day is to promote \nappreciation for the critical role of ethics and honesty in athletics \nand society through student-athlete outreach programs, writing and art \ncontests, coaches' forums and other activities aimed at furthering the \nprinciples of sportsmanship.\n  National Sportsmanship Day was founded at the University of Rhode \nIsland in 1991. Today, more than 12,000 elementary, middle, and high \nschools, as well as colleges and universities in all 50 States and over \n100 countries will participate in the events planned to help instill in \nyoung people the importance of playing fair and the value of hard work \nand discipline. The Institute of Sport is also proud that National \nSportsmanship Day will be webcast over the Internet. Through online \ninteraction with featured guests, exclusive interviews, and \nsportsmanship polls, this event will harness the power and expanse of \nthe World Wide Web to reach students and supporters here and around the \nworld.\n  The organizers of National Sportsmanship Day have gathered some of \nthe best of our nation's sportsmen and women to serve as 2001 Sports \nEthics Fellows. By sharing their remarkable accomplishments athletes \nGrant Hill of the Orlando Magic, soccer great Mia Hamm, Sergei Fedorov \nof the Detroit Red Wings, and 2000 Olympic Gold Medalist Lenny \nKrayzelburg, among others, will help encourage young athletes to strive \nand succeed by the rules of fair play. And in so doing, these gifted \nathletic heroes will inspire today's athletes to impart on future \nathletes the lessons of good sportsmanship.\n  Also part of this event and in its third year is a program called \n``The No Swear Zone,'' which is a pledge that can be signed by athletes \nand coaches to stop the use of profanity in sports and everyday life. \nFurther, in conjunction with National Sportsmanship Day, the Institute \nfor International Sport will launch the Center for Sports Parenting. \nThis online center will provide an interactive service where parents, \ncoaches, educators, and team officials involved in youth sports can \nseek guidance on youth sports. Indeed, it is equally important for \nadults involved in youth athletics to teach and lead in the spirit of \nsportsmanship.\n  Sportsmanship needs to be taught to each successive generation, and I \ncommend the Institute of Sport and all this year's participants for \nmaking sure that this valuable life lesson continues to lead the way on \nand off the field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1896-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN HONOR OF THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS 2001 STATE \n                       HONOREES FOR PENNSYLVANIA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I stand before you today to \nrecognize two outstanding students from the great Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania. Ms. Lindsay Stewart of Windber and Mr. Alexander Gates of \nPalmyra have just been named State Honorees in The 2001 Prudential \nSpirit of Community Awards program. This program honors one high school \nstudent and one middle-level student in each state for outstanding acts \nof volunteerism. They were selected from nearly 23,000 who were \nconsidered for this year's program.\n  Ms. Stewart was nominated by Forest Hills High School where she is a \nsenior, for her creation of the ``Humanitarian Club.'' This club is \ndedicated to providing information about chemical brain disorders, and \npromoting tolerance of understanding of individuals who suffer from \nthem. Inspired by an aunt afflicted with schizophrenia, Lindsay wanted \nto educate others about mental illnesses. During the past three years \nof her program, more than 300 people have experienced and learned from \nLindsay's Humanitarian Club programs.\n  Mr. Gates is an eighth grader at Palmyra Area Middle School, where he \nled an effort to erect a monument commemorating Palmyra-area veterans \nwho were killed in wartime military service. Alexander's design \nincluded a six-foot obelisk inspired by his grandfather, who is a World \nWar II veteran. He raised $8,250 to build the monument by selling \ngranite bricks that would be inscribed with contributors' names and \nplaced around the base of the memorial. Alexander included an \ninscription on the obelisk that reads, ``This monument honors the \nspirit of self-sacrifice which is necessary for the survival of a \ncommunity. It honors those members of the community who paid the \nultimate price so we can live in a free and just country.''\n  I enthusiastically applaud Ms. Stewart and Mr. Gates for their \ninitiative in seeking to make our communities better places to live, \nand for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. It is \nat times like these, when I am given the opportunity to see the young \npeople of our great nation make such a substantial difference, that I \nam so proud to be an American. Lindsay and Alexander have displayed \ngreat maturity, leadership, and most importantly, patriotism.

A bill to provide for fairness and accuracy in high stakes \neducational decisions for students; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill I \nintroduced last year that addresses high stakes testing: the practice \nof using a test as the sole determinant of whether a student will be \ngraduated, promoted or placed in different ability groupings. I am \nincreasingly concerned that high stakes tests are being grossly abused \nin the name of greater accountability, and almost always to the serious \ndetriment of our children.\n  Testing is necessary and beneficial. We should require it. But, \nallowing the continued misuse of high-stakes tests is, in itself, a \ngross failure of imagination, a failure both of educators and of \npolicymakers, who persistently refuse to provide the educational \nresources necessary to guarantee an equally rich educational experience \nfor all our children. That all citizens will be given an equal start \nthrough a sound education is one of the most basic, promised rights of \nour democracy. Our chronic refusal as a nation to guarantee that right \nfor all children, including poor children, is a national disgrace.\n  This legislation would stem the growing trend of misusing high stakes \ntests. The legislation would require that states and districts use \nmultiple indicators of student achievement in addition to standardized \ntests if they are going to use tests as part of a high stakes decision. \nThe legislation would also require that if tests are used, they must be \nvalid and reliable for the purposes for which they are used; must \nmeasure what the student was taught; and must provide appropriate \naccommodations for students with limited English proficiency and \ndisabilities.\n  It is important to note that the American Psychological Association, \nthe group entrusted with developing the standards for educational \ntesting, has endorsed this legislation. Like many Americans who care \ndeeply that our students are assessed appropriately, they feel that it \nis crucial for us to stem a tide that it becoming increasingly \nproblematic.\n  I would like to explain exactly why this bill would be so important \nand why I seek your support for it. I am struck by National Education \nAssociation President Bob Chase's comparison of this trend toward high \nstakes testing to the movie, ``Field of Dreams.'' In my view, it is as \nthough people are saying, ``If we test them, they will perform.'' In \ntoo many places, testing, which is a critical part of systemic \neducational accountability, has ceased its purpose of measuring \neducational and school improvement and has become synonymous with it.\n  Making students accountable for test scores works well on a bumper \nsticker, and it allows many politicians to look good by saying that \nthey will not tolerate failure. But it represents a hollow promise. Far \nfrom improving education, high stakes testing marks a major retreat \nfrom fairness, from accuracy, from quality and from equity.\n  When used correctly, standardized tests are critical for diagnosing \ninequality and for identifying where we need improvement. They enable \nus to measure achievement across groups of students so that we can help \nensure that states and districts are held accountable for improving the \nachievement of all students regardless of race, income, gender, limited \nEnglish proficiency or disability. Tests are a critical tool, but they \nare not a panacea.\n  The abuse of tests for high stakes purposes has subverted the \nbenefits tests can bring. Using a single standardized test as the sole \ndeterminant for promotion, tracking, ability grouping and graduation is \nnot fair and has not fostered greater equality or opportunity for \nstudents. First, standardized tests can not sufficiently validly or \nreliably assess what students know to make high stakes decisions about \nthem.\n  The 1999 National Research Council report, ``High Stakes,'' concludes \nthat\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n``no single test score can be considered a definitive measure of a \nstudent's knowledge,'' and that ``an educational decision that will \nhave a major impact on a test taker should not be made solely or \nautomatically on the basis of a single test score.''\n  The ``Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing,'' 1999 \nEdition, which has served as the standard for test developers and users \nfor decades, asserts that: ``In educational settings, a decision or a \ncharacterization that will have a major impact on a student should not \nbe made on the basis of a single test score.''\n  Even test publishers, including Harcourt Brace, CTB McGraw Hill, \nRiverside and ETS, consistently warn against this practice. For \nexample, Riverside Publishing asserts in the ``Interpretive Guide for \nSchool Administrators'' for the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, ``Many of \nthe common misuses, of standardized tests, stem from depending on a \nsingle test score to make a decision about a student or class of \nstudents.''\n  CTB McGraw Hill writes that ``A variety of tests, or multiple \nmeasures, is necessary to tell educators what students know and can do \n. . . the multiple measures approach to assessment is the keystone to \nvalid, reliable, fair information about student achievement.''\n  There are many reasons tests cannot be relied upon as the sole \ndeterminant in making high stakes decisions about students. The \nNational Research Council describes how these tests can be unreliable. \nThe Council concludes that ``a student's test score can be expected to \nvary across different versions of a test, . . . as a function of the \nparticular sample questions asked and/or transitory factors, such as \nthe student's health on the day of the test. Thus, no single test score \ncan be considered a definitive measure of a student's knowledge.''\n  The research of David Rogosa at Stanford University shows how test \nscores are not valid, in isolation, to make judgements about individual \nachievement. His study of California's Stanford 9 National Percentile \nRank Scores for individual students showed that the chances that a \nstudent whose true score is in the 50th percentile will receive a \nreported score that is within 5 percentage points of his true score are \nonly 30 percent in reading and 42 percent on ninth grade math tests.\n  Rogosa also showed that on the Stanford 9 test ``the chances, . . . \nthat two students with identical ``real achievement'' will score more \nthan 10 percentile points apart on the same test'' is 57 percent for \n9th graders and 42 percent on the fourth grade reading test. This \nmargin of error shows why it would not be fair to use a cut-score in \nmaking a high stakes decision about a child.\n  Robert Rayborn, who directs Harcourt's Stanford 9 program in \nCalifornia reenforced these findings when asked about the Stanford 9. \nHe said, ``They should never make high-stakes individual decisions with \na single measure of any kind,'' including the Stanford 9.\n  Politicians and policy makers who continue to push for high stakes \ntests and educators who continue to use them in the face of this \nknowledge have closed their eyes to clearly set professional and \nscientific standards. They demand responsibility and high standards of \nstudents and schools while they let themselves get away with defying \nthe most basic standards of the education profession.\n  It would be irresponsible if a parent or a teacher used a \nmanufactured product on children in a way that the manufacturer says is \nunsafe. Why do we then honor and declare ``accountable\" policy makers \nand politicians who use tests on children in a way that the test \nmanufacturers have said is effectively unsafe?\n  Many of my colleagues will remember how 8,600 students in New York \nCity were mistakenly held in summer school because their tests were \ngraded incorrectly or how 54 students in Minnesota were denied their \ndiplomas because of a test scoring error.\n  When we talk about responsibility, what could be more irresponsible \nthan using an invalid or unreliable measure as the sole determinant of \nsomething so important as high school graduation or in-school \npromotion?\n  It has been clearly established through research that high stakes \ntests for individual students, when used in isolation, are fatally \nflawed. I would, however, also like to address a general issue that \nthis bill does not address directly, but that I think is really what \nall of this is about in the end. The trend towards high stakes testing \nrepresents a harsh agenda that holds children responsible for our own \nfailure to invest in their future and in their achievement. I firmly \nbelieve that it is grossly unfair, for example, to hold back a student \nbased on a standardized test if that student has not had the tools \nrequired to learn the material covered on the test. When we impose high \nstakes tests on an educational system where there are, as Jonathan \nKozol says, ``savage inequalities,'' and then we do nothing to address \nthe underlying causes of those inequalities, we set up children to \nfail.\n  People talk about using tests to motivate students to do well and \nusing tests to ensure that we close the achievement gap. This kind of \ntalk is unfair because it tells only part of the story. We cannot close \nthe achievement gap until we close the gap in investment between poor \nand rich schools no matter how ``motivated'' some students are. We know \nwhat these key investments are: quality teaching, parental involvement, \nand early childhood education, to name just a few.\n  But instead of doing what we know will work, and instead of taking \nresponsibility as policy makers to invest in improving students' lives, \nwe place the responsibility squarely on children. It is simply \nnegligent to force children to pass a test and expect that the poorest \nchildren, who face every disadvantage, will be able to do as well as \nthose who have every advantage.\n  When we do this, we hold children responsible for our own inaction \nand unwillingness to live up to our own promises and our own \nobligations. We confuse their failure with our own. This is a harsh \nagenda indeed, for America's children.\n  All of us in politics like to get our picture taken with children. We \nnever miss a ``photo op.'' We all like to say that ``children are our \nfuture.'' We are all for children until it comes time to make the \ninvestment. Too often, despite the talk, when it comes to making the \ninvestment in the lives of our children, we come up a dollar short.\n  Noted civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer used to say, ``I'm sick \nand tired of being sick and tired.'' Well I'm sick and tired of \nsymbolic politics. When we say we are for children, we ought to be \ncommitted to invest in the health, skills and intellect of our \nchildren. We are not going to achieve our goals on a tin cup budget. \nUnless we make a real commitment and fully fund key programs like Head \nStart, Title I and IDEA, and unless we put our money where our mouth \nis, children will continue to fail.\n  We must never stop demanding that children do their best. We must \nnever stop holding schools accountable. Measures of student performance \ncan include standardized tests, but only when coupled with other \nmeasures of achievement, more substantive education reforms and a much \nfuller, sustained investment in schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 461. A bill to support educational partnerships, focusing on \nmathematics, science, and technology, between institutions of higher \neducation and elementary schools and secondary schools, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Math and \nScience Education Partnership Act. This bill will encourage States, \ninstitutions of higher education, elementary schools and secondary \nschools to work together to improve the math and science teaching as a \nprofession.\n  The purpose of this act is many fold. Through partnering schools with \nhigher education institutions, the bill proposes to encourage \ninstitutions of higher education to assume greater responsibility for \nimproving math and science teacher education through the establishment \nof a comprehensive, integrated system of recruiting and advising such \nteachers. Such partnerships will bring together math and science \nteachers in elementary schools and secondary schools with scientists, \nmathematicians, and engineers to increase\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nteacher content knowledge and improve teaching skills through the use \nof more sophisticated laboratory space and equipment, computing \nfacilities, libraries and other resources that colleges and \nuniversities are more able to provide.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Education to \naward competitive grants to eligible partnerships for a period of 5 \nyears. The partnerships will include a state, a math or science \ndepartment of an institution of higher education, and a local school \ndistrict. A priority will be given to those districts with a high \npoverty rate and a high number of teachers teaching out of their \nsubject area.\n  A partnership may use the grant funds to develop more rigorous \nmathematics and science curricula based on standards, to recruit math \nand science majors to teaching through bonuses, stipends for \nalternative certification and scholarships, and to establish math and \nscience summer workshops for teachers. Each eligible partnership \nreceiving a grant under this Act must develop an evaluation and \naccountability plan that includes the following objectives and \nmeasures: improved student performance on state math and science \nassessments or on the Third International Math and Science Study \nassessment; increased participation by students in advanced courses in \nmath and science; increased percentages of secondary school classes in \nmath and science taught by teachers with majors in math and science; \nincreased numbers of math and science teachers who participate in \ncontent-based professional development activities; and passing rates of \nstudents in advanced courses in math and science.\n  Each partnership will be required to report the progress made toward \nthese objectives to the Secretary annually. The Secretary will then \ndetermine whether or not the partnership is making substantial progress \nin meeting its goals. I urge my fellow colleagues to cosponsor the Math \nand Science Education Partnership Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for contributions to charitable organizations \nwhich provide scholarships for children to attend elementary and \nsecondary schools; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill provide new educational options to the students who need those \noptions the most.\n  While many Americans are satisfied with the public schools available \nto their children, we know that there are also many who are not, and \nwith good reason.\n  In large urban school districts, a majority of students drop out \nbefore high school graduation. Nearly 70 percent are unable to read at \nthe so-called ``basic'' level. And all too frequently, violence and \nentrenched mediocrity create a climate where learning is actually \ndiscouraged.\n  No wonder caring parents in such circumstances want alternatives.\n  We have seen compelling evidence of the pent-up demand for different \noptions when private organizations have invited low-income parents to \napply for partial scholarships that could be used at a non-public \nschool.\n  Usually, these private scholarship programs are structured in such a \nway that, to be eligible for an award, a low-income family must agree \nto contribute a significant portion of the total tuition bill.\n  The results are striking: In 1997, two distinguished business \nleaders, Ted Forstmann and John Walton invited applications for one \nthousand partial tuition scholarships from families here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Nearly eight thousand applications were received.\n  In 1998, they formed an organization called the Children's \nScholarship Fund to apply the idea on a national basis. They planned to \noffer 40,000 scholarships. 1.25 million applications were received.\n  No less impressive than the numbers are the testimonials offered by \nparents who have been pleading for better options.\n  One mother said the following about her experience: ``We would not be \nable to afford this without your help. Our daughter is really excited \nto be learning spelling and grammar, which was not being taught in \npublic school. She's an aspiring writer and thinks this is great. My \nson has autism, and his new school had more services in place for him \non the first day of school, without me even asking, than we've been \nable to pull out of the public school in six years! They both love \ntheir new schools and are doing well.''\n  Here's another mother's testimony: I am so excited that my son has \nbeen chosen to receive a scholarship . . . One evening I sat on my bed \nand cried because I really wanted him to attend a private school but I \nknow that I cannot afford all of the tuition. Therefore your \nscholarship fund was my only hope.''\n  Yet another mother wrote, ``I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I \nam for this opportunity to send my children to a private school. As a \nlow-income mother of four wonderful children with great potential, I \nwould not be able to provide this chance for them without your help.\n  This particular mother goes on to say, ``I have chosen,'' I cannot \nput enough stress on that word, ``chosen a school that will help \nnurture the seeds of greatness in them. I am sure that with this \nopportunity to succeed, my children will be successful and contribute \ngreatly to society in the future.''\n  Mr. President, in 1997, leaders in my state settled on a plan to help \nthe private sector to satisfy that vast unmet demand for options. They \ninstituted a state tax credit that allows Arizona residents to claim a \ndollar-for-dollar income tax credit for donations to school tuition \norganizations, like the Children's Scholarship Fund.\n  Thanks to that program, 4,000 Arizona students, nearly all of them \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, have received scholarship assistance \nthat has made it possible for them to enroll in a school of their \nchoice. The number of school tuition organizations operating in the \nstate has shot up from 2 to 33.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would extend this Arizona idea \nnation-wide, and I am pleased that my Arizona colleague, Congressman \nJohn Shadegg, will introduce this legislation this week in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  By way of tribute to President Bush's more comprehensive education \nproposal, I have given this bill the title, ``The Leave No Child Behind \nTax Credit Act of 2001.''\n  The Leave No Child Behind Tax Credit Act would allow a family or \nbusiness to claim a $250 tax credit for donations to qualified school \ntuition organizations. To qualify for that designation, an organization \nwould have to devote at least 90 percent of its annual income to \noffering grants and scholarships for parents to use to send their \nchildren to the school of their choice.\n  Scholarships awarded by such organizations could be used to offset \ntuition costs at a private school, or to pay the tuition costs families \nin most states must pay to enroll a child in a public school across \ndistrict boundaries.\n  This measure would move us toward an education policy that recognizes \nthe vital importance of parental choice.\n  It also recognizes and encourages the efforts that have been \nundertaken by public-spirited private citizens to find non-governmental \nsolutions to the serious challenge of improving education in our \ncountry. These activists embody the vision set forth by President Bush \nin his inaugural address, the vision of responsible citizens building \ncommunities of service and a nation of character.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n  Moreover, when parents are able to decide for themselves how to go \nabout securing one of life's most vital goods, namely, education for \ntheir children, rather than having such decisions made for them by a \nbureaucracy, they become, in President Bush's memorable terms, \ncitizens, not subjects.\n  I believe that this legislation will help them to do that, and I am \nvery pleased to introduce it today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for increased access to HIV/AIDS-related \ntreatments and services in developing foreign countries; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since the beginning of the AIDS \nepidemic, more than 17 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, one half \nthe population of California, have died from AIDS.\n  To begin to address this catastrophe, Senator Feingold and I \nintroduced an Amendment to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act that \nwould have helped ensure access to generic AIDS drugs for nations in \nsub-Saharan Africa ravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  Despite the fact that this amendment was approved by the Senate, it \nwas stricken from the final Africa Trade Conference Report.\n  Subsequently, the Clinton Administration issued an Executive Order \nthat ensured that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa could provide \ntheir people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n  And, two weeks ago, I am pleased to note, the Bush Administration \nindicated that it would not seek to overturn this Executive Order.\n  Now, Senator Feingold and I have developed the ``Global Access to \nAIDS Treatment Act of 2001'' which, among other provisions: Codifies \nthe Executive Order into law; Directs that the law must apply to the 48 \nnations of sub-Saharan Africa; and Expands the scope of the law to \ncover all developing nations facing a catastrophic AIDS crisis.\n  Unless the United States takes a leadership role in recognizing, as \ndoes the WTO TRIPS agreement, that there is a moral obligation to put \npeople over profits, the human devastation and social instability that \nhas already begun in countries facing an AIDS crisis will grow to \nunfathomable levels.\n  Until recently, many people have been unaware of the depth of the \nglobal loss being caused by this epidemic.\n  The HIV virus has infected over 36 million people worldwide, with \nover 95 percent of those infected living outside of the United States.\n  Over 21.8 million people have died from HIV/AIDS world-wide since the \nbeginning of the epidemic, 3 million in 2000 alone.\n  In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70 percent of all deaths from HIV/AIDS \nhave occurred, 17 million people, as I said before, have died from HIV/\nAIDS since the epidemic began, and 2.4 million in the year 2000.\n  To address this pandemic, Senator Feingold and I have developed \nlegislation to address the crisis. This legislation does the following:\n  First, this legislation directs the U.S. Government to refrain from \nseeking the revision of any law, imposed by a government of a \ndeveloping nation facing an AIDS crisis, that promotes access to HIV/\nAIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.\n  This will ensure that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable and more \navailable to those most in need.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes $25 million a year for programs \nto develop and strengthen health care infrastructure in developing \ncountries.\n  Third, the legislation calls upon the World Health Organization and \nUNAIDS to take the lead in organizing efficient procurement of \ncompulsory licences of pharmaceutical patents, active ingredients of \ndrugs, and finished medications for countries that require this \nassistance.\n  Fourth, this legislation calls on the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to work \nwith developing countries and international service providers to \ndevelop best practices for delivering pharmaceuticals to those who need \nthem.\n  Fifth, this legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA, and NIH to develop and maintain a database for information on \ndrugs, patent status, and treatment protocols to assist health-care \nproviders from around the globe in providing the best care possible to \nall patients.\n  And finally, this legislation provides $1 million a year to encourage \nAmerican physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, \npublic health workers, pharmacists, and other health professionals to \nprovide HIV/AIDS care and treatment in developing countries.\n  This legislation will allow countries facing an HIV/AIDS crisis to \nbetter determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their \ncountries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n  It is clearly in the national interest of the United States to \nprevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS, and I believe that this \nlegislation is necessary to continue to assist the countries of the \ndeveloping world to bring this deadly disease under control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\n                                 S. 463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Access to AIDS \n     Treatment Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, it has claimed \n     21,800,000 lives.\n       (2) Over 17,000,000 men, women, and children, have died due \n     to AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.\n       (3) Over 36,000,000 people are infected with the HIV virus \n     today. Over 25,000,000 live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (4) By 2010, approximately 40,000,000 children worldwide \n     will have lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS.\n       (5) Access to effective treatment for HIV/AIDS is \n     determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure, \n     and sustainable financing.\n       (6) In January 2000, the National Intelligence Council \n     released an intelligence estimate that framed the HIV/AIDS \n     pandemic as a security threat, noting the relationship \n     between the disease and political and economic instability.\n       (7) The overriding priority for responding to the HIV/AIDS \n     crisis should be to emphasize and encourage prevention.\n       (8) An effective response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic must \n     also involve assistance to stimulate the development of \n     health service delivery infrastructure in affected States.\n       (9) An effective United States response to the HIV/AIDS \n     crisis must also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS \n     vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease.\n       (10) The innovative capacity of the United States in the \n     commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is \n     unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these \n     sectors will be a critical element in any successful strategy \n     to respond to the global HIV/AIDS crisis.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the policy of the United States that the United States will \n     not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or \n     revision of intellectual property or competition laws or \n     policies that regulate pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies used to treat HIV/AIDS or the most common \n     opportunistic infections that accompany HIV/AIDS in any \n     foreign country undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health \n     crisis if the laws or policies of that foreign country--\n       (1) promote access to the pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies for affected populations; and\n       (2) provide intellectual property protection consistent \n     with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \n     Property Rights referred to in paragraph (15) of section \n     101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3511(d)(15)).\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to encourage the World Health Organization and the \n     Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to carry \n     out HIV/AIDS activities in foreign countries that are \n     undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis, \n     including activities that are consistent with the policy \n     described in section 2(b); and\n       (2) that the World Health Organization and the Joint United \n     Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) should lead the \n     international organization of the manufacture and \n     distribution of pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for \n     HIV/AIDS, including the global registration of products and \n     the organization of the efficient procurement of compulsory \n     licenses, active ingredients, and finished products for \n     foreign countries that require such assistance.\n\n     SEC. 4. PARALLEL IMPORTING AND COMPULSORY LICENSING.\n\n       Section 182(d)(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2242(d)(4)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``A foreign'' and inserting ``(A) Except as \n     provided in subparagraph (A), a foreign''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B)(i) With respect to a foreign country that is \n     undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis and that \n     is propounding or implementing laws or policies that regulate \n     pharmaceuticals or medical technologies used to treat HIV/\n     AIDS, or the most common opportunistic infections that \n     accompany HIV/AIDS, subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such \n     country with respect to such pharmaceuticals and \n     technologies.\n       ``(ii) With respect to a foreign country described in \n     clause (i), if the laws or policies of that country promote \n     access to the pharmaceuticals or medical technologies \n     described in such clause for affected populations within the \n     country or within other countries undergoing an HIV/AIDS-\n     related public health crisis, compliance with the specific \n     obligations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights referred to in section \n     101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act shall be \n     construed to provide adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property rights for the purposes of this Act, \n     and the President shall instruct the United States Trade \n     Representative not to seek, through negotiation or otherwise, \n     the revocation or revision of such laws or policies.''; and\n       ``(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `foreign \n     country that is undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health \n     crisis' means any of the 48 foreign countries of sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and any additional country determined to be \n     undergoing such a crisis by the President.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, shall--\n       (1) develop and implement programs to strengthen and \n     broaden health care systems infrastructure, and the capacity \n     of health care systems in developing foreign countries to \n     deliver HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals;\n       (2) provide assistance to foreign countries that the \n     Administrator determines are ready to implement anti-retro \n     viral treatment programs with respect to HIV/AIDS; and\n       (3) provide assistance to improve access to medical \n     education, including nursing education, in foreign countries \n     that are severely affected by the HIV/AIDS virus.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, $25,000,000 for \n     each fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 7.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for long-term care givers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, we have spent the last week discussing the \nimportance of tax cuts for all Americans. While we discuss fiscally \nresponsible means to provide financial benefits to all Americans we \nneed to remember there are millions of Americans that are taking on \nextra financial burdens by taking care of a loved one at home. These \ncaregivers deserve financial assistance.\n  America is aging, we are all living longer and generally healthier \nand more productive lives. In the next 30 years, the number of \nAmericans over the age of 65 will double. For most Americans this is \ngood news. However, for some families aging comes with unique financial \nobstacles. More and more middle income families are forced to choose \nbetween providing educational expenses for their children, saving for \ntheir own retirement, and providing medical care for their parents and \ngrandparents. When a loved one becomes ill and needs to be cared for, \nnothing is more challenging then deciding how the care they need should \nbe provided. Today, I rise again to make that decision easier and to \nstrengthen one option for long-term care caring for a loved one at \nhome.\n  The bill I am reintroducing today, the Care Assistance and Resource \nEnhancement Tax Credit, will provide caregivers with a $3,000 tax \ncredit for the services they provide. I am reintroducing this bill in \norder to encourage families to take care of their loved ones, by making \nit more affordable for seniors to stay at home and receive the care \nthey need, while saving the government billions of dollars currently \nspent on institutional care. Through\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nthis tax credit, we accomplish all that while emphasizing family \nvalues.\n  There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal \nneeds or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 \nyears old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. They do this \nwork without any compensation. They do not send the government a bill \nfor their services or get reimbursed for their expenses by a private \ncompany. They do it because they care. As a result of their compassion, \nthe government saves billions of dollars. For example, the average cost \nof a nursing home is $46,000 a year. The government spent approximately \n$32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing \nhome costs. If you add up all the private sector and government \nspending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend \ncaring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the \nAlzheimers Association indicated, caregivers provide $196 billion worth \nof care a year.\n  I held a field hearing in my state, Indiana, in August of 1999 to \ndiscuss ways to make long-term care more affordable. At this hearing, I \nheard from three caregivers who are providing care for a family member. \nMrs. Linda McKinstry takes care of her husband who had been diagnosed \nwith Alzheimers two years ago. Mr. and Mrs. Cahee are caregivers for \nMr. Cahee's mother who also has Alzheimers. They all echoed the need \nfor financial relief and support services. They spoke of the financial \nand emotional stress associated with taking care of a loved one. After \nhearing their stories, it became clear that their efforts are truly \nheroic and we should be doing all that we can at the federal level to \nprovide what they need to keep their families together.\n  At a time when people are becoming skeptical of the government, \nCongress needs to help people meet the challenges they face in their \ndaily lives. This tax credit does that. It will serve 1.2 million older \nAmericans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and approximately 250,000 \nchildren a year. I am encouraged by the inclusion of this tax credit in \nSenator Daschle's targeted tax package. I urge my colleagues to take \nnotice of the work done by caregivers and join me in supporting this \nlegislation and giving caregivers the gratitude they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 465. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit for residential solar energy property; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President. I am honored today to introduce the \nResidential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 2001 which provides a 15 \npercent residential tax credit for consumers who purchase solar \nelectric, photovoltaics, and solar thermal products. This bill is \nsimilar to one I introduced in the last Congress. I believe we have a \nwonderful opportunity to address this important energy issue and pass \nthis bill.\n  The legislation is an important step in preserving U.S. global \nleadership in the solar industry where we now export over 70 percent of \nour products. In recent years, over ten U.S. solar manufacturing \nfacilities have been built or expanded making the U.S. the world's \nlargest manufacturer of solar products. The expansion of the U.S. \ndomestic market is essential to sustain U.S. global market dominance.\n  Other countries, notably Japan and Germany, have instituted very \nlarge-scale market incentives for the use of solar energy on buildings, \nspending far more by their governments to build their respective \ndomestic solar industries. Passage of this bill will insure the U.S. \nstays the global solar market leader into the next millennium.\n  Recent tax legislation passed by this body, has included necessary \nsupport of the independent domestic oil producers, overseas oil \nrefiners, nuclear industry decommissioning, and wind energy, all \nworthy. This small proposal not only adds to these but provides an \nincentive to the individual homeowner to generate their own energy. In \nfact, 28 states have passed laws in the last two years to provide a \ntechnical standard for interconnecting solar systems to the electric \ngrid, provide consumer friendly contracts, and provide rates for the \nexcess power generated. These efforts at regulatory reform at the state \nlevel combined with a limited incentive as proposed in this bill, will \ndrive the use of solar energy.\n  Contrary to popular belief, solar energy is manufactured and used \nevenly throughout the United States. Solar manufacturers are in \nArizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In \naddition, solar assembly and distribution companies are in: Alaska, \nConnecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Vermont, as well as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and Guam. In addition to these states, solar component and \nresearch companies are in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, \nNebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia.\n  More than 90 U.S. electric utilities including municipals, \ncooperatives and independents--which represent more than half of U.S. \npower generation--are active in solar energy. Aside from new, automated \nsolar manufacturing facilities, a wide range of new uses of solar has \noccurred in the last two years, such as: an array of facilities \ninstalled in June at the Pentagon power block to provide mid-day peak \npower; installation of solar on the first U.S. skyscraper in Times \nSquare in New York City; and development of a solar mini-manufacturing \nfacility at a brown field in Chicago which will provide solar products \nfor roadway lighting and for area schools.\n  This small sampling of American ingenuity is just the beginning of \nthe U.S. solar industry's maturity. Adoption of solar power by \nindividual American consumers will create economies-of-scale of \nproduction that will, over time, dramatically lower costs and increase \navailability of solar power.\n  The bill I have introduced costs much less than previous proposals \nand provides consumer safeguards. This bill represents a pragmatic \napproach in utilizing the marketplace as a driver of technology. The \nbenefits to our country are profound. The U.S. solar industry believes \nthe incentives will create 20,000 new high technology manufacturing \njobs, offset pollution of more than 2 million vehicles, cut U.S. solar \nenergy unit imports which are already over 50 percent, and leverage \nU.S. industry even further into the global export markets.\n  The Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 2001 is sound energy \npolicy, sound environmental policy, promotes our national security, and \nenhances our economic strength at home and abroad. I ask my colleagues \nto include this initiative in any upcoming tax and/or energy \ndeliberations. American consumers will thank us, and our children will \nthank us for the future benefits we have preserved for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to fully fund 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for \nprograms under part B of such Act; to the Committee on Health \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join with nine of my colleagues today in \nintroducing the ``Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' I am pleased that \nSenators Jim Jeffords, Ted Kennedy, Pat Roberts, Chris Dodd, Susan \nCollins, Tom Harkin, Olympia Snowe, Patty Murray, and Jack Reed have \nagreed to serve as original co-sponsors of this important legislation.\n  This bill will have the Federal government fully meet its funding \nresponsibilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, for the first time since it was enacted in 1975. When Congress \npassed the IDEA a quarter of a century ago, it agreed that the Federal \ngovernment would pay 40 percent of the cost of ensuring that all \nchildren, including those with disabilities, receive a free, \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. That \nis the laudable goal of the legislation, one we all share. Sadly, \nhowever, we have never in all these years met our funding commitment. \nDespite substantial progress over the last five years, Congress has \nnever appropriated more than 15 percent of the cost of IDEA. The bill \nwe introduce today will finally make good on Congress's commitment to \nfund 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities. In \nso doing, it will strengthen the ability of States and local school \ndistricts in implementing IDEA and serve the children with disabilities \nwho are covered by its provisions.\n  Our IDEA full funding legislation is very simple. It would obligate \nFederal funds to increase funding under Part B of the IDEA program by \nannual increments of $2.5 billion until the full 40 percent share of \nfunding is reached in fiscal year 2007. Last year, fiscal year 2001, \nCongress appropriated $6.3 billion for Part B. With these annual \nincrements, the legislation would obligate an additional $37.5 billion \nover five years, or $52.4 billion over six years.\n  Let me note that this legislation does not establish a new Federal \nmandate or entitlement, State and Federal courts and IDEA have already \nfirmly established the right of a child with a disability to a free, \nappropriate education. The Federal government's failure for 25 years to \ncontribute its share of these costs has simply shifted this Federal \nshare onto State and local education agencies. Our bill will redress \nthis failure: Federal funds will finally be provided to meet the \nFederal share.\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n  IDEA has been a great success. Prior to its enactment, only 50 \npercent of students with disabilities were receiving an appropriate \neducation, 30 percent were receiving inappropriate education services, \nand 20 percent were receiving no education services at all. Today the \nmajority of children with disabilities are receiving an education in \ntheir neighborhood schools in regular classrooms with their non-\ndisabled peers. High school graduation rates have increased \ndramatically among students with disabilities, a 14 percent increase \nfrom 1984 to 1997. More students with disabilities are attending \ncolleges and universities. And students who have been served by IDEA \nare employed at twice the rate of older adults who were not served by \nIDEA. IDEA has played a very important role in raising our nation's \nawareness about the abilities and capabilities of children with \ndisabilities.\n  Last November we celebrated IDEA's 25th anniversary. It is time to \nmake good on our promise to fully fund this very worthwhile program, \nwhich is making such an important difference in the lives of so very \nmany of our nation's children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues \nSenators Chuck Hagel and Jim Jeffords in introducing the Helping \nChildren Succeed by Fully Funding the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA--the hallmark of which is to put real dollars \nbehind the goal of fully funding the IDEA.\n  Congress owes the children and families across the country the most \neffective possible implementation of this legislation, and the federal \nfunding support necessary to make it happen. For 25 years, IDEA has \nsent a clear message to young people with disabilities--that they can \nlearn, and that their learning will enable them to become independent \nand productive citizens, and live fulfilling lives.\n  Prior to 1975, 4 million disabled children did not receive the help \nthey needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers \nreceived services, and 1 million disabled children were excluded from \npublic schools. Now IDEA serves almost 6 million disabled children from \nbirth through age 21, and every State in the Nation offers public \neducation and early intervention services to disabled children. The \nrecord of success is astonishing.\n  The drop out rate for these students has decreased, while the \ngraduation rate has increased. The number of young adults with \ndisabilities enrolling in college has more than tripled, and now more \nthan ever disabled students are communicating and exploring the world \nthrough new technologies.\n  These accomplishments do not come without financial costs, and it is \ntime for Congress to meet its financial commitment to help schools \nprovide the services and supports that give children with special needs \nthe educational opportunities to pursue their dreams.\n  Today we are introducing legislation to address that need and assist \nour schools to meet their responsibility to provide an equal and \nappropriate educational opportunity for children with disabilities. In \nmy State of Massachusetts alone, this increase will provide $409 \nmillion over the next 6 years to help meet that goal.\n  Just as we are committed to increase funding for IDEA, we must be \nequally committed to the making sure that this law is implemented and \nvigorously enforced.\n  Far too many students with disabilities are still not getting the \neducational services they are entitled to receive under the IDEA. We \nmust never go back to the days when large numbers of disabled children \nwere left out and left behind.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration and all Members of \nCongress to enact this legislation. Fully funding IDEA moves us closer \nto ensuring the success of every child by supporting the great goal of \npublic education--to give all children the opportunity to pursue their \ndreams.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope that this effort will be the \nculmination of our long-term efforts to fully fund the Federal share of \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n  Last Congress, Senator Jeffords and I twice offered budget amendments \nto fully fund IDEA, and I have offered many measures over the years to \nincrease funding for IDEA. Of course, I also have worked closely with \nSenators Kennedy and Harkin on this issue, and I am thrilled to be \njoining today with the many other cosponsors of this bill, Senators \nMurray, Reed, Hagel, Roberts, Collins, and Snowe.\n  The Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding IDEA Act offers \nCongress the opportunity to fulfill our goal of funding 40 percent of \nthe cost of educating children with disabilities and to strengthen our \nsupport for children, parents, and local schools. This act is quite \nsimple, it directs the appropriation of funds for IDEA so that we will \nfully fund IDEA by 2007.\n  When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, we set a goal of helping States \nmeet their constitutional obligation to provide children with \ndisabilities a free, appropriate education by paying for 40 percent of \nthose costs. We have made great strides toward that goal in the last \nfew years, having doubled Federal funding over the past 5 years. \nNevertheless, we still only provide 15 percent of IDEA costs.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, in spite of spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to fund special education programs, we are facing a \nfunding shortfall. In our towns, the situation is even more difficult. \nToo often, our local school districts are struggling to meet the needs \nof their students with disabilities.\n  The costs being borne by local communities and school districts are \nrising dramatically. From 1992 through 1997, for example, special \neducation costs in Connecticut rose half again as much as did regular \neducation costs. Our schools need our help.\n  Of course, no one in Connecticut, or in any State or community in our \ncountry would question the value of ensuring every child the equal \naccess to education that he or she is guaranteed by our Constitution. \nThe only question is how best to do that, and a large part of the \nanswer is in this legislation. This legislation demonstrates that our \ncommitment to universal access is matched by our commitment to doing \neverything we can to helping States and schools provide that access.\n  And this amendment will help not only our children and schools, it \nwill help entire communities, by easing their tax burden. By our \nfailure to meet our goal of fully funding IDEA, we force local \ntaxpayers--homeowners and small businesspeople--to pay the higher taxes \nthat these services require. That is especially a problem in \nConnecticut, where so much of education is paid for through local \nproperty taxes.\n  If we are going to talk about the importance of tax relief for \naverage Americans, there are few more important steps we can take than \npassing this legislation. It will go far to alleviate the tax burden \nthat these people and businesses bear today.\n  Last year, the National Governors' Association wrote me that \n``Governors believe the single most effective step Congress could take \nto help address education needs and priorities, in the context of new \nbudget constraints, would be to meet its commitment to fully fund the \nfederal portion of IDEA.''\n  Over the next 10 years, we're looking at a $2.7 trillion non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicare surplus. I think that fully funding IDEA is one \nof the most productive ways that we can use a small part of that \nsurplus.\n  I ask that my colleagues seize this opportunity and support this \namendment and choose to help our schools better serve children with \ndisabilities, because I am tired of the false dichotomy that many \npeople perceive between parents of children without disabilities and \nparents of children with disabilities.\n  By fully funding the Federal share of IDEA, and easing the financial \nburden on states and schools, we can stop talking about ``children with \ndisabilities'' and ``children without disabilities,'' and start talking \ninstead about all children, period.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 467.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 6230 Van \nNuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, California, as the ``James C. Corman \nFederal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto honor the hard work and dedication of the late James C. Corman, an \nesteemed Member of the House of Representatives from California for 20 \nyears.\n  Jim Corman was born in Kansas, and moved to California with his \nmother shortly after his father's death. He served in the Marines \nduring World War II. After the war, Jim worked his way through the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern \nCalifornia Law School. He first held public office in 1957, when he was \nelected to the Los Angeles City Council.\n  Jim was first elected to the House in 1960. In 1963, he began serving \non the Judiciary Committee, which he felt handled the issues that were \namong the most important and relevant to Americans. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, he was an influential voice in drafting and \npassing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964. Jim always considered \nthis as the greatest accomplishment of his life.\n  In 1968, Jim became a member of the Ways and Means Committee, where \nhe devoted his energy to Social Security, tax, and welfare reform. He \nbecame a crusader for the welfare of senior citizens and the \ndisadvantaged members of our society.\n  Recognizing that his constituents would have better access to federal \nservices if there were a federal building in the San Fernando Valley, \nJim was responsible for securing funds for its construction. It is only \nfitting that this building be named after the man who considered \nconstituent service to be one of his top priorities.\n  Mr. President, James C. Corman was a well-respected Member of the \nHouse. I am pleased to honor his memory by introducing a bill to \ndesignate the federal building in Van Nuys as the James C. Corman \nFederal Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 469. A bill to provide assistance to States for the purpose of \nimproving schools through the use of Assistance Teams; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the School Support \nand Improvement Act of 2001, a bill designed to help ensure that every \nchild in America has access to a quality public school, with good \nteachers, adequate facilities and a safe environment to learn.\n  Mr. President, every child deserves and every parent has the right to \nexpect a top-notch, quality education. For example:\n  Every child should enter 1st grade healthy and prepared to succeed;\n  Every child should attend a school that is well-built, well-lit, \nwell-equipped and well-connected to our modern world; and\n  Every child should be instructed by a well-trained, well-paid and \nqualified teacher.\n  But some public schools in America do not meet that standard today. \nSome of our public schools are failing our children and shortchanging \ntheir future. We need to refocus our energy on turning these schools \naround and getting them back on track. This must be the nation's number \none priority.\n  A quality public school is not a partisan goal; it's not a \nconservative or liberal goal; it's not a big city or rural goal; it's \nnot a goal which separates rich from poor.\n  It's a simple, common-sense goal we can all agree upon. And if we can \nagree, then we should be able to do something about it.\n  The School Support and Improvement Act is one step in achieving this \ncommon sense goal. The legislation is based on a very important lesson \nwe have learned in my home state of North Carolina.\n  As many of you know, North Carolina has been at the forefront of the \neffort to reform public education for many years. In fact, President \nBush's new Education Secretary, Rod Paige, called North Carolina's \neducation system ``a model for the Nation.'' The School Support and \nImprovement Act is designed to translate one of the lessons we learned \nin North Carolina to the nationwide education reform effort.\n  At the heart of the North Carolina school reform program is a very \nsimple idea: immediately after we identify a school that is in trouble, \nwe assign a special team of experienced, specially trained educators, \nprincipals and administrators to go to the school and help them devise \na plan to turn that school around.\n  The team begins with an intensive evaluation of teachers, \nadministration and curriculum. Teachers and local school district \nofficials work with the Assistance Team to develop a plan tailored to \nthe school's needs and designed to improve student performance.\n  Assistance Teams have been remarkably successful in North Carolina. \nSince the program started in 1997, Assistance Teams have been assigned \nto 33 schools across North Carolina. Of those 33 schools, 29 have \nimproved significantly and are no longer considered low-performing. The \noverall percentage of low-performing schools has also decreased, from \n7.5 percent in the 1996-97 school year to 2.1 percent in the 1999-2000 \nschool year.\n  In short, Assistance Teams are a proven method to get low-performing\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nschools back on the path of providing quality education.\n  Our bill would accomplish two things: First, it would make the North \nCarolina model of sending Assistance Teams into low performing schools \na priority throughout the country. Second, it would require that the \nutilization of Assistance Teams be a priority in every States' efforts \nto turn around low performing schools. In order to carry out this task, \nthe bill provides additional resources to the States.\n  Mr. President, with the right tools, and adequate resources, we can \nbegin to put low-performing schools back on the right track. Our \nlegislation utilizes a proven model and provides the necessary \nresources while still ensuring flexibility for the state and local \neducational agencies.\n  I hope that this legislation will allow other states to benefit from \nthe sucessful model we have implemented in North Carolina.\n  When the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee considers \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the coming days, I intend \nto offer this proposal as part of that effort. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank \nyou.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Support and \n     Improvement Act of 2001.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds--\n       (1) The percent of low-performing schools in this country \n     is cause for national concern.\n       (2) Low-performing schools may not be in a position, or \n     their own, to make the kinds of changes necessary to turn \n     themselves around and improve student achievement.\n       (3) The federal government, States, and school districts \n     must collaborate with schools to help them improve to meet \n     the needs of their students.\n       (4) Schools must be held accountable for their performance \n     and improvement, but must also be given the tools and \n     resources they need to succeed.\n\n     SEC. 3. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       Each State educational agency shall reserve 5 percent of \n     the amount the State educational agency receives under \n     subpart 2 of part A for fiscal years 2002 through 2008, to \n     carry out the State agency's responsibilities under sections \n     1116 and 1117 (20 USC 6318), including carrying out the State \n     educational agency's statewide assistance and support for \n     local educational agencies, provided that an adequate \n     percentage of that reservation is passed to local educational \n     agencies.\n\n     SEC. 4. PRIORITY FOR SCHOOL ASSISTANCE TEAMS.\n\n       Sec. 1117 (20 USC 6318) is amended--\n       (1) in section (a) by adding at the end the following--\n       (3) Priority.--In assigning and placing school assistance \n     teams and providing additional support and technical \n     assistance as described in subsection 1117 (c)(1)(B), a State \n     educational agency shall give priority in assigning the State \n     assistance teams under this paragraph to school in which the \n     educational performance of the students is farthest from \n     meeting the State standards as determined by the State--\n       (A) first, to schools subject to corrective action under \n     section 1116(c)(5);\n       (B) second, to schools identified for school improvement \n     under section 1116(c); and\n       (C) third, to schools that have failed to make adequate \n     yearly progress under section 1111 for 1 year and where \n     placement of a State assistance team is appropriate and \n     requested by the local education agency or the school.\n       (2) section 1117(c) is amended to read as follows--\n       (c) School Assistance Teams.--In order to achieve the \n     purpose described in subsection (a), each State--\n       (A) shall give priority in its use of program improvement \n     funds for the establishment of schools assistance teams for \n     assignment to and placement in schools in the State in \n     accordance with 1117(a)(3) and for providing such support as \n     the State educational agency determines to be necessary and \n     available to assure the effectiveness of such teams.\n       (i) Composition.--Each school assistance teams shall be \n     composed of persons knowledgeable about successful schoolwide \n     projects, school reform, and improving educational \n     opportunities for low-achieving students including--\n       (a) teachers;\n       (b) pupil services personnel;\n       (c) parents;\n       (d) distinguished teachers or principals;\n       (e) representatives of institutions of higher education;\n       (f) regional educational laboratories or research centers;\n       (g) outside consultant groups; or\n       (h) other individuals as the state educational agency, in \n     consultation with the local educational agency, may deem \n     appropriate.\n       (ii) Functions.--Each school assistance team assigned to a \n     school under this Act shall--\n       (a) review and analyze all facets of the school's \n     operation, including the design and operation of the \n     instructional program, and assist the school in developing \n     recommendations for improving student performance in that \n     school;\n       (b) collaborate with school staff and the local educational \n     agency serving the school in the design, implementation, and \n     monitoring of a plan that, if fully implemented, can \n     reasonably be expected to provide student performance and \n     help the school meet its goals for improvement, including \n     adequate yearly progress under section 111(b)(2)(B) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311(b)(2)(B));\n       (c) evaluate, at least semiannually, the effectiveness of \n     school personnel assigned to the school, including \n     identifying outstanding teachers and principals, and make \n     findings and recommendations (including the need for \n     additional resources, professional development or \n     compensation) to the school, the local educational agency, \n     and where appropriate, the State educational agency; and\n       (d) make additional recommendations as the school \n     implements the plan described in paragraph (b) to the local \n     educational agency and the State educational agency \n     concerning additional assistance and resources that are \n     needed by the school or the assistance teams.\n       (iii) Continuation of assistance.--After 1 school year, the \n     school assistance team may recommend that the school support \n     team continue to provide assistance or that the local \n     educational agency or the state educational agency, as \n     appropriate, take alternative actions with regard to the \n     school.\n       (B) may provide additional technical assistance and support \n     through such approaches as--\n       (i) the designation and use of distinguished teachers and \n     principals, chosen from schools served under this part that \n     have been especially successful in improving academic \n     achievement;\n       (ii) providing assistance to the local educational agency \n     or school in the implementation of research-based \n     comprehensive school reform models; and\n       (iii) a review process designed to increase the capacity of \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop high-\n     quality school improvement plan; and\n       (iv) other approaches as the state educational agency may \n     deem appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 470. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to \nensure that each vote cast by such voter is duly counted, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support to \nAbsentee Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voters Act of 2001. This bill \nensures that Americans serving overseas, be they the men and women of \nthe military who stand guard on foreign shares, or equally deserving \ncitizens who serve our country in other venues, will have their vote \ncounted. American citizens should not loose their right to vote under \narbitrary or unfair standards. It is therefore incumbent upon lawmakers \nto ensure their rights are protected.\n  Although overseas mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, \nthe reality of the situation is that circumstances in foreign \ncountries, or at sea aboard u.S. Navy ships, can result in mail being \nsent without a postmark. Currently several states require a postmark \nfor an absentee ballot to be counted and without such a postmark \ncitizens are denied their vote through absolutely no fault of their \nown. We saw the damaging affects of this standard in our most recent \nPresidential election.\n  My bill provides that states may not refuse to count a ballot \nsubmitted in an election for a Federal office by an absentee uniformed \nservices member or overseas citizen voter on the grounds that the \nballot was improperly or fraudulently cast ``unless the State finds \nclear and convincing evidence'' of fraud in the preparation or casting \nof the ballot by the voter. Specifically, the bill states under a \n``Clear and Convincing Evidence'' standard, the lack of a witness \nsignature, address, postmark, or other identifying information may not \nbe considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud, absent any other \ninformation or evidence. Consequently the mere absence of a postmark \nwill not disqualify an overseas citizen from casting his or her vote.\n  Mr. President, our most recent election illustrates the clear need \nfor\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nchange in our voting procedures. Reform is needed. By making certain \nthat American's stationed overseas will have their votes counted, this \nbill is one crucial step in that direction. There is need for more \nreform however and I am working on a comprehensive election reform bill \ntargeting abusive practices at home. I look forward to introducing that \nlegislation next week and working with my colleagues towards adoption \nof all these measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 471. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide grants for the renovation of schools; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will provide grants \nto local schools so they can make the repairs to ensure the safety of \ntheir students. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman, \nKennedy, Wellsone, Dodd, and Clinton on this legislation.\n  In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a Report Card \nfor America's Infrastructure which reported serious problems with the \nphysical infrastructure in our nation. However, the most alarming \nfinding is the failing grade to schools in the United States--the only \narea to receive a failing grade.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our kids see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown \nplace they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about \nthe value we place on them, their education and future?\n  Modernizing and repairing our nation's schools is something I've been \nadvocating for over a decade now. I secured $100 million in the fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations bill as a down payment on a school \nmodernization program and was disappointed when those funds were \nrescinded.\n  But we made real progress last year with the passage of a $1.2 \nbillion initiative to make emergency repairs. That was a bipartisan \nagreement hammered out by Senator Specter and me in negotiations on the \nfiscal year 2001 appropriations bill with Congressman Goodling and the \nWhite House.\n  This was a 1 year authorization and the School Repair and Renovation \nAct will reauthorize this bipartisan plan for 5 years. This program \nprovides grants to Local Education Agencies to help them make urgently \nneeded repairs and to pay for special education and construction \nrelated technology expenses.\n  Funds will be distributed to the States. States will then distribute \n75 percent of the funds on a competitive basis to local school \ndistricts to make emergency repairs such as fixing fire code violation, \nrepairing the roof or installing new plumbing. The remaining 25 percent \nwill be distributed competitively to local school districts to use for \ntechnology activities related to school renovation or for activities \nauthorized under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  The School Repair and Renovation Act is a key component in a two-\nprong strategy to modernize our nation's schools.\n  In the near future I will join forces with Representatives Johnson \nand Rangel and introduce the America's Better Classrooms Act in the \nSenate to provide tax credits for school construction projects. This \nbipartisan legislation would leverage $1.7 billion in tax credits over \n5 years to pay the interest on $25 billion in school modernization \nbonds.\n  I know this approach will work because it mirrors a successful school \nconstruction demonstration program I started in Iowa in 1997. The Iowa \ndemonstration is a two-prong response to our school modernization \nneeds. First, we provide grants to local school districts to make \nurgent repairs to remedy fire code violations. Second, grants are made \nto local school districts to subsidize a portion of the cost for a new \nconstruction project.\n  The program has been a big success. During the first 2 years of the \ndemonstration, federal funds of $14.7 million supported projects \ntotaling $142 million--each federal dollar leveraged $10.33.\n  There is a legitimate federal role in helping fix our nation's \ncrumbling schools, and we can do so without undermining local control \nof education. This federal role is recognized by President Bush who is \nrecommending an expanded use of private activity bonds for school \nconstruction projects.\n  Over the past few years we have had several partisan skirmishes \nrelated to school construction. This is a new year, a new Congress, and \na new administration. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact the School Repair and Renovation Act of 2001.

A bill to provide for fairness and accuracy in high stakes \neducational decisions for students; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill I \nintroduced last year that addresses high stakes testing: the practice \nof using a test as the sole determinant of whether a student will be \ngraduated, promoted or placed in different ability groupings. I am \nincreasingly concerned that high stakes tests are being grossly abused \nin the name of greater accountability, and almost always to the serious \ndetriment of our children.\n  Testing is necessary and beneficial. We should require it. But, \nallowing the continued misuse of high-stakes tests is, in itself, a \ngross failure of imagination, a failure both of educators and of \npolicymakers, who persistently refuse to provide the educational \nresources necessary to guarantee an equally rich educational experience \nfor all our children. That all citizens will be given an equal start \nthrough a sound education is one of the most basic, promised rights of \nour democracy. Our chronic refusal as a nation to guarantee that right \nfor all children, including poor children, is a national disgrace.\n  This legislation would stem the growing trend of misusing high stakes \ntests. The legislation would require that states and districts use \nmultiple indicators of student achievement in addition to standardized \ntests if they are going to use tests as part of a high stakes decision. \nThe legislation would also require that if tests are used, they must be \nvalid and reliable for the purposes for which they are used; must \nmeasure what the student was taught; and must provide appropriate \naccommodations for students with limited English proficiency and \ndisabilities.\n  It is important to note that the American Psychological Association, \nthe group entrusted with developing the standards for educational \ntesting, has endorsed this legislation. Like many Americans who care \ndeeply that our students are assessed appropriately, they feel that it \nis crucial for us to stem a tide that it becoming increasingly \nproblematic.\n  I would like to explain exactly why this bill would be so important \nand why I seek your support for it. I am struck by National Education \nAssociation President Bob Chase's comparison of this trend toward high \nstakes testing to the movie, ``Field of Dreams.'' In my view, it is as \nthough people are saying, ``If we test them, they will perform.'' In \ntoo many places, testing, which is a critical part of systemic \neducational accountability, has ceased its purpose of measuring \neducational and school improvement and has become synonymous with it.\n  Making students accountable for test scores works well on a bumper \nsticker, and it allows many politicians to look good by saying that \nthey will not tolerate failure. But it represents a hollow promise. Far \nfrom improving education, high stakes testing marks a major retreat \nfrom fairness, from accuracy, from quality and from equity.\n  When used correctly, standardized tests are critical for diagnosing \ninequality and for identifying where we need improvement. They enable \nus to measure achievement across groups of students so that we can help \nensure that states and districts are held accountable for improving the \nachievement of all students regardless of race, income, gender, limited \nEnglish proficiency or disability. Tests are a critical tool, but they \nare not a panacea.\n  The abuse of tests for high stakes purposes has subverted the \nbenefits tests can bring. Using a single standardized test as the sole \ndeterminant for promotion, tracking, ability grouping and graduation is \nnot fair and has not fostered greater equality or opportunity for \nstudents. First, standardized tests can not sufficiently validly or \nreliably assess what students know to make high stakes decisions about \nthem.\n  The 1999 National Research Council report, ``High Stakes,'' concludes \nthat\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n``no single test score can be considered a definitive measure of a \nstudent's knowledge,'' and that ``an educational decision that will \nhave a major impact on a test taker should not be made solely or \nautomatically on the basis of a single test score.''\n  The ``Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing,'' 1999 \nEdition, which has served as the standard for test developers and users \nfor decades, asserts that: ``In educational settings, a decision or a \ncharacterization that will have a major impact on a student should not \nbe made on the basis of a single test score.''\n  Even test publishers, including Harcourt Brace, CTB McGraw Hill, \nRiverside and ETS, consistently warn against this practice. For \nexample, Riverside Publishing asserts in the ``Interpretive Guide for \nSchool Administrators'' for the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, ``Many of \nthe common misuses, of standardized tests, stem from depending on a \nsingle test score to make a decision about a student or class of \nstudents.''\n  CTB McGraw Hill writes that ``A variety of tests, or multiple \nmeasures, is necessary to tell educators what students know and can do \n. . . the multiple measures approach to assessment is the keystone to \nvalid, reliable, fair information about student achievement.''\n  There are many reasons tests cannot be relied upon as the sole \ndeterminant in making high stakes decisions about students. The \nNational Research Council describes how these tests can be unreliable. \nThe Council concludes that ``a student's test score can be expected to \nvary across different versions of a test, . . . as a function of the \nparticular sample questions asked and/or transitory factors, such as \nthe student's health on the day of the test. Thus, no single test score \ncan be considered a definitive measure of a student's knowledge.''\n  The research of David Rogosa at Stanford University shows how test \nscores are not valid, in isolation, to make judgements about individual \nachievement. His study of California's Stanford 9 National Percentile \nRank Scores for individual students showed that the chances that a \nstudent whose true score is in the 50th percentile will receive a \nreported score that is within 5 percentage points of his true score are \nonly 30 percent in reading and 42 percent on ninth grade math tests.\n  Rogosa also showed that on the Stanford 9 test ``the chances, . . . \nthat two students with identical ``real achievement'' will score more \nthan 10 percentile points apart on the same test'' is 57 percent for \n9th graders and 42 percent on the fourth grade reading test. This \nmargin of error shows why it would not be fair to use a cut-score in \nmaking a high stakes decision about a child.\n  Robert Rayborn, who directs Harcourt's Stanford 9 program in \nCalifornia reenforced these findings when asked about the Stanford 9. \nHe said, ``They should never make high-stakes individual decisions with \na single measure of any kind,'' including the Stanford 9.\n  Politicians and policy makers who continue to push for high stakes \ntests and educators who continue to use them in the face of this \nknowledge have closed their eyes to clearly set professional and \nscientific standards. They demand responsibility and high standards of \nstudents and schools while they let themselves get away with defying \nthe most basic standards of the education profession.\n  It would be irresponsible if a parent or a teacher used a \nmanufactured product on children in a way that the manufacturer says is \nunsafe. Why do we then honor and declare ``accountable\" policy makers \nand politicians who use tests on children in a way that the test \nmanufacturers have said is effectively unsafe?\n  Many of my colleagues will remember how 8,600 students in New York \nCity were mistakenly held in summer school because their tests were \ngraded incorrectly or how 54 students in Minnesota were denied their \ndiplomas because of a test scoring error.\n  When we talk about responsibility, what could be more irresponsible \nthan using an invalid or unreliable measure as the sole determinant of \nsomething so important as high school graduation or in-school \npromotion?\n  It has been clearly established through research that high stakes \ntests for individual students, when used in isolation, are fatally \nflawed. I would, however, also like to address a general issue that \nthis bill does not address directly, but that I think is really what \nall of this is about in the end. The trend towards high stakes testing \nrepresents a harsh agenda that holds children responsible for our own \nfailure to invest in their future and in their achievement. I firmly \nbelieve that it is grossly unfair, for example, to hold back a student \nbased on a standardized test if that student has not had the tools \nrequired to learn the material covered on the test. When we impose high \nstakes tests on an educational system where there are, as Jonathan \nKozol says, ``savage inequalities,'' and then we do nothing to address \nthe underlying causes of those inequalities, we set up children to \nfail.\n  People talk about using tests to motivate students to do well and \nusing tests to ensure that we close the achievement gap. This kind of \ntalk is unfair because it tells only part of the story. We cannot close \nthe achievement gap until we close the gap in investment between poor \nand rich schools no matter how ``motivated'' some students are. We know \nwhat these key investments are: quality teaching, parental involvement, \nand early childhood education, to name just a few.\n  But instead of doing what we know will work, and instead of taking \nresponsibility as policy makers to invest in improving students' lives, \nwe place the responsibility squarely on children. It is simply \nnegligent to force children to pass a test and expect that the poorest \nchildren, who face every disadvantage, will be able to do as well as \nthose who have every advantage.\n  When we do this, we hold children responsible for our own inaction \nand unwillingness to live up to our own promises and our own \nobligations. We confuse their failure with our own. This is a harsh \nagenda indeed, for America's children.\n  All of us in politics like to get our picture taken with children. We \nnever miss a ``photo op.'' We all like to say that ``children are our \nfuture.'' We are all for children until it comes time to make the \ninvestment. Too often, despite the talk, when it comes to making the \ninvestment in the lives of our children, we come up a dollar short.\n  Noted civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer used to say, ``I'm sick \nand tired of being sick and tired.'' Well I'm sick and tired of \nsymbolic politics. When we say we are for children, we ought to be \ncommitted to invest in the health, skills and intellect of our \nchildren. We are not going to achieve our goals on a tin cup budget. \nUnless we make a real commitment and fully fund key programs like Head \nStart, Title I and IDEA, and unless we put our money where our mouth \nis, children will continue to fail.\n  We must never stop demanding that children do their best. We must \nnever stop holding schools accountable. Measures of student performance \ncan include standardized tests, but only when coupled with other \nmeasures of achievement, more substantive education reforms and a much \nfuller, sustained investment in schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 461.

Through partnering schools with \nhigher education institutions, the bill proposes to encourage \ninstitutions of higher education to assume greater responsibility for \nimproving math and science teacher education through the establishment \nof a comprehensive, integrated system of recruiting and advising such \nteachers. Such partnerships will bring together math and science \nteachers in elementary schools and secondary schools with scientists, \nmathematicians, and engineers to increase\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nteacher content knowledge and improve teaching skills through the use \nof more sophisticated laboratory space and equipment, computing \nfacilities, libraries and other resources that colleges and \nuniversities are more able to provide.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Education to \naward competitive grants to eligible partnerships for a period of 5 \nyears. The partnerships will include a state, a math or science \ndepartment of an institution of higher education, and a local school \ndistrict. A priority will be given to those districts with a high \npoverty rate and a high number of teachers teaching out of their \nsubject area.\n  A partnership may use the grant funds to develop more rigorous \nmathematics and science curricula based on standards, to recruit math \nand science majors to teaching through bonuses, stipends for \nalternative certification and scholarships, and to establish math and \nscience summer workshops for teachers. Each eligible partnership \nreceiving a grant under this Act must develop an evaluation and \naccountability plan that includes the following objectives and \nmeasures: improved student performance on state math and science \nassessments or on the Third International Math and Science Study \nassessment; increased participation by students in advanced courses in \nmath and science; increased percentages of secondary school classes in \nmath and science taught by teachers with majors in math and science; \nincreased numbers of math and science teachers who participate in \ncontent-based professional development activities; and passing rates of \nstudents in advanced courses in math and science.\n  Each partnership will be required to report the progress made toward \nthese objectives to the Secretary annually. The Secretary will then \ndetermine whether or not the partnership is making substantial progress \nin meeting its goals. I urge my fellow colleagues to cosponsor the Math \nand Science Education Partnership Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for contributions to charitable organizations \nwhich provide scholarships for children to attend elementary and \nsecondary schools; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill provide new educational options to the students who need those \noptions the most.\n  While many Americans are satisfied with the public schools available \nto their children, we know that there are also many who are not, and \nwith good reason.\n  In large urban school districts, a majority of students drop out \nbefore high school graduation. Nearly 70 percent are unable to read at \nthe so-called ``basic'' level. And all too frequently, violence and \nentrenched mediocrity create a climate where learning is actually \ndiscouraged.\n  No wonder caring parents in such circumstances want alternatives.\n  We have seen compelling evidence of the pent-up demand for different \noptions when private organizations have invited low-income parents to \napply for partial scholarships that could be used at a non-public \nschool.\n  Usually, these private scholarship programs are structured in such a \nway that, to be eligible for an award, a low-income family must agree \nto contribute a significant portion of the total tuition bill.\n  The results are striking: In 1997, two distinguished business \nleaders, Ted Forstmann and John Walton invited applications for one \nthousand partial tuition scholarships from families here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Nearly eight thousand applications were received.\n  In 1998, they formed an organization called the Children's \nScholarship Fund to apply the idea on a national basis. They planned to \noffer 40,000 scholarships. 1.25 million applications were received.\n  No less impressive than the numbers are the testimonials offered by \nparents who have been pleading for better options.\n  One mother said the following about her experience: ``We would not be \nable to afford this without your help. Our daughter is really excited \nto be learning spelling and grammar, which was not being taught in \npublic school. She's an aspiring writer and thinks this is great. My \nson has autism, and his new school had more services in place for him \non the first day of school, without me even asking, than we've been \nable to pull out of the public school in six years! They both love \ntheir new schools and are doing well.''\n  Here's another mother's testimony: I am so excited that my son has \nbeen chosen to receive a scholarship . . . One evening I sat on my bed \nand cried because I really wanted him to attend a private school but I \nknow that I cannot afford all of the tuition. Therefore your \nscholarship fund was my only hope.''\n  Yet another mother wrote, ``I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I \nam for this opportunity to send my children to a private school. As a \nlow-income mother of four wonderful children with great potential, I \nwould not be able to provide this chance for them without your help.\n  This particular mother goes on to say, ``I have chosen,'' I cannot \nput enough stress on that word, ``chosen a school that will help \nnurture the seeds of greatness in them. I am sure that with this \nopportunity to succeed, my children will be successful and contribute \ngreatly to society in the future.''\n  Mr. President, in 1997, leaders in my state settled on a plan to help \nthe private sector to satisfy that vast unmet demand for options. They \ninstituted a state tax credit that allows Arizona residents to claim a \ndollar-for-dollar income tax credit for donations to school tuition \norganizations, like the Children's Scholarship Fund.\n  Thanks to that program, 4,000 Arizona students, nearly all of them \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, have received scholarship assistance \nthat has made it possible for them to enroll in a school of their \nchoice. The number of school tuition organizations operating in the \nstate has shot up from 2 to 33.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would extend this Arizona idea \nnation-wide, and I am pleased that my Arizona colleague, Congressman \nJohn Shadegg, will introduce this legislation this week in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  By way of tribute to President Bush's more comprehensive education \nproposal, I have given this bill the title, ``The Leave No Child Behind \nTax Credit Act of 2001.''\n  The Leave No Child Behind Tax Credit Act would allow a family or \nbusiness to claim a $250 tax credit for donations to qualified school \ntuition organizations. To qualify for that designation, an organization \nwould have to devote at least 90 percent of its annual income to \noffering grants and scholarships for parents to use to send their \nchildren to the school of their choice.\n  Scholarships awarded by such organizations could be used to offset \ntuition costs at a private school, or to pay the tuition costs families \nin most states must pay to enroll a child in a public school across \ndistrict boundaries.\n  This measure would move us toward an education policy that recognizes \nthe vital importance of parental choice.\n  It also recognizes and encourages the efforts that have been \nundertaken by public-spirited private citizens to find non-governmental \nsolutions to the serious challenge of improving education in our \ncountry. These activists embody the vision set forth by President Bush \nin his inaugural address, the vision of responsible citizens building \ncommunities of service and a nation of character.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n  Moreover, when parents are able to decide for themselves how to go \nabout securing one of life's most vital goods, namely, education for \ntheir children, rather than having such decisions made for them by a \nbureaucracy, they become, in President Bush's memorable terms, \ncitizens, not subjects.\n  I believe that this legislation will help them to do that, and I am \nvery pleased to introduce it today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for increased access to HIV/AIDS-related \ntreatments and services in developing foreign countries; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since the beginning of the AIDS \nepidemic, more than 17 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, one half \nthe population of California, have died from AIDS.\n  To begin to address this catastrophe, Senator Feingold and I \nintroduced an Amendment to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act that \nwould have helped ensure access to generic AIDS drugs for nations in \nsub-Saharan Africa ravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  Despite the fact that this amendment was approved by the Senate, it \nwas stricken from the final Africa Trade Conference Report.\n  Subsequently, the Clinton Administration issued an Executive Order \nthat ensured that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa could provide \ntheir people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n  And, two weeks ago, I am pleased to note, the Bush Administration \nindicated that it would not seek to overturn this Executive Order.\n  Now, Senator Feingold and I have developed the ``Global Access to \nAIDS Treatment Act of 2001'' which, among other provisions: Codifies \nthe Executive Order into law; Directs that the law must apply to the 48 \nnations of sub-Saharan Africa; and Expands the scope of the law to \ncover all developing nations facing a catastrophic AIDS crisis.\n  Unless the United States takes a leadership role in recognizing, as \ndoes the WTO TRIPS agreement, that there is a moral obligation to put \npeople over profits, the human devastation and social instability that \nhas already begun in countries facing an AIDS crisis will grow to \nunfathomable levels.\n  Until recently, many people have been unaware of the depth of the \nglobal loss being caused by this epidemic.\n  The HIV virus has infected over 36 million people worldwide, with \nover 95 percent of those infected living outside of the United States.\n  Over 21.8 million people have died from HIV/AIDS world-wide since the \nbeginning of the epidemic, 3 million in 2000 alone.\n  In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70 percent of all deaths from HIV/AIDS \nhave occurred, 17 million people, as I said before, have died from HIV/\nAIDS since the epidemic began, and 2.4 million in the year 2000.\n  To address this pandemic, Senator Feingold and I have developed \nlegislation to address the crisis. This legislation does the following:\n  First, this legislation directs the U.S. Government to refrain from \nseeking the revision of any law, imposed by a government of a \ndeveloping nation facing an AIDS crisis, that promotes access to HIV/\nAIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.\n  This will ensure that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable and more \navailable to those most in need.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes $25 million a year for programs \nto develop and strengthen health care infrastructure in developing \ncountries.\n  Third, the legislation calls upon the World Health Organization and \nUNAIDS to take the lead in organizing efficient procurement of \ncompulsory licences of pharmaceutical patents, active ingredients of \ndrugs, and finished medications for countries that require this \nassistance.\n  Fourth, this legislation calls on the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to work \nwith developing countries and international service providers to \ndevelop best practices for delivering pharmaceuticals to those who need \nthem.\n  Fifth, this legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA, and NIH to develop and maintain a database for information on \ndrugs, patent status, and treatment protocols to assist health-care \nproviders from around the globe in providing the best care possible to \nall patients.\n  And finally, this legislation provides $1 million a year to encourage \nAmerican physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, \npublic health workers, pharmacists, and other health professionals to \nprovide HIV/AIDS care and treatment in developing countries.\n  This legislation will allow countries facing an HIV/AIDS crisis to \nbetter determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their \ncountries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n  It is clearly in the national interest of the United States to \nprevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS, and I believe that this \nlegislation is necessary to continue to assist the countries of the \ndeveloping world to bring this deadly disease under control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\n                                 S. 463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, it has claimed \n     21,800,000 lives.\n       (2) Over 17,000,000 men, women, and children, have died due \n     to AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.\n       (3) Over 36,000,000 people are infected with the HIV virus \n     today. Over 25,000,000 live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (4) By 2010, approximately 40,000,000 children worldwide \n     will have lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS.\n       (5) Access to effective treatment for HIV/AIDS is \n     determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure, \n     and sustainable financing.\n       (6) In January 2000, the National Intelligence Council \n     released an intelligence estimate that framed the HIV/AIDS \n     pandemic as a security threat, noting the relationship \n     between the disease and political and economic instability.\n       (7) The overriding priority for responding to the HIV/AIDS \n     crisis should be to emphasize and encourage prevention.\n       (8) An effective response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic must \n     also involve assistance to stimulate the development of \n     health service delivery infrastructure in affected States.\n       (9) An effective United States response to the HIV/AIDS \n     crisis must also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS \n     vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease.\n       (10) The innovative capacity of the United States in the \n     commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is \n     unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these \n     sectors will be a critical element in any successful strategy \n     to respond to the global HIV/AIDS crisis.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the policy of the United States that the United States will \n     not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or \n     revision of intellectual property or competition laws or \n     policies that regulate pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies used to treat HIV/AIDS or the most common \n     opportunistic infections that accompany HIV/AIDS in any \n     foreign country undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health \n     crisis if the laws or policies of that foreign country--\n       (1) promote access to the pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies for affected populations; and\n       (2) provide intellectual property protection consistent \n     with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \n     Property Rights referred to in paragraph (15) of section \n     101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3511(d)(15)).\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to encourage the World Health Organization and the \n     Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to carry \n     out HIV/AIDS activities in foreign countries that are \n     undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis, \n     including activities that are consistent with the policy \n     described in section 2(b); and\n       (2) that the World Health Organization and the Joint United \n     Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) should lead the \n     international organization of the manufacture and \n     distribution of pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for \n     HIV/AIDS, including the global registration of products and \n     the organization of the efficient procurement of compulsory \n     licenses, active ingredients, and finished products for \n     foreign countries that require such assistance.\n\n     SEC. 4. PARALLEL IMPORTING AND COMPULSORY LICENSING.\n\n       Section 182(d)(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2242(d)(4)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``A foreign'' and inserting ``(A) Except as \n     provided in subparagraph (A), a foreign''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B)(i) With respect to a foreign country that is \n     undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis and that \n     is propounding or implementing laws or policies that regulate \n     pharmaceuticals or medical technologies used to treat HIV/\n     AIDS, or the most common opportunistic infections that \n     accompany HIV/AIDS, subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such \n     country with respect to such pharmaceuticals and \n     technologies.\n       ``(ii) With respect to a foreign country described in \n     clause (i), if the laws or policies of that country promote \n     access to the pharmaceuticals or medical technologies \n     described in such clause for affected populations within the \n     country or within other countries undergoing an HIV/AIDS-\n     related public health crisis, compliance with the specific \n     obligations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights referred to in section \n     101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act shall be \n     construed to provide adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property rights for the purposes of this Act, \n     and the President shall instruct the United States Trade \n     Representative not to seek, through negotiation or otherwise, \n     the revocation or revision of such laws or policies.''; and\n       ``(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `foreign \n     country that is undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health \n     crisis' means any of the 48 foreign countries of sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and any additional country determined to be \n     undergoing such a crisis by the President.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for long-term care givers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, we have spent the last week discussing the \nimportance of tax cuts for all Americans. While we discuss fiscally \nresponsible means to provide financial benefits to all Americans we \nneed to remember there are millions of Americans that are taking on \nextra financial burdens by taking care of a loved one at home. These \ncaregivers deserve financial assistance.\n  America is aging, we are all living longer and generally healthier \nand more productive lives. In the next 30 years, the number of \nAmericans over the age of 65 will double. For most Americans this is \ngood news. However, for some families aging comes with unique financial \nobstacles. More and more middle income families are forced to choose \nbetween providing educational expenses for their children, saving for \ntheir own retirement, and providing medical care for their parents and \ngrandparents. When a loved one becomes ill and needs to be cared for, \nnothing is more challenging then deciding how the care they need should \nbe provided. Today, I rise again to make that decision easier and to \nstrengthen one option for long-term care caring for a loved one at \nhome.\n  The bill I am reintroducing today, the Care Assistance and Resource \nEnhancement Tax Credit, will provide caregivers with a $3,000 tax \ncredit for the services they provide. I am reintroducing this bill in \norder to encourage families to take care of their loved ones, by making \nit more affordable for seniors to stay at home and receive the care \nthey need, while saving the government billions of dollars currently \nspent on institutional care. Through\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nthis tax credit, we accomplish all that while emphasizing family \nvalues.\n  There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal \nneeds or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 \nyears old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. They do this \nwork without any compensation. They do not send the government a bill \nfor their services or get reimbursed for their expenses by a private \ncompany. They do it because they care. As a result of their compassion, \nthe government saves billions of dollars. For example, the average cost \nof a nursing home is $46,000 a year. The government spent approximately \n$32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing \nhome costs. If you add up all the private sector and government \nspending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend \ncaring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the \nAlzheimers Association indicated, caregivers provide $196 billion worth \nof care a year.\n  I held a field hearing in my state, Indiana, in August of 1999 to \ndiscuss ways to make long-term care more affordable. At this hearing, I \nheard from three caregivers who are providing care for a family member. \nMrs. Linda McKinstry takes care of her husband who had been diagnosed \nwith Alzheimers two years ago. Mr. and Mrs. Cahee are caregivers for \nMr. Cahee's mother who also has Alzheimers. They all echoed the need \nfor financial relief and support services. They spoke of the financial \nand emotional stress associated with taking care of a loved one. After \nhearing their stories, it became clear that their efforts are truly \nheroic and we should be doing all that we can at the federal level to \nprovide what they need to keep their families together.\n  At a time when people are becoming skeptical of the government, \nCongress needs to help people meet the challenges they face in their \ndaily lives. This tax credit does that. It will serve 1.2 million older \nAmericans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and approximately 250,000 \nchildren a year. I am encouraged by the inclusion of this tax credit in \nSenator Daschle's targeted tax package. I urge my colleagues to take \nnotice of the work done by caregivers and join me in supporting this \nlegislation and giving caregivers the gratitude they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 465. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit for residential solar energy property; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President. I am honored today to introduce the \nResidential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 2001 which provides a 15 \npercent residential tax credit for consumers who purchase solar \nelectric, photovoltaics, and solar thermal products. This bill is \nsimilar to one I introduced in the last Congress. I believe we have a \nwonderful opportunity to address this important energy issue and pass \nthis bill.\n  The legislation is an important step in preserving U.S. global \nleadership in the solar industry where we now export over 70 percent of \nour products. In recent years, over ten U.S. solar manufacturing \nfacilities have been built or expanded making the U.S. the world's \nlargest manufacturer of solar products. The expansion of the U.S. \ndomestic market is essential to sustain U.S. global market dominance.\n  Other countries, notably Japan and Germany, have instituted very \nlarge-scale market incentives for the use of solar energy on buildings, \nspending far more by their governments to build their respective \ndomestic solar industries. Passage of this bill will insure the U.S. \nstays the global solar market leader into the next millennium.\n  Recent tax legislation passed by this body, has included necessary \nsupport of the independent domestic oil producers, overseas oil \nrefiners, nuclear industry decommissioning, and wind energy, all \nworthy. This small proposal not only adds to these but provides an \nincentive to the individual homeowner to generate their own energy. In \nfact, 28 states have passed laws in the last two years to provide a \ntechnical standard for interconnecting solar systems to the electric \ngrid, provide consumer friendly contracts, and provide rates for the \nexcess power generated. These efforts at regulatory reform at the state \nlevel combined with a limited incentive as proposed in this bill, will \ndrive the use of solar energy.\n  Contrary to popular belief, solar energy is manufactured and used \nevenly throughout the United States. Solar manufacturers are in \nArizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In \naddition, solar assembly and distribution companies are in: Alaska, \nConnecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Vermont, as well as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and Guam. In addition to these states, solar component and \nresearch companies are in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, \nNebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia.\n  More than 90 U.S. electric utilities including municipals, \ncooperatives and independents--which represent more than half of U.S. \npower generation--are active in solar energy. Aside from new, automated \nsolar manufacturing facilities, a wide range of new uses of solar has \noccurred in the last two years, such as: an array of facilities \ninstalled in June at the Pentagon power block to provide mid-day peak \npower; installation of solar on the first U.S. skyscraper in Times \nSquare in New York City; and development of a solar mini-manufacturing \nfacility at a brown field in Chicago which will provide solar products \nfor roadway lighting and for area schools.\n  This small sampling of American ingenuity is just the beginning of \nthe U.S. solar industry's maturity. Adoption of solar power by \nindividual American consumers will create economies-of-scale of \nproduction that will, over time, dramatically lower costs and increase \navailability of solar power.\n  The bill I have introduced costs much less than previous proposals \nand provides consumer safeguards. This bill represents a pragmatic \napproach in utilizing the marketplace as a driver of technology. The \nbenefits to our country are profound. The U.S. solar industry believes \nthe incentives will create 20,000 new high technology manufacturing \njobs, offset pollution of more than 2 million vehicles, cut U.S. solar \nenergy unit imports which are already over 50 percent, and leverage \nU.S. industry even further into the global export markets.\n  The Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 2001 is sound energy \npolicy, sound environmental policy, promotes our national security, and \nenhances our economic strength at home and abroad. I ask my colleagues \nto include this initiative in any upcoming tax and/or energy \ndeliberations. American consumers will thank us, and our children will \nthank us for the future benefits we have preserved for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to fully fund 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for \nprograms under part B of such Act; to the Committee on Health \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join with nine of my colleagues today in \nintroducing the ``Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' I am pleased that \nSenators Jim Jeffords, Ted Kennedy, Pat Roberts, Chris Dodd, Susan \nCollins, Tom Harkin, Olympia Snowe, Patty Murray, and Jack Reed have \nagreed to serve as original co-sponsors of this important legislation.\n  This bill will have the Federal government fully meet its funding \nresponsibilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, for the first time since it was enacted in 1975. When Congress \npassed the IDEA a quarter of a century ago, it agreed that the Federal \ngovernment would pay 40 percent of the cost of ensuring that all \nchildren, including those with disabilities, receive a free, \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. That \nis the laudable goal of the legislation, one we all share. Sadly, \nhowever, we have never in all these years met our funding commitment. \nDespite substantial progress over the last five years, Congress has \nnever appropriated more than 15 percent of the cost of IDEA. The bill \nwe introduce today will finally make good on Congress's commitment to \nfund 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities. In \nso doing, it will strengthen the ability of States and local school \ndistricts in implementing IDEA and serve the children with disabilities \nwho are covered by its provisions.\n  Our IDEA full funding legislation is very simple. It would obligate \nFederal funds to increase funding under Part B of the IDEA program by \nannual increments of $2.5 billion until the full 40 percent share of \nfunding is reached in fiscal year 2007. Last year, fiscal year 2001, \nCongress appropriated $6.3 billion for Part B. With these annual \nincrements, the legislation would obligate an additional $37.5 billion \nover five years, or $52.4 billion over six years.\n  Let me note that this legislation does not establish a new Federal \nmandate or entitlement, State and Federal courts and IDEA have already \nfirmly established the right of a child with a disability to a free, \nappropriate education. The Federal government's failure for 25 years to \ncontribute its share of these costs has simply shifted this Federal \nshare onto State and local education agencies. Our bill will redress \nthis failure: Federal funds will finally be provided to meet the \nFederal share.\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n  IDEA has been a great success. Prior to its enactment, only 50 \npercent of students with disabilities were receiving an appropriate \neducation, 30 percent were receiving inappropriate education services, \nand 20 percent were receiving no education services at all. Today the \nmajority of children with disabilities are receiving an education in \ntheir neighborhood schools in regular classrooms with their non-\ndisabled peers. High school graduation rates have increased \ndramatically among students with disabilities, a 14 percent increase \nfrom 1984 to 1997. More students with disabilities are attending \ncolleges and universities. And students who have been served by IDEA \nare employed at twice the rate of older adults who were not served by \nIDEA. IDEA has played a very important role in raising our nation's \nawareness about the abilities and capabilities of children with \ndisabilities.\n  Last November we celebrated IDEA's 25th anniversary. It is time to \nmake good on our promise to fully fund this very worthwhile program, \nwhich is making such an important difference in the lives of so very \nmany of our nation's children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues \nSenators Chuck Hagel and Jim Jeffords in introducing the Helping \nChildren Succeed by Fully Funding the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA--the hallmark of which is to put real dollars \nbehind the goal of fully funding the IDEA.\n  Congress owes the children and families across the country the most \neffective possible implementation of this legislation, and the federal \nfunding support necessary to make it happen. For 25 years, IDEA has \nsent a clear message to young people with disabilities--that they can \nlearn, and that their learning will enable them to become independent \nand productive citizens, and live fulfilling lives.\n  Prior to 1975, 4 million disabled children did not receive the help \nthey needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers \nreceived services, and 1 million disabled children were excluded from \npublic schools. Now IDEA serves almost 6 million disabled children from \nbirth through age 21, and every State in the Nation offers public \neducation and early intervention services to disabled children. The \nrecord of success is astonishing.\n  The drop out rate for these students has decreased, while the \ngraduation rate has increased. The number of young adults with \ndisabilities enrolling in college has more than tripled, and now more \nthan ever disabled students are communicating and exploring the world \nthrough new technologies.\n  These accomplishments do not come without financial costs, and it is \ntime for Congress to meet its financial commitment to help schools \nprovide the services and supports that give children with special needs \nthe educational opportunities to pursue their dreams.\n  Today we are introducing legislation to address that need and assist \nour schools to meet their responsibility to provide an equal and \nappropriate educational opportunity for children with disabilities. In \nmy State of Massachusetts alone, this increase will provide $409 \nmillion over the next 6 years to help meet that goal.\n  Just as we are committed to increase funding for IDEA, we must be \nequally committed to the making sure that this law is implemented and \nvigorously enforced.\n  Far too many students with disabilities are still not getting the \neducational services they are entitled to receive under the IDEA. We \nmust never go back to the days when large numbers of disabled children \nwere left out and left behind.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration and all Members of \nCongress to enact this legislation. Fully funding IDEA moves us closer \nto ensuring the success of every child by supporting the great goal of \npublic education--to give all children the opportunity to pursue their \ndreams.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope that this effort will be the \nculmination of our long-term efforts to fully fund the Federal share of \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n  Last Congress, Senator Jeffords and I twice offered budget amendments \nto fully fund IDEA, and I have offered many measures over the years to \nincrease funding for IDEA. Of course, I also have worked closely with \nSenators Kennedy and Harkin on this issue, and I am thrilled to be \njoining today with the many other cosponsors of this bill, Senators \nMurray, Reed, Hagel, Roberts, Collins, and Snowe.\n  The Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding IDEA Act offers \nCongress the opportunity to fulfill our goal of funding 40 percent of \nthe cost of educating children with disabilities and to strengthen our \nsupport for children, parents, and local schools. This act is quite \nsimple, it directs the appropriation of funds for IDEA so that we will \nfully fund IDEA by 2007.\n  When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, we set a goal of helping States \nmeet their constitutional obligation to provide children with \ndisabilities a free, appropriate education by paying for 40 percent of \nthose costs. We have made great strides toward that goal in the last \nfew years, having doubled Federal funding over the past 5 years. \nNevertheless, we still only provide 15 percent of IDEA costs.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, in spite of spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to fund special education programs, we are facing a \nfunding shortfall. In our towns, the situation is even more difficult. \nToo often, our local school districts are struggling to meet the needs \nof their students with disabilities.\n  The costs being borne by local communities and school districts are \nrising dramatically. From 1992 through 1997, for example, special \neducation costs in Connecticut rose half again as much as did regular \neducation costs. Our schools need our help.\n  Of course, no one in Connecticut, or in any State or community in our \ncountry would question the value of ensuring every child the equal \naccess to education that he or she is guaranteed by our Constitution. \nThe only question is how best to do that, and a large part of the \nanswer is in this legislation. This legislation demonstrates that our \ncommitment to universal access is matched by our commitment to doing \neverything we can to helping States and schools provide that access.\n  And this amendment will help not only our children and schools, it \nwill help entire communities, by easing their tax burden. By our \nfailure to meet our goal of fully funding IDEA, we force local \ntaxpayers--homeowners and small businesspeople--to pay the higher taxes \nthat these services require. That is especially a problem in \nConnecticut, where so much of education is paid for through local \nproperty taxes.\n  If we are going to talk about the importance of tax relief for \naverage Americans, there are few more important steps we can take than \npassing this legislation. It will go far to alleviate the tax burden \nthat these people and businesses bear today.\n  Last year, the National Governors' Association wrote me that \n``Governors believe the single most effective step Congress could take \nto help address education needs and priorities, in the context of new \nbudget constraints, would be to meet its commitment to fully fund the \nfederal portion of IDEA.''\n  Over the next 10 years, we're looking at a $2.7 trillion non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicare surplus. I think that fully funding IDEA is one \nof the most productive ways that we can use a small part of that \nsurplus.\n  I ask that my colleagues seize this opportunity and support this \namendment and choose to help our schools better serve children with \ndisabilities, because I am tired of the false dichotomy that many \npeople perceive between parents of children without disabilities and \nparents of children with disabilities.\n  By fully funding the Federal share of IDEA, and easing the financial \nburden on states and schools, we can stop talking about ``children with \ndisabilities'' and ``children without disabilities,'' and start talking \ninstead about all children, period.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 467.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 6230 Van \nNuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, California, as the ``James C. Corman \nFederal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto honor the hard work and dedication of the late James C. Corman, an \nesteemed Member of the House of Representatives from California for 20 \nyears.\n  Jim Corman was born in Kansas, and moved to California with his \nmother shortly after his father's death. He served in the Marines \nduring World War II. After the war, Jim worked his way through the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern \nCalifornia Law School. He first held public office in 1957, when he was \nelected to the Los Angeles City Council.\n  Jim was first elected to the House in 1960. In 1963, he began serving \non the Judiciary Committee, which he felt handled the issues that were \namong the most important and relevant to Americans. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, he was an influential voice in drafting and \npassing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964. Jim always considered \nthis as the greatest accomplishment of his life.\n  In 1968, Jim became a member of the Ways and Means Committee, where \nhe devoted his energy to Social Security, tax, and welfare reform. He \nbecame a crusader for the welfare of senior citizens and the \ndisadvantaged members of our society.\n  Recognizing that his constituents would have better access to federal \nservices if there were a federal building in the San Fernando Valley, \nJim was responsible for securing funds for its construction. It is only \nfitting that this building be named after the man who considered \nconstituent service to be one of his top priorities.\n  Mr. President, James C. Corman was a well-respected Member of the \nHouse. I am pleased to honor his memory by introducing a bill to \ndesignate the federal building in Van Nuys as the James C. Corman \nFederal Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 469. A bill to provide assistance to States for the purpose of \nimproving schools through the use of Assistance Teams; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the School Support \nand Improvement Act of 2001, a bill designed to help ensure that every \nchild in America has access to a quality public school, with good \nteachers, adequate facilities and a safe environment to learn.\n  Mr. President, every child deserves and every parent has the right to \nexpect a top-notch, quality education. For example:\n  Every child should enter 1st grade healthy and prepared to succeed;\n  Every child should attend a school that is well-built, well-lit, \nwell-equipped and well-connected to our modern world; and\n  Every child should be instructed by a well-trained, well-paid and \nqualified teacher.\n  But some public schools in America do not meet that standard today. \nSome of our public schools are failing our children and shortchanging \ntheir future. We need to refocus our energy on turning these schools \naround and getting them back on track. This must be the nation's number \none priority.\n  A quality public school is not a partisan goal; it's not a \nconservative or liberal goal; it's not a big city or rural goal; it's \nnot a goal which separates rich from poor.\n  It's a simple, common-sense goal we can all agree upon. And if we can \nagree, then we should be able to do something about it.\n  The School Support and Improvement Act is one step in achieving this \ncommon sense goal. The legislation is based on a very important lesson \nwe have learned in my home state of North Carolina.\n  As many of you know, North Carolina has been at the forefront of the \neffort to reform public education for many years. In fact, President \nBush's new Education Secretary, Rod Paige, called North Carolina's \neducation system ``a model for the Nation.'' The School Support and \nImprovement Act is designed to translate one of the lessons we learned \nin North Carolina to the nationwide education reform effort.\n  At the heart of the North Carolina school reform program is a very \nsimple idea: immediately after we identify a school that is in trouble, \nwe assign a special team of experienced, specially trained educators, \nprincipals and administrators to go to the school and help them devise \na plan to turn that school around.\n  The team begins with an intensive evaluation of teachers, \nadministration and curriculum. Teachers and local school district \nofficials work with the Assistance Team to develop a plan tailored to \nthe school's needs and designed to improve student performance.\n  Assistance Teams have been remarkably successful in North Carolina. \nSince the program started in 1997, Assistance Teams have been assigned \nto 33 schools across North Carolina. Of those 33 schools, 29 have \nimproved significantly and are no longer considered low-performing. The \noverall percentage of low-performing schools has also decreased, from \n7.5 percent in the 1996-97 school year to 2.1 percent in the 1999-2000 \nschool year.\n  In short, Assistance Teams are a proven method to get low-performing\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nschools back on the path of providing quality education.\n  Our bill would accomplish two things: First, it would make the North \nCarolina model of sending Assistance Teams into low performing schools \na priority throughout the country. Second, it would require that the \nutilization of Assistance Teams be a priority in every States' efforts \nto turn around low performing schools. In order to carry out this task, \nthe bill provides additional resources to the States.\n  Mr. President, with the right tools, and adequate resources, we can \nbegin to put low-performing schools back on the right track. Our \nlegislation utilizes a proven model and provides the necessary \nresources while still ensuring flexibility for the state and local \neducational agencies.\n  I hope that this legislation will allow other states to benefit from \nthe sucessful model we have implemented in North Carolina.\n  When the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee considers \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the coming days, I intend \nto offer this proposal as part of that effort. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank \nyou.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Support and \n     Improvement Act of 2001.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds--\n       (1) The percent of low-performing schools in this country \n     is cause for national concern.\n       (2) Low-performing schools may not be in a position, or \n     their own, to make the kinds of changes necessary to turn \n     themselves around and improve student achievement.\n       (3) The federal government, States, and school districts \n     must collaborate with schools to help them improve to meet \n     the needs of their students.\n       (4) Schools must be held accountable for their performance \n     and improvement, but must also be given the tools and \n     resources they need to succeed.\n\n     SEC. 3. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       Each State educational agency shall reserve 5 percent of \n     the amount the State educational agency receives under \n     subpart 2 of part A for fiscal years 2002 through 2008, to \n     carry out the State agency's responsibilities under sections \n     1116 and 1117 (20 USC 6318), including carrying out the State \n     educational agency's statewide assistance and support for \n     local educational agencies, provided that an adequate \n     percentage of that reservation is passed to local educational \n     agencies.\n\n     SEC. 4. PRIORITY FOR SCHOOL ASSISTANCE TEAMS.\n\n       Sec. 1117 (20 USC 6318) is amended--\n       (1) in section (a) by adding at the end the following--\n       (3) Priority.--In assigning and placing school assistance \n     teams and providing additional support and technical \n     assistance as described in subsection 1117 (c)(1)(B), a State \n     educational agency shall give priority in assigning the State \n     assistance teams under this paragraph to school in which the \n     educational performance of the students is farthest from \n     meeting the State standards as determined by the State--\n       (A) first, to schools subject to corrective action under \n     section 1116(c)(5);\n       (B) second, to schools identified for school improvement \n     under section 1116(c); and\n       (C) third, to schools that have failed to make adequate \n     yearly progress under section 1111 for 1 year and where \n     placement of a State assistance team is appropriate and \n     requested by the local education agency or the school.\n       (2) section 1117(c) is amended to read as follows--\n       (c) School Assistance Teams.--In order to achieve the \n     purpose described in subsection (a), each State--\n       (A) shall give priority in its use of program improvement \n     funds for the establishment of schools assistance teams for \n     assignment to and placement in schools in the State in \n     accordance with 1117(a)(3) and for providing such support as \n     the State educational agency determines to be necessary and \n     available to assure the effectiveness of such teams.\n       (i) Composition.--Each school assistance teams shall be \n     composed of persons knowledgeable about successful schoolwide \n     projects, school reform, and improving educational \n     opportunities for low-achieving students including--\n       (a) teachers;\n       (b) pupil services personnel;\n       (c) parents;\n       (d) distinguished teachers or principals;\n       (e) representatives of institutions of higher education;\n       (f) regional educational laboratories or research centers;\n       (g) outside consultant groups; or\n       (h) other individuals as the state educational agency, in \n     consultation with the local educational agency, may deem \n     appropriate.\n       (ii) Functions.--Each school assistance team assigned to a \n     school under this Act shall--\n       (a) review and analyze all facets of the school's \n     operation, including the design and operation of the \n     instructional program, and assist the school in developing \n     recommendations for improving student performance in that \n     school;\n       (b) collaborate with school staff and the local educational \n     agency serving the school in the design, implementation, and \n     monitoring of a plan that, if fully implemented, can \n     reasonably be expected to provide student performance and \n     help the school meet its goals for improvement, including \n     adequate yearly progress under section 111(b)(2)(B) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311(b)(2)(B));\n       (c) evaluate, at least semiannually, the effectiveness of \n     school personnel assigned to the school, including \n     identifying outstanding teachers and principals, and make \n     findings and recommendations (including the need for \n     additional resources, professional development or \n     compensation) to the school, the local educational agency, \n     and where appropriate, the State educational agency; and\n       (d) make additional recommendations as the school \n     implements the plan described in paragraph (b) to the local \n     educational agency and the State educational agency \n     concerning additional assistance and resources that are \n     needed by the school or the assistance teams.\n       (iii) Continuation of assistance.--After 1 school year, the \n     school assistance team may recommend that the school support \n     team continue to provide assistance or that the local \n     educational agency or the state educational agency, as \n     appropriate, take alternative actions with regard to the \n     school.\n       (B) may provide additional technical assistance and support \n     through such approaches as--\n       (i) the designation and use of distinguished teachers and \n     principals, chosen from schools served under this part that \n     have been especially successful in improving academic \n     achievement;\n       (ii) providing assistance to the local educational agency \n     or school in the implementation of research-based \n     comprehensive school reform models; and\n       (iii) a review process designed to increase the capacity of \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop high-\n     quality school improvement plan; and\n       (iv) other approaches as the state educational agency may \n     deem appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 470. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to \nensure that each vote cast by such voter is duly counted, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support to \nAbsentee Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voters Act of 2001. This bill \nensures that Americans serving overseas, be they the men and women of \nthe military who stand guard on foreign shares, or equally deserving \ncitizens who serve our country in other venues, will have their vote \ncounted. American citizens should not loose their right to vote under \narbitrary or unfair standards. It is therefore incumbent upon lawmakers \nto ensure their rights are protected.\n  Although overseas mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, \nthe reality of the situation is that circumstances in foreign \ncountries, or at sea aboard u.S. Navy ships, can result in mail being \nsent without a postmark. Currently several states require a postmark \nfor an absentee ballot to be counted and without such a postmark \ncitizens are denied their vote through absolutely no fault of their \nown. We saw the damaging affects of this standard in our most recent \nPresidential election.\n  My bill provides that states may not refuse to count a ballot \nsubmitted in an election for a Federal office by an absentee uniformed \nservices member or overseas citizen voter on the grounds that the \nballot was improperly or fraudulently cast ``unless the State finds \nclear and convincing evidence'' of fraud in the preparation or casting \nof the ballot by the voter. Specifically, the bill states under a \n``Clear and Convincing Evidence'' standard, the lack of a witness \nsignature, address, postmark, or other identifying information may not \nbe considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud, absent any other \ninformation or evidence. Consequently the mere absence of a postmark \nwill not disqualify an overseas citizen from casting his or her vote.\n  Mr. President, our most recent election illustrates the clear need \nfor\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nchange in our voting procedures. Reform is needed. By making certain \nthat American's stationed overseas will have their votes counted, this \nbill is one crucial step in that direction. There is need for more \nreform however and I am working on a comprehensive election reform bill \ntargeting abusive practices at home. I look forward to introducing that \nlegislation next week and working with my colleagues towards adoption \nof all these measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 471. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide grants for the renovation of schools; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will provide grants \nto local schools so they can make the repairs to ensure the safety of \ntheir students. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman, \nKennedy, Wellsone, Dodd, and Clinton on this legislation.\n  In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a Report Card \nfor America's Infrastructure which reported serious problems with the \nphysical infrastructure in our nation. However, the most alarming \nfinding is the failing grade to schools in the United States--the only \narea to receive a failing grade.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our kids see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown \nplace they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about \nthe value we place on them, their education and future?\n  Modernizing and repairing our nation's schools is something I've been \nadvocating for over a decade now. I secured $100 million in the fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations bill as a down payment on a school \nmodernization program and was disappointed when those funds were \nrescinded.\n  But we made real progress last year with the passage of a $1.2 \nbillion initiative to make emergency repairs. That was a bipartisan \nagreement hammered out by Senator Specter and me in negotiations on the \nfiscal year 2001 appropriations bill with Congressman Goodling and the \nWhite House.\n  This was a 1 year authorization and the School Repair and Renovation \nAct will reauthorize this bipartisan plan for 5 years. This program \nprovides grants to Local Education Agencies to help them make urgently \nneeded repairs and to pay for special education and construction \nrelated technology expenses.\n  Funds will be distributed to the States. States will then distribute \n75 percent of the funds on a competitive basis to local school \ndistricts to make emergency repairs such as fixing fire code violation, \nrepairing the roof or installing new plumbing. The remaining 25 percent \nwill be distributed competitively to local school districts to use for \ntechnology activities related to school renovation or for activities \nauthorized under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  The School Repair and Renovation Act is a key component in a two-\nprong strategy to modernize our nation's schools.\n  In the near future I will join forces with Representatives Johnson \nand Rangel and introduce the America's Better Classrooms Act in the \nSenate to provide tax credits for school construction projects. This \nbipartisan legislation would leverage $1.7 billion in tax credits over \n5 years to pay the interest on $25 billion in school modernization \nbonds.\n  I know this approach will work because it mirrors a successful school \nconstruction demonstration program I started in Iowa in 1997. The Iowa \ndemonstration is a two-prong response to our school modernization \nneeds. First, we provide grants to local school districts to make \nurgent repairs to remedy fire code violations. Second, grants are made \nto local school districts to subsidize a portion of the cost for a new \nconstruction project.\n  The program has been a big success. During the first 2 years of the \ndemonstration, federal funds of $14.7 million supported projects \ntotaling $142 million--each federal dollar leveraged $10.33.\n  There is a legitimate federal role in helping fix our nation's \ncrumbling schools, and we can do so without undermining local control \nof education. This federal role is recognized by President Bush who is \nrecommending an expanded use of private activity bonds for school \nconstruction projects.\n  Over the past few years we have had several partisan skirmishes \nrelated to school construction. This is a new year, a new Congress, and \na new administration. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact the School Repair and Renovation Act of 2001. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the report card to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              1998 REPORT CARD FOR AMERICA's INFRASTRUCTURE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subject            Grade                  Comments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoads..................

More than 70 percent\n                                    of peak-hour traffic occurs in\n                                    congested conditions. It will cost\n                                    $263 billion to eliminate the\n                                    backlog of needs and maintain repair\n                                    levels. Another $94 billion is\n                                    needed for modest improvement--a\n                                    $357 billion total.\nBridges................

C  Twenty percent of buses, 23 percent\n                                    of rail vehicles, and 38 percent of\n                                    rural and specialized vehicles are\n                                    in deficient condition. Twenty-one\n                                    percent of rail track requires\n                                    improvement. Forty-eight percent of\n                                    rail maintenance buildings, 65\n                                    percent of all rail yards and 46\n                                    percent of signals and communication\n                                    equipment are in fair or poor\n                                    condition. The investment needed to\n                                    maintain conditions is $39 billion.\n                                    It would take up to $72 billion to\n                                    improve conditions.\nAviation...............

At current\n                                    capacity, this growth will lead to\n                                    gridlock by 2004 or 2005. Estimates\n                                    for capital investment needs range\n                                    from $40-60 billion in the next five\n                                    years to meet design requirements\n                                    and expand capacity to meet demand.\nSchools................

Forty-six\n                                    percent lack basic wiring to support\n                                    computer systems. It will cost about\n                                    $112 billion to repair, renovate and\n                                    modernize our schools Another $60\n                                    billion in new construction is\n                                    needed to accommodate the 3 million\n                                    new students expected in the next\n                                    decade.\nDrinking Water.........

The total\n                                    infrastructure need remains large--\n                                    $138.4 billion. More than $76.8\n                                    billion of that is needed right now\n                                    to protect public health.\nWastewater.............       D+   Today, 60 percent of our rivers and\n                                    lakes are fishable and swimmable.\n                                    There remain an estimated 300,000 to\n                                    400.000 contaminated groundwater\n                                    sites. America needs to invest\n                                    roughly $140 billion over the next\n                                    20 years in its wastewater treatment\n                                    systems. An additional 2,000 plants\n                                    may be necessary by the year 2016.\nDams...................        D   There are 2,100 regulated dams that\n                                    are considered unsafe. Every state\n                                    has at least one high-hazard dam,\n                                    which upon failure would cause\n                                    significant loss of life and\n                                    property. There were more than 200\n                                    documented dam failures across the\n                                    nation in the past few years. It\n                                    would cost about $1 billion to\n                                    rehabilitate documented unsafe dams.\nSolid Waste............         C- Totals non-hazardous municipal solid\n                                    waste will increase from 208 to 218\n                                    million tons annually by the year\n                                    2000, even though the per capita\n                                    waste generation rate will decrease\n                                    from 1,606 to 1,570 pounds per\n                                    person per year. Total expenditures\n                                    for managing non-hazardous municipal\n                                    solid waste in 1991 were $18 billion\n                                    and are expected to reach $75\n                                    billion by the year 2000.\nHazardous Waste........       D-   More than 530 million tons of\n                                    municipal and industrial hazardous\n                                    waste is generated in the U.S. each\n                                    year. Since 1980, only 423 (32\n                                    percent) of the 1,200 Superfund\n                                    sites on the National Priorities\n                                    List have been cleaned up.

The price tag\n                                    for Superfund and related clean up\n                                    programs is an estimated $750\n                                    billion and could rise to $1\n                                    trillion over the next 30 years.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmerica's Infrastructure G.P.A. = D.

Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in \n     Arts Education Act (Public Law 106-533) was approved by the \n     106th Congress by unanimous consent;\n       Whereas arts literacy is a fundamental purpose of schooling \n     for all students;\n       Whereas arts education stimulates, develops and refines \n     many cognitive and creative skills, critical thinking and \n     nimbleness in judgment, creativity and imagination, \n     cooperative decisionmaking, leadership, high-level literacy \n     and communication, and the capacity for problem posing and \n     problem-solving;\n       Whereas arts education contributes significantly to the \n     creation of flexible, adaptable, and knowledgeable workers \n     who will be needed in the 21st century economy;\n       Whereas arts education improves teaching and learning;\n       Whereas when parents and families, artists, arts \n     organizations, businesses, local civic and cultural leaders, \n     and institutions are actively engaged in instructional \n     programs, arts education is more successful;\n       Whereas effective teachers of the arts should be encouraged \n     to continue to learn and grow in mastery of their art form as \n     well as in their teaching competence;\n       Whereas educators, schools, students, and other community \n     members recognize the importance of arts education; and\n       Whereas arts programs, arts curriculum, and other arts \n     activities in schools across the Nation should be encouraged \n     and publicly recognized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ARTS EDUCATION MONTH.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates each of March 2001, and March 2002, as \n     ``Arts Education Month''; and\n       (2) encourages schools, students, educators, parents, and \n     other community members to engage in activities designed to--\n       (A) celebrate the positive impact and public benefits of \n     the arts;\n       (B) encourage all schools to integrate the arts into the \n     school curriculum;\n       (C) spotlight the relationship between the arts and student \n     learning;\n       (D) demonstrate how community involvement in the creation \n     and implementation of arts policies enriches schools;\n       (E) recognize school administrators and faculty who provide \n     quality arts education to students;\n       (F) provide professional development opportunities in the \n     arts for teachers;\n       (G) create opportunities for students to experience the \n     relationship between participation in the arts and developing \n     the life skills necessary for future personal and \n     professional success;\n       (H) increase, encourage, and ensure comprehensive, \n     sequential arts learning for all students;\n       (I) honor individual, class, and student group achievement \n     in the arts; and\n       (J) increase awareness and accessibility to live \n     performances, and original works of art.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Senate \nresolution to designate March 2001, and March 2002, as ``Arts Education \nMonth.''\n  Last year, the Senate approved a similar resolution, marking for the \nfirst time, Congressional recognition of the annual celebration of \nmusic, art, dance and theatre programs in American schools.\n  There is growing awareness that arts education can help ensure \nAmerica's arts traditions and lead to higher I.Q.'s, better SAT scores, \nbetter math and language skills, less juvenile delinquency, and improve \nchances of higher education and as well as increased job opportunities.\n  According to a study by the UCLA Graduate School of Education and \nInformation Studies, students involved in the arts outscored students \nwho were not exposed to arts on standardized tests. Among 10th graders, \nfor example, 47.5 percent of low-arts-involved students scored in the \ntop half of standardized tests while 65.7 percent of high-arts-involved \nstudents scored above the test median.\n  The study also found that students who consistently act in plays and \nmusicals, join drama clubs or taking acting lessons showed gains in \nreading proficiency, self-concept and motivation. By the 12th grade, \nthose consistently involved with instrumental music scored \nsignificantly higher on math tests. The findings held true for students \nregardless of parents' income, occupation or level of education, \nresearchers said.\n  I hope that by designating March as Arts Education Month, more \nschools and communities will engage in activities that showcase, \ncelebrate, reward and provide new arts experiences for students of all \nages.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring Arts Education \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1911-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, if I may take a moment or two, we have \njust concluded on the House floor a bipartisan meeting between Members \nof the House and Senator Allen and myself where we had some 400-plus \nindividuals from all across the United States discussing a wide range \nof issues regarding the Internet and cyberspace. It was a fascinating \ndiscussion. That group is soon to come over to this Chamber, following \nthe Senate standing in recess, where Senator Allen and I will continue \nthat discussion, but we will also speak about the history of this \nChamber.\n  In the course of my remarks--and then I will call on my distinguished \ncolleague to follow with his remarks--I addressed the extraordinary \nproblem that the entire Nation is facing with regard to those devising \ncapabilities to hack into our computer systems and, as chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, what our committee is now doing with the \nsubcommittee on emerging threats, which under the leadership of Senator \nRoberts has taken many strides towards trying to take positive actions \nto stop the invasion of our computer systems.\n  In the year 1999, there were over 20,000 invasions of various \ncomputer systems in the Department of Defense, and in the following \nyear up to 24,000 intrusions into our system. That says to us, as we \nproceed to make our military more high tech, we are highly vulnerable \nbecause of that situation, and I urge this group to work more closely \nwith the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies \nwithin the Federal Government to do everything we can to try to make \nmore secure our computers and other aspects of cyberspace.\n\n  It is to the advantage of the private sector because security against \nhacking into their system--a bank going into accounts, an investment \nhouse going into accounts, medical things, people working on patents, \nand so forth--is desperately needed. I am pleased to be a part of the \nteam here in the Senate that is looking at this.\n  I now ask if my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from \nVirginia, who is chairman on our side, so to speak, of the high-tech \ntask force, would care to say a few remarks. I might add we are trying \nto prolong this session a few minutes so the pages don't have homework. \nFor those who follow these proceedings, we are just about there.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator, Mr. Warner, for \nallowing me to make a few remarks about technology. It is a great honor \nto be chairman of the Senate Republican high-tech task force, where we \nare looking at a variety of issues to allow the technology community to \ncontinue to improve our lives.\n  Senator Warner has been a tremendous leader in this regard, \nespecially as far as security is concerned. We all on the task force \nvery much look forward to his further contributions.\n  The people in this country are benefiting a great deal from the \ntechnology in communications, and in commerce there is tremendous \npotential, as well as in education, in biotechnology, in \ntransportation, and elsewhere. Just for people to understand our \nphilosophy, we trust free people and free enterprise. People should not \nbe limited or hampered in their creativity, and it should be the \nmarketplace, free people making free choices as to whether or not \nsomeone's technological invention or innovations are worthy of their \npurchases.\n  So we think those are the principles that should be guiding us in \ndetermining the success determined by the people in the marketplace.\n  Mr. President, in recognizing how much technological opportunity we \nhave, we need to make sure that our rural communities have access to \nhigh-speed Internet capabilities. But these technologies not only have \nnot reached all the areas of our country, which is important, but they \ncertainly haven't reached all corners of the world.\n  Consider this: If the entire world population was reduced to 100 \npeople, with the current ratios staying the same, here are a few \nexamples of how the world would look: Out of the 100; 57 would be \nAsians; 21 European; 14 would be from the Western Hemisphere, North and \nSouth America; 8 would be Africans; approximately 80 out of the hundred \nwould live in substandard housing; about 60 to 70 would be unable to \nread; 50 would suffer from malnutrition; 50 would not have made their \nfirst telephone call; about 1 would have a college education; and maybe \n1\\1/2\\ out of 100 of the world's population would have a computer.\n  As you can see, we have a long way to go. So we need to understand \nthat this country is the technology leader. It is what is allowing us \nto compete in the international marketplace, to improve our methods of \nmanufacturing and production in an efficient, top-quality approach, as \nwell as reducing emissions and toxins.\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\n  I think as long as we continue to foster the proper tax, regulatory, \nand educational policies in this country, and as long as the \ninvigorating breeze of freedom continues to blow into new markets and \nplaces in the world, technology will improve construction, \ncommunications, education, life sciences, medical sciences, and \ntransportation.\n  I very much look forward to the leadership of the President and \nSenator Warner in the Senate to allow the technological revolution to \ncontinue to improve our lives and those of our fellow human beings here \non earth.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. How much I look \nforward to working with him here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/06/senate-section/article/S1913-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
