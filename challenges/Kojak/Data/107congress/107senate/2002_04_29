The reports we have \nreceived are that it does not appear there will be a lot of debate \nprior to this vote tonight, although there are a few Members who wish \nto speak. There will be about 5 hours for debate, and it appears at \nthis time that there will not be a lot of speakers.\n  Unless my friend from Wyoming has a statement, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum, and I ask that the time for the quorum call be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I wish to speak on the bill before us.\n  At 6 o'clock, as my friend from Nevada mentioned, we will be voting \non the motion to proceed to one of the more important bills before us \nthis year. I am glad we have some opportunity to talk about this \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 3009 is the vehicle on which the Senate will be voting as to \nwhether or not the Senate will proceed to three bills--the Trade \nPromotion Act, the Trade Adjustment Act, and the extension of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences. I wish to focus on what I believe to \nbe the more critical issue, and that is the Trade Promotion Act.\n  This is often called fast track. It is designed to give us a system \nto bargain, if you will, and negotiate treaties with other countries, \nhopefully to the benefit of the United States. I believe it is very \ncritical to our economic future.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n  While other nations are negotiating treaties--and have been for some \ntime--to open markets and strengthen their economies, the United States \nduring these negotiations has been on the sidelines. Of the 134 free \ntrade agreements in force, the United States is only party to 3. Mexico \nhas signed 28 agreements. One-third of the world's exports are covered \nby the European Union's trade and customs agreements, where ours is \nless than 11 percent.\n  Since the authority for the President expired in 1994, the rest of \nthe world has gone forward seeking to make trade agreements that are \nfavorable to their countries. We have not been able to do that.\n  The TPA bill passed the Finance Committee 18 to 3, and, of course, \nhas passed the House. I think it provides a reasonable solution to \nwhere we ought to be and where we need to be. All of us are concerned \nthat trade be fair, that it be equitable, that it gives us the best \nopportunities it can, but that there is trade. Trade is there and \nbillions of dollars move around the world every day.\n  We need to make sure our trade is as favorable as it can be and we \nare in step with the rest of the world in terms of being able to do \nthat fairly.\n  President Bush said earlier it is important for America to understand \nwe are good at what we do. We can compete with anyone in the world. We \nhave the most productive workforce on the face of the Earth. Therefore, \nlet us open our markets to sell our products. He asked the Senate to \ngive him the ability to do that.\n  As I mentioned, the Trade Promotion Act expired in 1994 and we have \nsort of stood on the sidelines ever since. In December, the House \npassed a bipartisan trade promotion bill. The Senate Finance Committee \nthen moved fairly quickly. I was fortunate enough, as was the Presiding \nOfficer, to be a part of that and listened to that debate. It passed 18 \nto 3 to move it on and to do the things we want to do.\n  Certainly, there is room for discussion about trade and trade \nagreements. We have different views of it, depending a little on where \nwe are and what we do at the time, but the fact is that trade \nagreements are very important to us. They expand markets for U.S. goods \nand services. They create higher paying jobs in America for those kinds \nof things that are exported. They give us a chance to show our \nproductivity and our efficiency in doing the things we do well. So it \ntends to invigorate our economy, and certainly now is a time when we \nwant to do that.\n  The absence of trade opportunities has created sort of an invisible \ntax on America that we pay whenever we shop. Better trade deals and \nlower tariffs can boost savings even higher, and I think it is time we \ndo that.\n  Trade is essential, of course, to America's economy and our growth \nand our prosperity. Exports accounted for more than one-fourth of all \neconomic growth in the 1990s. The jobs that are dependent on exports \nare estimated to be 13 to 18 percent higher than the national average. \nOne-tenth of American workers, 12 million, are in jobs that depend on \nexports. So we need to think long and hard about the process we use.\n  Fast track sounds as if we are giving all the authority to the \nPresident to make these decisions, but that is not the case. What we \nare doing is setting up a system which allows the President and his \npeople to do the negotiations within guidelines that are set in the \nbill, and then bring the results of those negotiations back to the \nCongress. The Constitution provides that the Congress deal with those \nFederal trade issues.\n  So as I mentioned before, a lot of these have been going on while we \nhave not been able to do much about it, and the impact is fairly \nsimple. One example is a $187,000 Caterpillar tractor made in America \nand shipped to Chile is slapped with a $13,000 trade tariff. The same \ntractor made in Brazil and sold to Chile is $3,000. The same tractor \nmade in Canada and shipped to Chile, there is no tariff. So in terms of \nbeing able to compete, in terms of being able to be part of world \ntrade, without an agreement and a system to bring in these kinds of \nthings, we are left on the sidelines to some extent.\n  Trade is good for American farmers and ranchers. We have had several \nmeetings and a couple of news conferences on agriculture. One in every \nthree acres in this country is planted for exports. American farmers \nexported about $55 billion in agricultural products last year. Almost a \nthird, nearly 40 percent, of agricultural products go into exports.\n  I understand different commodities are different and have different \nimpacts, but, nevertheless, overall agriculture is certainly a valuable \ntool and one we have to have to have a strong economy. The same is true \nof small business. The same is true, of course, of all we do in the \nworld.\n  Our relationships and our leadership, at least in part, have to do \nwith the economic arrangements we have and our economy. The trade \npromotion authority is the one we are really looking at.\n  I mentioned it passed the House. It was a very close vote, as a \nmatter of fact, but it was passed on and the committee has dealt with \nthat. It would renew the trade agreement authority that expired in \n1994.\n  Basically, it falls in two categories: the President's authority to \nproclaim changes in tariffs resulting from negotiations of reciprocal \ntrade agreements and, two, procedures for implementing the provisions \nof these agreements which entail changes in U.S. law.\n  These procedures are commonly known as fast track, and they require \nan up-or-down vote of the Congress. It seems to me that is a reasonable \nthing. I cannot imagine 535 individuals trying to come up with some \nkind of trade negotiation. That does not work. So we have to delegate \nthat and then have the overview of it in the Congress. That is \nbasically what this does.\n  The key provisions include establishing the objectives of \nnegotiations. Obviously, when we negotiate for the United States and \nthe U.S. representatives, the purpose is to get as good a deal as we \ncan possibly get for our country. There are congressional guidances to \nthe President. It requires Presidential consultation with the Congress \nbefore, during, and after trade negotiations. So, again, it is not \nsomething that is apart from but is done in a particular way. It \ncreates a congressional oversight group, a broad-based bipartisan \norganization, that has oversight of what is going on and can report and \ngive information to the Congress. It is designed to do that.\n  So the Congress is very much involved. That is the key now. The way \nthis is happening is what is called the Trade Adjustment Act. That is \nthe bill that is before us with these other two that will be coming a \npart of that. One of them is Andean trade, which is a specific trade \nagreement set forth to work with States in South America. We, again, do \nnot have agreements with them. One of them is Colombia where we are \nseeking to try to make some changes, of course. Another is Bolivia, \nEcuador, and Peru. So this is one of the bills addressing that.\n  Then the trade adjustment authority is the one that has been in \neffect before. It has expired. It provides programs for employees who \nhave felt the impact of trade agreements, such as the loss of jobs and \nthe loss of their businesses. Financial trading and assistance has been \navailable to firms and companies, and for displaced workers who face \nsignificant adjustments.\n  I always think about agriculture. Years ago, farmers and ranchers \nlived on the ranch and provided almost everything for themselves: \nclothing and food. They built their own houses. They did all of those \nthings. Then as things changed we sought to do the things we do best \nand make our profits there and then buy from other people what they do \nbest. That is sort of what happens in trade.\n\n  The new provision, however, is designed to go much further than what \nit did in the past, and I suspect this will be the controversial aspect \nof this negotiation in which there is a tendency on the part of \nparticularly the folks on the other side of the aisle to bring forth a \nprogram that will be permanent, such as financing COBRA, where the \ninsurance can be extended that one had with their company, paying for \n75 percent of it from Government funds, and developing a permanent \nprogram where we are really looking for some rather short-term \nassistance until these folks can readjust or perhaps get rehired.\n  So that is kind of where we are. Certainly this is one of the issues \nthe President has talked about a great deal\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nin terms of our economy and in terms of all the many things that affect \nus. This has been one of his highest priorities.\n  I have to say, despite some of the conversation that goes on, the \nPresident's priorities have done rather well in terms of taxes, in \nterms of energy, and I think this is another one that must necessarily \nbe handled and put into place.\n  Trade promotion is critical to our economic future. The President \nneeds the authority to extend and expand our international trade \ncapacities. Trade negotiators need legislation to ensure they are \nafforded a seat at the negotiation table.\n  I have already mentioned that many of these negotiations have gone on \nwithout us. This bill provides a reasonable and effective procedure for \ncongressional consultation and involvement. It avoids establishing \nunwarranted mandates that would adversely affect the negotiating \nauthority of the President. It ensures that the laws of the United \nStates are maintained and protected.\n  I suspect this will be somewhat controversial. Each of us will have \nsome of our parochial feelings about it. Wyoming is very involved in \nagriculture. Trade is important to Wyoming agriculture. It is important \nto beef, wool, wheat, and lamb. We have been through this. But TPA will \nprovide the negotiators a chance to reduce those barriers and get us a \nbetter seat at the table.\n  Despite our relationship with Japan, I think there is still about a \n40-percent tariff on beef. That is a high tariff in Japan. We need to \nwork at reducing those tariffs because, for agriculture, one of the \nbest futures we have is the opportunity to expand markets beyond our \ndomestic market.\n  I look forward to this debate and discussion, and, frankly, I look \nforward to finishing the discussion this week so we can get on with \nprotecting our markets and making our economy even stronger.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3483-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3483-S3484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MESSAGE ON EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we speak frequently of Nevada's security \nneeds. We speak frequently of the security needs of every State in the \nUnion, especially after September 11. We speak frequently of American \nsecurity needs, and understandably so. But we should also realize that \nthe strength and security of our Nation require more than bombs and \nbullets and our brave men and women in uniform.\n  The future of our country will also be determined by our children and \nour grandchildren and how they are going to be educated. I believe we \nhave a high priority for America to educate our children, making sure \nthat all children have the tools and opportunity to succeed.\n  Nevada is similar to almost every State in the Union with regard to \neducational needs today. However, we also have unique problems. In the \nLas Vegas area, the Clark County School District is the sixth largest \nschool district in America with 240,000 kids. We have built 18 new \nschools in 1 year to keep up with the growth.\n  In other parts of the State, teachers have been laid off because the \npopulation growth was not as rapid and there are fewer people living \nthere. Jobs have been cut back, especially in places where mining is so \nimportant. Mines have been cut back.\n  The things I hear about education in Nevada I think can be applied \nall over the country. For example, a couple of weeks ago two women came \nto visit with me. They are schoolteachers in Nevada, one representing \nLas Vegas and one representing Reno. They specialize in educating kids \nwho are really smart. They were here to tell me of the cutbacks in \nprograms in both the Reno and Las Vegas areas. These children have IQs \nof more than 130. Those programs for smart kids in Clark County are \nbasically gone. In Reno we still have some, but not as many as they \nshould have.\n\n  In Nevada, the high school dropout rate is very high--one of the \nhighest in the country. Twenty-seven percent of the children who drop \nout of high school in Clark County have IQs of more than 130. Think \nabout that. The smart kids have no programs for their interests. They \nare geniuses. Anyone with an IQ that high is really smart. With all the \ncutbacks in funding for IDEA--a program for kids with special needs--we \ndo not have the ability in Nevada and other parts of the country to \neducate those children.\n  Think about that--27 percent of the kids dropping out of high school \nin the sixth largest school district in America. That school district \nis one of leaders in high school dropouts. They are geniuses.\n  Often, education--especially elementary and secondary education--is \nviewed as a local issue because most decisions are made by local \nleaders, school boards, principals, teachers, and parents, as it should \nbe. But the Federal Government should and does play an important role \nin helping to educate America's children.\n  One of the high points of my congressional service was when we joined \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to pass an education bill. We agreed to \nwork to improve the quality of education in America's public schools. \nWe worked in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the ESEA. We passed a \nstrong educational reform program that requires States to set high \nstandards for every student, to strengthen Federal incentives to boost \nlow-performing schools, and to significantly improve educational \nachievement. We even gave the legislation a catchy name--the No Child \nLeft Behind Act.\n  Unfortunately, though, the President has not lived up to what I \nthought was the bipartisan spirit of the legislation we passed. We need \nto not only authorize legislation but we need to appropriate money for \nit.\n  Less than a month after signing this bill, the President proposed a \nbudget which cuts almost $100 million in funding for the No Child Left \nBehind Act. In addition to that--in effect, rubbing salt into the \nwound--we learned that the President wants to squeeze $1.3 billion from \nthe Federal student loan program that helps millions of college \nstudents, recent graduates, and their families. Actions speak louder \nthan words. This administration should want to do more than just talk \nabout education.\n  This administration can't claim to be committed to education while \nsimultaneously making it more difficult and more expensive for students \nto pay for their college education.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about the administration's \nrecent pronouncement regarding Federal loan programs. Millions and \nmillions of poor and middle-income students rely on student loans to \npay for their education. Without these loans, these children and young \nadults would be left behind.\n  Currently, students and recent graduates can consolidate their loans \nand repay their debts with a fixed interest rate. The President's plan, \nhowever, would force students and graduates to pay thousands of dollars \nmore by subjecting them to a variable interest rate.\n\n  What does this mean? It means you would borrow money and never know \nwhat the interest rate was going to be. You wouldn't be able to \nconsolidate the loans. When students go to college and to graduate \nschool, or a professional school, when they graduate and want to \nconsolidate their loans, they should be able to do that and have one \ninterest rate. The President is suggesting they can't do that anymore.\n  To be competitive in the future and remain in our leadership position \nwith schools and colleges, America needs to encourage and support \nstudents seeking higher education.\n  People can quibble about public education. I am a great proponent of \npublic education. About 95 percent of all kids in America go to public \nschools. There is some criticism due about the public education \nsystem--no question about that. But college education in this country \nis second to none.\n  Of the 131 top schools and colleges in the world, the United States \nhas 124 of them. Colleges in America are the best. We have to maintain \nthat superiority.\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nThe plan the President has put forth would close the gates of college \ncampuses to many students. In a global economy, and increasingly tied \nto information technology, we will depend more and more on workers with \nadvanced training and skills.\n  This is more than a student going to college to become a teacher or a \ndoctor or a lawyer or an engineer; it is young men and women getting \nout of high school and becoming automobile mechanics or working in the \nhealth care profession.\n  When I graduated from high school, if you wanted to be an automobile \nmechanic, you went to work at the corner service station and became a \nmechanic. It is not that way anymore. To be hired to be an automobile \nmechanic at a car dealership, you have to have a certificate indicating \nyou have been properly trained. That is what will happen at our local \ncommunity colleges. That is something of which we have to be aware, \nthat young men and women who want to do this need to be able to borrow \nmoney to get an education.\n  A college degree, long seen as a ticket to financial success, is \nbecoming a prerequisite for achieving the American dream. At the same \ntime, students face even higher tuition costs. Attending a 4-year \nprivate university can cost up to $40,000 a year. And even public \nuniversities are becoming too expensive for many students. Some \nstudents face double-digit percentage increases for tuition at State \nschools next year.\n  So we cannot allow this administration's plan to proceed as it deals \nwith college loans because it would prevent many capable students from \nattending college. The administration's plan would also have a negative \nimpact on those who have already attended college.\n  This month, millions of students will graduate from our Nation's \ncolleges and universities. They and their families will be rightfully \nproud that they have earned a diploma. Yet they do not know what the \ntrue cost of their education will be, which they have largely financed \nwith student loans. The President's plan will cost them thousands of \ndollars in additional interest payments.\n\n  Already, graduates are heavily burdened with student loan debt. As a \nconsequence, they are often unable to pursue a job in the field of \ntheir choice and, instead, are forced to work in a higher paying job \nbut a less personally fulfilling job, if they can find it.\n  There are wonderful young men and women who work in the Senate \noffices. They each work for one of us because they want to contribute \nto what they believe is a better society. They could go other places to \nwork. I could pick lots of people from my office and use them as \nexamples.\n  I have two people with Ph.Ds who work for me: One has a doctoral \ndegree in physics and the other has a doctorate in geology from fine \nuniversities around America. They could work other places and make more \nmoney, but they love what they are doing here. I am so happy they work \nfor me. They owe money on student loans. So we have to make sure the \nplan suggested by this administration will not go forward.\n  I could pick as examples lots of university graduates who have worked \nfor me. I could pick, as I mentioned, Dr. Greg Jaczko. I could pick Dr. \nKai Anderson. But as an example here today, I am going to pick Shannon \nEagan.\n  Shannon is from Las Vegas. She works on my staff, and she is really \ngood. She does legislative correspondence. She also does legislative \nassistance work. She is intelligent, talented, ambitious, and \ninterested in a career in public service. But she has to repay tens of \nthousands of dollars in student loans because her parents are not \nwealthy.\n  The President's plan would require her to pay thousands and thousands \nof dollars in addition to what she already owes. Of course, she fears \nthat a relatively low-paying Government job such as she has will not \nenable her to meet these needs. She is considering, sadly, seeking a \nhigher paying, private sector job, even though she likes what she is \ndong in her job.\n  If she leaves my staff, I will lose a valuable employee, the State of \nNevada will not be helped as much as it could be, and the Senate will \nlose a valuable employee. I think it will have a detrimental effect on \nour country, a very small, but significant detrimental effect.\n  So we have to watch this very closely. There are hundreds of \nthousands of young Americans who face the same dilemma as Shannon. They \nwant to dedicate themselves to serving our country as teachers or \nsocial workers or working in the Congress of the United States. But \nwhen they do the math--calculating their salary and their expenses, \nincluding their student loan payments--they discover it simply is not \npossible.\n  Since we need more bright, motivated people to work in these \noccupations, including being a teacher, this is really a double whammy \non us. If education is truly a priority for this administration, they \nwill drop this plan to raise the cost of student loans. We all must be \naware of this. It affects millions of people, and we should do \neverything we can so the students get the benefit, not the banks.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nto President Bush for his commitment to bringing insurance parity to \npeople with mental illness.\n  As a long time supporter of mental health parity legislation in the \nSenate, I found his statement today in New Mexico to be a breath of \nfresh air in a debate that has languished for too long here in \nWashington.\n  I will always believe that when it comes to health insurance \ncoverage, mental illness should be treated like any physical ailment. \nUnfortunately, those suffering from mental health disorders have for \nyears suffered undue discrimination at the hands of insurers who force \nthem to pay higher costs than patients suffering from physical \nailments.\n  I believe there simply is no scientific, clinical, fiscal or ethical \nreason for this discrimination.\n  I applaud President Bush for his commitment to ending it and leveling \nthe health care playing field to require equal access to psychiatric \ntreatment and care.\n  As President Bush pointed out today in New Mexico, people suffering \nfrom severe and persistent mental problems don't suffer alone. Their \nillness affects their families and loved ones, and even our country\n  It is incredibly painful to watch someone you love struggle with an \nillness that affects their mind, their feelings and their relationships \nwith others, and that difficulty is only exacerbated when care and \ntreatment options are denied or placed out of reach due to high costs.\n  Remarkable treatments exist, yet many people--too many people in my\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nview--remain untreated because insurance discrimination limits their \naccess.\n  I am glad the President has asked all Americans for a commitment to \nbridge the insurance divide between people who are physically and \nmentally ill. Americans with mental illness deserve our attention. I \nbelieve we can and should this year act on mental health parity \nlegislation that bridges those coverage chasms and also controls new \nhealth care costs.\n  For my part, I intend to continue working with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Domenici, on this important issue to ensure that \nnondiscrimination is the law of the land. We can do this in a \nbipartisan, fiscally responsible way, and I look forward to getting it \ndone this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3485-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3485-S3489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to calling up the Andean \ntrade pact for debate, someone could immediately question why the \ndelay, trying to hold up on the actual calling of the bill? There will \nbe plenty of time to submit amendments. I do not know of a more serious \ntopic that will be discussed this year in the Congress, and yet \ndiscussion should be two ways: Those who are ready to propose and \npropound, and those who are ready to object to and explain why this is \nnot in the economic interest of the United States. It is a one-way \nstreet, though, as it appears, in the Senate.\n  The temptation is to have a live quorum so somebody can be talked to. \nThis has been the typical treatment of trade in the United States now \nfor the past several years. What really happens is those for the fast-\ntrack agreement work on the members to vote their way. By one vote, the \nHouse passed it, with what my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nwould call pork--little favors here, little favors there. After the \npassage of NAFTA some 8 years ago in 1994, the New York Times ran a \nstory of the 26 different favors done by President Clinton at that \nparticular time to get NAFTA and fast track passed. I think it was \nCongressman Pickle, who got a cultural center down in Austin, TX; \nanother Congressman got a round of golf; another Congressman a round of \ngolf personally with the President of the United States; another \nCongressman got two B-17 contracts, and so on. The New York Times wrote \nof the 26 different votes that were changed.\n\n  There was only one important vote to change this particular time in \nthe House. When it comes to the Senate Finance Committee, it is an easy \nfix. Once it is fixed and ready to be presented in the Senate, they \nwithhold the presentation of the particular measure until they have 60 \nvotes to make sure they can get cloture as they cut off debate, limit \nthe amendments, and limit the time for each of the individual Senators. \nAnd since the Senators know the debate is limited and the vote is \nfixed, no one listens.\n  I have to express my gratitude to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for coming because I do not know of a more important subject \nthan this. While cloture is obtained later at 6 p.m. today, we will \nagain try to withhold the actual finalizing of the debate with another \ncloture vote after we present some amendments.\n  The bottom line is, if one had to answer their opposition it would be \ndifficult to do. They are putting out the Andean trade bill, combining \nit with the come-ons not only of fast track but trade adjustment \nassistance, and they put those amendments on and then pass it \naltogether. After they have bundled together various wants, namely \ntrade adjustment assistance and the fast track which the White House \nwants; and, of course, the Andean trade bill which others interested in \nthis particular hemisphere want, what happens then is they package \ntogether and get a bad deal for America.\n  I say that advisedly for the simple reason, we are exporting jobs \nfaster than we can create them. What happens is that in trying to \ncreate them, we are really facing organized society politically, \neconomically, financially, and otherwise, in the United States against \nus. It is a very interesting thing.\n  I think about my friend Robert Kennedy. I have had his desk for years \nin the Senate. Robert Kennedy came to political notoriety in a book \ncalled ``The Enemy Within.'' He was writing about James Hoffa and \norganized labor.\n  Today I could write a book on the enemy within. Instead of labor, it \nis management. How does that occur? It occurs because 30 percent of \nproduction costs, 30 percent of volume, is in labor. In manufacturing, \nparticularly, 20 percent of manufacturing costs can be saved by moving \nproduction or manufacturing offshore, to a low-wage country such as \nMexico. If you have $500 million in sales at a manufacturing facility, \nyou can make $100 million pretax profit by moving offshore. Just keep \nyour executive office and your sales force in-country and move your \nproduction offshore and you have made yourself $100 million. Or you can \ncontinue to work your own people and go bankrupt.\n  That is the job policy of the U.S. Government today. That is the job \npolicy of the Senate. Who is supporting this? The Business Roundtable, \nthe Conference Board, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Business.\n  My friend, Tom Donohue, at the Chamber of Commerce, has it \norchestrated where the five move in. I saw it with Y2K. Chicken Little, \nthe sky was going to fall if we did not hurry and pass that particular \nprovision to protect Silicon Valley. Of course, the Republicans and \nDemocrats were fighting hard in the Silicon Valley to get their \nfinancial contributions. The fight was not to protect the computers. It \nwas to protect the financial wherewithal of campaigns. They could care \nless about Main Street America. They are for offshore production, \nthereby the offshore creation of jobs outside of America.\n  There is more. I will never forget the debates we had with respect to \ntextile bills in my time. We passed five textile bills through the \nSenate. One did not get past the House; the other four that did were \nall vetoed after the President, of course, promised to sign them. The \nPresident promised to sign them in my State, in the city of Greenville, \nthe heart of textile industry. They forget about that.\n  I bought a shirt made in China and one made in New Jersey. I bought a \ncatcher's mitt. One made in Korea and one made in Grand Rapids, MI. I \nshowed that the markup on the imported article was much greater.\n  So the retailers are getting behind the movement of big business. Who \nfollows behind? The newspapers. The retailers are seeing the newspapers \nhand out free trade, free trade, fast track, fast track. They are like \nparrots. The majority of the newspapers are for retail advertising. So \nthey, in turn, join in. You ought to see how the special trade \nrepresentatives are representing the Government in these giveaway \nprograms. They have literally drained the jobs from the United States \nof America.\n  I was reading a book that has become required reading in the \nWashington area, ``Theodore Rex,'' by Mr. Edmund Morris. He is \ndescribing the United States of America at the turn of the century, 100 \nyears ago: The United States could consume only a fraction of what it \nproduced.\n\n       More than half the world's cotton, corn, copper, and oil \n     flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one third \n     of all steel, iron, silver, and gold. Current advertisements \n     in British magazines gave the impression that the typical \n     Englishman woke to the ring of an Ingersoll alarm, shaved \n     with a Gillette razor, combed his hair with Vaseline tonic, \n     buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried downstairs for Quaker Oats, \n     California Figs, and Maxwell House Coffee, commuted in a \n     Westinghouse tram (body by Fisher), rose to his office in an \n     Otis elevator, and worked all day with his Waterman pen under \n     the efficient glare of Edison lightbulbs. ``It only \n     remains,'' one Fleet Street wag suggested, ``for us to take \n     American coal to New Castle.''\n\n  Behind the joke lay real concern: The United States was already \nsupplying\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nbeer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, and oranges to Valencia.\n  Now, instead of that Ingersoll alarm, we get that from Malaysia, \nKorea, or of course an expensive one from Switzerland. With respect to \nthe Gillette razor, it comes from either Mexico or China. With respect \nto the Arrow shirt, we have bought those shirts out of China. And \ninstead of the coffee, it is Brazilian or Colombian coffee. When they \nhave mentioned that Westinghouse tram, I took the Acela, the fast \nAmtrak train the other day to New York, and found out it was made in \nCanada. When I got to Penn Station, I was sniffed by the dog from \nCzechoslovakia. The police dogs have been so over bred in the United \nStates they have lost their smell propensities. So the dogs, now, for \nsecurity, are imported from Czechoslovakia.\n  Now we have lost the watches, the cameras, the electronics. We are \nabout to lose all the steel business and everything else. I could go \ndown the list. We don't produce anything much to export, export, export \nas the fast track, fast track, fast track crowd will have us.\n  The fact is, more than half of what we consume today is imported. The \nmajority of our consumption is imported articles, including furniture. \nI had to rebuild a house, and to my surprise I had to get furniture \nfrom the Philippines and Vietnam.\n  Yes, buy America, buy America. Well, I was a champion, still am, I \nhope, of trying to buy America, but I used to represent a bunch of \nautomobile dealers. I think it was 20 some years ago, when I bought an \nAmerican car, a Pontiac. I drove in front of my neighbor's place. He \nsaid:\n\n       How much did you pay for that car, Fritz?\n\n  I said:\n\n       I don't know, let me look at the sticker price.\n\n  As I looked at the sticker price--this was over 20 years ago it \nsaid--``Montreal, Canada.'' I had a foreign car. Why? Because \nautomobile production had already moved across the border to save $800 \nper health contract on each of its employees.\n  But the so-called high-tech industry was supposed to save us. That \nwas the motor of growth. We tried to point out in one of those debates \nduring the 1990s, here, in the last 10 years, when we had this \nwonderful growth, that it wasn't the motor of growth at all because 42 \npercent of Silicon Valley was on part-time, and one-third of the \nMicrosoft employees had to sue Microsoft in order to get benefits. That \nwas Senator Abraham, from Michigan, who was running around all over the \nChamber for immigration, immigration, immigration.\n  Why? Because you can get the Indian trade, Indian production, those \nexperts coming over from India and China at $30,000 a year, maybe \n$35,000 a year; they are just as good as any you could ever find in the \nUnited States of America. So they were cutting their costs. That is \nwhy. There was not any shortage, any need to retrain or everything else \nof that kind.\n  But let's complete the thought. We are in desperate circumstances. If \nI have to make one particular point, it is this: Your security as a \nnation rests, as it were, upon a three-legged stool. The first leg is \nthe values we have as a nation--our stand for individual rights, \ndemocracy, freedom--is known and respected around the world. The second \nleg, the military, is unquestioned. But the economic leg has been \nfractured, and intentionally so.\n  You see, after World War II we had the only industrial production. \nTrying to rebuild Europe and bring the Pacific rim to capitalism versus \ncommunism in that cold war, we sent over the Marshall Plan. We sent \nover the expertise, we sent over the technology and the equipment--and \nwe won. No one regrets it. Everyone is proud of it. We defeated them--\ncapitalism defeated communism in the cold war.\n  I testified back in the 1950s before the old Tariff Commission when \nTom Dewey, representing the Japanese, ran me around the hearing room \nsaying: Why don't you let these Third World countries make the shoes \nand the clothing and we will make the airplanes and the computers?\n  Our problem is they make the shoes, the clothing, the airplanes, the \ncomputers, and everything else. Our manufacturers, our industrial \ngiants, learned of this moving their manufacturing offshore to a lower \nwage country. As you and I sit here in the Senate, talking about the \nenvironment and our standard of living and safety and otherwise, before \nyou can open up Nelson Manufacturing, you have to have a minimum wage, \nclean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant \nclosing notice, parental leave, safe working place, safe machinery--I \ncould go on and on.\n  You can go down for 90 cents an hour to Mexico and have none of those \nrequirements. You are guaranteed a profit. If your competition goes, \nyou have to go or go bankrupt.\n  So what is the problem? The problem is that they have all joined \ntogether, as I have described, to move the jobs out of the country, \nwhereas you and I, as public servants, have the job of trying to create \njobs.\n  I can see the President now, after 9-11, saying: What can we do with \nthis crisis we are in? Take a trip, go to Disney World with your \nfamily, live normally--whatever.\n  I will tell you what we can do: Create a job. Give your neighbor a \njob. That is why I am on the floor of the Senate, trying to hold up \nthis fast track so we can listen and learn just exactly what is in it.\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution says that the Congress--not \nthe President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress of the United \nStates--shall regulate trade or foreign commerce. We are abdicating our \nresponsibility. It is a fix. The agreement is made downtown on K Street \nand with the White House and their minions. That is what happens. The \ninterests that come to their Representatives in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate are wasting their time. The Senators and \nthe House Members have nothing to do with it. It is a done deal at the \ntime it is proposed, when they make these lousy agreements that \ncontinue to drain the United States of its economic strength.\n  Other than draining us of our economic strength in that fashion, with \na fixed vote, we ought to be on the floor of the Senate debating, if \nyou please, the significance.\n  Henry Ford, at the time he put on mass production, said: I want to \nmake sure my employees make enough money to buy the article they are \nproducing--so they could buy that car they were making. As a result, he \nstarted the benefits which resulted in the middle class. The labor \nmovement over 100 years now has had difficulty developing and thereby \nholding on to these particular improvements to our standard of living, \nto health care, to different other benefits of that kind that we have \nnow in the production contract that has created the middle class, or \nthe strength of democracy itself.\n  What I am fearful of is we are going the way of England. At the end \nof World War II, they told the press: Don't worry, instead of a nation \nof brawn, we will be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products, \nwe will provide services. Instead of creating wealth, we will handle it \nand be a financial center.\n  England has generally gone to hell in an economic handbasket. They \nhave the haves and the have-nots. The middle class disappears, and \ndowntown London is an amusement park.\n  That is exactly the road we are on. We have to get off that highway. \nWe have to be competitive. We have to understand the word ``trade'' \nmeans just that--something for something, not aid, and not developing \nit so that we have, as was said on the floor, something that is \nimmoral.\n  I heard my distinguished colleague from Florida say it was immoral \nfor us to go along with these countries, and to even backtrack or hold \nthe line with respect to Andean trade--that we owe them a duty to \ndevelop it. We all want to develop everything. But you can go forward \nand develop and develop until you become underdeveloped, which is our \npredicament today. Debt overseas stirs up trouble at home.\n  There is an article in Business Week that I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n                   [From Business Week, May 6, 2002]\n\n                 Debt Overseas Stirs Up Trouble at Home\n\n               (By James C. Cooper and Kathleen Madigan]\n\n       The world economies are finally mounting a recovery from \n     last year's slump. Even the latest word on Japan is a bit \n     more upbeat. The reason, of course, is the upturn in the U.S. \n     economy. The U.S. led the world into a downturn that hit \n     different regions with varying impact, and it will be the \n     locomotive for the recovery.\n       But therein lies a problem. U.S. financial obligations to \n     the rest of the world are once again on the rise as America \n     grows ever more dependent on foreign capital to finance its \n     growth. Back in March, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan noted that over the past six years, about 40% of \n     the increase in the U.S. capital stock was financed by \n     foreign investment, a pattern that will require an ever-\n     larger flow of interest payments going out to foreigners. \n     ``Countries that have gone down this path invariably have run \n     into trouble,'' said Greenspan, ``and so would we.''\n       Greenspan was highlighting the fact that the gap between \n     what an economy consumes and what it produces cannot continue \n     to widen indefinitely. At some point, foreigners come to the \n     belief that either the country's overconsumption requires a \n     policy adjustment, or that investment opportunities elsewhere \n     begin to look more attractive.\n       The most important result of this shift is the softening of \n     the debtor nation's currency. For the U.S., a weaker dollar \n     won't be a problem if the adjustment occurs slowly and \n     orderly. However, currency markets rarely move that way. And \n     any sharp change in the dollar's value could wreak havoc in \n     the financial markets as well as portend a higher level of \n     inflation as the price of imports begins to rise. \n     Consequently, the U.S.'s mounting external debt is clearly \n     the most crucial structural problem facing the economy. And \n     unlike other recent economic troubles, there may be no easy \n     way out.\n       Typically, a recession helps narrow the trade deficit. But \n     last year's slump was anything but typical, and the U.S. \n     external imbalance did not improve much. Now, renewed growth \n     in U.S. demand, coupled with the potent buying power of the \n     U.S. dollar, is drawing in imports by the boatload (chart), \n     which once again means the U.S. trade deficit is widening \n     sharply. The January and February increase in imported goods \n     was the largest two-month rise in two decades.\n       The trade gap is the main component of the current-account \n     deficit, which is the broadest measure of U.S. financial \n     obligations to other countries. After last year's respite, \n     the external debt is starting to mount up anew. Last year's \n     current-account gap hit 4.1% of gross domestic product, and \n     it could reach 5% by the end of 2002. That would be the \n     largest rate in the industrialized world and larger than in \n     many emerging-market nations.\n       Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized \n     countries informally voiced concern about the U.S. current-\n     account problem in Washington on Apr. 20 during the spring \n     meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World \n     Bank. Europe, in particular, expressed worries that the \n     imbalance could eventually put the dollar, financial markets, \n     and U.S. and world growth at risk.\n       One solution would be a gradual weakening in the dollar. \n     But stemming the dollar's rise has proved difficult. Even \n     during the official recession months of 2001, the broad \n     trade-weighted value of the dollar continued to rise (chart). \n     And while last year's economic slump was much worse in the \n     U.S. than in Europe, the dollar remains slightly stronger vs. \n     the euro, compared with this time last year.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have a $400 billion deficit in the \nbalance of trade. We have a horrendous budget deficit of $168 billion. \nWe are in the red. Even after all the money came in on April 15, we are \nstill in the red by $168 billion. We are going to be around $300 \nbillion to $350 billion in the red by the end of September. That is our \nfiscal deficit.\n  We are not paying the bills. We are cutting taxes. We are running \naround saying we ought to make permanent the temporary tax cuts, which \nof course cost us another $4 trillion, and we are wondering why we have \na deficit. In a similar fashion, we ought to be aware that we are in \ncompetition when we talk about trade.\n  Let me refer to just one little bit of history because you can't \nfault our globalization and trading partners. I have been in the game. \nIn 1960, as South Carolina's governor, I took a trade mission to Latin \nAmerica and to Europe. Today, we have 117 German plants in South \nCarolina. I will never forget calling on Michelin in downtown Paris in \nJune of 1960 to come to America. Now, they have about 11,000 employees \nand 4 big facilities. I called upon Bowater in London. Now the Bowater \nheadquarters are in Greenville, SC. We believe in trade, and we believe \nin development. I have to pay particular attention at this time to jobs \nin the United States.\n  That is what we did in the earliest days. We had just won our freedom \nwhen our friends in the mother country said: We will trade with the \nfledgling little United States of America with what it produces best, \nand England would trade with us what England produced best. Free trade, \nfree trade, the doctrine of comparison advantage, as written by David \nRicardo.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote a little booklet, A Report on Manufactures. \nIt was Hamilton and Madison who wrote our Federalist Papers. Hamilton \nis one of the most disregarded former Treasury Secretaries with a \nmagnificent history of having built this industrial giant, the United \nStates of America.\n  He countered to the Brits in that particular little booklet--I will \nnot read it, but I will get a copy and put it in the Record during the \ndebate--he told the Brits: Bug off. He said: We are not going to remain \nyour colony shipping to you our coal, our timber, our rice, our cotton, \nour indigo, our iron ore, and import from England the manufactured \nproducts. We will become a nation state by developing our own \nmanufacturing capacity.\n  As a result, on July 4, 1789, the second bill Congress passed was a \nprotectionist measure, a tariff bill on various articles. We began the \nUnited States with protectionism.\n  When the Transcontinental Railroad was being built, they said: We can \nget the steel from England to build the railroad. President Lincoln \nsaid: No, not at all. We are going to build up our own steel mills. \nWhen we get through, we will not only have the Transcontinental \nRailroad but we will have the steel capacity.\n  Lincoln provided protectionism for steel; Roosevelt for agriculture; \nand Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, provided protectionism for oil with \nimport quotas on oil. We built this industrial giant, the United States \nof America, with protectionism.\n  Don't go around here with these silly childish pollsters saying: Yes, \nyou have to be for free trade, free trade. They do not know anything \nabout it. They know nothing about the economy. They know nothing about \nthe creation of jobs. They have never been in the business of trying to \ncreate jobs and bringing industrial expansion to your State and to this \ncountry. They just do not know. They automatically ask to be given free \ntrade, free trade. The truth of the matter is that we have to put in a \ncompetitive trade policy.\n\n  Since I mentioned deficits, I would be glad if I could get a \ncosponsor or another vote in this body to put on a value-added tax. \nThese are serious times. During every moment of the history of the \nUnited States of America in war, we paid for the war. We put on special \ntax and revenue provisions to pay for the war.\n  Now we have a President who comes and says: We are at war. We are \ngoing to have to run deficits. And, incidentally, the war will never \nend.\n  What kind of leadership is that? I would put on a value-added tax and \nsay: Pay for that war. Get the deficits down. If anybody within the \nsound of my voice wants to help cosponsor it, let me know. I have put \nit in before at least two-times. I have thought it through thoroughly. \nOne of the biggest disadvantages we have is we are the only \nindustrialized nation that does not have that tax.\n  How does that work to our disadvantage?\n  If I manufacture this desk in the United States of America, in \nWashington, I have to pay all the different taxes. If I am over in \nVirginia, or in Maryland, I pay the State taxes, the corporate taxes, \nthe personal income taxes, and I ship it to Europe and to downtown \nParis. They will put on a 17-percent value-added tax.\n  In contrast, if I manufacture that desk in Europe, in Paris, they \nwill put on a 17-percent value-added tax, but they rebate it when it \nleaves the border and is exported to Washington, DC. It is a given. The \nvalue-added taxes are rebated at the border. That is a big advantage \nwhich all of the trading partners have with us.\n  If we are going to get serious about fast track and Andean trade, I \nam not particularly interested in a copout.\n  Let's remove that 17-percent disadvantage immediately and pay for the \ngovernment we are giving the people of the United States of America \nhere this year.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  Yes, by the end of September we are going to spend some $300 billion \nmore than we take in. We can pay for it. We always have, but not under \nthe leadership here. Everything is: Let's have more loss of the \nrevenues. Let's run up the debt, the current accounts deficit and debt, \nthe trade deficit, and the fiscal deficit of the United States of \nAmerica. It is a tragic thing. But we could easily get that done.\n  Now, those competing nations say: Look, don't give me this \nenvironment stuff. Don't give me this label stuff. There is no chance \nof putting on the label and environmental protections, say the \nMexicans, as we have here in the United States. That is an advantage. \nAs long as those people suffer, that is a disadvantage as we see it, \nbut that is an advantage to them, and they are going to continue so \nthey can build up themselves economically and strong just as the United \nStates of America did in its earliest days.\n  We did not even pass the income tax until 1913. We financed our \nentire Government with tariffs and protectionism. But we run around now \nin the 21st century: free trade, free trade, that we can't have any \nincrease in taxes or pay the bill.\n  It's a very peculiar thing. If I run for Governor of South Carolina, \nI have to go all over the State and promise that I will pay the bill. \nIf I run for the U.S. Senate in the same State, I run all over the same \nState promising I will not pay the bill. It is the same people, but \nthat is the way the pollsters have conditioned it, and that is the way \nthe media has covered that particular predicament. They have no idea. \nYes, David Broder, the pre-eminent columnist, pointed out over the \nweekend how all the Governors and all the mayors all over the country \nare having to cut educational budgets, or else lose their credit \nratings. If they lose their credit ratings, then they get no \ndevelopment, and then they even again lose more revenues or income from \ntheir different taxes. So they are having to cut back.\n  But we up here in Washington are all running for reelection, saying: \nWe will pay. Let's make the tax cut permanent. Let's lose another $4 \ntrillion. We don't care. By the way, there is a war on. We are going to \nhave deficits. So sui pig. Everybody come. Anybody who wants anything, \nwe have the money. We will just print it. And with respect to the \neconomy, we can forget about jobs.\n  Let me, now that I have a good friend in the Senate Chamber, talk \nabout the Washington solution because I have some other issues to talk \nabout. But we have tomorrow and the next day and the next day.\n  Let's do it Washington's way. Washington says: Now you have to get \nwith globalization and high tech and retrain and retrain. That was Mao \nTse-tung, if I remember correctly. We are getting to be like China with \nMao. And we are going to reeducate.\n  Well, let's say, down in Andrews, SC, where 40 years ago an Oneida \nplant came to the State of South Carolina to make T-shirts, now has to \nclose. At the time of their closing, what they had was 487 employees. \nAnd the average age of the employees was 47 years of age. And then it \nis tomorrow morning and we have done it Washington's way. They are \nreeducated, they are retrained, they are now high tech, and we have 487 \nexpert computer operators.\n  I ask, are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator or a \n21-year-old computer operator? Are you going to take on the retirement \ncosts for that 47-year-old, and take on the health costs for that 47-\nyear-old, or are you going to cancel that on the books and take on the \n21-year-old? The answer is obvious. Those people are stuck down there.\n\n  Down in Spartanburg, where we have a new BMW plant, unemployment was \n3.2-percent last year. It is now at 6.1-percent. And in the surrounding \ncounties, it is 11-percent, 12-percent, even 14-percent.\n  With NAFTA, we were going to create jobs, solve the immigration \nproblem, and do away with the drug problem. It was going to be the \nfinest thing since sliced bread. But instead of getting 200,000 jobs, \nwe have lost 1.3 million manufacturing jobs. That is from the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics.\n  The drug problem has gotten worse, killing so many people. The \nimmigration problem has gotten worse, to such a point that now we are \npassing legislation and breaking up the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. I think the House is on track. We have to do something about \nimmigration laws, and everything else of that kind.\n  In little South Carolina, since NAFTA we have lost 53,900 textile \njobs alone. We did not create jobs. And you put my State into poverty \nand into welfare. And I take no comfort in the idea that now we are \ngoing to pass trade adjustment assistance like it is just a little \ntemporary thing. The United States of America is going out of business. \nWe are on the road, as England, of the haves and the have nots. And we \nare not going to be creating anything in manufacturing or producing \nanything to export.\n  So that is the trouble for the lethargic economy. It is not consumer \nconfidence. It is not just the manufacturing because there is no \nmanufacturing to boil up. You watch it. This recession downtime is \ngoing to last the rest of this year, and into next year, until we get a \nhold of ourselves and start rebuilding America.\n  Yes. When people ask what we should do as a result of 9-11, instead \nof President Bush saying, we should take a trip with our kids, getting \nour families to go to Disney World, let's give our neighbor a job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator state whether he is speaking \nin support or in opposition to the cloture motion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nOhio yield for a question.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator speaking in support or in \nopposition to the cloture motion?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is speaking in favor of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized following Senator DeWine's presentation for a period of 25 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask that my time be taken off the time \nof those in favor of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be subtracted.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the trade debate in the Senate gets \nunderway, I rise to talk about some of the important issues involved in \nthis debate and the vital role trade plays in our Nation's foreign \npolicy and, really, in the health of our overall economy.\n  The trade legislation before us represents a tremendous opportunity, \nan opportunity for the United States to demonstrate its leadership in \nhemispheric and world trade. The sad fact is that over the last decade, \nthe United States has not led in this area. Of the more than 130 \nbilateral and free trade agreements worldwide, the United States is \nparty to just three. The European Union, on the other hand, has free \ntrade agreements with 27 countries. Mexico, the United States and my \nhome State of Ohio's second leading trade partner, has negotiated 25 \nagreements in the past 8 years--25 compared to our 3. Quite simply, we \nhave underutilized trade as a tool in foreign policy; I believe to the \ndetriment of our Nation and our neighbors within the Western \nHemisphere.\n  It is in our national interest to be surrounded by stable \ndemocracies. When we trade with our Latin American neighbors, we are \nhelping them economically, which in turn helps maintain internal \nstability, peace, and democratic reform.\n  It is also beneficial to the United States to trade within our \nhemisphere because if we don't, other nations and their businesses will \ntake our markets. No country is waiting for us to act\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nfirst. In the end, the longer we wait to pursue more free trade \nopportunities in our hemisphere and around the globe, the more we stand \nto lose.\n  Take, for example, my home State of Ohio. The future of our economy \nis linked in part at least to our ability to send our products \noverseas. When given the chance, Ohio's business men and women and \nOhio's farmers can and do compete effectively on the world stage. Just \nlisten to these figures: Ohio exported more than $28 billion worth of \nmanufactured goods. In fact, one in every five manufacturing jobs in \nthe State is tied to exports. In most years, one-third to one-half of \nOhio's major cash crops in the agricultural field--corn, wheat, \nsoybeans--is found in markets and meals outside our own country.\n\n  Look beyond Ohio to our entire hemisphere. With a combined gross \ndomestic product of more than $10 trillion, which encompasses 800 \nmillion people, trade with our hemispheric neighbors represents vast \nopportunities.\n  These are opportunities we simply must not ignore. Right now, Europe, \nAsia, and Canada are all securing their economic fortunes throughout \nLatin America by trading with the Mercosur, a powerful trading block \nconsisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. As of now, the \nMercosur countries are the EU's largest trading partners. Two-way trade \nbetween the EU and the Mercosur totaled $43 billion in the year 2000. \nThat is compared to $38 billion from the United States in the Mercosur. \nThe EU currently imports five times more from the Mercosur than the \nUnited States does. Between 1990 and 1998, the total value of trade \nflows between the Mercosur and the EU increased almost 125 percent.\n  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the EU is not going to sit \nidle and let the United States gain much of a new market share in this \nregion. In fact, just last Friday, in Brussels, the EU was working to \nfinalize a free trade agreement with Chile. Earlier this month, the EU \nset out its strategy for negotiating new economic partnerships with \nAfrica, the Caribbean, and Pacific countries. And as we speak, the EU's \ntrade commissioner is in Mexico addressing the EU's relationship with \nMexico, almost 2 years after the free trade agreement they entered into \nwent into effect.\n  This is the hemisphere in which we live. Those should be our markets. \nTo lose them through neglect would be a truly shameful outcome for our \ncountry.\n  The bill before us this afternoon, the Andean Trade Preference Act, \nwould renew but also enhance our commitment to helping the Andean \nregion: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It would help them, but \nit also would help us. It would help them to develop economic \nalternatives, for example, to drug crop production. The Andean \nPreference Act expired on December 4, 2001. The law provides \npreferential, mostly duty-free treatment on selected U.S. imports from \nthe region.\n  The countries of the Andean region certainly need our help, and we \nneed their help. For the past 10 years, the Andean Trade Preference Act \nhas helped the United States and these four countries develop \nlegitimate, strong, and expanding commercial ties. Between 1991 and \n1999, total two-way trade nearly doubled between our countries.\n  During this same time period, U.S. exports grew 65 percent, and U.S. \nimports from these countries increased by 98 percent.\n  In 1999, a severe economic recession in the region did, in fact, curb \nU.S. exports, but U.S. imports continued to grow by 17 percent. U.S. \nimports to Colombia during this same time increased 155 percent since \nATPA was enacted. The Colombian flower industry is a prime example of \nhow U.S. trade policy can support important economic benefits both in \nColombia and here at home and at the same time provide jobs and income \nto people so they do not feel the necessity to become involved in the \ndrug trade.\n  In 1965, Colombia exported just $20,000 worth of flowers to the \nUnited States. Today, these exports total nearly $600 million. The \nflower industry generates 75,000 direct jobs in Colombia, jobs that \noffer year-round stability and health and retirement benefits, not to \nmention a legitimate economic alternative to elicit drug production.\n  The Colombian industry also directly generates 7,000 U.S. jobs. \nIndirectly, even more jobs are created, with U.S. supermarkets \nemploying more than 24,000 people in their flower departments, and U.S. \nflower shops employing nearly 125,000 people.\n  We also have substantially increased our exports to the Andean \nregion. Under ATPA, our exports have gone up by 84 percent, to $6.6 \nbillion in the year 2000.\n  Despite these gains, ATPA must be expanded. NAFTA and the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative have changed the playing field and have created a \ncompetitive disadvantage for Andean countries. For example, most \nCaribbean apparel enters the United States duty free, while Andean \napparel enters with a 14-percent duty. We also must remember that ATPA \nis about more than just trade. This is an issue of national security.\n  The stability of the Western Hemisphere is at stake. Open markets are \nabsolutely vital for developing nations to overcome poverty and create \nopportunity. Fragile economies place peace and democracy at risk.\n  With aid, with trade, and with democracy, we can foster peace among \nour neighbors. It is in our national interest to pursue an aggressive \ntrade agenda in the Western Hemisphere, to combat growing threats and \npromote prosperity. Free markets and open trade are the best weapons \nagainst poverty, against disease, against tyranny and, yes, against the \ndrug dealers.\n  For example, if Africa, Asia, and Latin America were each to increase \ntheir share of world exports by just 1 percent, it would lift 128 \nmillion people out of poverty, with all the consequences that would \nhave. Tariff barriers on products from the Third World are more than \nfour times higher than those encountered by richer nations. Such \nbarriers cost poor countries approximately $100 billion a year. That is \ntwice as much as these nations receive in foreign aid. Tariff barriers \non products from the Third World are more than four times higher than \nthose encountered by richer nations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of renewing \nand expanding the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act. It is the \nright thing to do for our neighbors and for our businesses at home. It \nis the right thing for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3489-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3489-S3490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HIV/AIDS IN OUR HEMISPHERE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss a \ncritically important issue in our hemisphere--the growing problem of \nHIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n  Today, there are an estimated 420,000 individuals living with HIV/\nAIDS in the Caribbean, and another 1.4 million living with the disease \nin Latin America. In Haiti alone, roughly 1 out of every 10 people has \nHIV/AIDS.\n  Yet despite these staggering numbers and despite the fact the highest \nprevalence of HIV/AIDS--outside of Sub-Saharan Africa--exists right in \nour own backyard, this region of the world is often forgotten, and the \npeople who suffer there because of AIDS are often forgotten. While, \nunderstandably, much attention has been focused on the great tragedy \ncaused by the disease in Sub-Saharan Africa--and we should never forget \nit--I think it is also important that we also focus our efforts on \ncombating this disease in our own hemisphere.\n  That is why I want to call attention to a historic, day-long meeting \nheld just last week in Georgetown, Guyana. While it received very \nlittle attention in the media, on April 20, senior U.S. and Caribbean \nhealth officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy \nThompson, met in Guyana to sign a new Pan-Caribbean agreement against \nHIV/AIDS.\n  I commend Secretary Thompson, Secretary Powell, and President Bush \nfor their leadership and follow through in making this vision a \nreality. Last week's meeting and subsequent agreement represents an \nunprecedented new partnership to fight the disease in the region. As \npart of this new agreement, the U.S. and Caribbean nations have pledged \nto improve collaborative efforts to make sure people living with HIV/\nAIDS, and those at risk, have good\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\naccess to prevention and treatment services. As Secretary Thompson \nsaid:\n\n       This will be an equal partnership--a sharing of technical \n     know-how and experiences.\n\n  As part of this partnership, Secretary Thompson has pledged greater \nin-country collaboration with officials from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, and the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration. These efforts will complement recently announced \ninitiatives by the U.S. Agency for International Development to provide \nalmost $162 million in new funding over the next 5 years to help \ncountries in the Americas and worldwide expand HIV/AIDS prevention, \npatient care, and HIV/AIDS mitigation programs. This is in addition to \nthe $20 million the United States is currently providing in HIV/AIDS \nfunding to Latin America and the Caribbean under the Bush \nadministration's Third Border Initiative. These are all important steps \nin the right direction toward developing an integrated approach to \ncombat this devastating disease.\n  I urge my colleagues to share my support for these initiatives and to \nwork with me to secure greater U.S. contributions for these \ninternational efforts in the future--through the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, as well as other bilateral assistance programs.\n  To borrow Secretary Colin Powell's words:\n\n       Our response to this crisis must be no less comprehensive, \n     and no less relentless, than the AIDS pandemic itself.\n\n  Mr. President, this is something that we need to work harder on in \nthe United States, in Africa, in the Caribbean, and throughout the \nworld--wherever people suffer from AIDS. I thank the Chair, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3490-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3490-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak about fast-track trade \nauthority, which is now known by the euphemism ``trade promotion \nauthority.''\n  Before I do that, I want to talk for a moment about what is happening \nwith respect to trade with Cuba. Since we are on the subject of trade, \nthere is something happening with Cuba about which I believe I must \nalert the Senate.\n  As you know, a wide majority in both the U.S. Senate and the House \nhas agreed that we should not use food as a weapon and that the 40-year \nembargo with Cuba--at least with respect to food and medicine--should \nbe loosened. So by a vote of the House and of the Senate, we are now \nable to sell food to Cuba.\n  Yet under current law, the Cubans are not allowed to purchase food \nfrom the United States on credit. They cannot borrow from a private \nlender. They must pay cash. Following the hurricane in Cuba, Cuba is \nbuying American grain and agricultural products to the tune of $70 \nmillion, but they have to pay cash and run the transaction through a \nFrench bank in order to buy commodities from American farmers. This is \njust bizarre.\n  The head of a group called Alimport, which is the organization in \nCuba that purchases food for the Cuban Government, was invited to this \ncountry by farm leaders. His name is Pedro Alvarez. He was intending to \ncome here--including to my State of North Dakota--and asked for a visa \nto do that. He was intending to purchase additional food from our \ncountry--and to pay cash. A visa was granted, but then the State \nDepartment abruptly reversed course and decided to revoke the visa. The \nState Department said: No, we don't want somebody from Cuba coming in \nto buy food or commodities from American farmers. When we called the \nState Department to ask them why they decided to revoke the visa to \nhave the head of Cuban imports come into this country, they said: It is \nnot our policy to encourage the sale of food to Cuba.\n  Now, I find it just byzantine that our State Department would say: \nNo, we don't want the head of the Cuban agency that purchases \nagricultural commodities to come to our country to purchase those \ncommodities and, therefore, we will revoke his visa.\n  When will those who take that position wake up and understand that \nusing food as a weapon is merely shooting ourselves in the foot?\n  I have now written a letter to Pedro Alvarez in Alimport and said: I \nam inviting you to this country; a U.S. Senator is inviting you to this \ncountry. I would like you to come to America; I would like you to come \nto North Dakota; come to North Dakota and buy wheat from our wheat \nfarmers and buy dried beans from those who plant dried beans.\n  I wrote a letter to the State Department saying: You have a \nresponsibility to give these people visas to come here.\n  I do not know what on Earth the State Department is thinking. I have \ntalked to someone at the State Department who indicated that the matter \nis being reviewed. I said: Can you tell me who decided to revoke the \nvisas? Who decided that farmers in America should be the victims of \nthis foreign policy nonsense? Who was it? Who made the phone calls? I \nwant to know who said that this is political, this isn't trade policy, \nand the politics persuade us we ought to revoke visas from someone from \nCuba who wants to come to this county and buy wheat, dried beans, \napples, and other commodities from the United States.\n  I just do not understand why we have people in this country who still \nthink that way. We ought never use food and medicine as a weapon. We \nhave done it for 40 years with respect to Cuba. We can sell food to \nChina. That is a Communist country. We can sell food to Vietnam. That \nis a Communist country. But for 40 years we have said no, you cannot \nsell food to Cuba.\n  We loosened that restriction. Cubans can now buy our food, and now we \nhave the spectacle of the State Department deciding to revoke visas \nthey already approved for people from Cuba who want to come to this \ncountry and buy from American farmers. That is unfair to our farmers. \nIt is another embargo.\n  Cuba bought $1 billion worth of food last year. The Europeans are \nselling food to them, and the Canadians are selling food to them. We \nhave sold them some now, but judging by the behavior of the State \nDepartment, it appears they do not want us to sell food to Cuba, \ndespite the fact the Congress has already made the judgment that such \nsales should be lawful.\n  I intend tomorrow to press this case once again at the State \nDepartment, and I hope they will change their mind and make a rational \ndecision, one that is in concert with what the Congress has already \ndecided, both the House and the Senate.\n  Let me turn to the trade issue of fast track for a few moments. I see \nsome colleagues in the Chamber who wish to speak. I will not speak as \nlong as I had intended. They will want the opportunity to have a \nportion of this time as well.\n  Let me quickly put up a chart showing an excerpt from ``Inside U.S. \nTrade,'' a publication on international trade. It quotes U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Zoellick speaking to a business group in Chicago. Mr. \nZoellick described lawmakers and lobbyists who oppose a trade promotion \nauthority bill sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman \nBill Thomas as ``xenophobes and isolationists.''\n  The Trade Ambassador says those who oppose fast track are xenophobes \nand isolationists. This really fits the way this thoughtless debate \nalways plays out on trade. Instead of it being a thoughtful debate \nabout what America's real trade policy ought to be to benefit this \ncountry, it turns quickly into a thoughtless debate by those who say \nthere are only two sides: Those who support free trade, globalization, \nexpanded trade, and have a world view that will allow them to see well \nover the horizon and understand the world much better than others, and \nthose who are just xenophobic, isolationist stooges. That is how this \ndebate is characterized: Those who think and those who do not.\n\n  There is an old saying: You ought not ever buy anything from somebody \nwho is out of breath. There is a kind of breathless quality to this \ndebate about fast track: It just has to be fast track; if it is not \nfast track, we cannot pursue international trade agreements.\n  That, of course, is total nonsense. We did not give Bill Clinton fast \ntrack\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nwhen he was President. I did not support giving him fast-track trade \nauthority when he was President, and I do not support giving George W. \nBush fast-track authority either.\n  Yet in the Clinton Presidency they did negotiate trade agreements. \nHow did they do that? They do not need fast track to negotiate trade \nagreements. Fast track is simply a mechanism by which the Congress \nsays: Wait a minute, before you negotiate in secret the next trade \nagreement, let us handcuff our arms behind our back; please let us do \nthat; then you negotiate in secret; and when you come back, we wear \nhandcuffs so we will not be able to offer even one amendment to this \ntrade agreement you have negotiated in secret. That is what fast track \nis.\n  There are a good many Members of Congress who sign up. I do not know, \nthere is some kind of masochistic urge in trade, I guess, to say: Let's \ndo this, let's tie our hands, and then allow someone else to negotiate \nin secret.\n  Here is what the Constitution says about the Congress. Article I, \nsection 8, says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations. . . .\n\n  It does not say the President. It does not say the U.S. Trade \nAmbassador. It does not say some unnamed trade negotiators. The \nConstitution says:\n  The Congress shall have Power--\n  The word is ``power.''\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations. . . .\n\n  In recent decades--three decades, in fact--we have had Presidents \nnegotiate just five trade agreements under fast track: GATT, United \nStates-Israel, United States-Canada, NAFTA, and the WTO.\n  I want to show a chart showing the effects of one of these \nagreements. We gave fast-track trade authority to negotiate a trade \nagreement with Canada and Mexico. Prior to that, we had a small trade \nsurplus with Mexico. Of course, after this agreement was done, it \nturned into a huge deficit. Prior to that, we had a modest deficit with \nCanada. After a trade agreement was negotiated with Canada, the deficit \nexploded. We turned a trade relation with Mexico that was a positive \nrelationship into a negative relationship, and with Canada we had an \nexplosion of the deficit.\n  I thought it would be interesting to take a look at a chart that \nshowed what happened to our trade deficits through all of these trade \nagreements. Every time we have another agreement, the trade deficit \ngoes up, up, and way up.\n  One might ask: What is the difference? The difference is this line \nmeans jobs in this country, good jobs, manufacturing jobs, and this \nline suggests an erosion of the manufacturing sector in this country.\n  Under fast-track trade authority, which Congress has given to some \nPresidents, the major export has been jobs. The Economic Policy \nInstitute suggests somewhere over 3 million jobs have been lost \ncomparing prior to NAFTA and WTO and after NAFTA and WTO.\n  Some say: This is just a global economy, and let's just move goods \neverywhere, and whatever happens happens. They ignore the fact that in \nthis country, we have had people fight in the streets, we have had \npeople killed in the streets for the right to form unions. We had \npeople take to the streets to demand fair and safe workplaces. We had \npeople marching in the streets in this country dealing with child labor \nlaws. For 75 and 100 years, we have confronted all of these tough \nissues in the United States, and we have created an environment in \nwhich an employee has to have a safe workplace, be paid a decent wage, \na business cannot hire kids, cannot dump pollutants into the stream and \nthe air, and employees have a right to organize as a labor union.\n  Economists always remind us of the importance of comparative \nadvantage in determining what country gets to produce what products. \nBut should child labor be a comparative advantage in trade? The legal \nminimum age for child workers in Peru is 12 years old.\n  When someone takes the product of a 12-year-old, who works 12 hours a \nday and is paid 12 cents an hour, and ships it to Pittsburgh or Los \nAngeles or Denver or Fargo, and puts it on the store shelf, is that \nfair trade? Is that what we want American workers to compete with?\n  There are 3 million workers in Brazil under the age of 15. Fair \ncompetition? Or how about people making shoes for 24 cents an hour in \nIndonesia? Fair competition?\n  People say, well, America has to become competitive. Competitive with \nwhat? With 12-year-old kids making 12 cents an hour or 24 cents an \nhour? Is that the marketplace in which we describe fair trade \ncompetition?\n  Before we pass fast track, I would like to see a little bit of \nprogress by our trade officials to solve a few problems they have \ncreated recently. I am not asking for the Moon. I am saying before they \nrun off and, under fast track, negotiate new trade agreements, how \nabout doing something that stands up for this country's economic \ninterests? How about solving a few problems that have been created in \npast trade agreements?\n  I will talk first about Canadian wheat because that is a huge problem \nfor my state of North Dakota. We had a trade agreement with Canada. We \nallowed Canada to sell its wheat through a sanctioned monopoly called \nthe Canadian Wheat Board, which would be illegal in this country. It \nthen sends an avalanche of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain into this \ncountry, taking money right out of the pockets of our farmers. It goes \non year after year in a relentless way and no one stops it. Why? \nBecause the remedies to stop unfair trade have been emasculated in our \ntrade agreements.\n  We were promised with the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that this \nwould not happen, but it did. It not only happened and an avalanche of \nunfairly traded Canadian grain came down injuring our farmers, but when \nwe got to the bottom of it, we found out that our trade ambassador \nentered into a secret side agreement with Canada, and our negotiators \nrefused to tell the truth about it even in a committee hearing in the \nU.S. House of Representatives when asked directly about it.\n  This is what has happened with Canadian wheat exports in the United \nStates and U.S. wheat exports to Canada: a pail versus a thimble, but \nthat pail represents serious damage to U.S. farmers.\n  There are some other trade problems. I have spoken at great length \nabout beef in Europe. We have not been able to get most U.S. beef into \nEurope for 10 years because they say we use beef hormones. They portray \nour cows as having two heads over in Europe.\n  We took Europe to the WTO, the World Trade Organization. We took our \ncase to the WTO and we won. The WTO said, yes, Europe is wrong so you \ncan go ahead and exact some penalties with respect to Europe.\n  Do you want to know what we did? We were upset that Europe would not \nallow our beef in. We went to the WTO. The WTO said, yes, Europe is \nguilty. So the United States says, all right, what we are going to do \nis we are going to retaliate. We retaliated against European shipments \nto the United States of goose liver, truffles, and Roquefort cheese. \nNow that is enough to scare the devil out of an opponent; is it not? A \ntrading partner like Europe, we say they better watch it; we are going \nto slap them with goose liver, truffles, and Roquefort cheese? What \nkind of remedy is that? When Europe was upset about the recent steel \ndecision, they said, we are going to respond with tariffs on U.S. \nsteel, textiles, and citrus products.\n\n  How about Korean automobiles? Maybe we could ask our trade ambassador \nto fix that. I have gotten several letters from Korea recently because \nI have been talking about their automobile industry. Last year there \nwere 618,000 Korean automobiles shipped into the United States, Daewoos \nand Hyundais, into our marketplace. That is fine with me, but do you \nknow how many U.S. automobiles were shipped into Korea? We were able to \nsell 2,800 U.S. cars in Korea. For every 217 Korean cars sold in the \nU.S. marketplace, we were able to sell one in the country of Korea. \nWhy? Because Korea does not want U.S. cars in the marketplace. It is \nvery simple.\n  Is there somebody who will stand up and say this is unfair trade? \nBecause, after all, this represents a loss of good manufacturing jobs \nin our country, when there is that kind of trade imbalance.\n  Is there someone who will fix that problem? The beef problem with \nEurope? The grain problem with Canada?\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nOr how about wheat flour to Europe? Or eggs? Let me use eggs as an \nexample. We cannot get American eggs in the European marketplace. Do \nyou know why? Because American eggs are washed. They will not allow \nwashed American eggs into the European marketplace. So we do not have a \nmarket for American eggs. Pork chops to China, T-bone steaks to Tokyo--\nI will speak tomorrow at much greater length about a range of these \nissues.\n  I ask this question: Mr. President and Mr. Trade Ambassador and \nothers, you are so anxious to go negotiate a new trade agreement. How \nabout solving a few of the trade problems that have been created?\n  Brazil sends sugar to Canada. It is loaded on molasses, liquid \nmolasses, and sent into the United States. Molasses becomes the carrier \nfor sugar that could otherwise not enter under U.S. law. They ship it \ndown into Michigan, offload the sugar, send the molasses back to get \nanother load of Brazilian sugar to Canada, fundamentally undercutting \nour sugar program. In my judgment, it is an abrogation of fair trade. \nIt has been going on for years. Yet you cannot get anybody to do \nanything about it.\n  In the legislation that is going to come up on trade adjustment \nassistance, I believe that the molasses problem is being addressed by \nsome concerned members of the Senate. But the point is that we have \nchronic trade issues and that administrations do not do enough about \nthese problems.\n  We have an enforcement division down in the Commerce Department. We \nhave some enforcement in USTR. I have not seen the statistics lately, \nbut do you know how many people we have dealing with China and Japan? \nWe have eight people enforcing trade agreements with Japan, a country \nwith which we have a $60 billion to $70 billion trade deficit, and they \ncannot even tell us what the agreements are that we have with Japan, \nlet alone tell us whether they are enforcing them.\n  This country does not do right by its producers, farmers, \nmanufacturers, and others in the area of international trade. So we are \nnow requested by this administration to give them fast-track authority \nso they can negotiate another agreement somewhere in the world. I say \nthat we ought not give fast-track authority. I would not support it for \nPresident Clinton. I do not support it for this President.\n  I think it is time for us to stand up for this country's economic \ninterest. No, not build a wall, not keep goods out of our country. This \nis not about isolationism. This is about standing up for this country's \nmanufacturing sector and its workers, saying that we will compete any \ntime, anywhere, as long as the conditions of competition are fair, but \nwe demand fair trade.\n  One final point: I started by talking about Cuba. The revocation of \nthe visas that I described is about politics. It is not about trade \npolicy. It is about pointy-headed foreign policy.\n  For the first 25 years after the Second World War, our trade was \nalmost all foreign policy. We could compete anywhere in the world with \none hand tied behind our back. We were the biggest, the best, and the \nstrongest. In the second 25 years, things have gotten tougher. Our \ncompetitors are shrewd, tough, international competitors, and it is \ntime that our foreign policy stop being the dominant force in trade \npolicy. It is time our country stand up for its own economic interests \nand demand fair trade. We ought to do that before we embark on any \nnotion about fast-track authority for any President. That is in the \nbest interest of this country, in my judgment.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is in the Chamber. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, President Clinton used to brag--and I \nthink correctly--during the years he was President that some 20 million \njobs were created during his Presidency. Those are statistics that \nspeak for themselves.\n  In regard to this debate before the Senate, President Clinton said \nabout one-third of the jobs were created because of international \ntrade. Quite obviously, the last Democrat President talked about the \nimportance of trade. Jobs are created by trade. Those are jobs that pay \nvery good wages--13 to 18 percent higher than the national average. It \nis estimated 1 in 10 Americans, 12 million people, are employed in jobs \nrelated to goods and services.\n  The important issue of trade promotion authority is before the \nSenate. It has worked, as has already been correctly stated. Presidents \nsince President Ford have periodically have had trade promotion \nauthority. It has led to trade agreements passed by Congress. They are \nnow the law of the land.\n  When it was pointed out--correctly--that Congress has the power to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce, that is very true. But \nremember that Congress does not have the ability to negotiate with \nother countries--particularly 144 countries in the World Trade \nOrganization--in a way that could be considered an expeditious way of \nreaching an agreement.\n  We form a sort of contract with the President of the United States. \nThis is not just for Republicans and Republican Presidents. Republicans \nin this body tried to form such a contract with President Clinton in \nthe last administration, but his own party would not let him have this \nauthority. Trade promotion authority is a type of contract between the \nCongress and the President of the United States in which the President, \nin very precise ways, is given the authority by Congress to agree, on \nthe part of Congress, with goals that will be pursued at the \nnegotiating table.\n  This legislation will help achieve those goals. It establishes a \nformat for Congress to be consulted by the President of the United \nStates in every step of that process. Congress reviews the agreement \nthat the President brings it back. We have the last say. If we do not \npass it, it does not become law, and there is no agreement, no matter \nhow much the President negotiated with 143 other countries to bring \nthat agreement back to Congress.\n  We in Congress do not see trade promotion authority as Congress \ngiving away all its power over international trade to the President of \nthe United States. Not at all. We cannot do that without amending the \nConstitution. We don't intend to amend the Constitution to do that.\n  However, trade promotion authority is a type of contract with the \nPresident of the United States to negotiate for us because the Congress \nof the United States, as the legislative arm of our Government, is not \ncapable, with 535 men and women, of negotiating with 144 other \ncountries in the World Trade Organization, or with another 30-some \ncountries in the Western Hemisphere if you are talking about regional \nFTAA trade negotiations, or even on a bilateral basis negotiating with \nChile or with Singapore, which are in process now.\n  We want our President to be credible at the negotiating table. When \nthe President has Trade Promotion Authority, other countries, \nnegotiating with the United States, know the President is a credible \nnegotiator.\n  We have been told the United States loses so much when we negotiate. \nWe don't lose anything when the rest of the world's tariffs are way up \nhere and ours are much lower; we cannot go much lower. When we bring \nforeign tariffs down, even if we bring them just partway down and not \ndown to our low level, it is a win-win situation for the United States.\n\n  I quote Harvard economist Jeff Frankel, estimating that the economic \nbenefits of a successfully completed new round of WTO trade \nnegotiations would mean $7,000 per individual or, as we measure in this \ncountry, the unit of the family, about $28,000 for a family of four. \nThis estimate was even backed up by Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Alan Greenspan. He said before the Senate Finance Committee when \nhe testified last year on the importance of trade promotion authority \nto the President, that the estimates made by Jeff Frankel, were very \ncredible estimates.\n  As just one example of the advantage of a trade agreement to the \nUnited States, look at Caterpillar, located in several countries around \nthe world, but with its main operation in the United States. The \ncorporate headquarters is in the United States. I have an example of a \n$187,000 Caterpillar, model 140H, a motor grader tractor, made in \nAmerica. If shipped to Chile, it is slapped with $13,090 in tariffs and \nduties, or 7 percent of the tractor's cost because we do not have a \nfree trade agreement with Chile.\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n  That same tractor can be made in Brazil by a Caterpillar plant in \nBrazil and shipped to Chile with only a $3,740 tariff because Brazil \nhas some trade agreements with Chile. Obviously, not a free trade \nagreement but some agreements that reduce the tariff from 7 percent on \na tractor made in the United States to 2 percent.\n  If that same tractor is made in Canada, because Canada has a free \ntrade agreement with Chile, there are no tariffs whatsoever on that \nCaterpillar motor grader tractor made in Canada.\n  We have to ask ourselves, as Senators for the entire United States, \nwould you not rather have the Caterpillar tractor made in America and \nshipped to Chile than have it made in Canada or have it made in Brazil \nand shipped to Chile?\n  This decision is a no-brainer, Mr. President. We have seen so much \nadvancement in the rural economy since the process of reducing tariffs \nworldwide. Originally called GATT, now called the World Trade \nOrganization process, WTO for short, that process has been going on \nsince 1947. We ought to be satisfied with what world trade has done for \nAmerica, that it is good for America, it is good for the world, and \nthat if we are going to be in this business of having America's \nleadership continue as it is in the war against terrorism, but more \nbased upon our military prowess than anything else, but backed up by \neconomic strength, it seems to me if the President of the United States \ncan have trade promotion authority and continue to be the leader in \nreduction of world tariff trade barriers and nontariff trade barriers, \nas the United States has been between 1947 and 1994 when the authority \nran out, we are going to have an additional advantage--an additional \ntool for world leadership to use in pursuing peace sooner.\n\n  The other side of the coin is that if you are going to have an \nexpanding world population--which we all know is underway and is going \nto be underway for decades to come--you cannot have stagnant world \neconomic growth. More people with less material goods are only going to \nlead to social instability, political instability, and the opposite of \nworld peace.\n  An expanding world economic pie can only come through the reduction \nof trade barriers, and that only comes through this process of global \ntrade liberalization that in the WTO. That is the only way we are going \nto have an expanding world population with more people having more \nmaterial goods, more prosperity, and more social stability and \npolitical stability as well, and the peace that will come with it.\n  Even though during these weeks of debate on trade promotion authority \nwe are going to be talking about its economic benefits, and some other \npeople will be talking about the economic harm they see coming from \ntrade promotion authority, from my perspective it is not just an \neconomic issue. It is also an issue of expanding the world economic pie \nfor social stability, political stability, and eventually world peace.\n  Mr. President, I support cloture on the motion to proceed on one of \nthe four trade bills that will be before the Senate in the next several \nweeks. The one before us is the Andean Trade Act. This vote is far more \nthan a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed on the Andean bill. In \nthe next few days, starting with and moving beyond this vote, we may \nfinally take up other trade bills: trade promotion authority, trade \nadjustment assistance, the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, \nand trade adjustment assistance.\n  This vote is in reality a referendum on the future leadership of U.S. \ntrade policy. After months of delay, it is finally a long overdue \nacknowledgment of the Senate's important constitutional and political \nresponsibility for U.S. trade policy. As such, today is the start of \nthe most important legislative period on the Senate floor for America's \ntrade policy since trade negotiating authority for the President lapsed \nin April 1994.\n  It was in 1994 when a critical ingredient of American global \nleadership in trade policy was lost, trade promotion authority. As a \nresult, in the last 8 years the United States has been severely \nhandicapped in its ability to conduct major trade negotiations. Yes, we \nrecently concluded a free trade agreement with Jordan and we have \nstarted Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. That is the \nWestern Hemisphere regional free trade zone. We also have bilateral \nfree trade negotiation going on with Singapore and with Chile right \nnow.\n  We have been involved with three agreements in the last 6 years. The \nrest of the world has adopted 130 or more preferential trade \nagreements; 127 of which we were not a party to. That damages America's \ntrade interests.\n  The European Union has 27 preferential or special customs agreements \nwith other countries and is negotiating 15 more. Our international \ncompetitors, then, are clearly not waiting for the United States of \nAmerica while they negotiate and while we get our act together. We have \nbeen, for about 6 years now, maybe 8 years, trying to get our act \ntogether.\n\n  The lack of trade promotion authority is already affecting our \neffectiveness at the negotiating table in the Western Hemisphere \nnegotiations called the Free Trade Area of the Americas. I recently \ncommissioned a General Accounting Office study on the status of the \nFree Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. They found the Western \nHemisphere participants believed that the absence of the President's \ntrade promotion authority has thwarted the negotiations to the extent \nthat some countries are not willing to make the necessary concessions \nto move negotiations forward.\n  This lack of progress of the Free Trade Area of the Americas has \nenormous economic consequences for the United States. We currently sell \nless than 8 percent of our exported goods south of Mexico's southern \nborder--meaning Central and South America.\n  In terms of competitiveness in exports, we are underperforming in our \nown hemisphere. A successful conclusion to the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas talks will help us catch up, but the President needs trade \npromotion authority to make that happen.\n  The United States is currently pursuing new World Trade Organization \nnegotiations with 143 other nations in Geneva. These negotiations are, \nright now, underway. Our negotiators are meeting with their \ncounterparts in Geneva almost as we speak to try to hammer out \nprocedures for addressing the major issues in these important \nnegotiations, issues such as market access for America's farmers and \nranchers for all of our agricultural products. They are all on the \ntable, but without trade promotion authority, our negotiators have one \nhand tied behind their backs. That is something that before this debate \nis over I hope I can convince the Senator from North Dakota of--who \nspoke previous to me--that it is very important not to negotiate from a \nposition of disadvantage.\n  Right now, without trade promotion authority, do not have credibility \nat the negotiating table. We need credibility to set the agenda and to \ninfluence the scope and timing of these talks.\n  Without trade promotion authority, our foreign competitors will have \nthe upper hand. They will determine the scope and the timing of the \nWorld Trade Organization negotiations to their advantage--obviously not \nto the advantage of the United States.\n  Last Friday the Agriculture Coalition for Trade Promotion Authority, \nwhich represents more than 80 food and agricultural groups, sent a \nletter to congressional leaders. It was signed by 29 university \nagricultural economists. I will read from a portion of that letter:\n\n       . . . There is an important political dimension in all \n     trade negotiations, and without trade promotion authority, \n     the ability of the United States negotiators to press for \n     agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally \n     weakened. . . . Trade Promotion Authority is an indispensable \n     tool that U.S. trade officials need now to keep U.S. \n     agriculture on the path of prosperity and long-term economic \n     growth.\n\n  The individuals who signed that letter are some of the most \ndistinguished agricultural economists in our country. I am sure some of \nmy colleagues would recognize their names. I hope we hear their message \nvery clearly. I am suggesting it is wrong not to act on their advice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\n TPA Coalition Commends Letter to Congressional Leaders From Prominent \n                        Agricultural Economists\n\n       The Agricultural Coalition for Trade Promotion Authority \n     today commended the 29 university agricultural economists who \n     signed a letter in support of TPA that was sent Friday to \n     Congressional leaders. The letter, which will go to every \n     House and Senate member today, points out that without trade, \n     the U.S. farm economy would be in a desperate situation and \n     that without TPA, ``the ability of U.S. negotiators to press \n     for agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally \n     weakened.''\n       Following is the text of the letter. The Agriculture \n     Coalition for TPA includes more than 80 food and agriculture \n     groups dedicated to the passage of legislation granting the \n     president Trade Promotion Authority. It is co-chaired by the \n     National Pork Producers Council and Farmland Industries.\n                                                   April 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,\n     U.S. House of Representatives\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     U.S. House of Representatives\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Representative \n     Gephardt, and Mr. Speaker: We, the undersigned agricultural \n     economists from the nation's agricultural colleges, \n     universities and research institutions, strongly support \n     trade negotiations to advance U.S. agriculture's interests in \n     the global market.\n       Despite the frustrations some in the farm community voice \n     today about recent trade agreements, U.S. agriculture would \n     be substantially worse off had it not been for those \n     arrangements. The fall in exports resulting from the Asian \n     financial crisis and the unusual string of years of strong \n     global crop production would have been worse without the \n     access opportunities in Mexico and many other markets that \n     NAFTA and the Uruguay Round provided.\n       Clearly, there remain important tariff and subsidy \n     inequities that impede U.S. exports. Global food and \n     agriculture tariffs average 62 percent, while U.S. food and \n     agriculture tariffs average only 12 percent. But the only \n     practical way to deal with these problems is through the \n     multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade negotiations the \n     Administration has undertaken, and for which it must have \n     Trade promotion authority (TPA). While the regional and \n     bilateral trade initiatives currently under negotiation are \n     important, the most promising trade initiative for U.S. food \n     and agriculture producers is the ongoing multilateral World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.\n       To put the importance of trade and the need for \n     negotiations in perspective, it is worth pointing out that \n     the value of U.S. agricultural exports--now around $54 \n     billion--frequently tracks or exceeds the level of net farm \n     income each year. Without exports, farm and ranch income \n     would plummet.\n       The domestic U.S. market is, of course, the principal \n     destination for most of our farm output. However, the U.S. \n     population is only about 4 percent of the world's total. \n     Increased access to the other 96 percent, which can only be \n     accomplished through trade negotiations, would offer U.S. \n     producers another--and potentially enormous--outlet for our \n     high quality production.\n       As economists, we tend to view issues in terms of numbers: \n     the data that show that a substantial portion of our \n     production is exported, the strong recent growth in exports \n     of job-creating high value and processed agricultural \n     products, and the contribution exports make to the overall \n     farm economy. However, we also recognize that there is an \n     important political dimension in all trade negotiations, and \n     that without TPA the ability of U.S. negotiators to press for \n     agreements on our terms and our agenda will be fatally \n     weakened. Indeed, there is a deadline of March 2003 in the \n     ongoing WTO agriculture negotiations for establishing the \n     framework of the final agreement--which is referred to by our \n     trade negotiators as establishing the ``modalities.'' If the \n     U.S. is to provide effective leadership in establishing these \n     modalities, our negotiating partners must know that U.S. \n     leadership is based on and supported by authority from \n     Congress. In short, TPA is an indispensable tool that U.S. \n     trade officials need now to keep U.S. agriculture on the path \n     of prosperity and long-term economic growth.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dermot Hayes, Ph.D., Professor of Economics, Iowa State \n           University; Colin A.

On the subject of another trade bill coming before us, \nI want people to know I strongly support what we have had since 1963, \ncalled trade adjustment assistance. It is coming up for \nreauthorization. It has been an integral part of our trade policy for \nabout 40 years.\n  We need to update trade adjustment assistance and make it more \neffective for people whom it is designed to serve.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Andean trade bill. \nThat is the bill which the cloture motion we are debating is on.\n  The Andean trade bill will enable the United States to constructively \nengage with our Latin American neighbors at a time when many of them \nface enormous economic and political challenges. There is political \ninstability and the social instability in some of those countries \nbecause they face severe economic challenges. There are more people \nwith less growth and fewer material goods for the people. What the \nAndean pact comes down to is that we need--and the Andean nations \nneed--a trade policy that will positively affect trade between our \ncountries.\n  Where I come from--the little town of New Hartford, IA--when your \nneighbor down the road has an emergency, or needs a hand, in that \nMidwestern spirit we reach out to help. The United States pretty much \nhas adopted the same policy as part of our responsibility of world \nleadership since World War II. It happens all over America. Neighbors \nhelp and support each other.\n  When our Andean neighbors--Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador--\nfound themselves under siege by narco-terrorists, we reached out to \nhelp these hemispheric neighbors. Through the Andean Trade Preference \nAct, we designed a plan that is based on trade--not aid--following the \nadvice of President Kennedy 40 years ago that focuses upon people's \nself-help. That is what trade is all about. Aid is all about doing \nsomething for somebody instead of helping themselves. But trade is \nabout helping people to help themselves so they eventually develop to a \npoint--such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand have in the last 40 \nyears--where they don't need our help.\n\n  The Andean pact uses trade to promote economic development through a \ndiversified export base as an alternative to the allure of the drug \ntrade. I also support the Andean trade bill because it recognizes that \ntrade and prosperity go hand in hand. Trade is not just for rich \ncountries such as the United States, it is also for countries that \naspire to be rich.\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\n  What country looking at the United States wouldn't like to have the \nprosperity the United States has developed in the last hundred years \nand become the richest nation in the world? Countries want better and \nmore secure lives for their people. Countries want better health care, \nbetter education, and a better future for their children.\n  Through the Andean Trade Preference Act and complementary trading \ninitiatives, such as the free trade areas of the Americas, we can help \nachieve a new era of hemispheric economic cooperation that will not \nonly benefit those countries to the south of us but it will benefit us \nas well. The Andean nations know that trade--not aid--is the best way \nto overcome the fragmentation of Latin American economies and build \nself-sustaining growth that nourishes democratic institutions.\n  The United States must get off the sidelines. We need to get back \ninto the middle of the negotiating circle and back into our customary \nrole as leader of the world economy in trade, as we have been generally \nsince at least 1947. But we haven't been there in the last few years. \nThe rest of the world is not going to stand around and wait for us. \nThey are negotiating over 100 agreements, and we have negotiated 3.\n  The longer we wait, without credibility at the negotiating table, the \nmore harm will be done to our political and economic interests. By not \nleading the world, we are not going to help the world economy grow as \nlarge as that world economy can grow.\n  It is very important to get this debate started. To get this debate \nstarted, we have to have a yes vote on cloture on this bill so we can \novercome a few Members of the Senate who believe the United States \nought to be more parochial and a little more isolated. That is not a \nplace where America has been since 1947.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act and the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  However, I believe the Senate should move forward on this important \npiece of legislation separately from consideration of Trade Promotion \nAuthority.\n  I believe it is essential for the people of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, \nand Bolivia and the people of the United States that the Senate \nexpeditiously debate and act on the Andean Trade Preference Expansion \nAct on its own.\n  The original Andean Trade Preference Act was designed to discourage \nillicit drug production and help participating countries develop a \nbroader export base.\n  The results over the past decade have been very encouraging. The \nAndean Trade Preference Act has generated $3.2 billion in new output \nand $1.7 billion in new exports to the United States. Export \ndiversification has resulted in the creation of 140,000 jobs in the \nregion.\n  The excellent cooperation of participating countries with the United \nStates in the fight against narcotics production and trafficking has \nresulted in significant gains. For example, coca cultivation in Bolivia \nhas fallen by 68 percent and in Peru by 74 percent.\n  Unfortunately, we have not seen similar progress in Colombia, but \nthis is due more to political instability and the continuing struggle \nagainst narco-terrorism. I am hopeful that these difficult issues can \nbe resolved and that Colombia will enjoy the full benefits of this \nbill.\n  Just as important, the Andean Trade Preference Act has given hope to \nthe people of the region for a better tomorrow and has shown them that \nthe journey from poverty to economic prosperity need not begin with the \ncultivation of illicit narcotics.\n  Nevertheless, despite these success stories, the Andean Trade \nPreference Act expired on December 4, 2001 and the 90-day suspension of \nimport duties on eligible products issued by President Bush is set to \nexpire on May 16.\n  The House passed its own version of the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act on November 16, 2001. That bill has now come to the \nSenate floor and will be amended to include Trade Promotion Authority \nlegislation. I am concerned that this will slow passage of the \nunderlying bill.\n  If the United States continues to delay passage of the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act, the participating countries will be put in a \nvulnerable position and could face devastating consequences. They will \ndeal with increased narcotics production and trafficking, and the gains \nof the past ten years will be lost.\n  In addition, in a recent meeting, the ambassadors of Colombia, \nEcuador, and Peru indicated to me that inaction on this bill would \nresult in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. The hopes of hard \nworking families will be shattered.\n  Finally, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia all face presidential \nelections this year, and the lack of closer trade ties with the United \nStates could impede continued growth of democracy in the region.\n  The resulting weakness of the central governments will only serve to \nreenforce the strength of drug lords and their armies and destabilize \nthe region even further.\n  We should also be concerned about our own economy and export growth. \nBetween 1991 and 1999, U.S. exports to the Andean region increased by \n65 percent. The United States is the largest source of imports for each \nof the participating countries.\n  The gains from an expanded Andean Trade Act, strengthened democracies \nand stronger, more vibrant economies, will encourage even more U.S. \ninvestment and exports to the region, creating more jobs at home and \nfostering greater economic growth.\n  My home State of California, the fifth largest economic engine in the \nworld and a leader in global commerce, will greatly benefit from \nincreased prosperity and political stability in the Andean region.\n  If we do not act, U.S. credibility and leadership in the region will \nsuffer and future efforts to expand trade in Central and South America \nwill be met with skepticism and resistance.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 295, H.R. 3009, the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act:\n         Max Baucus, Zell Miller, Harry Reid, Tom Carper, Joseph \n           Lieberman, Bob Graham, John Breaux, Blanche L.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 3009, an act to extend the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, to grant additional trade benefits under that act, and \nfor other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.

Mr. President, I am sure that when all of our colleagues \ntravel back to their States and meet with parents and families, they \nare being asked about the increased cost of tuition at the universities \nand colleges across the country.\n  I know that is true in my own State of Massachusetts. The average \nfees at the University of Massachusetts, one of our fine universities, \nare going up in excess of $1,000 for this next year.\n  Quite frankly, in my part of the country, families are really \nconcerned about the economic conditions. I know the economic \nindicators, the GDP indicators, are showing some improvement. Clearly, \nthe unemployment figures are not reflecting the real situations of many \nAmericans in many parts of the Nation. So many Americans are facing \nlay-offs and those that are finding new jobs are often taking pay cuts. \nAs many states cut their higher education budgets, people are wondering \nhow they are going to afford the increases in tuition.\n  Many of those attending school and recent graduates were very \nperplexed to read the story in the New York Times over the weekend that \nsays: ``Bush seeking to squeeze school loan program.''\n  The student loan programs offer low-interest loans to full-time \nstudents. These programs are available to low and middle-income \nfamilies. I have an AP story that says:\n\n       The White House has suggested $5.2 billion savings from \n     Federal student loan programs. The White House Budget \n     Director Mitch Daniels proposed the savings to the House \n     Speaker Dennis Hastert last week. Among Daniels's proposed \n     savings is to require college students and graduates who wish \n     to consolidate their Government-backed education loans to use \n     variable interest rates, a change from the current program.\n\n  I want to share with the Senate what has happened in my own State, \nand it is replicated across the country. Just last year, we had some \n36,000 families consolidate their loans, taking advantage of the lower \nfixed interest rates. It amounts to $1 billion. The average loan in my \nState is $29,000. Let me be very clear, Mr. President. If the proposal \nthat is reported in the New York Times goes into effect, it will mean \n$3,000 more for every $10,000 a person owes to the guaranteed loan \nprogram--$3,000; $10,000 over a 30-year period. That is $10,000 \nadditional over a 10-year period if that student owes $30,000.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, the average consolidated loan is \n$29,000. To do what? According to Mr. Daniels, for the next year, it \nwill mean $1.3 billion in savings to the administration evidently so \nthey can use it for the tax cut program for wealthy individuals. Talk \nabout a financial transfer. This administration is going to balance its \nbooks at the expense of students. They are talking about $1.3 billion \nfrom students and middle-income families who will have to pay a \nvariable rate on consolidated loans, instead of taking advantage of the \nlower fixed interest rates at the present time. This is an effort to \neffectively fix the system so that students and their families will pay \nmore so this administration can afford more in tax cuts.\n  Families pay what they can afford in tuition for their children to go \nto school, and depend on the federal loan programs for the remainder of \nthe tuition. When it comes time to help repay those student loans, they \nwill have to pay higher interest rates, and they ask why. Hard working \nfamilies should get the best deal on interest rate that is available.\n  The New York Times article goes on:\n\n       ``The Bush administration is seeking to ease its budget by \n     squeezing $1.3 billion from the Federal student loan \n     program,'' administration and congressional officials say \n     today.\n\n  Whether it is the $1.3 billion as in the New York Times or the $5 \nbillion, what they are basically saying is the students and middle-\nincome families are going to have to pay a good deal more rather than \ntaking advantage of the lowest interest rates.\n  That is poor education policy. It is grossly unfair to middle-income \nfamilies, and it is clearly not in the national interest. Our national \ninterest ought to be to encourage the best and the brightest to \ncomplete their education, to be involved in the communities of this \ncountry, and contribute to our Nation's democratic values and its \neconomic values.\n  How can the administration make that kind of request to the Congress? \nMr. President, I just want to make it very clear, as far as our \ncommittee goes, I can say without fear of any contradiction, this \nsuggestion will not pass.\n  The last time we faced this type of proposal was in 1981 under \nPresident Reagan who suggested an origination fee which was an \nadditional burden on students and their families who were taking out \nstudent loans. We were unsuccessful in stopping that fee, and I believe \nwe will succeed in rejecting the elimination of the fixed rate \nconsolidation loans. But I tell my colleagues, how in the world can you \nbelieve this administration is putting education first when it is \ntrying to shortchange the students of this country in an unfair and, I \nthink, unwise way?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I must say, when I saw that article, the first thing I \nthought to myself was: They must have figured out some sort of unique \nway to achieve some savings in the college loan program which will not \naffect the beneficiaries of the program. It never occurred to me until \nI read the article, to which the Senator has referred, that they were \nintending to take this money right out of the hide of the \nbeneficiaries.\n  As I understand it, we have had this program where people can \nconsolidate their loans and lock them into place with a fixed interest \nrate. That has helped, as I understand it, to significantly reduce the \ndefault rate on college loans, if I am not mistaken.\n  I think 10 years ago we had a default rate at about 22 percent, and \nnow we have cut that rate to, what, about 5 percent?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five point six percent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Five point six percent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is one of the benefits of providing a rational \nframework for students and their families to address these college \nloans.\n  First of all, we have to understand these students are taking on a \ntremendous burden as they move through college in order to get a \ncollege education. There are many people who argue we are not doing \nenough to help lift that burden. But the notion that we should now add \nto it in this significant manner that the head of the OMB is talking \nabout I find outrageous.\n  How are these people going to afford this college education?\n  We have set up a system which seems to be working pretty well. If \nanything, we ought to provide more assistance, not less. I certainly \ncommend the Senator for taking to the floor to underscore this problem. \nI gather they want\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\nto try to do it in the supplemental appropriations bill, with very \nlittle consideration of its impact or an opportunity to affect what is \nhappening.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The State PIRGs have completed an interesting study. It \nis an independent evaluation on higher education student loan debt. \nTheir estimate on the cost to borrowers of switching from a fixed rate \nto a variable rate consolidation loan--this is their estimate, not \nmine--for an average graduate with $16,000 in college debt would have a \n$2,800 increase over the next 10 years and $6,300 if they chose to \nspread their payments over 20 years. If one has $16,000 they would pay \nan additional $2,800--the average loan is $29,000 in my State. Do you \nunderstand that? Mr. President, $16,000 is just about the national \naverage loan. This is not my estimate, this is the estimate of the \nhighly regarded and respected national group the Public Interest \nResearch Group.\n  I do not know how many people are consolidating loans in the State of \nMaryland and the State of Illinois, but I do not think that higher \nrates are what these families deserve. They deserve the best possible \nlow interest rates. They are uncertain about their economic future. \nThey are planning their life. They have every right to consolidate at \nthe lowest interest rates, and now the administration is attempting to \nforce them to pay the rate at the time that they originate their loans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for raising this issue, and I thank \nthe Senator from Maryland for joining us. Roughly two out of three \ncollege graduates today leave college with a debt. The average debt \nacross the United States for all college students is $16,000. That is a \npretty substantial sum of money for somebody starting out to get their \nfirst job out of college.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Age 21, I might add, or 22, and they are already \nwalking out, after getting their education, with a $16,000 average \ndebt. A lot of them, as the Senator points out, have more.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nexperience in Illinois is the same as in his State. Our average student \nloan, as consolidated under this program, is $30,000. What the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts tells us is that President Bush's administration has \nsuggested adding $10,000 in cost to pay back that student loan.\n\n  So one might say to themselves, this must be some national emergency \nthat would lead us to the point where we would take a young college \ngraduate and say we are going to eliminate a program and heap on \nanother $10,000 in debt for them to pay off. The national emergency \nappears to be making permanent the President's tax cut program.\n  We did a little analysis on this program recently, and I think the \nSenator from Massachusetts is aware that 65 percent of President Bush's \ntax cut goes to people making over $500,000 a year. So think about this \nfor a second. The new college graduate coming out with a debt, in my \nState, of an average $29,000, just got a $10,000 bill to collect money, \nto do what? To give to the average person making over $500,000 a year a \n$39,000-a-year tax break.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Why are we not helping the young men \nand women who are going to lead this Nation with their education to \ntake the kind of jobs that they need?\n  I know the Senators from Maryland and Massachusetts know the \nsituation where so many young graduates want to go into teaching, for \nexample, and they look at their student loans and say: This is \nimpossible. I cannot make enough money as a teacher.\n  The Bush administration proposal would make their debt larger. For \nwhat? To give a tax break, two-thirds of which goes to people making \nover $500,000 a year. This is totally upside down.\n  The student loan obligations for students across America have doubled \nwithin the last 8 years. They are likely to go up in the future. The \nBush administration proposal, I am afraid, is going to make it even \nmore difficult for our sons and daughters and grandsons and \ngranddaughters to pursue a higher education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I add one point? I would be interested in my \nfriend's reaction to this. If someone is receiving a Pell grant, the \naverage family income for a Pell grant student is $17,000. These are \ngifted, talented individuals who could qualify for any of our greatest \nuniversities. Their family income is under $17,000, and the Pell grant \nis available to them. Reading from the Public Interest Research Group's \nanalysis, even worse off are the students who depend on the Pell grants \nto finance their education. This would cost the typical Pell grant \nborrower $3,100, almost a thousand dollars more because since they are \nlower income, they have to pay--at the start they are paying higher \nrates.\n  So we are talking about students who are gifted and talented, who \nhave every kind of asset except a large wallet or pocketbook, who have \na great deal to contribute to our Nation, and whose family income is \nless than $17,000, people who are going ahead and working. Sixty-three \npercent of the students in this country now who are on scholarship work \n25 hours a week or more. That is extraordinary.\n  We wonder why the students are not talking about books and education; \nthey are talking about their debts and their obligations. Well, I am \nwondering, if my two friends would not agree, when families of limited \nincome, even though their children have the academic gifts and talents \nto go on to education, are going to be forced to say: No, count me out; \nI will just go on, wait on tables, I will park cars, because I am not \ngoing to put my family through that kind of indebtedness. That is the \nmessage that will go out with this proposal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Asking the Senator to further yield, I will share with \nhim this statistic: 39 percent of college students now graduate with \ndebt loads that are termed unmanageable, meaning their monthly payments \nare more than 8 percent of their monthly incomes.\n  With this Bush administration change putting more debt on these \nstudents, it becomes impossible for them to deal with this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But the Republican response to that is these students \nare going to become lawyers and doctors so they will be able to afford \nit. Would not both my colleagues agree, we have a shortage of 2 million \nschoolteachers in this country? What we are talking about is \nschoolteachers. We are talking about social workers who we are trying \nto help. We are talking about those who would be childcare providers. \nWe are talking about police officials and nurses. These are the ones \nwho are entering low wage professions, trying to make it and to be \nresponsible and pay off their debt. They are the ones who are going to \nfind education virtually priced out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The fact is that no other advanced country places as \nmuch of the burden of obtaining a college education on the individual \nstudent and the family as we do. We in the Congress have been trying to \nease that burden through a combination of grants and loans, although we \nhave been shifting from grants to loans increasingly over the years. \nOther countries do not do the same thing. Why not? Because they \nrecognize the society and the nation benefit from developing the \ntalents and the capacities of their young men and women; that it is not \nonly the individual who gets the benefit but society gets a benefit \nfrom educating these people.\n  As my colleague from Illinois pointed out, if they walk out of \ncollege with this huge burden on their back, then obviously they are \nmotivated to go to lucrative professions in order to pay off the debt.\n  I have talked to young people who have said: I really would like to \nteach but I cannot afford to teach because I have this debt burden that \nI have to pay off. Therefore, they are looking to go into some \nprofession where they can make a lot of money. They are lost to the \nteaching profession.\n  Now that we have a system in place, we knock out one aspect. My \nunderstanding is the consolidation of loans has been in effect since \nthe Reagan years. I understand it first went into place in 1986, the \nconsolidation of loans. It makes good sense. We are always telling \npeople they ought to consolidate their loans and we put it into place. \nNow we are taking away from\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\npeople another support to try to help with higher education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. There is a very \ninteresting statistic for those who enter medical school. 85 percent of \nmedical students want to become general practitioners. They care about \npatients and want to be there on the front line treating the families \nof America. However, they end up borrowing so much to pay for their \nschool costs that they need to enter specialization because of the \nsalary differences at the very time we need more general practitioners.\n  I draw the attention of my colleagues to the chart and what has \nhappened with grants and loans. My colleagues remember the great \ndebates held on providing greater access to higher education for all \nAmericans, those national debates go back to 1960. President Kennedy \nbelieved the size of your pocketbook should not determine what \nuniversity a student attends, only your qualifications should determine \nwhere you could attend school. Grants, some loans, work-study programs, \nsummer employment should add up to the cost of your tuition and fees. \nAll of those match together in an economic package so a student can \nsuccessfully go to the school of their choice.\n  I was in the Education Committee when Secretary Bennett said: Too \nbad. Those families can go where the loans will take them. That is our \nview of this Republican administration. That is the attitude. We do not \nwant to limit opportunity. I know where that is in the Record.\n  We have seen the buying power of grants fail to keep up with the \ncosts of college. The neediest children are forced to take out loans. \nNow we find at a time when these young students and graduates are \ntrying to take advantage of refinancing their loans, we are hearing the \nadministration saying: No, we need another $1.3 billion for our tax \nprogram so we are going to force students to wait and see what the \ninterest rate will be every year instead of locking in at a fixed rate. \nThat is regrettable.\n  I draw another chart to the attention of my colleagues. This is a \nwomen's issue. Education is one way that we can help women close the \nearnings gap. When you deny women the opportunities to continue \neducation, you continue a perpetuation of the notable disparity taking \nplace. Women, like their male counterparts, increase their earnings \nwhen they increase their education.\n  Once you put the economic binds by effectively denying people the \nability to discharge debt, this will work against women students. We \nsee it already. We will see it even grow over the period of time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator was part of an effort that many joined with \nPresident Bush: Leave no child behind. The idea was to improve the \nquality of education across America, to make certain, with \naccountability, that schools were graduating students who had the basic \nwherewithal to succeed in society.\n  One of the linchpins was to improve teachers in the classroom.\n  I would like the Senator from Massachusetts to tell me if I recall \nthis correctly. Are we moving through President Bush's bill to a point \nwhere more and more teachers have to be certified in that they are \ngoing to teach in schools? In other words, you cannot be the gym \nteacher who says, I will teach biology. You have to stand in front of \nthe classroom with students.\n  We are passing bills saying, teachers, we want you to stay in school, \nget more advanced degrees, and be more valuable in the marketplace but \ncome back to the classroom. And now the Bush administration, months \nlater, comes in and increases the cost of education for those who \naspire to be those quality teachers. There is a disconnect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It is a powerful, \npowerful argument. We are trying to make sure we are going to have a \nwell-qualified teacher in every classroom. More and more young people \nwho are entering teaching are saddled with enormous debt burden. As a \nnational objective, have a well-qualified teacher in every classroom. \nHow can these young professionals afford to pay off their loans when we \nknow that too many teachers are underpaid.\n  And the Senator quite rightly points out that will require tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands, of teachers to get certification and \nto go back to universities and colleges, community colleges, to get \nthese certifications.\n  This kind of activity is going to make it that much more expensive, \nthat much more of a disincentive to go into teaching. That is \nenormously important and significant. I thank my colleague for bringing \nthis critical fact to the floor.\n  I see my friend from Rhode Island who has been such a leader in \neducation, and follows a very proud tradition in his state. We give \nfair notice to the administration that we are going to do everything we \npossibly can legislatively do to make sure this does not take place. We \nwant to keep as many low-cost options for borrowers as possible to make \nsure that more people are getting college degrees. We will have more to \nsay about this in the very near future.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy).

Mr. President, as we celebrate National Volunteer Week I \nwould like to recognize the 300 volunteers at the University Medical \nCenter in Las Vegas, NV who are committed to providing young Nevadans \nwith more promising futures.\n  As a group, U.M.C.'s 300 volunteers donated 49,700 hours of time in \n2001. Their contribution of volunteer time and talent has enormously \nimproved the efficiency and effectiveness of University Medical Center. \nThrough their efforts, these volunteers have helped build a better \ncommunity. The programs that they have participated in include U.M.C.'s \nMedical Explorer Program, the Volunteer Youth Corps, the ``Pal'' \nprogram of Las Vegas High School, and the ``Medical Magnet Program of \nRancho High School, all of which have positively impacted the youth of \nNevada.\n  In addition, for almost 40 years U.M.C. Auxiliary, a group chartered \nby the Clark County Board of Trustees, has volunteered and raised \nmillions of dollars for the discretionary use of the hospital including \nthe purchase of needed medical equipment. Having recently been \nchallenged to raise even more money for the hospital, the Auxiliary \npresented a donation of $300,000 to the Clark County Board of Trustees \non April 16.\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that ``everyone can be great because \nanyone can serve.''

Mr. President, in my twenty-four years in the United \nStates Senate, I have had the responsibility as a United States \nSenator, in keeping with the long standing traditions of the Senate, to \nrecommend to the President of the United States well qualified Federal \njudicial nominees for Federal courts sitting in Virginia. I deem this \none of my most important duties as a United States Senator.\n  Since his inauguration, I have the had the honor of recommending \nindividuals to President George W. Bush for two positions on the \nFederal courts sitting in Virginia.\n  First, I was pleased to recommend Roger Gregory to serve as a judge \non the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. President \nBush subsequently nominated Mr. Gregory, and the Senate confirmed this \nnomination on July 20, 2001.\n  Today, I rise in support of another nominee that I have recommended \nto President Bush, Mr. Henry Hudson. On January 24, 2002, President \nBush nominated Judge Hudson to serve on the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia. Senator Allen and I both \nstrongly support Judge Hudson's nomination.\n  Judge Hudson's background makes him highly qualified for this \njudgeship. And, it is important to note that the Virginia Bar \nAssociation ``highly recommends'' him as well.\n  Judge Hudson's experience with the law is extensive, beginning with \nhis service as a Deputy Sheriff in Arlington County, Virginia, in 1969 \nand 1970. He then went to law school, graduating from American \nUniversity in 1974.\n  Subsequent to his graduation from law school, Mr. Hudson entered \nlegal practice as a prosecutor. First, he served as an Assistant \nCommonwealth's attorney for five years and then as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  In 1986, Mr. Hudson was confirmed by the Senate and began his service \nas the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, a \nrole in which he served in until 1991.\n  After leaving the U.S. Attorney's office, Judge Hudson once again \nreceived Senate confirmation and served as the Director of the United \nStates Marshal Service from 1992 to 1993.\n  After completing his work at the Marshal Service, Mr. Hudson entered \nprivate practice until he was a sworn in as a Judge on the Fairfax \nCounty, Virginia Circuit Court. Judge Hudson has served as a judge on \nthis important court since 1998.\n  During his time on the Fairfax County Circuit Court bench, Judge \nHudson has been known as a fair, objective judge who conducts \nproceedings with dignity and with the appropriate judicial temperament. \nI am confident that he will continue his service on the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia bench consistent with this reputation.\n  Clearly, Judge Hudson is a highly qualified nominee. Accordingly, I \nwill soon be speaking directly with Chairman Leah and Ranking Member \nHatch about an appropriate time for a confirmation hearing for this \nnominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3499-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ON THE DEATH OF STUART R. PADDOCK\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the late \nStuart R. Paddock, editor emeritus, publisher emeritus, and owner of \nthe suburban Chicago newspaper, the Daily Herald. The Daily Herald, I \nam proud to say, is my hometown paper. A respected businessman, \ncommunity leader, and World War II veteran, Mr. Paddock served the \nDaily Herald for nearly 65 years, during which time he transformed a \nstruggling tri-weekly paper into Illinois' third largest daily \nnewspaper. Mr. Paddock died last week at the age of 86.\n  Stuart Paddock's career with the Daily Herald began inauspiciously as \na ``printer's devil,'' the person responsible for pouring molten lead \ninto molds for use in linotype. After graduating from Knox College and \nserving as a company commander in Europe during World War II, Mr. \nPaddock rejoined the newspaper in 1946. By 1948, he had been named vice \npresident and board director. In 1970, just 2 years after assuming the \nHerald's top leadership position, he overcame fierce competition from \nother publications and established the Herald as a 5-day-a-week paper. \nFor his hard work and dedication, Stuart Paddock earned the respect not \nonly of Daily Herald readers and employees, but of his staunchest \ncompetitors. As the Chicago Tribune wrote, ``Stuart R. Paddock Jr. put \n`daily' in Daily Herald.'' The Herald enjoyed enormous success in the \nensuing years, growing from a circulation of 11,800 in 1970 to nearly \n130,000 by 1994. The Herald's success was so remarkable for a suburban \npaper that the Chicago Tribune proclaimed Stuart Paddock ``the Sam \nWalton of suburban journalism.'' Throughout his career, Mr. Paddock was \nactive in the Illinois Press Association, the Cook County Suburban \nPublishers Association, the Newspaper Committee for a Free and \nCompetitive Press, and numerous other organizations. In recognition of \nhis outstanding professional accomplishments, Mr. Paddock was inducted \ninto the Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame in 2001.\n  Despite his success as a visionary and leader, Stuart Paddock, \naffectionately called ``Stu'' by his employees, never lost his sense of \ncommitment to the family he represented and the readers he served. When \nthe Herald's spectacular growth sparked lucrative offers from potential \nbuyers of the paper, he respectfully declined, choosing instead to keep \nthe paper a family business with strong ties to local communities.\n  I knew Mr. Paddock as a man of integrity and vision. He was a \ngentleman, in every sense of the word. He is beloved by the communities \nand people that knew him best, and will leave a remarkable void as a \ncivic leader and patriarch of the Paddock and Daily Herald family.\n  In paying tribute to Stuart Paddock, we honor a groundbreaking \njournalist, a gentleman, and a great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3499-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there has seldom been a more \nimportant time for Congress to support Israel. Right now, both the \nUnited States and Israel are under attack, and we share a common \nenemy--terrorism.\n  The goals of these terrorists are clear. They want to kill innocent \nmen, women, and children to further their cause--whatever it may be. \nThey want to strike at our democracies and test the freedoms of the \nUnited States and our greatest democratic ally in the Middle East, \nIsrael. They are willing to train their sons and daughters to murder \nothers by strapping explosives to their bodies and detonating \nthemselves in civilian areas. But this is a test both nations will \npass.\n  Why is this so? I think it is because our shared ideals of respect \nfor religion, freedom of thought, and peace throughout the world make \nus stronger than those who fly airplanes into buildings and blow up \nrestarants. We will pass this test because the United States and Israel \nare united in our resolve that we will not change our ideals and our \nprinciples in the face of cowards. We can never be forced to surrender \nour freedoms.\n  Why do I have such faith and hope that Israel will weather this \ncurrent storm of violence? I simply look at the history of Israel since \nindependence nearly 54 years ago. I am struck by the resolve of the \nIsraeli people. After the long-fought War for Independence, Israel \nsuffered more than 10,000 acts of terrorism prior to the 1956 Sinai \nCampaign. That number is remarkable given that the population of Israel \nat the time was just 2 million.\n  In 1967, Israel overcame a hostile Arab alliance that threatened the \nexistence of the nation from all sides. The early 1970s brought a \nmassacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and a surprise \nattack by Egypt and Syria on Judaism's most holy day. The 1980s were \nmarked by the first intifadah, and the 1990s by Scud Missiles and the \nGulf War.\n  Today, no Israeli man or woman can get on a bus or walk in a \nmarketplace\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nwithout fearing for his or her life. Israel and its people have always \nbeen faced with violence and terror, its very existence continuously \nthreatened by its neighbors.\n  But how has Israel responded? By developing a thriving democracy that \nrespects human rights. By working hard to create an economy that has \nsuccessfully operated in the face of hostile Arab boycotts. And by \nshowing over and over again its commitment to peace by reaching out to \nthe world to sign the Camp David Accords with Egypt, to engage in the \nOslo process with the Palestinians, to unilaterally withdraw from \nLebanon and even by reaching out two years ago to one of the most \nnotorious state-sponsors of terrorism, Syria.\n  And, today, in the face of everything, it is Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon who is urging to a return to the peace table and laying out the \nroadmap that leads to peace.\n  Unfortunately, Israel's courage to make peace has, in large part, not \nbeen reciprocated in these cases, and it has certainly not be \nreciprocated by Yasser Arafat.\n  In 1993, Yitzhak Rabin took a bold step by entering into the Oslo \nAccords and beginning a process marked by the principle that peace in \nthe Middle East could be achieved by trading land for peace. It's \nsomething that the Arab countries and the Palestinians said that they \nwanted. Did Israel live up to its commitments set out in the Oslo \nAccords? Yes, it did.\n  During the 1990s, Israel transferred control of 40 percent of West \nBank land and 70 percent of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian \nAuthority. Yet Arafat was not able to, or did not want to, provide \nsecurity and continuously violated the accords.\n  Then, President Clinton put a plan on the table. After all the land \nwas already transferred to the Palestinians, Israel was willing to give \nup a staggering 95 percent of the West Bank during the Camp David \ntalks. But Yasser Arafat walked away from that too. And I remember the \ndespair I felt when this happened. You had to wonder, at that point, \nwhat this was really all about.\n  And not only did he walk away, Arafat started another intifadah. Now \nI want to take a minute to talk about a visit Democratic Senators had \nwith Tom Friedman, a columnist who, over the years, has been very \nbalanced in his approach to the Middle East. I cannot remember the \nexact conversation, so I will retell it to the best of my recollection. \nMr. Friedman said that he was stunned that Arafat walked away after \nbeing offered 95 percent of what he wanted, he questioned the \nPalestinian leadership to learn why.\n  And the answer came back from the Palestinians that they needed more \ntime to look this over, to see the details of the plan.\n  Mr. Friedman said that if that was all true why the intifadah. And \nthe answer from the Palestinians was that they could not take one more \nday of the occupation.\n  Mr. Friedman was incredulous. The Palestinians could not take one \nmore day of the occupation, yet refused offers that would have ended \noccupation. Where is the sense in this?\n  So this intifadah has been a calculated plan of violence. Mr. \nFriedman later wrote in a column that, ``the world must understand that \nthe Palestinians have not chosen suicide bombing out of desperation . . \n. stemming from the Israeli occupation . . . [It] is because they \nactually want to win their independence in blood and fire. All they can \nagree on as a community is what they want to destroy, not what they \nwant to build.''\n  We are left to ask ourselves, does Arafat want peace? I say the facts \ndictate that he does not. Arafat is telling us that he wants peace on \none hand, but on the other he is leading the Palestinian people away \nfrom what it is in their best interests, a lasting peace with Israel.\n  A look back at history shows that Palestinian leaders have walked \naway from possible statehood and secure borders with Israel four times, \nonce in 1937 and in 1947, and then twice under plans presented by Prime \nMinister Ehud Barak and President Clinton. How many times will it take \nbefore we realize that there is something else going on here. They were \noffered a homeland four times. The Palestinians need to understand: \nit's not about the homeland, it's about all the land.\n  This strategy of suicide bombing is barbaric, it is to be condemned, \nand I am shocked at how little condemnation you hear around the world \nfor this tactic.\n  When I take this issue up with leaders from other Arab countries, the \nanswer is ``well, people are desperate and they will do desperate \nthings.'' When I bring up the issue of women and girls blowing \nthemselves up, they just give me the brush off.\n  We will never forget the Palestinian suicide bomber who killed 27 \nIsraelis as they were sitting down for the traditional feast marking \nthe beginning of Passover. Zeev Vidor was one of he Israelis killed in \nthe attack and today his kidney is keeping alive a Palestinian woman \nwho was in need of a transplant.\n  This is possible because the family of Zeev Vidor knew the value of \nusing life to give life, whereas those who entice suicide bombers \nbelieve in using life to destroy life. And I think that whole story is \na metaphor for what we are talking about. Since September 2000, 170 \nIsraelis have been killed by more than 60 suicide bombers.\n  Last year I worked on a resolution with Senator George Allen right \nbefore September 11 to condemn suicide bombing. After September 11, the \nresolution was shelved briefly, but it eventually passed the Senate in \nOctober.\n  Earlier this year, when we saw the women strapping on bombs, I went \nto all the women in the United States Senate, 13 of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and got them to sign on to a resolution that passed \nearlier this year. Then, I wrote to Palestinian envoy Dr. Hanan Ashrawi \nand urged her to speak out clearly against this horrible escalation of \nviolence.\n  Women suicide bombers are a deadly tactic used by the al-Aqsa \nmilitant group that is linked to Yasser Arafat. An al-Aqas leader in \nBethlehem has been quoted as saying that ``we have 200 young women, \nfrom the Bethlehem area alone ready to sacrifice themselves for the \nhomeland.'' You notice that the older people don't do this, they just \nentice the young, which adds to the horror.\n  One such suicide bombing by an 18-year-old Palestinian girl was \nresponsible for the death of a 17-year-old Israeli girl named Rachel \nwho was only on a quick errand to buy some herbs for the fish dinner \nher mother was preparing nearby. It is tragic when young women are \nwilling to kill each other in this fashion. It is even more tragic that \nthe people these women look to for guidance are actively encouraging \nthese acts of terror. Earlier this month there was a story of one of \nthe highest ranking Muslim leaders in Lebanon giving his blessing to \nfemale suicide bombers, calling them part of a ``new glorious history \nfor Arab and Muslim women.''\n  And what about Mrs. Arafat, telling an interviewer that if she had a \nson, she could conceive of ``no greater honor'' than having him strap \non an explosive belt.\n  I have to tell you, the truth we have to look at is horrible, but we \nbetter look at it. Believe me, I am the last one who wanted to be \ndismayed or discouraged. I am in politics because I want to see a \npeaceful world, because I want a healthy environment for everyone, \nbecause I want all children to have hope. But we have to look at this, \nand we have to be strong and clear. And I am going to be very clear.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the McConnel-Feinstein legislation \nthat says that Arafat must meet his commitments or be sanctioned by the \nUnited States. And I am honored to be the author of the Syrian \nAccountability Act.\n  This bill that I introduced would expand sanctions against Syria, a \nstate sponsor of terrorism, if it continues to support groups like \nHamas and Hisbalah, does not fully withdraw from Lebanon, continues to \ndevelop and deploy ballistic missiles, and remains in violation of U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  From the death of innocent civilians in Israel, to attacks on Jews in \nthe former Soviet Union; from Daniel Pearl saying ``I am a Jew'' \nshortly before his execution to the leader of a French political party \nsaying that the gas chamber is just a detail of history, we know that \nthis is a difficult and trying time for people of the Jewish faith.\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n  I believe the Senate must send a message of hope and a message of \naction. We have friends outside the Jewish community who are standing \nwith us. We ought to thank them and embrace them. Just as we had \nfriends during the Holocaust, we must always embrace them. We must \nalways form those coalitions. I believe that Americans of all faiths \nand people of all faiths across this world understand what is at stake \nhere. Because it really is about humanity. Israel will come out of this \nstrong, and remain a beacon of hope in the Middle East with the United \nStates standing by as one of its greatest allies.\n  I agree with Prime Minister Sharon that the peace table must be \nrebuilt and there must once again be a process in place to resolve at \nlong last the difficult challenges of the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3501-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 1, \n1992, in Miami Beach, FL.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a letter sent by almost 300 State legislators--Republican \nand Democrat alike from 40 States--calling on Congress to add \nsubstantial new funding for child care.\n  Just as parents have provided moving testimony to Congress about \ntheir struggles to find and afford child care, these state legislators \njoin them in urging us to better fund child care to help families work \nand children succeed in school. Unfortunately, the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant (CCDBG), is currently serving only one out of \nevery seven eligible children. And any progress that States have made \nin recent years is now being threatened by the challenging economic \nsituations that the States are confronting. I, along with Senators \nKerry and Torricelli, introduced the Children First Act of 2002, S. \n2070, to help children, families and the states meet their child care \nneeds.\n  People in New Mexico recognize that accessible, quality child care is \na vital support for working families. Increased availability of child \ncare will help to ensure the success of welfare reform, while also \nproviding a critical support for parents earning low-incomes who are \nstruggling to support their families and stay off the welfare rolls. \nState legislators see firsthand the integral role of child care in \nhelping families to work.\n  Quality child care also provides children with the early learning \nexperience they need to achieve in school. States have been strong \npartners in the effort to improve public education across the nation. \nWe must help them to provide children with the experiences they need to \nbe ready to learn.\n  These State legislators, including 14 legislators from New Mexico, \ntoday join the growing chorus of voices that we have heard from in \nsupport of increased child care funding. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of their letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows.\n\n                                                    April 24, 2002\n     Re: Child Care\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Quality child care is one of the \n     most important investments we can make to help families to \n     work and children to enter school ready to learn. The \n     undersigned state legislators believe that substantial new \n     investments for child care must be a top federal priority.\n       Congress has a unique opportunity to address child care \n     this year. As you undertake the reauthorization of the Child \n     Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), we urge you to make \n     sufficient new investments to ensure that 2 million more \n     eligible children can receive assistance and that quality \n     improvements can be made. This additional funding would \n     approximately double the number of children currently getting \n     assistance while improving the quality of care. Now, just 1 \n     in 7 eligible children are receiving this important \n     assistance.\n       This additional investment serves two critical purposes. \n     First, child care is an essential work support that will help \n     ensure the success of welfare reform. Working parents need \n     stable, affordable, and safe child care for their children in \n     order to get a job and stay employed. Parents who work in low \n     wage jobs struggle to find quality child care that they can \n     afford. State legislators see firsthand the critical value of \n     child care and its integral role in helping families to work.\n       Second, quality care provides children with the early \n     education experience they need to be ready for school and \n     success in later life. States have been strong partners in \n     the effort to improve the education of our children; we must \n     to provide them with the strongest foundation possible to \n     prepare them to be ready to learn and to succeed in school.\n       Substantial new funding for the CCDBG would help states \n     ensure that parents can work and children can have the \n     quality early learning experiences that help prepare them to \n     achieve in school. Now, as states struggle to overcome \n     difficult economic challenges, we hope that we can count on \n     your leadership in making additional investments in the \n     CCDBG. This investment is one we cannot afford NOT to make.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rep. Steven C. Adams (VT), Sen. Richard Alarcon (CA), Rep. \n     Elaine R. Alfano (VT), Rep.

Mr. President, in March 2002, the National \nInstitute for Health Care Management announced that for yet another \nyear, prescription drug prices rose more than ten percent. Often we see \nthese rising costs attributed to the plethora of new drugs now \navailable and to the resources needed to produce such innovative \ntechnologies. Yet, I find this argument difficult to accept when \nFortune 500 reported this month that while most industries report \ndwindling earnings, pharmaceutical companies were showing impressive \ngains. Drug prices rising steadily in a year when the pharmaceutical \nindustry trumped all other industries in profitability is a correlation \nthat should come to nobody as a surprise.\n  Pharmaceutical companies continue to insist that they are sinking \nunder the heavy cost of research and development. But R costs are not \ncausing high drug prices. Excessive profits are causing high drug \nprices, and excessive profits are keeping necessary drugs out of the \nfinancial reach of millions. It is time for Congress to challenge the \npractices of U.S. drug manufacturers. The Prescription Drug Price \nParity for Americans Act exposes drug manufacturers to international \nprice competition by allowing the reimportation of FDA-approved drugs \nfrom Canada, where prices are almost 35 percent lower. In the face of \nsuch competition, drug companies will be confronted with the fact that, \nall along, their prices have not only been exorbitant, but unwarranted.\n  Over the past few years, I have brought to the Senate floor countless \nstories of Michigan residents who have crossed the border into Canada \nsimply to get their hands on affordable prescription drugs. They \ncontinue to do so as we speak, and I do not blame them when just a few \nmonths ago I found that Prilosec, a commonly prescribed \ngastrointestinal drug, was fifty dollars less in a pharmacy in Windsor, \nCanada, than in a pharmacy in neighboring Detroit. U.S. pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers continue to operate in a closed market. They are still \nable to get away with charging $50 more than their Canadian \ncounterparts. Additionally, they are currently the only ones who are \nallowed to import drugs approved by the FDA. American pharmacists and \ndistributors deserve this right, too. Pharmacists and distributors \ndeserve not only the right to purchase lower costing FDA-approved drugs \nabroad, but to bring these critical drugs back to America where the \nsavings can be passed on to our own citizens. The Prescription Drug \nPrice Parity for Americans Act, which improves upon last year's enacted \nversion, would make this access possible.\n  High drug prices impact everyone--the young and the old, the insured \nand the uninsured--we all lose when prescription drugs are \nunaffordable. Much more needs to be done to expand access to lower \npriced prescription drugs sold abroad and the bill we are introducing \ntoday will help to offer that opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3502-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3502-S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SELBYVILLE, DELAWARE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are times, it seems, when we \ncelebrate ``small-town America'' as an idea, either in nostalgic \nlonging or as an homage to traditional values and a spirit of community \nthat seem elusive in the rush of modern life.\n  But the values and spirit of our small towns is more than just an \nidea; it is real, it is alive, it not only endures but thrives, to the \nbenefit of us all, in places across this country, and certainly in \ntowns up and down my home State of Delaware.\n  The Town of Selbyville, in Sussex County, the southernmost part of \nour State, is one such place. And it gives me great pleasure to pay \ntribute to Selbyville, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of its \nincorporation.\n  The history of the Town goes back much further than 1902, to the late \n1770s, when Benjamin Long, Arthur McCabe, John Murray, Reuben Stevens \nand Elijah Campbell bought a 250-acre tract at the head of the St. \nMartin's River, where a gristmill and sawmill operated.\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\n  The tract had been known as Sandy Branch, but about 50 years after \nthe purchase, a country store owner named Sampson Selby began to mark \npackages for delivery ``Selby-Ville.''\n  In 1872, the Frankford and Breakwater Railroad reached the Town, so \nthat its strawberries could be shipped to more distant markets. By \n1918, Selbyville was the East Coast's main supplier of strawberries, \nand strawberries remained an important commercial base for the Town \nthrough the late 1930s.\n  Agriculture is still important to Selbyville, although now it's \npoultry and pork, corn and soybeans that occupy most of the farmers. \nAnd the Town has grown beyond its original business center, reaching \nout to US 113 with service industries and a shopping center.\n  The highway has become more important than the railroad, Selbyville \nhas grown, but it is still a small Town a place of living history, a \nplace driven by the values that grow from long-time association and the \nwork ethic of an agricultural community, a place that feels like home.\n  We neighbors of Selbyville congratulate Mayor Clifton C. Murray; Town \nCouncil members Jay C. Murray, C. Frank Smith, III, Clarence W. Tingle, \nJr., and Richard A. Duncan, Sr.; and all the citizens and friends of \nthe Town, as they look forward to their official 100th anniversary \ncelebration on May 25th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3503-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3503-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/29/senate-section/article/S3503-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following concurrent resolution was read, and referred as \nindicated:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, \nto establish certain limitations relating to the use of official time \nby Federal employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Workplace \nIntegrity Act of 2002, a bill that would monitor and greatly restrict \nthe time spent by Federal employees on union-related activities. \nFederal spending on union activities is spiraling out of control, and \nthis legislation, if enacted into law, would send a message to the \nAmerican people that Congress is committed to curbing wasteful \npractices in our government. I think that my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle would agree that we have a duty to ensure that limited \nmonies are used both reasonably and efficiently.\n  One area of labor-related spending that should be closely examined is \nthe use of official time. Official time is paid time when Federal \nemployees represent union employees and bargaining units. Federal \nemployees may use official time to take part in activities such as \nemployee-initiated grievance procedures and union-initiated \nrepresentational duties. Surprisingly, there are few limits on the use \nof official time. If costs associated with this practice are not \ncontained, these expenditures will become exorbitant drains on the \nFederal treasury. Congress should make the fiscally responsible \ndecision to impose sensible limitations on this practice.\n  Although significant resources are spent on union activities in the \nFederal Government each year, current costs are unknown. Limited \nstudies indicate that the costs are high. In 1998, the Office of \nPersonnel Management issued a report that tallied the costs associated \nwith union activity in the Federal Government. The report found that \nduring the first six months of calendar year 1998, official time \ntotaled 2,171,774 hours, and its cost had a dollar value of \n$48,110,284. An astounding 23,965 Federal employees used official time, \nand 946 employees spent an alarming 100 percent of their time \nperforming union-related activities. The report also found that 912 \nemployees spent between 75 percent and 100 percent of their work hours \non official time, and 1,152 employees spent between 50 percent and 75 \npercent on official time. The Department of the Treasury alone spent \nover $9 million on official time during this six-month time period. \nBased on the amount spent in six months, it is not unreasonable to \nexpect that Treasury spent over $18 million during the entire 1998 \ncalendar year. This report demonstrates that large sums are being spent \non union activity, and I feel strongly that Congress should insist on a \nregular accounting of these costs.\n  Additionally, other studies indicate that union-related costs are not \nonly high, but are increasing. In 1996, the General Accounting Office \nissued a report on the costs of labor-related activities at the Social \nSecurity Administration. The report found a steady growth in costs at \nthe SSA during the 1990s. From calendar year 1990 to 1995, the amount \nof time spent on union activities at SSA increased from 254,000 hours \nto 413,000 hours, at a cost increase of over $6 million. In Fiscal Year \n1995 alone, the cost attributed to official time was $12.6 million, the \nequivalent of the salaries and expenses of approximately 200 employees. \nMore recently, the Commissioner of Social Security reported that the \ntotal expenses of labor activities in Fiscal Year 2000 was $13.5 \nmillion, an increase of $1.1 million over the Fiscal Year 1999 level.\n  These increasing costs are not limited to the Social Security \nAdministration. A 1996 hearing of the Civil Service Subcommittee of the \nHouse Government Reform and Oversight Committee revealed that the use \nof official time at the Internal Revenue Service increased 27 percent \nfrom 1992 to 1996. At the U.S. Customs Service, the rising cost of \nunion activity was more dramatic. The amount spent on official time \nincreased from $470,000 in 1993 to more than $1 million in 1996, a jump \nof 119 percent. I am particularly concerned about these reports of \nrapidly expanding costs.\n\n  Despite the high and increasing costs, we do not presently know the \ntotal amount spent by the Federal\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\nGovernment on official time. We can estimate based on incomplete data, \nbut we do not regularly gather information that would enable us to know \nthe true costs and spending trends. This is unacceptable.\n  Furthermore, we do not even know the true costs at the Social \nSecurity Administration, the one agency where the use of official time \nhas been thoroughly studied. The GAO report on union activity at the \nSSA found that the reporting system did not track effectively the \nnumber of union representatives charging time to union activities or \nthe actual time spent. A subsequent report issued in 1998 by the SSA \nInspector General also called into question the reliability of the data \ncollected by SSA's reporting system. The Inspector General's report \nconcluded that almost half of the SSA managers who were surveyed \nindicated that the system for supervising official time spent by \nemployees on union activities was either somewhat ineffective or very \nineffective. These findings demonstrate that Congress must do a better \njob of monitoring the costs associated with labor-related activities in \nthe Federal government.\n  My bill would accomplish two important objectives. First, this \nlegislation would require the collection of data on the amount of money \nspent on official time in the entire Federal Government. By requiring \nthe collection of data associated with official time, Congress will \nhave the information necessary to control costs in the future. Second, \nmy bill would help ensure that Federal funds are spent wisely and \njudiciously. This legislation would limit a Federal employee's use of \nofficial time to 25 percent of the employee's total hours worked. I \nbelieve that this limitation is entirely reasonable. It would allow \nFederal employees to spend up to a quarter of their time on union-\nrelated activities and would also protect American taxpayers from ever-\nincreasing costs.\n  During a period of fiscal discipline, we should seek to know the true \ncosts of any activities supported by the American taxpayers. I \nencourage my colleagues to support my effort to place reasonable \nlimitations on the taxpayer financing of union-related activities. By \nbringing the true costs to light and by seeking to restrain these \nescalating expenses, Congress will responsibly exercise its power of \nthe purse. Furthermore, this bill would send a message to American \ntaxpayers that their hard-earned dollars will not be spent in an \nuncontrolled and wasteful manner. To turn a blind eye to costs would be \nan abdication of our duty to the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill entitled ``The Production Incentive Certificate \nProgram Revision Act''; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake several technical adjustments to the Production Incentive \nCertificate, PIC, program. The PIC program helps assure that the watch \nand jewelry industries in the U.S. insular possessions, particularly \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, USVI, will continue to provide critical \nsources of employment in the insular possessions. This legislation \nwould improve the operation of the PIC program for both watch and \njewelry manufacturers in the U.S. Virgin Islands and, over the longer \nterm, would protect the PIC program and related duty incentives from \nthe effects of any future reduction or elimination of watch tariffs.\n  The watch industry is the largest light manufacturing industry in the \nUSVI and remains one of the most important direct and indirect sources \nof private sector employment in the Territory. The insular watch \nproduction industry is also highly import-sensitive and faces continued \nthreats from multinational watch producers, who have continued to move \ntheir watch production to lower wage countries.\n  Congress and successive Administrations have recognized the \nimportance of the watch industry to the USVI--and the import \nsensitivity of watches--through a series of significant enactments and \ndecisions. The General Note 3(a) program, which Congress has \nincorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, grants duty-free \ntreatment for qualifying insular possession watches and thereby \nprovides a relative duty advantage vis-a-vis foreign watch producers. \nThrough the PIC program, insular possession watch producers can obtain \nduty refunds based on creditable wages paid for watch production in the \ninsular possessions. Additionally, in recognition of the relative \nadvantage that duty-free treatment of watches provides to insular \npossession watch producers, Congress and successive Administrations \nhave resisted efforts to eliminate watch duties on a worldwide basis.\n  In 1999, Congress extended the General Note 3(a) program and PIC \nprogram benefits to jewelry produced in the insular possessions. In \ndoing so, Congress sought to promote vital employment in the insular \npossessions by extending existing watch industry incentives to jewelry \nproduction--an industry which utilizes many of the same skills and \nfacilities as watch production. In recent months, three mainland \njewelry manufacturing companies have established operations in the USVI \nand are expected to file for PIC benefits in the near future.\n  Recently, watch and jewelry producers in the Virgin Islands have \nconsulted with the American Watch Association and U.S. watch firms that \nimport substantial quantities of foreign\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nmade watches regarding proposals to preserve and protect benefits for \ninsular possession watches and jewelry, while also mitigating the \nimpact of any future reduction of duties on imported watches. These \ndiscussions have resulted in the parties' unified support for the \nlegislation that I am introducing today.\n  The various technical adjustments set forth in this legislation would \nenhance the ability of insular watch and jewelry producers to utilize \nthe PIC program while, at the same time, retaining overall PIC program \nunit and dollar value limits. Additionally, the legislation would \nestablish a standby mechanism to mitigate the impact of any possible \nfuture reduction or elimination of watch duties on a worldwide basis \nthrough trade negotiations and congressional action. This mechanism--\nwhich has broad support among the insular and domestic watch \nmanufacturing and distribution sectors--would ensure that any future \nreduction in watch duties does not disturb the relative value of \ncurrent duty incentives and PIC program benefits for the insular watch \nindustry. Importantly, this standby mechanism would have no effect on \ncurrent watch duties or PIC program limits.\n\n  Under the PIC program, producers of watches and jewelry in the U.S. \ninsular possessions are issued certificates by the Department of \nCommerce for specified percentages of the producer's verified \ncreditable wages for production in the insular possessions. Based on \nthese certificates, the producers are entitled to apply to the U.S. \nCustoms Service for refunds on duties paid on watches. Certain \ntechnical provisions of the PIC program, however, impose unnecessary \nburdens on producers. These include unclear definitions, unduly complex \nPIC refund provisions and special issues relating to the extension of \nPIC benefits to jewelry. The legislation that I am introducing today \nincludes technical adjustments to the PIC program to eliminate these \nburdens, while retaining overall PIC program limits on units and \nbenefits.\n  Currently, producers must assemble often voluminous import entry \ninformation and apply to U.S. Customs for wage-based refunds. If a \nproducer has not paid sufficient import duties, the producer must sell \nthe PIC certificate to another firm, which then applies for the duty \nrefund. In either event, the PIC program assures that an insular \nproducer is compensated for a specified percentage of its verified \nproduction wages, regardless of whether it has paid the corresponding \namount of import duties. The bill would simplify this refund process by \nproviding producers with the option of applying directly to the \nTreasury Department for the full amount of their verified PIC program \ncertificates.\n  For watches, the PIC program establishes a 750,000 unit limitation on \nthe number of watches used to calculate an individual producer's PIC \nbenefits. When the PIC program was extended to jewelry by Congress, \nthis upper limit was also extended to each individual jewelry \nproducer's qualifying jewelry production. While this limit may be \nappropriate for watches, which are technically sophisticated and \nrelatively expensive, I am informed that it is likely to unduly limit \njewelry production in the insular possessions, which relies on large \nquantities of relatively lower-priced units. My proposed legislation \nwould address this issue by eliminating the 750,000 unit per producer \nlimit for jewelry, while retaining the overall unit and dollar value \nlimits for the PIC program as a whole.\n  When Congress extended the PIC program to jewelry in 1999, it sought \nto encourage the phased establishment of new jewelry production in the \ninsular possessions through a transition rule. Under this rule, jewelry \nitems that are assembled, but not substantially transformed, in the \ninsular possessions before August 9, 2001 would be eligible for PIC \nprogram and duty-free benefits. Although this new provision has helped \nattract new jewelry production to the USVI, I am informed that some \npotential producers are facing administrative, technical and business \ndelays which may severely erode the benefits of the transition rule. \nThe bill would address this issue by extending this transition rule for \nnew insular jewelry producers for an additional 18 months.\n  The bill would help to facilitate long term planning by existing \ninsular producers and attract new producers to the insular possessions \nby extending the authorized term of the PIC program until 2015. The \nbill would also clarify current law by stating explicitly that verified \nwages include the amount of any fringe benefits.\n  For many years, multinational companies that import substantial \nquantities of foreign-made watches into the United States have sought \nto reduce or eliminate U.S. watch duties, either through multiple \npetitions for duty-free treatment for watches from certain GSP-eligible \ncountries or through worldwide elimination of watch duties in trade \nnegotiations. Insular possession watch producers have repeatedly \nopposed these efforts on the ground that the elimination of duties on \nforeign watches would eliminate the relative benefit that insular \npossession producers receive through duty-free treatment under the \nGeneral Note 3(a) program and, in turn, lead to the eventual demise of \nthe insular watch industry. Successive Congresses and Administrations \nhave agreed with these arguments and refused to erode the benefits that \ninsular possession producers receive under General Note 3(a) and the \nPIC program.\n  These continued battles over watch duties and the insular possession \nwatch program have imposed significant resource burdens on Virgin \nIslands watch producers and the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, \ndiverting resources and energy that could better be spent in enhancing \ngrowth and employment in the insular watch and jewelry industries. \nVirgin Islands watch producers, the AWA and representatives of U.S. \nfirms that import foreign-made watches are seeking to address this \nlongstanding issue by reconciling existing insular possession watch \nbenefits with any worldwide reduction or elimination of watch duties. \nThe legislation that I am introducing contains two mechanisms to help \nmitigate the impact of any future reduction or elimination of watch \nduties, while also preserving existing watch benefits.\n  The bill would put in place a standby mechanism that would preserve \nthe benefits of duty-free treatment under General Note 3(a) in the \nevent that Congress and a future Administration were to agree to \neliminate or reduce duties on watches. This mechanism would preserve \nthe relative tariff advantage that insular producers currently enjoy \nover foreign-made watches by incorporating a ``hold harmless'' \nprovision in the PIC program. Under this standby mechanism, if watch \nduties were reduced or eliminated in the future, PIC payments to \ninsular producers would also include an amount that reflects the value \nto the insular producers of the current General Note 3(a) benefit. This \nmechanism would facilitate the eventual reduction or elimination of \nwatch duties on a worldwide basis while helping to assure that any such \nduty reduction does not lead to the demise of the insular industry.\n  Currently, payments under the PIC program are funded from watch \nduties. An alternative funding source would be required if watch duties \nwere reduced or eliminated on a worldwide basis. The legislation that I \nam introducing provides that PIC benefits can be funded from jewelry \nduties or duties on other appropriate products.\n  It is important to bear in mind that these two mechanisms would only \nbe activated in the event that watch duties are, in fact, reduced or \neliminated in the future--decisions that would require considerable \ndeliberation and consultation by the President and Congress. By \nassuring the continuation of current benefits for insular producers, \nhowever, these mechanisms would greatly mitigate the impact of any \neventual decision by Congress to reduce or eliminate watch duties.\n  Congress has long recognized that the current watch industry \nincentives are critical to the health and survival of the watch \nindustry in the U.S. Virgin Islands. By adopting this legislation, \nCongress can improve the operation of the PIC program for insular watch \nand jewelry producers and establish a mechanism to facilitate the \neventual reduction or elimination of watch duties on a worldwide basis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n                                S. 2385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security act to deny \nsocial security old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits \nto fugitive felons and individuals fleeing prosecution, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Federal Government should not be \npaying benefits to fugitives from justice. Today, I am introducing \nlegislation which denies Social Security Old Age Survivors Insurance, \nOASI, and Social Security Disability Insurance, DI, benefits to \nfugitive felons and requires the Social Security Administration, SSA, \nto disclose information about the fugitives to law enforcement \nofficers. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the distinguished \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley.\n  There is precedent for this legislation in current law. The Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193, \ndisqualified fugitive felons from receiving welfare cash assistance, \nSupplemental Security Income, SSI, food stamps, and housing benefits. \nLikewise, it allowed law enforcement officers to obtain the current \naddresses, photographs, and Social Security numbers of fugitives who \nreceived such assistance. I was the author of these prohibitions on \nFederal assistance for fugitive felons.\n  I am pleased to report that the current fugitive felons law is having \na positive effect. It is saving taxpayers millions of dollars. More \nimportant, it is getting violent criminals off the streets. For \ninstance, the Inspector General of USDA reported that as of January 2, \n2001, more than 6,800 fugitive felon food stamp recipients were \narrested. Similarly, SSA identified more than 28,000 fugitive SSI \nrecipients, 14,000 of whom were identified in fiscal year 2000.\n  The legislation offered by Senator Grassley and myself would further \ncurtail a fugitive's financial ability to escape the law. In testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee on April 25, 2001, James G. Huse, Jr., \nInspector General of the SSA, expressed frustration that SSA does not \nhave the statutory authority to deny OASI and DI benefits to fugitive \nfelons. The inability to cut off benefits to these fugitives costs the \nSocial Security Trust Fund $39 million per year. He also testified that \nthe Privacy Act prohibits SSA from providing law enforcement officials \nwith information, such as the current addresses and Social Security \nnumbers of fugitive felon recipients, which could lead to their \napprehension. Mr. Huse told the Finance Committee,\n\n       . . . this waste of Federal funds goes to the heart of our \n     mission, and our inability to stop these payments is \n     frustrating. What is more frustrating to us as a law \n     enforcement organization is that these benefits were paid to \n     some 17,300 fugitives, many of whom could have been \n     apprehended had my office been able to provide law \n     enforcement agencies with felons' addresses. The loss of \n     money is disturbing; the thousands of criminals that could \n     have been incarcerated but remain free is worse.\n\n  Mr. Huse further advised, ``Congress may want to consider \nlegislation, this session, that will permit us to treat felons as \nfelons, regardless of the types of Social Security benefits they are \nusing to finance their flight from justice.'' That is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  The majority of Americans would agree it is bad policy to pay Federal \nbenefits to fugitives from justice. The effect of such policy is to \ngive criminals the financial means to continue avoiding the law. It is \ntime to close\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nlegal loopholes which allow felons to receive OASI and DI payments \nwhile in fugitive status. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish a Community Corps, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I'm very pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the School Service Act of 2002. This is legislation that can \nhelp foster the next generation of great American citizens.\n  When we think about education, we usually think about English, math, \nscience. But I believe education needs to do more than provide \nknowledge and career skills. It also has to teach citizenship, the \nlesson that America is about not only rights but also responsibilities, \nand that each of us, however humble or wealthy, has a calling to our \ncommunity and to our country. In my view, service to the community \nought to be more than just another afterschool activity, like \nbasketball or photography. Service should be a part of every child's \neducation, as much as math or science or anything else. If our children \nare going to believe in serving their community, we have to give them \nthe experience of service while they're young, so they know in their \nbones that it matters.\n  In the last few months, the President and several of my Senate \ncolleagues have offered proposals to engage more adults Americans in \nexpanded national service programs. These are promising ideas, but I \nbelieve they're left our one key group: school-age students, especially \nhigh schoolers.\n  In the best service initiatives with teenagers, we've seen remarkable \nbenefits, for students and the communities they serve. In one program, \nadults who had completed service projects more than 15 years earlier \nwere still more likely to be volunteers and voters than adults who \nhadn't. In another program, kids who served had a 60 percent lower \ndrop-out rate and 18 percent lower rate of school suspension than kids \nwho didn't.\n  Just as important, the service also has tremendous impacts on \ncommunities. High school kids have built community centers in run-down \nneighborhoods. They've cleaned up polluted ponds. They've helped small \nchildren learn to read, and offered comfort to the elderly and sick. \nPeople in the community say this work is worth four times more than it \nactually costs.\n  It's time to encourage more States and cities to develop service \nprograms for all their students. It's not enough that students study \nhistory to graduate. We should expect them to contribute to history, \ntoo. Some of my favorite models for engaging children in service come \nfrom my own State, in fact, from the high school in Raleigh that my \nchildren have attended.\n  With these thoughts in mind, today I am introducing, together with \nSenator Gordon Smith and Senator Clinton, the School Service Act of \n2002. The proposal is very simple: We say to a limited number of States \nand cities, if you have schools that will make sure students engage in \nhigh-quality service before graduation, we will support those school's \nefforts.\n  The service can be based in the classroom. It can be based in an \nafterschool program. It can be based in a summer program. And it can be \ndirected or supervised by AmeriCorps members who are leaders and \ncoordinators.\n  All that we ask is that you ensure two things:\n  First: real service with real benefits to communities. The \nCorporation's own studies show that a dollar invested in a good service \neffort produces benefits worth over four dollars. We need to keep that \nup.\n  Second: we want service that means something to young people, service \nthat students reflect on and talk about with each other. We want kids \nseeing these experiences not as another chore, but as an exciting \ninitiation into long lives of active citizenship. And we know service \nis often just that. Kids who serve grow up to volunteer more and to \nvote more throughout their lives.\n\n  Finally, our bill will hold these programs to high standards and \nrequire measurable success.\n  Let me stress: I don't think we should require my State or city to do \nanything. Nor should this program operate nationwide. My proposal is \nthat for the State and school districts with schools that are ready, we \nought to make sure every child has the opportunity and the \nresponsibility to engage in service. Here in Congress, it is our \nresponsibility to give those opportunities for service to our young \npeople. When we do, our country will be richly rewarded in the years \nand decades to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 2393. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for individuals who need mental health services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to introduce the Mental \nHealth Patient Rights Act. This legislation will break down one of the \nbarriers faced by thousands of Americans who face discrimination in the \nindividual health insurance market because they have been treated at \nsome time in their life for a mental condition. Senators Kennedy, \nWellstone, and Corzine have joined me in this effort.\n  Each year some 18 million Americans suffer from depression, and fully \na quarter of the country's adult population is faced with some form of \nmental illness. Many of them are not part of group coverage provided by \nemployers and must rely on individual policies that they purchased \nthemselves. Without coverage, many who are dealing with mental disease \ndo not seek treatment. Indeed, repeated surveys have shown that \nconcerns about the cost of mental care is one of the most common \nreasons that individuals decline to seek care. The Mental Health \nPatient Rights Act limits the ability of health care plans to redline \nindividuals with a preexisting mental health condition.\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n  I undertook this initiative when I read a letter from one of my \nIllinois constituents who was turned away from health care plans in the \nprivate nongroup market, due solely to a past history of treatment for \na mental condition. This constituent, whom I will call Mary, suffered \nsevere depression over 10 years ago and received treatment, which was \nsuccessful. It allowed her to return to work.\n  At that time Mary had employer-sponsored health insurance through her \nhusband's employment. But in the fall of 1998, Mary and her husband \nlost this employer-based insurance coverage when Mary's husband lost \nhis job.\n  Mary applied for a comprehensive health insurance plan offered to \nindividuals. Her application was declined because, as per the insurance \ncompany notice, due to her medical history of depression, she did not \nmeet the company's underwriting requirements.\n\n  Mary wrote:\n\n       As I see it, we are being punished for accessing health \n     care. In 1987, when I became clinically depressed, I could \n     have chosen to avoid proper medical care, become unemployed \n     and received Social Security disability. I did not. I \n     obtained the help I needed and continued to support myself, \n     my family and contribute positively to society. Depression is \n     a treatable medical illness. Insurance companies must stop \n     their indiscriminate denial of coverage.\n\n  The Washington Post recently ran a column that documented a similar \nstory about the discrimination that individuals with a history of \nmental illness face in our current health insurance market.\n  The column conveys the dilemma of Michelle Witte who was denied \nhealth insurance coverage because she was successfully treated for \ndepression during her adolescence.\n  Unfortunately, Mary and Michelle are not alone. While the majority of \nAmericans under age 65 have employer-sponsored group coverage, a \nsignificant minority, approximately 12.6 million individuals, rely on \nprivate, individual health insurance.\n  Underwriting in the individual health insurance market is fierce.\n  Just last week The Wall-Street Journal reported that a Wisconsin-\nbased insurer, American Medical Security Group, Inc., is actually re-\nunderwriting individual policies on an annual basis. At each annual \nrenewal, this company reviews the individuals claims filed in the \nprevious year and increases premiums to policyholders whose claims \nexceed the standard. Under the current system of care in the United \nStates, individuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of \ntreatment for mental illness may find it particularly difficult to \nobtain private health insurance, especially if they must purchase it on \ntheir own and do not have an employer-sponsored group plan available to \nthem.\n  That is why I have introduced this legislation. The Mental Health \nPatients' Rights Act closes this loophole by limiting any preexisting \ncondition exclusion relating to a mental health condition to not more \nthan 12 months and reducing this exclusion period by the total amount \nof previous continuous coverage.\n  It prohibits any health insurer that offers health coverage in the \nindividual insurance market from imposing a preexisting condition \nexclusion relating to a mental health condition unless a diagnosis, \nmedical advice or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 \nmonths prior to the enrollment date.\n  And it prohibits health plans in the individual market from charging \nhigher premiums to individuals based solely on the determination that \nthe individual has had a preexisting mental health condition.\n  These provisions apply to all health plans in the individual market, \nregardless of whether a state has enacted an alternative mechanism, \nsuch as high risk pool, to cover individuals with preexisting health \nconditions.\n  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act complements ongoing efforts to \nenhance parity between mental health services and other health \nbenefits.\n  This is because parity alone will not help individuals who do not \nhave access to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting \nmental illness discrimination.\n  The Patients' Rights Act does not mandate that insurers provide \nmental health services if they are not already offering such coverage. \nIt simply prohibits plans in the private non-group market from \nredlining individuals who apply for general health insurance based \nsolely on a past history of treatment for a mental condition.\n  The legislation is backed by more than compelling anecdotal stories. \nI asked for a study from the GAO and last month they told me the new \nstudy documents that individuals with mental disorders, past or \npresent, face restrictions in purchasing health insurance in the \nindividual market that exceed restrictions for physical health \npreexisting conditions in the same cost category.\n  GAO interviewed insurance carriers that sell individual market \ninsurance and sell insurance in most of the 34 states in which carriers \nare permitted to medically underwrite.\n  Collectively, these insurers cover more than one million individuals \nrepresenting more than 10 percent of all individual market enrollees. \nResearchers found that carriers denied coverage for applicants with \nselected mental disorders more than half of the time, while denying \ncoverage for applicants with other selected chronic conditions just 30 \npercent of the time.\n  Even in states which have established subsidized insurance options as \na coverage option for applicants rejected in the individual insurance \nmarket, sometimes called high-risk pools, these options have higher \npremium rates.\n  High-risk pools also may include more restrictions on mental health \nbenefits than other benefits and many have waiting lists due to budget \nconstraints.\n  In the seven states without high-risk pools and without guaranteed \nissue requirements, applicants with a history of mental illness are \nlikely to find themselves without any viable health insurance coverage \noption.\n  In other words, it is not about money. If the insurance company wants \nto ask you if you have a history in your family of cancer, heart \ndisease, diabetes, things that might have some impact on the cost of \nhealth insurance, it is understood that is part of underwriting. But \nnow they are including mental illness as part of this inquiry, and \nregardless of the fact that it doesn't seem to be, or prove out to be \nas expensive to the insurance companies, they are just discriminating \nagainst people who have this history of mental illness.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation.\n  It does not make sense that a person is rendered uninsurable for all \nhealth needs simply because he or she seeks treatment for mental \nillness. Mental illness is a disease just as cancer or asthma or the \nflu is a disease.\n  Yet it is clear that when it comes to mental health millions of \nAmericans must battle not only with their disease, but for their access \nto adequate insurance coverage.\n  I invite my colleagues to enlist in this important initiative to \nensure that such individuals are not discriminated against when \napplying for health insurance coverage.\n  More than 80 organizations representing consumers, family members, \nhealth professionals and providers have endorsed the Mental Health \nPatient Rights Act. I urge you to do the same.\n  Some of us who saw the movie, ``A Beautiful Mind,'' are reminded that \nthere are people who have suffered from mental illness who have \nrecovered and made great contributions to America, as John Nash has at \nPrinceton, and as those who have been involved in so many other walks \nof life. It is unfair in America for us to discriminate against a \nperson because of a history of mental illness. Yet it is a fact of \nlife.\n  I salute my colleagues, Senators Wellstone and Domenici, for their \nleadership on this issue. I join them in their effort and hope this \nbill will complement what they are doing to not only make mental \nillness subject to coverage by health insurance but also to end this \ndiscrimination against those who have a history of that illness. We \nshould be working to break down the stigma of mental illness, not to \nmaintain it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\n                                S. 2393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
