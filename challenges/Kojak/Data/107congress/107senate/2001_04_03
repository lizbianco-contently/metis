The Diocese of Manchester, of course, \nencompasses the entire State of New Hampshire. He is also the pastor of \nSt. Pius X parish in Manchester where he shows great compassion for the \npoor and the needy.\n  As secretary for administration, Father Ed is responsible for the \ndaily operation of the diocesan administration, and as chancellor he \noversees the maintenance of all records in the diocesan archives and \nserves as executive assistant to Bishop John B. McCormack in the daily \noperations of the bishop's office.\n  Father Ed holds a masters in divinity from St. Mary's Seminary in \nnearby Emmitsburg, MD. He was ordained a priest by Bishop Leo O'Neil on \nJune 1, 1991.\n  Father Ed is very special to me and my family because he is our \nspiritual adviser and has been for many years. He sponsored my wife \nMary Jo as she actually converted to Catholicism. Father Ed also \npresided over the marriage of my daughter Jenny to her husband Eric in \nNew Hampshire in 1998.\n  It is a privilege to have Father Ed join us in the Senate to share \nhis words of prayer with our Nation. Father Ed's friendship and \nspiritual guidance have been a blessing to me and my family\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\nfor many, many years. I am proud and honored to sponsor Father Ed as \nguest Chaplain.\n  I thank my friend, the Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd Ogilvie, for \nallowing Father Ed to be here.\n  Also, I recognize Father Ed's brother, Michael, his aunt Jeri, and \nmother Ann who are here today to witness this wonderful occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3290-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3290-S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                               2001-2011\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H. Con. Res. 83, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) establishing the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2002, revising the congressional budget for the \n     United States Government for fiscal year 2001, and setting \n     forth appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years \n     2003 through 2011.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Amendment No. 170, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am working with the ranking member on \na startup schedule this morning. I suggest the absence of a quorum to \nbe charged to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have begun debate on the budget \nresolution, the budget resolution for the country for the next year. \nUnder the rules of the Senate, we are also required to put it in the \ncontext and the framework of a 10-year budget, and so begins what is in \nmany ways perhaps the single most important debate that we will have \nthis year. It is the question of choices we make with respect to the \npriorities of the Nation.\n  Our President has said on many occasions that it is the people's \nmoney; we ought to give the money back to the people. I think all agree \nthat the President is exactly right when he says it is the people's \nmoney. Of course it is. That is exactly right. But I think we also \nunderstand that there are more choices than just giving the money back \nto the people by way of a tax cut. There are certain things that we do \ncollectively as the people of a nation which we cannot do individually: \nfor example, providing for our national defense.\n  There are other things that we do as a society to make it a better \nnation. We have a Social Security system to safeguard our elderly. We \nhave a Medicare program to provide for the health of our senior \ncitizens. We have support for education because we all understand that \nis the Nation's future.\n  We also have a national debt, a publicly held debt that, as we meet \nhere today, is $3.4 trillion. But there is another debt that we don't \ntalk very much about. That is the gross debt of the United States. That \ngross debt is $5.6 trillion. While we say many times we are paying down \nthe publicly held debt, and that is true, it is also true that the \ngross debt of the United States is actually increasing. I think that \nconfuses many people.\n  The publicly held debt is that debt which is held by people outside \nof the Government. It is debt held by the public. And the public is not \njust the public here in America; the debt is also held abroad. It is \nheld by Japan, by Germany, and by other countries. That is the publicly \nheld debt, $3.4 trillion as we meet here today.\n  But the gross debt of the United States is the debt not only owed to \nthe public but the debt that is owed to other government entities. For \nexample, the trust funds of the United States--the general fund of the \nUnited States owes the Social Security trust fund hundreds of billions \nof dollars. Under the President's proposal and under all other \nproposals, the way we are going to be paying down the publicly held \ndebt is to take the surpluses that are in Social Security and use those \nto pay down the publicly held debt. Because the money is not needed by \nSocial Security at the moment, and will not be needed for the next \ndecade, that money is in surplus. It is those surpluses--the surpluses \nthat are in the trust funds--that are being used to pay down the \npublicly held debt.\n  While we pay down that publicly held debt, obviously we are creating \nanother debt. The debt we are creating as we pay down the publicly held \ndebt with trust fund moneys is a debt to the trust funds from the \ngeneral fund of the United States. That debt is increasing.\n  While we talk about surpluses, I think we should be ever mindful that \nthese surpluses are temporary. When we get past this 10-year period, we \nare going to face, instead of surpluses, deficits. We know that. The \nComptroller General of the United States has warned that we will face a \ndemographic tidal wave when the baby boom generation retires. And then \nthese surpluses turn to substantial deficits.\n\n  With that in mind, the Democratic alternative to the budget proposed \nby our colleagues on the other side has adopted these fundamental \nprinciples. First, we protect the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds in every year. Second, we pay down a maximum amount of the \npublicly held debt. Third, we provide for an immediate fiscal stimulus \nof $60 billion to give some lift to this economy. In fact, we believe \nthat is what we ought to be debating on the floor of the Senate this \nweek. We think we ought to be talking about the fiscal stimulus \npackage. Instead of a budget resolution talking about the next 10 \nyears, we ought to be talking about a fiscal stimulus package for this \nyear. Fourth, we believe we should provide significant tax relief for \nall Americans, including rate reduction, marriage penalty relief, and \nestate tax reform.\n  In addition, our budget reserves resources for high-priority domestic \nneeds, including improving education, a prescription drug benefit, \nstrengthening of our national defense, and funding agriculture. Those \nare very clear priorities of the American people.\n  The American people tell us in meeting after meeting: We want you to \nimprove education. We want you to invest in our kids. And they are \nright. Our budget responds to that call. They also say: We want a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit. We know that the pattern and \npractice of medicine have changed since Medicare was enacted and we \nought to have a modernized Medicare, one that includes a prescription \ndrug benefit. That is costly. But we have provided for it in our \nbudget. And strengthening our national defense; there is broad \nbipartisan consensus that our defense must be strengthened. Additional \nresources must be provided. If they are going to be provided, they have \nto be in the budget. That is what we have done with our budget. \nFinally, we have provided $750 billion to strengthen Social Security \nand to begin to address our long-term debt. We think that is critically \nimportant.\n  The budget on the other side provides nothing for this purpose--no \ndollars to strengthen Social Security for the long term. Not any \ninvestment in dealing with our long-term debt which is coming as \ncertainly as night follows day.\n\n  We believe these are the priorities of the American people that ought \nto be included in any budget. I will go to the specifics that \ndemonstrate we have kept faith with those principles.\n  We start with the projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. As I said last \nnight, it is important that we remember this is just a projection. It \nmay not come true. In fact, if there is one thing of which we are \ncertain, it is the uncertainty of this forecast. Even the agency that \nmade the forecast says it is highly uncertain. The people who made the \nforecast say to us there is only a 10-percent chance that number is \ngoing to come true--10 percent. They say there is a 45-percent chance \nthere will be more money. They say there is a 45-percent chance there \nwill be less money. Which way would you bet, after the events of the \nlast 8 weeks since this forecast was made? Is the economy strengthening \nor weakening? Is it more likely the money will be less than forecast or \nmore than forecast? I feel safe in predicting it is likely to be less \nthan was forecast.\n  Whether that is right or that is wrong, the reality is we know $5.6 \ntrillion over 10 years is a very uncertain projection. When the \nforecasting agency made the estimate, they informed\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\nus, looking at their previous forecasts and the variance from what they \nprojected and what actually came true, they said this could be anywhere \nfrom a $50 billion deficit to over a $1 trillion surplus in the 5th \nyear alone, based on the previous variances in their forecasts. So it \nis highly uncertain.\n  Then we take out the Social Security trust fund. We protect it. We \nprotect the Medicare trust fund. That leaves us with a non-Social \nSecurity non-Medicare remainder of $2.7 trillion that is left.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, put up a very interesting chart \nlast night. He started with the same projection of surplus, but when he \nsubtracted out trust funds, he only subtracted out the Social Security \ntrust fund. There was not any mention of the Medicare trust fund in his \npresentation. There was no mention at all. I guess that should not be \nsurprising because he has argued there is no Medicare trust fund. He \nsaid there is no surplus in the Medicare trust fund.\n  That is not what the law says. That is not what the actuaries say. \nThat is not what the reports of the Congressional Budget Office say. \nThat is not what the President's own budget document says. All of them \nmake very clear there is a trust fund surplus in Social Security and \nthere is a trust fund surplus in Medicare. Medicare Part A has a \nsurplus of anywhere from $400 billion to $500 billion. The \nCongressional Budget Office says it is $400 billion. The President's \nbudget document says it is over $500 billion. Medicare Part B is in \nrough balance over the 10-year period.\n  The Senator from Texas says: Oh, no, Part B is in deficit. It is not \nin deficit. That is just not so. He tries to make the case by saying \nonly 25 percent of the funding for Medicare Part B comes from premiums; \n75 percent comes from the general fund. That has nothing to do with \nbeing in deficit. That has to do with the law that we have passed in \nthe Congress. We have said 25 percent of the funding of Part B will \ncome from premiums and 75 percent will come from the general fund. It \nhas nothing to do with being in deficit.\n  So the reality is there is a trust fund surplus in Medicare of $400 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office--$500 billion \naccording to the President's own budget documents. We believe every \npenny of it ought to be protected. It should not be raided for any \nother purpose. That is a fundamental difference between the budget \noffering on this side and the budget offering that we make. We believe \nthis money should not be shuffled off to some contingency fund \navailable for other uses. We believe it ought to be protected in each \nand every year.\n\n  Of what is left, we believe a third ought to go for a tax cut. That \nwould be a net tax cut excluding the interest cost of $745 billion over \nthe next 10 years. We believe that is affordable.\n  Then we believe about a third ought to go for these high-priority \ndomestic needs. We have made very clear and very specific what those \nneeds are: $311 billion for a prescription drug benefit. That funds a \nprescription drug benefit that would be available to all who are \nMedicare eligible. It would be on a voluntary basis. It would be a \nsignificant benefit--not the most generous, by any means, of those that \nhave been offered on the floor of the Senate in various proposals but \nnonetheless a significant benefit. The President's proposal is half as \nmuch. But of course 75 percent of people who are on Medicare will get \nno benefit under the President's plan. We do not think that is a \nserious prescription drug benefit plan.\n  We provide $193 billion for infrastructure and education. It is not \nenough to just talk about these as priorities. If they are priorities, \nthey need to be funded, and no one is more important than education.\n  Third, we provide $100 billion over the 10-year period for additional \nresources for our national defense because we think that is critically \nimportant as we go forward and, fourth, we provide another $140 billion \nfor other mandatory and health care expenditures. A very big chunk of \nthis is for health care expansion so more people can be covered. We do \nnot make the specific decision in the budget resolution about how that \nshould be done, but we provide the resources so it can be done.\n  Then we take a third of the non-trust-fund money and use it to \naddress our long-term debt: $750 billion to strengthen Social Security \nbecause that is the source of most of our long-term debt. This $750 \nbillion is also available as a strategic reserve in case these \nprojections aren't ready.\n  Then the interest costs associated with the other elements of the \nplan, because anytime you cut taxes, anytime you spend money, that \nincreases your interest cost because the money is not paying down debt. \nIf we are not providing a tax cut, if we are not spending money, then \nwe are using it to pay down debt. To the extent we pay down debt, we \nreduce interest costs. So if we use the money for other purposes, if we \nprovide a tax cut as we do, or if we spend money on high-priority \ndomestic needs as we do, then there is less money going to pay down \ndebt and that means additional interest costs.\n  Let me make the point that we are doing far more dedicating of \nresources to paying down debt than our friends on the other side of the \naisle. The President has said he would dedicate $2 trillion to paying \ndown debt and his $2 trillion comes from the Social Security trust \nfund. We have reserved all of that money from the trust funds for \npaying down publicly held debt, $2.5 trillion plus $400 billion for the \nMedicare trust fund. So we are dedicating more money to paying down the \npublicly held debt than is the plan on the other side. In addition, we \nhave reserved $750 billion for the long-term debt.\n  We have tried not only to emphasize the short-term debt and the \npublicly held debt but to also focus on the long-term debt facing our \nNation. If you add the one-third of what remains after we protect the \ntrust funds with the trust funds money which will go to paying down \ndebt, we have a combined total of nearly $3.7 trillion out of the $5.6 \ntrillion for paying down short-term and long-term debt.\n  That is the fundamental difference between our plan and their plan. \nThey have a much bigger tax cut. We have much more for paying down \nshort-term and long-term debt.\n  The Senator from Texas tried to say last night that the real \ndifference is spending. No, it isn't. There are some differences in \nspending because we make more of a commitment to these high-priority \ndomestic needs--education, prescription drugs, national defense, health \ncare, and expansion. We spend more money in those high-priority areas. \nBut that isn't the biggest difference between us. The biggest \ndifference between us is that we have reserved over two-thirds of these \nprojected surpluses for paying down short-term and long-term debt. The \nPresident has reserved about 35 percent of the money for that purpose.\n  I have done this comparison chart to try to get at the heart of the \ndifferences between our proposal and their proposal.\n  You can see from the GOP budget that while the President says he will \nonly use $2 trillion to pay down publicly held debt, his budget numbers \nactually show that he is using all of the Social Security money for \npaying down publicly held debt. We do the same.\n  On the Medicare trust fund, we have reserved all $400 billion. The \nPresident's proposal has taken that money and put it in an unallocated \ncategory. We will get to that as we go through this comparison.\n  On tax cuts, the President proposes $1.6 trillion; we propose $745 \nbillion.\n  On spending, the President proposes $713 billion over the 10 years \nabove the so-called baseline. We are at $743 billion because of the \nhigh-priority domestic needs of education, health care, prescription \ndrugs, and national defense.\n  Here is the place where there is a major difference. We have the \nstrategic reserve to strengthen Social Security and deal with our long-\nterm debt. They have nothing for that purpose in their budget. We have \n$750 billion.\n  As I indicated before, the interest cost on the Republican budget is \n$472 billion; $490 billion in our plan.\n  If you add up the totals in the Republican plan, it comes to $4.8 \ntrillion, ours is $5.6 trillion, and they have left unallocated $846 \nbillion. Let's remember that $400 billion of that is from the Medicare \ntrust funds. They call it unallocated. It is fully allocated. It is \nfully committed. It is committed to the trust fund.\n  By saying it is unallocated, by saying it is available for a \ncontingency, they are opening up the Medicare trust fund\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\nfor the raid--the raid that has gone on in the past, the raid we have \nbeen able to stop the last 3 years. They are getting ready to raid the \nMedicare trust fund all over again.\n  If we take that out of their contingency fund, we are left with just \nunder $500 billion. That is not enough to cover education, prescription \ndrugs, national defense, and the alternative minimum tax reform that is \nmade necessary by the President's tax cut plan because the President's \ntax cut plan which he advertises as costing $1.6 trillion actually will \ncost a great deal more than that because it will require us to change \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n\n  Currently, about 2 million people are caught up in the alternative \nminimum tax. The President's plan will put over 30 million people under \nthe alternative minimum tax. Boy, are they in for a big surprise. They \nthought they were going to get a tax cut. They thought they were going \nto get a reduction. What they are going to get is caught up in the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Thirty-million taxpayers--nearly one in four taxpayers in our \ncountry--are going to be caught up in the alternative minimum tax under \nthe President's plan. It costs $300 billion to fix. On top of his $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut, it will cost another $300 billion to fix the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Then, of course, you have the interest cost associated with the \nPresident's tax cut and fixing the alternative minimum tax. That is \nanother $500 billion. Now we are talking real money.\n  The reported cost of $1.6 trillion, of course, is reestimated by the \nbudget experts of the Congress. I can tell you that they reestimated \njust part of his plan and they found it costs much more than $1.6 \ntrillion. Over in the House, they reestimated just part of his plan and \nit went up in cost by $126 billion.\n  The $1.6 trillion plan, the $1.7 billion plan, then you have to fix \nthe alternative minimum tax, which is another $300 billion, and then \nyou have the associated interest costs, which is another $500 billion. \nNow you are talking real money--$2.5 trillion from their supposed \nprojected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion.\n  Unfortunately, $3.1 trillion of that, according to the President's \nnumbers--because his is slightly different from the Congressional \nBudget Office number--$3.1 trillion of that $5.67 trillion is trust \nfund money. It is trust fund money--$3.1 trillion of $5.6 trillion is \ntrust fund money.\n  Then you take the President's tax plan; it costs $2.5 trillion when \nyou include all of the costs. You can see he has used all the non-\ntrust-fund money for his tax cut plan. That is the fundamental problem \nwith the President's plan. That is the fundamental problem with trying \nto find a way to get his plan to add up.\n  For just a moment I would like to talk about the question of \nreconciliation. Very soon we may face the vote on reconciliation. I \nthink it may be one of the most important votes not just in this debate \nbut it may be one of the most important votes in all of our service \ntime in the Senate. It may be one of the most important votes that \naffects the role of this institution. Why do I say that?\n  Reconciliation was created for deficit reduction. It was created to \nshort-circuit the normal way of doing Senate business, giving Senators \nthe right to extend debate and giving Senators the right to amend \nlegislation. The reason Senators were given those rights was that our \nFounding Fathers believed it was critical to the constitutional \nfunctioning of the U.S. Congress.\n  They created the House of Representatives with Members serving 2-year \nterms to respond to the heat of the moment, to respond to the public \npassion. They created the Senate to be the cooling saucer, to be the \nplace where debate and amendment could prevent serious mistakes. That \nis the constitutional role of the Senate. It is absolutely critically \nimportant to the functioning of our democracy.\n  Reconciliation sweeps all of that away. Reconciliation has special \nprocedures that allow only 20 hours of consideration of legislation on \nthe floor of the Senate--no extended debate, no right by every Senator \nto amendment. That is all out the window. That reconciliation process \nwas put in place for a purpose. The purpose was the deficit crisis that \nwas facing the country. It was designed to be a way to raise taxes and \ncut spending to reduce deficits. That is why reconciliation was put in \nplace. It was not designed for programs to increase spending or to cut \ntaxes. That is just the opposite of for what reconciliation was \ncreated. I repeat, reconciliation was created for deficit reduction.\n  It would be a perversion of the reconciliation process to use it for \nspending or for tax cuts. That is not deficit reduction. That is the \nopposite of deficit reduction. That is for what reconciliation ought to \nbe reserved. Everything else ought to be under the regular order of the \nSenate, permitting Senators the right to extended debate, permitting \nSenators the right to amend because that is the constitutional role for \nthis body. To change that role is a fundamental threat to the \nconstitutional structure of the Senate.\n  Nothing could be more important in this debate because if we \nfundamentally make the Senate of the United States into the House of \nRepresentatives, we have fundamentally changed the nature of this \ninstitution. We have fundamentally--and perhaps for all time--altered \nwhat our Founding Fathers intended for the Senate.\n  I remember so well back in 1993-1994, there was a different \nadministration, there was a different hot issue of the moment; it was \nhealth care. A group of us, including the father of the distinguished \noccupant of the chair who was part of a group, a bipartisan group, were \ngiven the primary responsibility to write a health care reform bill. \nThat administration very much wanted that legislation. It was their \nhighest priority. But they knew they could not get it through the \nregular order. They could not get it through the regular Senate \nprocess. They could not get 60 votes to stop a filibuster.\n  So they came to a group of us and asked us if we would support the \nuse of the reconciliation process for a massive new spending program, a \n$138 billion spending program to expand health care coverage. And that \ngroup of us said: No. As much as we wanted to reform the health care \nsystem, as much as we wanted to expand coverage, we said that would be \nan abuse of the reconciliation process because it was not for deficit \nreduction, it was for new spending, and we could not go along with that \nrequest. We could not support it because it went beyond a procedural \nquestion.\n  That was a fundamental question of the operation of this institution, \na fundamental question of the operation of the Senate and its \nconstitutional role. We could no more support the use of reconciliation \nfor a spending program as we could for a tax-cutting program because \nneither were intended to be used under the special rules of \nreconciliation that reduced the rights of each and every Senator to \nextended debate and the right to amendment.\n\n  In fact, under reconciliation we are limited to 20 hours on the floor \nof the Senate, and one side or the other can give back all of its time. \nThey can give back 10 hours. Then you are down to 10 hours, 10 hours of \ndebate and amendment on a bill that would provide a $2 trillion tax \ncut.\n  Is that what our Founding Fathers intended? Is that what the Founding \nFathers intended for the Senate, that there would be a limitation and a \nrestriction on debate, on something that would provide a $2 trillion \ntax cut, that that should be limited to 10 hours of debate and \namendment? I do not think so. I do not think that is what they \nintended.\n  I do not think that is what they intended for a spending measure \neither. I do not think they ever intended you could only have 10 hours \nof debate and discussion on something that could spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. No, no. That was not the role of the Senate. That \nfundamentally threatens the role of the Senate. That undermines the \nrole of the Senate. That neuters this Senate. And if we neuter that \nrole, we have fundamentally altered what our Founding Fathers intended.\n  This goes way beyond the question of a tax cut. This goes to \neveryone's vision of what this Chamber should be about. I believe, as \nour Founding Fathers did, that the role of the Senate is to be the \ncooling saucer. This is where we should have extended debate. This is \nwhere Senators should have the\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\nright to offer amendments, and to have them voted on, and to have our \ncolleagues ultimately held accountable as to their votes. There should \nbe no rush to judgment. There should be no process that short-circuits \nall of the protections that are given to individual Senators so they \ncan represent their individual States and protect the rights of a \nminority. When I am asked what the fundamental problem is with the \nbudget plan that has been offered by the other side, I go back to this \nchart because, to me, the numbers tell the story. We start with a \nprojected surplus of $5.6 trillion. But $2.6 trillion of that is Social \nSecurity; $500 billion is Medicare. Now, these numbers are slightly \ndifferent than the numbers I used on my chart because I was using CBO \nnumbers. We are required to do that in the Budget Committee. These are \nthe President's numbers. Instead of a Social Security trust fund that \nthe Congressional Budget Office says amounts to $2.5 trillion, the \nPresident says it is $2.6 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays the Medicare trust fund is $400 billion; the President's office \nsays $500 billion. This is the President's budget. So I am using the \nPresident's numbers.\n  That leaves us with $2.5 trillion of non-trust-fund money. We take \nout the Bush tax cut--$1.7 trillion, as reestimated by the House--we \ntake out the cost of the alternative minimum tax reform that will be \nrequired by his plan--it is not part of his plan, but it is required by \nit--that costs another $300 billion, the interest cost--$500 billion--\nof the tax cut and the alternative minimum tax fix and the Bush \nspending proposals above the baseline of $200 billion. That adds up to \n$2.7 trillion, and the President is ``in the hole'' by $200 billion.\n  Where does it come from? There is only one place I can find it can \ncome from, and that is the trust funds. That is the problem with the \nPresident's plan. It does not add up. It is right into the trust funds \nbefore we ever get started.\n  Mr. President, I see there are Members waiting to offer amendments. \nBy prior agreement, I am going to stop talking for the moment, and we \nwill have remarks from the other side of the aisle, and then we will go \nto the first amendment, which will be an amendment from our side on \nprescription drugs. With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the kindness of my colleague \nand good friend from North Dakota.\n  We have a lot of work to do this week. I know we are going to be \ngetting to amendments, but I thought it would be important to talk a \nlittle bit about the ``Blueprint for New Beginnings'' submitted by the \nPresident on February 28 and how we intend to implement our agenda in \nthis congressional budget resolution offered by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee.\n  As we all know, the Congressional Budget Act puts a deadline on \nadoption of the budget resolution. It must be signed, sealed, and \ndelivered by April 15. That is an important deadline for a couple of \nreasons. It is the tax filing deadline. As Americans put together their \ntax returns, they see newspaper stories about how their tax money is \nbeing spent. We certainly have their attention then, and taxpayers who \ncalculate the tax burden say: What am I getting in return? Then they \nsee the details of the budget in their newspapers and they get to \ndecide whether it is worth it or not. Are they getting all the \nGovernment they deserve, or are they paying for too much Government?\n  Second, April 15, an early deadline, is important to keep us on track \nfor the rest of the year. As a member of the Appropriations Committee \nas well as the Budget Committee, I know that the two committees have to \nwork together to figure out how much we are going to spend for the \ncoming year, and then the subcommittees need to work up the 13 \nindividual bills to meet these targets. We should pass them and sign \nthem into law by October 1.\n  We have had trouble getting the appropriations bills passed on time \nin recent years and I guess even before then. Last year the complete \npackage was not signed into law until December 21. By that time, \nseveral of us had already written our letters to Santa Claus. We would \nhave rather gotten a lump of coal in our stocking than to be still \ndealing with appropriations bills at that late date.\n  If we were to miss the budget deadline now, it would make our \ntimeframe even more of a problem, and we could lag further and further \nbehind the rest of the year.\n  There was a very interesting exchange last Friday about that between \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nArizona. I say this is one of the central issues that often gets \noverlooked in this discussion. If we miss the deadline now, we are set \nup for missing deadlines all year long, deadlines we have enough \ntrouble meeting as it is.\n  These are not simply arbitrary dates that do not matter. When we fail \nto have a budget in place by the start of the fiscal year, the agencies \nare severely affected. They do not know how to plan, they are put in \nlimbo, and we pass short-term continuing resolutions. That just keeps \nthe doors open and keeps us busy with make-work, passing of the short-\nterm continuing resolutions.\n  One cannot develop a consistent year's plan for the operation of an \nagency with a stop-and-start, stop-and-start continuing resolution \nagenda. This causes agencies and the programs to be less effective in \nserving our citizens. In turn, we get further behind in our \npreparations as well.\n  I am unwilling to say that we can afford to miss the April 15 \ndeadline facing us knowing that to do so will put us even further \nbehind. We must move forward using the best information we have, and \nthe information we have turns out to be pretty good.\n  We expect a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. Out of \nthat, we set aside $2.5 trillion of Social Security money. A bipartisan \nconsensus has already developed that this money should be used for \nSocial Security. It is not used for additional spending. It goes to pay \ndown the debt held by the public, and that is the only way we can put \nmoney in the bank.\n\n  We gave ourselves a little extra leeway, a little extra breathing \nroom so we can borrow again down the road when we need to pay benefits \nto retiring baby boomers. That is $2.5 billion in debt reduction, \nputting that money, again, to use for Social Security later.\n  Some have said we do not do much debt reduction under the President's \nproposal. Mr. President, $2.5 trillion is not enough? That is out of a \ntotal of $3.4 trillion in debt held by the public.\n  At the end of the 10 years covered by this budget resolution, less \nthan $1 trillion will be left of the debt. We know that under this \nformula we will retire all the debt that is actually possible to \nretire. The only question is when we will reach that point.\n  Federal debt is used as an investment for many Americans and other \npeople around the world. Pension plans use it as a safe place to put \ntheir funds. They will not want to part with it unless we pay a big \npremium to make it worth their while to give up that investment. It \nmakes no sense for us to pay down debt to the point that we would have \nto pay a premium to buy back the obligations that people hold.\n  I do not know about the occupant of the chair, but certainly in our \nfamily when my son was growing up, we bought savings bonds. We expected \nover a period of time the Federal Government would pay the interest on \nthat debt and that he would have a long-term investment in a federally \nguaranteed, federally safe investment. To buy all those savings bonds \nback, as well as the bonds held by funds, not only disrupts the \nplanning in the private sector, but probably cannot be done without \npaying a premium.\n  When I say there is only so much debt we can pay down, I believe any \neconomist will tell you the price to buy some of that debt down is \nexorbitant. There is no reason for us to pay down debt before it is due \nif we are going to have to pay a premium.\n  After we set aside Social Security money and pay pretty much all the \ndebt we can, we still have $3.1 trillion left. That is a lot of money \nto meet critical priorities.\n  One of the priorities, obviously, is Medicare. Since this program was \nset up in the sixties, medicine has made tremendous progress. Problems \nthat required expensive hospital stays now\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\ncan be treated with prescription drugs. It is cheaper for the taxpayer \nand better for the patient. It makes sense to have a reformed Medicare \nplan that includes prescription drug coverage.\n  Clearly, one of the things we must do in this Congress is reform \nMedicare. Fortunately, we have bipartisan work going on with the \nSenator from Louisiana and the Senator from Tennessee coming up with a \nplan that makes some sense instead of the current plan where we have \nthe Government trying to control the costs merely by setting prices \nwhen the patients and the providers control the usage.\n  As I have said before, that system does not make sense. The Health \nCare Financing Administration, which is right in the middle of the \nsystem, has made it even worse. They have imposed arbitrary cuts. For \nexample, they have put more than one-third of the home health care \nagencies in the Nation out of business by demanding too great a cut in \ntheir reimbursement. We need to put Medicare on a sound footing. We \nneed to blow up the current function of HCFA and move into a system \nthat has some rational being, some commonsense approach to ensuring \nthat we provide the services and that we do so in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  I hope we will get to the Medicare reform proposal because people in \nthe health care field tell us that Medicare and HCFA are the biggest \nproblems. Over the last 8 to 10 years, the problems we have seen with \nHCFA administering Medicare under the Balanced Budget Act have been \nhuge. They are probably the most unresponsive agency in the Federal \nGovernment. If our experience in small business is anything like the \nexperience other committees have had, we can assure our colleagues this \nis a system that is not working.\n  We will have the money in Medicare for reform. There is surplus in \none of the Medicare trust funds. The hospital insurance trust funds \nwill be nearly $400 billion over the next 10 years. This budget \nresolution ensures all that money can be used for Medicare purposes, \nand it allows us to pay, at least in part, for prescription drug \ncoverage.\n\n  I believe my colleague on the other side of the aisle rounded that \nfigure up to $500 billion, but the figures we have are about $392 \nbillion. That is a little bit of a rounding up error.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I tried to make clear in my presentation, and I know the \nSenator wasn't here, there are two different sets of numbers. One is \nthe President's number from the Office of Management and Budget. He \nsays there is $500 billion in the Medicare trust fund Part A. The CBO \nsays $400 billion or the specific amount of $392. That is the \ndifference.\n  I have tried to be clear throughout on those differences, that it is \na difference between the agencies. The CBO that we must use says $400 \nbillion, and the President's Office of Management and Budget says $526 \nbillion. That is the difference.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague. As he said, we do use Congressional \nBudget Office numbers in the congressional budget resolution.\n  In any event, we will round that up to $400 billion. I think we found \na basis of agreement. We have already overcome one of the big hurdles, \nand we now, at least for this side, agree it is $400 billion.\n  However, one of the fundamental issues that separates our side of the \naisle from our Democratic friends is what we do with that money. It is \nset aside for Medicare. I agree with Senator Domenici and voted on \nMarch 13 for his version of the lockbox that allows Medicare money to \nbe spent on Medicare. It sounds like common sense to me. That is what \nwe have a trust fund for, to provide for Medicare. So let's use it. \nThat is how we make prescription drugs affordable. That is how we make \nMedicare reforms and make the programs stronger, solvent for the long \nterm, and ensure our senior citizens will continue to have not only \nMedicare coverage but, if they have prescription drug coverage, they \nwill continue that. If they don't, they will have a prescription drug \noption and low-income seniors will get assistance for their \nprescription drug payments.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle want to lock the money \naway completely with a flawed so-called lockbox that would not allow \nMedicare money to be used for Medicare. We don't think that makes \nsense. That approach would have jeopardized the growing consensus that \nwe need to provide prescription drug coverage. The Democratic approach \nwould have made it unaffordable. Medicare money should be spent for \nMedicare. I am committed to that. But the so-called lockbox that \nwouldn't allow Medicare money to be spent even on Medicare is \ncounterproductive and unrealistic.\n  Finally, after setting aside Social Security money, after paying down \nas much debt as we can, and after making prescription drug coverage \navailable in a reform Medicare program, we have money left over to \nreturn to the hard-working folks who earned it in the first place--or, \nbetter yet, not really returning it; we are leaving it in their \npockets.\n  I don't know how many of you have the workout T-shirt that I have \nfrom the small business community. It says it is the money that we sent \nto Washington; it is not the IRS. It is not theirs; it is ours. We are \nsending it to Washington because they need it. If Washington doesn't \nneed it, we need to leave it in their pockets. We need to leave it in \nthe pockets of the hard-working American families who have debts they \nhave to pay. They have needs they have to secure for their families. \nOur proposal would leave more of that money in their pockets.\n\n  We have $1.6 trillion in tax relief. Leaving that money in the \npockets of families, farmers, and small businesses will have a \ntremendous impact.\n  As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I listen to small \nbusinesses every day, 21.2 million of whom are taxed at personal rates. \nIn other words, the taxes from the businesses flow to them. They are \neither proprietorships or partnerships or limited liability \ncorporations, subchapter S. corporations, and instead of being taxed in \nthe corporate entity, they are taxed at the personal level. Mr. \nPresident, 21.2 million pay income taxes based on personal rates.\n  When we lower marginal rates as proposed by the President, No. 1, we \nare giving the greatest tax relief to the low-income people. Six \nmillion people at the bottom of the income-tax-paying ladder are taken \noff the income tax rolls. If you are a family of four making $35,000 a \nyear, you get knocked off the income tax rolls altogether. A family of \nfour making $50,000 a year receives a 50-percent tax reduction: $1,600 \nwill be the reduction. Up the scale, a farmer or businessman will have \nreductions in income taxes that will allow them to save, to invest in \nequipment, to invest in technology, to hire more workers, and to pay \nmore to the workers.\n  We have had a tremendous explosion in the productivity of our \nworkforce in recent years because we have invested in information \ntechnology. Where did that come from? No. 1, from the reductions in \ncapital gains rates. It encouraged more money to go into the \nproductivity-enhancing work of each business. Chairman Alan Greenspan \nand other reputable economists agree that if you want to give a boost \nto the economy, which is sagging, which was not rescued by the last 50 \npercentage bases point rate reduction by the Federal Reserve, the best \nthing to do is tax relief, tax reduction. The best kind of tax \nreduction is the marginal rate reduction.\n  A few years ago, we agreed 28 percent ought to be the top marginal \nrate. I think most people, if surveyed over what is the maximum the \nFederal Government ought to take from anybody's income that they worked \nto earn, would answer maybe 30 percent. We are not going to come \nanywhere near that. We will lower that 39-percent bracket, which \nbecause of the cockamamie scheme of phaseout of deductions, becomes as \nhigh as 44 percent in some areas. We will lower that rate to 36 percent \nbut still leave the top 1 percent of the taxpayers paying more of the \ntotal tax burden than they do today. That is very important for our \neconomy. That is very important for the healthy growth of small \nbusinesses, improving the balance sheet of families, and strengthening \nour communities.\n  Second, we will fix the marriage penalty. It is ridiculous to punish \ncitizens for getting married. We ought to encourage stable households \nand relieve the burden that comes when two working married partners \nmove into a higher tax bracket than they would if they were single.\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\n  Second, we need to fix the death tax by getting rid of it. It is \nridiculous for the tax collector to show up at people's weddings. It is \neven more ridiculous for the tax collector to show up at a funeral.\n  There was a recent movie, ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' For the \nIRS, four weddings and a funeral makes five taxable events. We fix that \nunfairness in the budget resolution. We get rid of the death tax that \nerases an entire lifetime of work and productivity by making small \nbusinesses sell out just to pay taxes. We also eliminated the costly \nburden of inheritance tax planning and insurance costs that put \nunnecessary drags on small businesses while the owner is still alive \nand trying to plan around the death tax.\n  One of the best arguments for getting rid of the death tax is the \ncomplexity of the code. Many have had an opportunity to listen to Larry \nLindsey. We know the death tax only brings in about 1 percent of the \nrevenue. But think of the significant number of pages in the Tax Code \nthat were put in there to try to shore up the death tax to make sure \npeople could not get around the death tax. Add to that the tens of \nthousands of dollars that farmers and small businesses have to pay just \nto figure out how to get around the death tax and you see why it is \nsuch a nonproductive burden on the economy.\n\n  A farm friend of mine was telling that in his father's final illness \nthey had to spend $97,000 on legal and accounting fees just to try to \nfigure out how to keep the farm together to make it a viable \nagricultural productivity unit. They wasted $97,000 that could have \ngone a long way towards a downpayment on a new tractor or other \nequipment they needed on the farm.\n  Speaking about the death tax, there is an article in yesterday's \nWashington Post from four African American leaders calling for the \nrepeal of the death tax. Many fellow citizens have been able to \nparticipate in our economy for a long time and have accumulated assets \nacross several generations. For African Americans who are often getting \ninto the economic life for the first time thanks to the civil rights \nmovement and others, the death tax is holding them back. A generation \nthat has finally gotten to enjoy some level of opportunity is finding \nthat the death tax can undo decades of progress.\n  For example, Robert L. Johnson, chief executive of Black \nEntertainment Television and an organizer of the campaign, said the \ngroup was influenced by recent efforts by very wealthy white Americans \nsuch as William Gates, Senior, and members of the Rockefeller family to \nfight repeal with similar ads.\n  Johnson said although it might be easier for people who have \naccumulated assets for generations to support the tax, many African \nAmericans have built up wealth only since the passage of the Civil \nRights Act. He goes on to say on behalf of the group that repealing the \ntax will help close a wealth gap that has left the net worth of an \naverage black family one-tenth of that of the average white family. He \nalso said the group believes the estate tax is a form of double \ntaxation because businesses have already paid taxes on earnings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 2, 2001]\n\n                 Black Group Seeks Repeal of Estate Tax\n\n\n     businessmen say levy increases disparity in wealth among races\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       Opening a new front in the battle over the estate tax, more \n     than three dozen African American business leaders this week \n     plan to support repeal of the tax because they say it helps \n     widen the wealth gap between whites and blacks.\n       President Bush has made repeal of the tax levied on the \n     assets of wealthy Americans when they die a key part of his \n     $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax plan. The House is scheduled to \n     vote Wednesday on a bill that would repeal the estate tax by \n     2011, and that day the group will run full-page \n     advertisements in major newspapers to make clear its support \n     for repeal. Bush fared poorly among African American voters \n     in the presidential election.\n       Robert L. Johnson, chief executive of Black Entertainment \n     Television and organizer of the campaign, said yesterday the \n     group was influenced by recent efforts by ``very wealthy \n     white Americans,'' such as William Gates Sr. and members of \n     the Rockefeller family, to fight repeal with similar ads.\n       Johnson, who said he is worth more than $1.5 billion, said \n     although it might be easy for people who have accumulated \n     assets for generations to support the tax, many African \n     Americans have built up wealth only since the passage of the \n     Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n       Even then, he said, African Americans often face subtle \n     forms of discrimination, such as difficulty in getting bank \n     loans, and have had to build up businesses by catering mostly \n     to black customers.\n       Now, Johnson said, this first generation of significant \n     black wealth is threatened by the estate tax. Not only might \n     the tax force the sale of businesses with few liquid assets \n     to pay it, but it also prevents passing on wealth to the next \n     generation, he said.\n       ``Many members of a white family may be wealthy in their \n     own right,'' he said. In the black community, where a \n     business executive may have been the first in a family to go \n     to college, ``all that wealth is in one person's hand, but \n     others are living hand to hand.''\n       Repealing the tax, he said, will help close a wealth gap \n     that has left the net worth of the average black family one-\n     tenth that of the average white family. He also said that the \n     group believes the estate tax is a form of double taxation, \n     because businesses have already paid taxes on earnings.\n       About 98 percent of all descendants do not pay estate tax \n     because the first $675,000 of an estate is exempt for \n     taxation, an exemption that is due to rise to $1 million by \n     2006 under current law. Only 47,500 estates paid estate tax \n     in 1998, the most recent year for which figures are \n     available. Businesses that oppose the tax say preparations \n     for it, such as buying insurance, are costly and a drain on \n     capital.\n       Johnson estimates he pays about $200,000 to $300,000 in \n     annual insurance premiums, and said insurance costs were akin \n     to ``transferring wealth out of the black community to the \n     majority community.''\n       Other members of the group include Earl Graves, publisher \n     of Black Enterprise magazine; Ernie Green, managing director \n     of Lehman Brothers Inc.; Ed Lewis, chief executive of Essence \n     Communications; and Dave Bing, chairman of the Big Group of \n     automotive suppliers.\n       Johnson said the black community's support for repealing \n     the estate tax might give Bush an opening.\n       ``If he's smart, he'd take the opportunity to reach out to \n     these African American business leaders and say, `We agree on \n     at least one thing. What else can we talk about?' ''\n\n  Mr. BOND. I have lots more to say about this budget resolution, and \nregrettably I will have a chance to say it. But at this point I think \nit appears that people are here and ready to move on. So I will thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Allen). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there were a couple of statements made by \nmy colleague from Missouri that I think require a response.\n  First, with respect to how much debt can be retired, the President \nhas said only $2 trillion of publicly held debt can be retired. But \nwhen we examined the budget offering by my colleagues on the other \nside, we saw they have reduced the debt by $400 billion over that. \nPerhaps at some point we could get a clarification on how much debt \nthey intend to pay down because while the President has repeatedly said \nthere is $1.2 trillion that can't be retired, when we examined the \nbudget documents from our colleagues on the other side, we saw they \nhave paid all but $800 billion of publicly held debt.\n  So there seems to be some conflict within the troops on the other \nside. Which is it? Is it, as the President says, that there is $1.2 \ntrillion you cannot pay down, or is it as the budget document that has \ncome from our colleagues on the other side says, which is, no, it is \nnot $1.2 trillion, it is $800 billion?\n  I think the $800 billion comes closer to the truth, by the way, than \nthe President's assertion that you can only pay down $2 trillion of the \npublicly held debt and that there is $1.2 trillion that can't be \nretired. Again, the budget document that has been provided by the other \nside says they are prepared to pay publicly held debt down to the level \nof $800 billion.\n  The second point: When we do an analysis, a detailed cashflow \nanalysis on paydown of debt, we find that if you save all of Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds, you have no cash buildup problem \nuntil 2010. There is no cash buildup problem until 2010. So all this \ntalk about you are going to be paying premiums and you are going to be \npaying foreign debtholders more than they should be paid, that just \ndoes not match the facts.\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n  That whole scenario arose out of the notion that we do not have a tax \ncut, that we do not have any additional spending initiative. But under \nboth plans, under the Republican plan and our plan, there are \nsignificant tax cuts and there are spending initiatives. The fact is \nyou have no cash buildup problem until the year 2010, and you may well \nnot have it then because this 10-year forecast may not come true.\n  So I hope we are not debating kind of in the fog with respect to \npaying down debt and that some are trying to pay down more debt than is \navailable to pay down. Certainly that is not the case based on the \ntestimony received in the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Finally, on the estate tax, a point that my colleague made on the \nother side, we do have a difference on the estate tax. We believe it \nought to be fundamentally changed, that it bites at much too low a \nlevel on estates. We believe that ought to be substantially changed. We \nbelieve a couple ought to be able to preserve $4 or $5 million without \nhaving any estate tax; a small business or a farm, $8 or $10 million \nwithout paying any estate tax; and we think we ought to phase in those \ndramatic increases very quickly.\n  It is interesting; the proposal on the other side does not relieve a \nsingle estate of taxation in the next 10 years. Their proposal cuts the \ntax rates on the wealthiest estates first. I call it the upside down \napproach. Instead of expanding those estates that are not subject to \ntaxation, our Republican friends have a proposal that cuts the rates on \nthe wealthiest estates first, does not relieve a single estate of \ntaxation over the next 10 years, and makes this promise out there: \nWell, just be patient; at the end of 10 years we will eliminate it. We \nwill eliminate it. We will eliminate it in the second 10 years right \nwhen the baby boomers start to retire and the cost of elimination is \n$750 billion for that second 10-year period.\n  I say to my colleagues I do not think it will ever happen. What will \nhappen is, if we go that route, they will come up with another name for \nanother tax and they will put it on and people will have lost the \nopportunity in this 10-year period to have our plan pass.\n  Our plan, which would dramatically increase the exemptions for \nestates, our plan, which would shield $4 or $5 million for a couple, $8 \nor $10 million for a small business or farm so that they do not pay any \nestate tax, is significant. It would relieve 40 percent of estates from \ntaxation in the first year. Forty percent of currently taxable estates \nwould be relieved of taxation in the first year. We would relieve two-\nthirds of all taxable estates from any taxation over the 10 years of \nthis budget plan.\n  Contrast that to what the Republicans have. They do not relieve a \nsingle estate of taxation in the next 10 years. They cut the rates on \nthe wealthiest estates first. I don't know where they came up with that \nplan, but I don't think that plan is going to enjoy much popular \nsupport. It certainly does not in my State.\n  We are now ready to turn to amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself time off the budget resolution. I yield \nmyself up to 10 minute, Mr. President.\n  First I want everybody to know that while my friend who is managing \non the Democrat side might choose to answer every detail of research \ngiven on this side, I am not going to do that in reference to what he \ntalks about in the Chamber. I will every now and then indicate why I \nthink it is wrong.\n  I want to make sure we start with everybody understanding what the \nRepublican budget proposal is. I am pleased to have the other side say \nthey would do it differently. But I want to make sure everybody in the \ncountry understands that based upon the regular budget concepts that we \nhave been using now for a long time with reference to what is within a \nbudget, what is not within a budget: This is the budget. It is very \nsimple. I don't want to say it is right because I have just asked that \nperhaps the other side not be so dogmatic and say right and wrong. But \nI would say it is what the President asks us to do, with a few changes.\n  Frankly, it is a very good budget, if you want to give the American \npeople, the average family, a substantial portion of this surplus; if \nyou want to give that back to them so they can spend it for themselves \nas they see fit, perhaps sitting around a table saying we are going to \nget $1,600 back, we are going to get $1,200 back, which is the average \nin my State; $1,600 is the average in Texas. They are going to say \nevery year we are going to get that much; what can we do with it? \nFrankly, I will trust any choice they make sitting around that table \nrather than us keeping it up here in the Federal Government and making \nthat choice for them.\n  This is a very basic budget. I am sorry it was prepared when we were \nstill meeting in small rooms. So next time we have it, it will be very \nbig so people will not have to strain. I told them order it twice as \nbig so it will not be so tough for me to explain it.\n  Everyone agrees if you use the Congressional Budget Office estimates, \nwhich we are bound to do--and incidentally, to my friend, the ranking \nmember, when he asked about the debt service and how do we get at these \nnumbers, there is a simple answer: We use the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates. So that question of us, How do we get the debt \nservice paid like we are? The Congressional Budget Office estimates, \nwhich we are supposed to use.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus. Everybody starts with that over 10 years. I want to \neditorially comment on it.\n  There has been some talk about should we use that number. Let me make \nsure everybody knows what I think. I think absolutely we should use \nthat number because, if you look at what they tell us, what the CBO \ntells us, the Congressional Budget Office, they say using modest \neconomics, modest productivity, modest growth, and assume a couple of \ndownturns over the next decade, that is the number they recommend.\n  All the other business about it could be four times higher and it \ncould be three times lower--they are telling us that might happen. But \nthen you ask them: But what do you recommend? That is what they \nrecommend. That number. That means in the next decade that is going to \nbe sitting around up here, not being needed to pay for the ordinary \noperations of Government--unless we choose it as an opportunity for \nspending and we say we are going to spend a bunch of money. Then that \nwill come down. We will not have that much. We will tell you what we \nthink we ought to spend because we think it is right.\n  Next, take out all the Social Security money, everything that is \nsupposed to go toward the debt on Social Security. I don't think there \nis any argument there, that is $2.5 trillion. Then what we call the \nrest of the Government surplus, $3.1 trillion--the rest of the \nGovernment surplus.\n  Then the President of the United States has asked us to approve a \nbudget resolution that says the committees that write the taxes can \nlower taxes up to $1.6 trillion. Interestingly enough, my friends in \nthe Senate, and anybody else who is interested, this budget resolution \ndoes not tell us which tax cuts are going to take place. So when we get \nup and say we know what the Republicans' tax proposal will be, we know \nwhat the Democrat's tax proposal will be--not so. We don't know because \nthe tax-writing committee will write whatever they want with reference \nto tax cuts, and make sure they do not exceed $1.6 trillion. That is \nall we are doing in this budget.\n\n  If you want to talk about whose estate tax is better, you have to \nwork on that in the Finance Committee when you write up the bill. When \nyou talk about which kind of marginal rate cuts you are going to have, \nthey will continue to say Republicans want to cut the taxes for the \nrich. We say we want to cut everybody's marginal rates and, in fact, \nfor those in the middle-income area, they get a rather substantial tax \ncut, each and every one of them, because their marginal rates are going \nto be cut. But that may not happen because the tax-writing committee \nwill write what they can work out among themselves.\n  The next amendment will be offered by the ranking member of that \nFinance Committee. He cannot stand up here and say this is what the \nRepublicans say they are going to do in the Finance Committee and I \nknow they are going\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nto do it. He is probably going to say, whatever you say to him, we are \ngoing to work our will and he is going to be part of that working our \nwill.\n  Next, available for other priorities--$1.5 trillion. Identified \npriorities: Medicare, prescription drugs $200 billion, the surplus for \nMedicare, for Part A, is $400 billion, and the debt service that it \ncauses is $400 billion.\n  The important thing is, no matter what is said on the other side, \nunder our budget there is $1/2 trillion--$500 billion--that is not \nspent. It goes nowhere. It is there to be used as a contingency fund \nover the next 10 years. That is it, plain and simple.\n  The other side may choose to put in some other numbers. They have \nanother place they want to say we are going to put $700 billion because \nwe are waiting around for somebody to draft up a program that will let \npeople, independently, invest in investment accounts.\n  The point of it is last time I saw that it was part of Social \nSecurity reform. The last time I heard about it, it disappeared from \nthe horizon, it seems to me, until the stock market comes back. A lot \nof other things are not dependent on that stock market, but you come \ndown here to try to sell an overhaul of the Social Security system that \nincludes investing money now in independent accounts that involve the \ncommon stocks of America, I think it would be a logical thing going \nthrough everybody's head, why don't we wait a year or two? I think that \nis what is going to happen. I wish it was not. So this is what we \nnormally put in a budget. We believe it is a good budget for the \nAmerican people.\n  Having said that, I want to make sure everybody knows that, plain and \nsimple, as this Senator sees it, every time we get close to giving the \nAmerican people a large sum of the surplus back so they can use it, a \nnew project, program, or activity is invented by the other side to \nspend it. It is presented with great, great ardor, with great \neffectiveness. All of a sudden, something that was never used before in \na budget, never thought necessary, as soon as we get close to giving \nthose American people a big tax break up pops another one: Here is $700 \nbillion you ought to set aside for something else. Here is $500 billion \nmore you should spend on Medicare plus agriculture.\n  Just remember, those who are listening, you will hear many things. \nBut for the most part, it will be: We have found some way to use more \nof this surplus for Government purposes rather than for individual \npurposes. Up pops the spending, up pops the new idea that will restrain \nwhat we can give the taxpayers of America.\n  I have been at it a long time. I was one who stuck with it to get \nbalanced budgets. I believe this is fair. I believe we are going to \nhave a balanced budget, we are going to keep a balanced budget, we are \ngoing to pay down the debt as much as you can, and we are going to end \nup giving the American people back some of their money. That is a very \nsimple plan. The President offered it and it was pretty good.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  Remember that all of these proposals build on a budget that the \nPresident sent that has a 4-percent increase built into it, and for the \ndecade almost has 4-percent growth every year. All of that is taken for \ngranted. Everybody should understand that. Then whatever people are \noffering on top of that means more than 4 percent which means less tax \nreform and less tax rebates, less tax cuts.\n\n  The budget before us does one other good thing. It says, tax-writing \ncommittees, you can use $60 billion out of this year's surplus as this \nyear's stimulus so long as you fix the marginal rates so that you get a \ndouble whammy: current stimulus and a permanent fix for the American \neconomy and its performance over time for the American people who are \nsitting around about now paying their taxes. We are saying to them: We \nwant your taxes to be less; we want to give you some back. In addition \nto the stimulus, we want to prepare the economy for long-term growth.\n  I yield the floor. I understand the other side has an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague.\n  First of all, let me say that I have enormous respect for the \nchairman of the committee. He is a good chairman. He is a fair \nchairman. But we do have a significant difference of opinion with \nrespect to the budget that is before the country.\n  The chairman believes that the size of this tax cut is the \nappropriate way to go. He tries to poster it as a question of spending \nversus tax cuts. But that is the old debate. That is the tired debate. \nIt doesn't relate to the facts of their budget.\n  It is not the proposal that we have made. The fundamental difference \nis we have reserved 70 percent of the money for short-term and long-\nterm debt reduction. They reserve, under the President's plan, about 35 \npercent of the money for debt reduction.\n  The fundamental difference is not a difference between taxing and \nspending. The fundamental difference is a question of do we do more \ndebt reduction as we advocate or more of a tax cut as they advocate?\n  We have a substantial tax cut but one that is half as big as theirs \nbecause we reserve the difference for money to deal with our long-term \ndebt that is primarily Social Security. We say: Look, we have had the \nComptroller General of the United States come and tell us the situation \nwe face.\n  The Social Security and Medicare trust funds face cash deficits as \nthe baby boomers retire. Yes, we are in surplus today, but we are \nheaded for deficits tomorrow. We say in our plan that we ought to set \naside some of their money they want to use for a tax cut to deal with \nthe long-term debt crisis facing our country.\n\n  That is the difference. That is the big difference between their plan \nand our plan. They want it all for a tax cut. We want half of it for a \ntax cut, and we want half of it to begin to deal with our long-term \ndebt crisis that is facing this country.\n  If we want to strengthen Social Security for the future, we have to \nhave resources to do it, whether it is individual accounts as many on \ntheir side advocate, and some on our side, or whether it is the Social \nSecurity Plus plan advocated by Vice President Gore in the Presidential \ncampaign or whether it is the privatization plan that their President \nadvocates. From where is the money going to come?\n  The chairman of the committee puts up a chart. You can't find a \nsingle dime set aside to strengthen Social Security for the long term--\nnot one thin dime. You can't find a penny to deal with this long-term \ndebt problem, not a penny.\n  That is the difference between us.\n  We reduce the size of the tax cut so that we have resources to \nstrengthen Social Security for the long term to deal with this long-\nterm debt crisis.\n  Look at what we are told. The Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds start to run into massive deficits in this second 10-year period.\n  Let me conclude. When they say this is a question of the Democrats \njust wanting to increase spending, no, this isn't a question of \nDemocrats just wanting to increase spending.\n  Let's go to the facts. The facts are under our plan the Federal role \nwill continue to shrink. Last night the Senator from Texas said facts \nare stubborn things. Indeed they are.\n  Here is our spending proposal. The role of the Federal Government \nwould continue to decline. In fact, it would go to the lowest level \nsince 1951 under our proposal. This is not increased spending. This is \nreducing the role of the Federal Government so more resources can be \ndedicated to debt reduction--both short-term and long-term under our \nplan.\n  That is the fundamental difference between these plans.\n  Our friends on the other side want to take all of the non-trust-fund \nmoney and put it out for a tax cut. We say, no, that is not wise. Yes, \nhalf of it could be used for a tax cut, but half of it ought to be used \nto deal with our long-term debt crisis; that we ought to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term.\n  That is the fundamental difference between these plans. And it is a \nprofound difference. It recognizes, No. 1, the uncertainty of the \nforecast. Any 10-year projection is uncertain.\n  More than that, it recognizes that at the end of this 10-year period, \nthe baby boomers start to retire. These surpluses turn to deficits, and \nwe have an obligation to deal with that long-term\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\ndebt. We have reserved $750 billion for that purpose. That money could \ngo into individual accounts.\n  When they talk about money going back to the people, you add up our \ntax cut and the money that is available to deal with long-term debt, \nwhich happens to be the people's debt--we talk a lot about the people's \nmoney; it is also the people's debt--you have the people's short-term \ndebt and the people's long-term debt. We say let's reserve 70 percent \nof the money to deal with the people's short-term and long-term debt.\n  Our friends on the other side want to take all the non-trust-fund \nmoney and use it for a tax cut. They don't want to reserve one single \ndime to deal with this long-term debt crisis facing the country, not a \npenny. There is no money reserved for the long-term debt situation of \nthe country.\n  They will say we reserve the Social Security trust fund money. Good. \nThat is a good start. But what do you do next? What do you do after you \nreserve the money for the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare \ntrust fund? Do you provide a single dime? Is there a single penny in \nthere to deal with the long-term crunch that we all know is coming? No, \nnot a penny.\n  They are getting ready to take it out of the Social Security trust \nfund, which, of course, will just move up the date of insolvency for \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  We say reserve every penny of the Social Security trust fund for \nSocial Security, every penny of the Medicare trust fund for Medicare, \nand out of what is left take $750 billion to strengthen Social Security \nfor the long-term to deal with the long-term debt that is facing this \ncountry.\n  This isn't a question between taxes and spending. No. It is part of \nit because there are places where we think more resources could be \nreserved for a prescription drug benefit, to improve education, and to \nstrengthen national defense. But we also believe most of this projected \nsurplus ought to be dedicated to debt reduction, short term and long \nterm. And we do twice as much as they do.\n  That is a simple truth. That is the simple difference. It is a big \ndifference for the future of this country.\n  We are going to go to our first amendment and Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 172 to Amendment No. 170\n\n     (Purpose: It is the purpose of this amendment to establish a \nprescription drug benefit under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, \n   without using funds generated from either the Medicare or Social \nSecurity surpluses, that is voluntary; accessible to all beneficiaries; \n  designed to assist beneficiaries with the high cost of prescription \n drugs, protect them from excessive out of pocket costs, and give them \n bargaining power in the marketplace; affordable to all beneficiaries \n    and the program; administered using private sector entities and \ncompetitive purchasing techniques; and consistent with broader Medicare \n                                reform)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Dayton, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Carnahan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 172 to amendment No. 170.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It provides \nthe funds necessary to establish a good, solid prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program for our seniors and disabled. That is \nwhat it does. It is not excessive. It is not gold plated. It is not, \nfrankly, the total benefit that some of our seniors would like. But it \nis a good, solid benefit--coverage that would meet the commitment that \nso many of us have made so many times to our seniors.\n  To offset the cost of the new benefit, the amendment would make a \nvery modest reduction in the size of the proposed $1.6 trillion tax \ncut. It would be very modest.\n  Let me put this amendment in perspective. Medicare was enacted in \n1965. Since then, the practice of medicine has changed dramatically. No \none doubts that. Today, more often than not, medicine involves not only \na trip to the doctor, but a trip to the pharmacy to pick up a \nprescription drug as part of therapy.\n  At the same time, we all know that drug prices are rising very fast. \nIn the year 2000, drug prices rose by 11 percent. Since 1990, \nprescription drug spending has more than tripled.\n  Let's go beyond the statistics and look at the effect on real people. \nTake the drug Prilosec. It is used to treat ulcers and digestive \nproblems. If you don't have health insurance, it might cost you $1,400 \na year. If you are a senior citizen living on Social Security payments \nof about $10,000 a year--and many seniors are--that is more than 10 \npercent of your income on one prescription. I ask you, how many seniors \nhave only one prescription? Virtually none. They have several. They \nhave to.\n  Or take Lipitor, which is used for diabetes. It costs $680 a year. \nFor Procardia, which is for hypertension, it costs $900 a year. And the \nlist goes on.\n  The result is that Americans who do not have drug insurance coverage \npay the highest prices for prescription drugs of anyone in the \nindustrialized world. Let me repeat that statement. It is startling. \nAmericans who do not have insurance coverage pay the highest prices for \nprescription drugs of anyone in the industrialized world. I think that \nis something we do not want to continue.\n\n  We are not talking about relatively a handful of people. Over the \nyears, as the importance and expense of prescription drugs has grown, \nmore and more seniors have been affected. Today, about 35 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries lack direct coverage for outpatient prescription \ndrugs--35 percent. And that probably understates the problem.\n  For example, one study has shown that only about 50 percent of \nseniors have drug coverage throughout the year, and for many who do \nhave coverage, it is often limited, inadequate.\n  In rural areas, it is even worse. There the problem is particularly \nsevere. In my State of Montana, 76 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nlive in rural areas. A National Economic Council study of last year \nshowed that rural beneficiaries are 50 percent less likely than their \nurban counterparts to have drug coverage.\n  Here is another way to look at it. Rural Medicare beneficiaries use \n10 percent more prescriptions than the people in the cities, but they \npay 25 percent more out of pocket for their drugs. They are more likely \nto use drugs but pay more than 25 percent out of pocket than people who \nlive in cities.\n  This lack of coverage is reflected in the letters I receive every \nday. And I am sure you, Mr. President, and every senator in this body \nreceives letters very similar to what I am going to read. For example, \na woman from Columbus, MT, a rural part of my State wrote:\n\n       Senator Baucus, it is so vital to me and thousands of other \n     senior citizens that prescription drugs be put entirely under \n     Medicare. I drew $5,890 in Social Security in the Year 2000, \n     and my prescription drugs cost me $7,514. . .so you can see \n     it is a struggle to keep things paid.\n\n  She paid a lot more in drugs than she got in Social Security \nbenefits--a lot more, almost a couple thousand dollars more.\n  And I heard this from a senior citizen in Havre, MT. She wrote:\n\n       Senator Baucus, I am a senior citizen on a fixed income. I \n     take medication to deal with anxiety. That medicine used to \n     cost me $20; now it costs me almost $60. Something should be \n     done about this.\n\n  How right she is. In fact, I will bet virtually everyone in this \nChamber\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nagrees, something should be done about this.\n  That is where the budget resolution comes in. Simply put, the budget \nresolution proposed by the Senator from New Mexico does not go far \nenough. It does not set aside funds that are needed, funds to support a \nsolid prescription drug program. In other words, it sells our seniors \nshort.\n  I will be more specific. The budget resolution sets aside about $153 \nbillion over 10 years for a new prescription drug program. That tracks \nwith the President's proposal, the so-called ``immediate helping \nhand.''\n  I am not critical of the President, nor am I critical of the senator \nfrom New Mexico. Their proposal is a start. It acknowledges the need to \nexpand prescription drug coverage. It makes a good-faith effort to get \nthere. But even though it is a start, it has two very significant \nproblems that have to be remedied. First of all, the budget resolution \ndoes not even cover the cost of the President's proposal. CBO now \nestimates the President's proposal would cost $207 billion over 10 \nyears. So the budget resolution is more than $50 billion short. The \nchart behind me shows that; that is, the budget proposal offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico falls short and does not even do what the \nPresident's helping hand suggestion purports to cover. So it fails in \nthat regard.\n\n  Second, we probably all know that the President's proposal in and of \nitself isn't going anywhere. Even it is too short. It is not enough. \nWhen Secretary Thompson had his nomination hearing before the Finance \nCommittee, there was a lot of talk about prescription drug proposals. \nBut not a single member of the committee spoke up to support the \nPresident's proposal. Why? Because it was so inadequate.\n  That is not surprising. The proposal has several defects. One, it \nrequires States to implement a new program they do not want. It also \ndelays many tough decisions on Medicare reform.\n  Most significantly, it leaves half of all seniors behind, without \ncoverage. Anyone with an income above $20,000, for example, if they do \nnot have prescription drug coverage now--as I mentioned, about 35 \npercent of American seniors do not have a plan. They will not have it \nunder the President's proposal.\n  This chart behind me shows in the circle all of the seniors now not \ngetting prescription drug coverage. On the left, is the helping hand \nprovision. About half the seniors will be covered under the helping \nhand proposal. The black on the far right shows about half of the \nseniors would not get coverage under the proposal.\n  Now, it could be argued that the budget resolution does not lock in \nthe President's proposal. After all, it does not mandate any particular \napproach. It just establishes the overall funding. True. At the same \ntime, it is clear that if we set aside only $153 billion over 10 years, \nwe will not be able to write a prescription drug coverage bill that \ngoes far enough to provide universal coverage to all our seniors.\n  Here is what the head of the CBO told our committee two weeks ago:\n\n       [A] universal benefit would be a pretty thin benefit . . . \n     . If you're going to spread $150 to $160 billion over the \n     entire population, it won't provide a great deal for any one \n     person.\n\n  He is commenting on the helping hand proposal offered by the \nPresident. So whether you focus only on the President's proposal or \nmore broadly on what you could accomplish for $153 billion , the budget \nresolution is obviously much too short.\n  The amendment that Senators Graham, Kennedy, and I have offered is \ndesigned to address this shortfall. How do we do it? We do it by \nproviding more resources from the budget surplus for prescription drug \ncoverage. It basically doubles the amount that is available from $153 \nbillion to $311 billion. By doing so, the amendment gives us room to \ndesign a good, solid prescription drug program, something that is going \nto work. We don't want to pass something so inadequate that not only is \nit paltry, but it just won't work. It would be disingenuous. It would \nbe a false promise to our seniors. We have to do enough that works. Not \na gold-plated program, but a solid one.\n\n  To offset the cost, our amendment reduces the size of the tax cut by \n$158 billion, or about 10 percent. Since $153 billion is already \nprovided for in the budget, we take $158 billion out of the tax cut, \ntotaling about $311 billion. That is our amendment. That still allows \nus plenty of room to cut tax rates, reform the estate tax, the marriage \npenalty, and other necessary changes to the code.\n  Some will argue that a $1.6 trillion tax cut is the Holy Grail. It is \nsacrosanct. We can't touch it. It is locked in stone. It is almost in \nthe Constitution. That is what we hear, that we must pass a tax cut \nthat large at all costs, regardless of the consequences, regardless of \nthe other important priorities that would have to be shunted aside. I \ndisagree.\n  The process of writing a budget resolution is a process of setting \npriorities. A large tax cut is an important priority, but so is the \nhealth and welfare of our senior citizens. So I ask the Senate to \nstrike a balance, and that is precisely what our amendment does.\n  Mr. President, we may hear a counterproposal, a second-degree \namendment to accomplish some of the same objectives by taking the money \nout of the so-called contingency fund, rather than by reducing the \nproposed tax cut by $158 billion. This is an honest debate. Where do we \nget the money? Do we take it out of the contingency funds, or do we \ntake it out of the tax cut? That is the question with which this body \nis confronted.\n  We know that the contingency fund has been accounted for by as many \ntimes as there are Senators in this body and more than that, because \neach Senator has different ideas how to use that contingency fund.\n  That contingency fund is not going to be there. Let me indicate why. \nIf you take the final amendment in the contingency fund presented by \nthe Senator from New Mexico, he said it is about $450 or $500 billion--\nI am not sure exactly which--here are some of the claims against the \ncontingency fund in various ways: uninsured benefits, people want to \nstart providing a benefit for the 43 million Americans who are \nuninsured; the alternative minimum tax, what is that going to cost us? \nThat is going to cost us $200 to $300 billion. We all know we are going \nto fix the alternative minimum tax defect. Extenders, tax extenders, \nnot in the budget, another $200 billion. Already that is close to $600 \nbillion.\n  Business tax breaks, does anybody here think there are not going to \nbe some business tax breaks in this bill, say $200 to $300 billion? \nAgriculture, that is not in here. Disaster assistance, that is not in \nhere. That is about $100 billion over 10 years. Education, $150 \nbillion; missile defense, possibly another $200 billion. There is just \nso much in here or not in here that if we honestly look at the \ntradeoffs, either reducing the tax cut by $158 billion or using the \ncontingency fund for a prescription drug benefit, it is clear where the \nmoney is going to be and where the money is not going to be.\n  I know many Senators in this body think they can't touch the $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut. That it is just a given. But nothing is a given \naround here. We are here to make choices. We are here to represent our \npeople. I will bet dollars to doughnuts that if you were to ask all of \nthe people in your State, and if every senator were to ask all the \npeople in their own States, what do you prefer, a $1.6 trillion tax cut \nwith no prescription drug benefit, except a very modest one that won't \nwork, or a tax cut reduced by $158 billion for a real honest-to-\ngoodness prescription drug benefit that will work, we all know what the \nanswer to that will be. People will say: Of course. That is such a \nmodest nick in the tax reduction for something so good and so needed. \nThere are so many seniors destitute and down and out who need \nprescription drug help. That is a no-brainer.\n\n  Compare that with asking: Should we try to get the benefit out of the \ncontingency fund? We all know, we are adults, we have been around here \na while, that is kind of a phony issue, that contingency fund, because \neverybody knows the claims on it are more than the number of senators \nin this body.\n  Let's do what is right. It is a very modest reduction in the \nPresident's proposed tax cut, a modest reduction that clearly makes \nsense. I ask senators to forget what the party ideology says for a \nmoment. Maybe just for a nanosecond, someone might say: Gee, that is a \ngood thing to do.\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\n  In so saying, I urge senators to support the amendment offered by \nmyself and Senators Graham and Kennedy, reserve the remainder of my \ntime, and yield to the senator from Florida.\n  Mr. REID. The time would be off the bill, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may I indicate that Senator Graham's time \nwill come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before I turn to the specific issues \nraised by the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from \nMontana, myself, and others, I will make a couple of general comments \nabout the context of this discussion of the budget resolution.\n  We are looking at the world as if it ended exactly 10 years from the \nend of this fiscal year. That is a very artificial restraint.\n  At a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee on March 29, a former \nDirector of the budget office during the administration of the first \nPresident Bush made this statement in response to a question about the \nartificiality of the 10-year limit. Dr. James Miller stated:\n\n       I think the timeframe does matter. We sort of lull \n     ourselves into, when I was budget director, in 5-year \n     timeframes, and now you are looking at 10-year timeframes, \n     and it is appropriate to look beyond that. And what we know, \n     of course, is that they'll be running big surpluses until \n     about 2020, whatever. And then we will be running deficits \n     again.\n\n  During that hearing, I used the important historical fact that on \nMarch 30, my daughter Suzanne's triplet daughters had their sixth \nbirthday. I can report it was a happy celebratory occasion. If my \ndaughter and her husband were to view the economic consequences \nrelative to their triplets as we are about to do with this budget, they \nwould stop the clock 10 years from now when their triplets had their \n16th birthday. That would give a very false impression of what the true \ncost of raising triplets in the 21st century is going to be because 2 \nyears after their 16th birthday will be their 18th birthday, the year \nin which, hopefully, they will all be entering college. Any family who \nhas some idea of what college costs for one child in the year 2001 can \ncalculate what the costs are going to be for three children and project \nwhat they are likely to be in another 12 years from now.\n  In many ways our Nation is similar to my daughter's family. We have \nsome very big expenses that are coming just beyond this 10-year \ntimeframe. What is driving those big expenses is a contract. Actually, \nit is a series of contracts between the American people and their \nFederal Government.\n  Those contracts provide that when Americans reach retirement age, \nthey will become eligible for economic assistance in the form of Social \nSecurity, a contract they have been paying for throughout their working \nlife through a payroll deduction plan, and they will also become \neligible for Federal assistance in paying their health care costs, a \ncontract which in part, through the Part A hospital trust fund, they \nhave also been paying for throughout their working life.\n  The numbers of Americans today who are cashing in that contract are \nrelatively modest. I happen to be 64. In November of this year, I will \nbecome fully eligible for Social Security and Medicare. When I become \neligible, I will place a relatively modest burden on the trust funds \nbecause, frankly, there were not a lot of people born in 1936. It was \nthe depth of the Depression and most people did not see that as a \npropitious time to be adding to the size of their family.\n  Right after World War II, Americans started having babies in record \nnumbers. It is those babies who will begin to become eligible for \nSocial Security and Medicare in about the year 2011, just after this \n10-year window shuts down, and they will rapidly increase in numbers. \nAs Dr. Miller said, by the time of 2020, whatever, then we will be \nrunning deficits again.\n  In my judgment, the context in which we need to look at all of the \nissues we are discussing is not the 10-year context but the \ngenerational context of the next 25 years so that we will be taking \ninto account this enormous number of Americans who will be eligible for \nthe contract rights they have been paying for in Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Another thing is going to be happening to that population. Not only \nwill it be reaching retirement age, but that generation is going to \nstart living longer. The average life expectancy of an American when \nSocial Security was established in the mid-1930s, after one reached 65, \nwas about 7 years. Today, the average age for an American female who \nreaches 65 is almost 20 years, and it is almost 16 years for an \nAmerican male.\n  During this century, those ages beyond 65 will continue to grow. So \nwe are going to have a much larger population over 65 and that \npopulation will live substantially longer, placing additional economic \nchallenges to the Federal Government.\n  In my judgment, the key step we should be taking now to prepare for \nthat is to save every dollar of the trust funds of Social Security and \nMedicare for their intended purposes. We should do this to the maximum \nextent possible by paying down the national debt, and then we need to \nbe creative after we have reached the point that we have paid off the \nnational debt fully or to the extent feasible, as to how we can \ncontinue to reserve those funds so that they will be available when \nthis tidal wave of retirement comes in the next decade.\n  Those are some of the contexts for the discussion on the issue that \nwill dramatically affect this generation that will soon be retiring, \nand that is the quality of the Medicare program they will become \neligible to receive.\n  I strongly support the addition of a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare. Frankly, if anyone were to suggest that a Medicare program be \nfashioned today and not include prescription drugs, they would be \nconsidered to be a dinosaur in terms of what is a modern health care \nsystem.\n  This belief that Medicare should include prescription drugs is now \nwidely accepted by the American people. Both the candidates for \nPresident in the year 2000 committed to work for a prescription drug \nbenefit for older Americans.\n  I have been conducting a poll on my Senate Web site for over a year \non the question of Medicare prescription drugs. The first question we \nask is, Should Medicare coverage include a prescription drug benefit?\n  I have no professions as to the statistical appropriateness of this \npoll. It is just anybody who logs on to our site and takes advantage of \nthe opportunity to express their opinion. But of those who have done \nthat--this, as I said, represents over a year of citizens who have \ntaken advantage of this poll--88 percent have answered the question: \nYes; Medicare coverage should include prescription drugs. I think that \nis close to representative of what the American people believe about \nthis issue.\n  The challenge is before us this week to make a determination: Are we \ngoing to provide in this budget resolution a sufficient amount of funds \nto provide an affordable, comprehensive, realistic prescription drug \nbenefit within Medicare?\n  I submit the proposal which is contained in the budget resolution as \nsubmitted is not an adequate proposal to provide that comprehensive \nbenefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will be happy to provide the Senator an additional 10 \nminutes off the resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator intends to take 10 more \nminutes; is that correct? May I ask, then, that following the Senator \nfrom Florida, I be able to speak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, but I have a similar request; that I follow the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I also ask to follow the esteemed Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps we can propound a unanimous consent request. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nGraham, continue for 10 minutes; then turn to the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison, for 15 minutes; then go to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for 15 minutes; and then go to the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding is there are 7 minutes remaining on the amendment. I want \nto reserve 5 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, are we \nalternating back and forth on the sides? I did not hear the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There were no requests on the Senator's side. We can \ncertainly do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. If not, I want to be inserted wherever convenient \nfollowing Senator Hutchison, if we are alternating back and forth.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I amend the unanimous consent request to 10 minutes for \nthe Senator from Florida, then 15 minutes for the Senator from Texas, \nthen back to our side for 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts. \nHow much time does the Senator from Tennessee want?\n  Mr. FRIST. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twelve minutes to the Senator from Tennessee, and then \ncome back to the Senator from Michigan for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Montana had previously requested and, as \nI understood it, reserved 5 minutes off the amendment. All of these \nother times are off the resolution on our side. On the Republican side, \nI am assuming they will be off the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Off the resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Off the resolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest, frankly, under the rules, each side has 30 \nminutes. This side has virtually used up 30 minutes, and none of the \ntime has been used on the other side. My suggestion is during this \ndebate we also use time off the amendment as well as time off the \nresolution, but we start first with the amendment and then the \nresolution so that is taken care of.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is not my intention. My intention is to take \ntime off the resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I repeat my unanimous consent request and we reserve 5 \nminutes off the amendment for the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The amendment on which we are debating provides $153 \nbillion in new budget authority in outlays for a prescription drug \nbenefit for the period 2002 through 2011. As my colleague, Senator \nBaucus, has already indicated, the assessment of the plan that \nPresident Bush has submitted would be that it would have a cost over \nthat 10-year time period of $207 billion. So the amount of money \nrequested in the budget resolution would not even be adequate to \nfinance the barebones, available only to low-income elderly, high-\ndeductible plan that President Bush has recommended.\n  If we were to try to take his plan and stretch it as he states he \nwill attempt to do during the last 6 years of this 10-year period to \ncover all Medicare beneficiaries, the effect of that would be to \nprovide a plan which could require as much as a $1,750 deductible \nbefore any beneficiary was eligible for payment under the prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  As Senator Baucus has already demonstrated, the Director of the CBO \nhas described the attempt to stretch a universal benefit under the \namount of dollars available as not providing a great deal for any one \nperson.\n  There is a second defect in this plan in addition to its inadequacy. \nThat is the fact that it purports to use Part A funds as the means of \npaying for this prescription drug benefit. That is quite directly \nstated in the plan which has been passed by the House, where their \nbudget resolution specifically says prescription drugs will be paid \nthrough the Part A trust fund.\n  The Senate resolution is not that explicit, but as you go through the \nanalysis provided by the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nMontana, you inevitably come to the conclusion that the proposal is to \nswitch the Part A trust fund surpluses to a contingency fund and then \nuse that contingency fund for a variety of purposes, including the \npayment of prescription drug costs to the Federal Government.\n\n  The Part A trust fund is one of those contracts between the American \npeople and their Federal Government. That Part A is intended to pay for \nhospital costs, not for other costs. If we are intending to add to the \nPart A trust fund a new obligation to pay for prescription drugs, then \nwe are going to have to ask ourselves how are we going to provide the \nadditional dollars that will be required for the Part A to be able to \nmeet its current obligations of paying hospital costs and take on this \nnew, nonactuarially balanced responsibility for prescription drugs.\n  I believe this amendment being offered presents the opportunity to \ntell the American people we are serious about providing a prescription \ndrug benefit and that we recognize the urgency of doing so.\n  Today, prescription drug benefits for older Americans, which have \ntraditionally been provided from other sources, are rapidly declining. \nThere are four areas in which, traditionally, Medicare beneficiaries \nhave received some prescription benefit. Medigap, which is the \npurchased insurance, is becoming so expensive that fewer than 5 percent \nof the Medicare beneficiaries today are purchasing it. Managed care has \nbeen dramatically reducing prescription drug benefits. In my State of \nFlorida, it is common for there to be a $500 per year maximum of \nprescription drug benefits. Many elderly use that in less than 2 \nmonths.\n  Retiree plans are becoming less prevalent and less generous, and \nMedicaid--my State of Florida is an example has restricted prescription \ndrug benefits to just three medications.\n  In every area, the places that the elderly have looked to in the past \nfor benefits are declining. At the same time, the cost of drugs is \nrapidly increasing. The average yearly drug spending per Medicare \nenrollee today is $1,756. This is projected to increase to $4,412 by \nthe year 2010.\n  The time is urgent. We face this issue of the necessity of providing \na meaningful prescription drug benefit for older Americans, and to do \nso through the Medicare program. What would be the outline of an \nappropriate plan? I think an appropriate plan would have the following \ncharacteristics: It would be voluntary in the same way the physician \nbenefits which are currently provided through Part B of Medicare are \nvoluntary. It would be comprehensive. It would be available to all \nMedicare beneficiaries. It would be adequate.\n  Today, the physician component of Medicare is paid 75 percent by the \nFederal Government, 25 percent by monthly premiums. I propose for this \nprescription drug benefit it be an equal, a 50/50, division of \nresponsibility between the Federal Government and the Medicare \nbeneficiary.\n  Projections have been that at that level of support we could \nanticipate substantial voluntary participation in this plan, sufficient \nparticipation to maintain its actuarial soundness and to avoid the \ncherry-picking or adverse selection of only those who were the most in \nneed. This would be within Medicaid--hopefully, a reformed Medicare. It \nwould use an insurance model. It would emphasize to people that this is \nnot just a dollar-for-dollar exchange for products you know you will \npurchase. It also represents a transfer of the risks that you might \nbecome seriously ill and your prescription drug costs dramatically \nincrease.\n  We would provide for a deductible at the beginning of the process, \nbut also very important, a stop loss, once you have expended $4,000. At \nthat point, the Federal Government would pay the full cost of your \nprescription drugs.\n  We believe this is an affordable plan. Last year, a plan with these \ncharacteristics was costed as $245 billion for a 10-year period. Today, \nit is estimated that the same plan will cost $311 billion for 10 years, \nwhich is some indication of how rapidly prescription drug costs, \nparticularly those drugs that are most used by older Americans, have \nbeen increasing.\n  The American people want and expect this Congress will provide a \nprescription drug benefit. They have a right to expect that benefit \nwill not be a sham, that it will provide meaningful, comprehensive, \nadequate coverage for all seniors who elect to participate in this \nprogram. They have a right to expect it will not be done at the \nsacrifice of their current contractual expectations in terms of \nhospital benefits. Those hospital benefits have been paid for over the \nyears in their payroll\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\ntaxes. This is not the time to raid that fund to try to finance a \nprescription drug benefit. It should be done through a combination of \ngeneral revenue Federal funds and the premiums paid monthly by the \nbeneficiaries on an equally shared basis.\n  That is what our amendment will finance. I urge my colleagues who are \nserious about telling their constituents they voted for a prescription \ndrug benefit to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nrecess from 12:30 to 2:15 for weekly party conferences to meet and the \ntime be counted equally with respect to the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today on the resolution itself. \nI am very proud of the budget resolution that has been produced. I \ncommend Senator Domenici for his leadership in making sure we address \nall the needs of our country in the most responsible way. I want to \naddress the basics of this resolution: debt reduction, tax relief, \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare, and increasing spending in our \npriority areas.\n  Every household and every business in America increases spending in \nsome areas and decreases spending in some areas because you set your \npriorities and you decide what you want to spend more money for and \nwhat you care less about and would not increase for the following year. \nThat is what has been done in this budget resolution.\n  First, let's talk about debt reduction. This budget resolution \nprovides for the largest and fastest debt reduction in the history of \nour country. We will pay off $2.3 trillion of our $3.2 trillion in \npublicly held debt over the next 10 years. Not only is this an \naggressive schedule, but it is the maximum debt reduction possible \nunless we want to pay a penalty, which would not make economic sense. \nSo without penalties, we are paying down this debt to the maximum \nextent possible.\n  Under this budget resolution, the Government's publicly held debt \nwill decline from 35 percent of the gross domestic product to 7 percent \nin 2011, the lowest level in 80 years. By comparison, the publicly held \ndebt was 80 percent of the gross domestic product in 1950, following \nWorld War II; it was 42 percent of gross domestic product in 1990, \nfollowing the cold war; and by 2011, under this budget track, it will \nbe 7 percent. That is a healthy debt ratio and most certainly a healthy \nreduction.\n  Tax relief. We are going to have $5.6 trillion in surplus over the \nnext 10 years. We are proposing to divide that right down the middle \nand set aside all of the Social Security and Medicare surplus so that \nthose items will only be spent for those two very important programs. \nBut of the other half, which is the income tax withholding surplus, \nwhich means that people are sending $2.5 trillion more to Washington \nthan we need to fund the current programs, we want to return $1.6 \ntrillion, leaving approximately $1 trillion for added spending because \nwe are going to add spending in our priority areas.\n  The overall budget increase is 4 percent. There will be more in some \nareas such as public education--11.5 percent--and there will be less in \nsome areas. There will be dead even expenditures 1 year to the next in \nsome areas. In some cases, projects have already been finished and they \ndo not need more funding.\n  So we are taking the responsible approach of saying $1.6 trillion \ngoes back into the pocketbooks of the people who earned it. What is \ngoing to happen with that $1.6 trillion? That money will go back into \nthe economy, either through spending, savings, or investment, all of \nwhich is better than having it sit in Washington doing nothing for the \neconomy. In fact, some economists say it is a drag on our economy to \nhave this big a surplus sitting in Washington, doing nothing. It is \nbetter to be in the pocketbooks of the people who earned it so it will \ngo back into the economy and create the jobs and the prosperity that \nwill keep the economy strong.\n  We are talking about a $5.6 trillion tax relief package. But Senator \nDomenici, to his great credit, came up with the idea that we are \nwatching the economy stagnate right now. So why don't we take $60 \nbillion, which is the surplus we have available right now, and give it \nback to the people right now. So $60 billion is set aside.\n\n  The Democrats and the Republicans have agreed on that figure. Senator \nConrad has agreed on the $60 billion figure. That is in the budget we \nwill pass today. How that $60 billion is returned to taxpayers I do not \nknow. We will talk about that later. We will hammer it out. But now \nthat we have the number in the budget, the people of our country will \nknow they are going to get some relief immediately.\n  No. 3, protecting Social Security and Medicare. We want to make sure \nthat Social Security is secure. That is our No. 1 priority. That is \nexactly what we do in this budget resolution. The Social Security \nsurplus will be used for Social Security, and it will also reduce the \ndebt because we have the surplus that is there for Social Security. The \nsame is true for Medicare. The budget resolution ensures that every \ndime of Medicare Part A will be used for Medicare, for paying down the \ndebt. It also provides--and this is important; Senator Gramm was \ntalking about this before I spoke--$153 billion over the next 10 years \nwill go for prescription drug benefits and options in Medicare because \nall of us know that people are having a harder time paying for their \nprescription drugs.\n  Prescription drugs have taken the place of surgery. They have taken \nthe place of hospital stays. They have lessened the cost of health care \nin general. But the drugs are expensive so we need to accommodate that \nadded expense as we are reforming Medicare. This budget provides the \nmeans to do that.\n  So what is left? Our funding priorities. We are increasing our \npriority areas 11.5 percent for education. That is our No. 1 priority \narea and it is the biggest expenditure in the budget. A 4-percent \noverall annual increase is going to be higher than the rate of \ninflation. So I think that is quite responsible.\n  In addition, we are going to double the spending at the National \nInstitutes of Health for the research so we can, hopefully, find the \ncure for breast cancer and colon cancer and all of the diseases, heart \ndisease--we are pouring the money into the research because we want to \ntry to cure these diseases.\n  We have treatments for these diseases but in many instances we don't \nhave the cure. That is what doubling the NIH budget does.\n  We are going to increase national defense spending. That is our first \nresponsibility. Curing Social Security and providing for the national \ndefense is our first-line responsibility. We are going to make sure \nthat the men and women who give their lives to protect our freedom will \nhave the support they need to do the job. We are going to give them \nhigher pay. We are going to give them education benefits. We are going \nto give them health care benefits, and we are going to give them better \nhealth. We owe them that. They are doing a job for our country that no \none else can do.\n  We are going to have the next generation of technology so that we \nkeep our superiority in national security; so that we keep the air \nsuperiority we have seen just in the last year absolutely perform in \nthe way we had hoped it would.\n  We are going to keep the superiority of our defenses because we know \nthat the best defense is a good defense. We know that peace will come \nthrough strength. Knowing that we have the best is the best deterrent \nthat we can have for any country that might choose to fool around with \nAmerica.\n  I am proud of this budget resolution. I am proud of the President of \nthe United States.\n  There is a new era in Washington. I hope we can keep the promises we \nmade to the American people and pass a responsible budget resolution \nwith responsible spending and responsible tax relief for every hard-\nworking American.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts was to follow \nthe Senator from Texas. The Senator from Texas has 4 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\n Does she intend to allow the Senator to use her time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I had 15 minutes, and it is my \nintention to yield the remainder to Senator Frist.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have a \nunanimous consent agreement in place. The unanimous consent agreement \nprovided for time for the Senator from Texas, and then we were to go to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and then back to the Senator from \nTennessee. I think what has been suggested would be out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts was next to be \nrecognized.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 15 minutes. I \nask the Chair to let me know when I have 12 minutes left.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator Conrad, the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, for his excellent presentation both \nlast evening and this morning. I also commend him for his deep and \nprofound and thoughtful analysis of the whole budget that is before the \nSenate at this time in the rather unusual form because, as I think \nevery Member understands, we don't have the President's budget.\n  I think all of us believe we should have the actual budget of the \nPresident so we can find out the President's priorities and the cuts \nthat are going to be made in the various programs rather than \npredicting or surmising what might be in that particular proposal.\n  I commend Senator Conrad for the very strong analysis he has made of \nthis. From any fair reading of the debate, to date, one would have to \nfind that the presentation made has been clear and convincing--that we \nare not going to be able to do all things for all people. We are not \ngoing to be able to afford these very dramatic tax cuts, which I \nbelieve are too large, too unfair, and too unpredictable, and still \ndeal with the many challenges that we are facing.\n  I commend the Senators from Montana and Florida, Mr. Baucus and Mr. \nGraham, for their leadership on this issue of prescription drugs. They \nhave made a very effective case. It is one which I strongly support. I \nthank them.\n  It is a clear indication of the priorities on this side of the aisle \nthat our first amendment is on the issue of prescription drugs. This \namendment recognizes the enormous need for giving assurances for \nprescription drugs to our seniors. I want to underline that fact. \nToday, as was pointed out in the presentation of Senator Baucus of \nMontana and the presentation of the Senator from Florida, this is \nreally a life and death issue.\n  Our debate on the budget is really a question of priorities, and it \nis also a question of values. What we are saying with this amendment is \nthat we put a high priority on the issue of prescription drugs--\nguaranteeing an affordable, dependable, reliable, and effective \nprescription drug program for our seniors in this country, and for \nothers in desperate need.\n  There is a critical failure to make that commitment in the underlying \nbudget proposal. As has been debated on the floor of the Senate on a \nnumber of different occasions, the issue of prescription drugs is a \nlife and death issue.\n  This budget is about priorities. We are talking about life and death \nissues. For senior citizens, prescription drugs are as important as \ngoing to the hospital today. They are as important as the physician's \ncare.\n  If you can, imagine what would happen in this country if the Senate \nof the United States decided to take away all guarantees of \nhospitalization under Medicare. The country would be in an uproar. If \nwe decided to take all guarantees of the physician's care away, the \ncountry would not tolerate it. Yet for our senior citizens, make no \nmistake about it, prescription drugs are life and death to them.\n  I listened to my good friend--she is my good friend--from Texas \ntalking about investing in the NIH and producing these new miracle \ndrugs. That will be meaningless unless we are going to set up a system \nto get the magnificent new drugs out to the people who need them. That \nis what this amendment is all about.\n  What we see before the Senate--in terms of choice and in terms of \npriority--is a Republican budget that effectively provides for a $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut for the wealthiest individuals, and only $153 billion \nfor the Medicare program.\n  For the over 1 million individuals who are making more than $1 \nmillion, they will get $729 billion. Those seniors who are on Medicare \nand need prescription drugs get $153 billion. These tax breaks are for \nthe millionaires who benefited very well over the last several years. \nWe are going to give them $729 billion and $153 billion for the 39 \nmillion senior citizens and others who depend on Medicare.\n  Who are these senior citizens who depend on Medicare? The average \nsenior citizen who depends on prescription drugs and Medicare is 73 \nyears old, a widow, about $14,000 in income, with multiple ailments.\n  Do we understand that? A senior citizen making about $14,000 gets \none-fifth in this budget what we are going to give the wealthiest 1 \npercent. This is the question of priorities.\n  This chart shows very clearly that about 80 percent of all seniors \nhave incomes under $25,000. Those are the people about whom we are \ntalking.\n\n  This issue is about priorities. Are we going to give tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest individuals or are we going to say--as a matter of \nnational priority--our senior citizens are a priority? They are in \ndesperate need for a prescription drug program.\n  With all due respect to the proponents of the administration's \nbudget, in the proposal that is before us, just look at what they say \nin justifying their position on prescription drugs: ``If the Committee \non Finance of the Senate reports''--if. Do you think the word ``if'' is \nin there for the tax cut? This is what the words for the tax cut are: \n``the amount by which the aggregate levels of Federal revenues should \nbe reduced.'' It is mandated here. It is mandated for the tax cut but \nnot with regard to prescription drugs.\n  It says: ``If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill . \n. . which improves the solvency of the Medicare programs''--what does \nthat mean, ``improves the solvency of the Medicare programs''? That is \n``wordspeak'' for if they are going to cut out benefits, because here \nit says: ``without the use of new subsidies from the general fund.'' \nThose words ``which improves the solvency'' mean if we report out of \nthe Finance Committee--if they are going to report a bill--it is going \nto improve the solvency of the Medicare program by cutting out other \nbenefits, because it says here ``without the use of new subsidies from \nthe general fund.''\n  Therefore, the only way you are going to get prescription drugs is if \nthey decide to do it, and it is only going to happen if they make cuts \nin the Medicare program and if the bill ``improves the access to \nprescription drugs.''\n  Wouldn't you think they would at least put the words in there that \nwould guarantee prescription drugs? No. It is ``access to prescription \ndrugs.''\n  What in the world is happening? ``Access to prescription drugs''--is \nthat the President's old program, a ``helping hand'' for prescription \ndrugs? Is it a welfare benefit program? What is it? All it says is \n``access to prescription drugs.'' It is no guarantee that there will be \nan effective prescription drug program that will be universal, that \nwill be comprehensive, that will have basic and comprehensive coverage, \nand that will be affordable, like in the Baucus proposal. It also says: \nif there is ``. . . access to prescription drugs for the Medicare \nbeneficiaries, the chairman of the Budget Committee of the Senate \nmay''--may--``revise the allocations, but not to exceed the . . . $153 \nbillion.''\n  We know what is going on here. The Budget Committee on the one hand \nmandates tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals. There is no \ncontingency in this budget proposal with regard to taxes. There are no \nifs, ands, or buts; there is a mandate for the Finance Committee on \ntaxes, but not for prescription drugs. You would think if they were \ngoing to put this completely inadequate amount of money into the budget \nfor prescription drugs, they would actually say: ``When the Committee \non Finance does report a prescription drug program.'' But, oh, no.\n  So make no mistake about it, this is phony. It is made up. No senior \ncitizen\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nin this country can take any--any--satisfaction whatsoever from what \nhas been included in the budget proposal.\n  The proposal that is before the Senate at this time by the Senators \nfrom Montana and Florida remedies that. It puts us on record to say \nthat this is a national priority, this is a reflection of our budget \npriorities, this is a reflection of our values. We are going to insist \nthat we have an opportunity to express it in this budget, and we shall.\n\n  Now I think for those who are watching this debate, there are four \nmajor criteria by which we should evaluate the budget plan:\n  Is it a fiscally responsible and balanced program? As has been \npointed out by the Senator from North Dakota and others, it does not \nmeet that test.\n  Does it protect Social Security and Medicare for future generation \nretirees? It flunks that test.\n  Does it adequately address the urgent needs, such as the prescription \ndrug program and the real enhancement which is necessary if we are \ngoing to make education a priority in this country? We will have an \namendment that will be offered by our colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Harkin, on that issue.\n  And does it distribute the benefits of the surplus fairly amongst all \nAmericans? It fails that test.\n  If the American people care about prescription drugs, this amendment \nis the way to go. It is well thought out. It is responsive to the \nchallenge. It is absolutely essential to meet the health care needs of \nour senior citizens, at a time when their prescription drug coverage is \ndropping right through the bottom.\n  A third of our seniors have no coverage. A third of our seniors have \nno coverage. Another third have employer-sponsored retiree coverage, \nbut it is in rapid decline. We have seen how that has fallen off 40 \npercent in the last few years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then we have seen what has happened in Medicare HMOs. \nLast year, 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries were dropped from their \nMedicare HMOs. This year it is 934,000--three times as many in 2001 as \nwere dropped in 2000. People have to be asking: Business as usual? I \nhear from the other side: Business as usual. Business as usual.\n  We are challenging that theory with this amendment. We believe this \nis a reflection of the true values of the American people and the true \npriorities of American families. I hope the amendment will be adopted.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair and ask that the Chair notify me when I \nhave 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator has the 12 minutes of his \ntime plus the 4 minutes yielded to him earlier. The Chair will notify \nthe Senator when there are 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to continue our dialog and debate this morning on Medicare, \nhow we improve Medicare, how to strengthen Medicare for our seniors, as \nwell as for our individuals with disabilities.\n  We are in the middle of the budget debate which sets the framework \nfor our policies over the coming days and weeks and months of this \nyear.\n  I am a little more optimistic than the Members I heard this morning \nbecause I think we have a unique opportunity, an opportunity that is \nreflected in the budget put forth by both President Bush and Senator \nDomenici, as reflected in the budget resolution that is before this \nbody--a body that aims at what I think is most important when we look \nto our seniors or our individuals with disabilities because what they \nreally want is health care security; that if they need care at a \ncertain time, it will be available for them and include the hospital \nbed, the surgeon's knife, the operation, the outpatient unit, the \ndoctor's visit, and prescription drugs. That is where the opportunity \ncomes in. So I would like to speak to that shortly.\n  We are talking about the budget today, so let me begin with what the \nPresident's budget is, what is reflected in the budget resolution \nbefore us, and what are the numbers.\n  If we look at Medicare, and we look at fiscal year 2002, the Medicare \noutlays would be $229 billion. It is a large number, but until you \nstart looking at other numbers, how large is it? And what happens to \nit?\n  In that first year, it is $229 billion. Our budget, the budget we are \ntalking about on the floor, goes out, year by year, to year 5 and year \n10. In year 10, that $229 billion in the budget resolution put forth by \nSenator Domenici is up to $459 billion. That is in the budget. That is \nabout an 111-percent increase, if you compare the first year on out to \n11 years. And that is the resolution. If you look at year 5, just to \ngive you the overall numbers, there is a year-5 number of $291 billion, \nwhich represents a 42-percent increase, an increase of about $92 \nbillion. Thus, we are talking about marked increases in the Medicare \nbudget as we go forward.\n  In addition to that, there is $153 billion in addition to that--the \nincreases I just talked about--which is placed on top of it, to be \ndirected to modernization, to strengthening Medicare, to give our \nseniors more security by including prescription drugs. And I hope, as \nwe modernize Medicare, and as we strengthen Medicare, we do other \nthings--in fact, I would say we absolutely have to do that if we want \nto have a program that is going to be sustained over time--such as more \npreventive care, more chronic care, better care for heart disease, for \nlung disease, and for cancers.\n  That is where it comes back to the great opportunity we find before \nus that is laid out in the policy behind this budget; that is, that we \nhave the opportunity to strengthen Medicare, to improve Medicare, to \nmodernize Medicare, to bring it up to the sort of standards today that \nwe see so broadly distributed in the private sector.\n  I should add, what Senators and Members of the Congress get, what the \nPresident of the United States gets, what Federal employees get--our \nseniors deserve it, and individuals with disabilities deserve it.\n  When I say strengthen Medicare, which this budget allows us to do, I \nam talking about improving it, making it stronger, injecting energy \ninto the program to make it more responsive to the individual needs of \nseniors or individuals with disabilities.\n  When I say improve Medicare, which this budget allows, and the policy \nbehind it almost assures, I am talking about adding a benefit, such as \nprescription drugs, which will be universally available, adding more \nelements of preventive care and chronic care, disease management, the \nsort of disease management that is routine in the non-Medicare world \nbut which cannot, because of this rigid stratification and \nmicromanagement, be included in Medicare today.\n  I am talking about strengthening, improving, and modernizing \nMedicare. One has to be careful when saying ``modernize Medicare.'' \nPeople ask, What does that mean? Does it mean laying off people? It is \njust the opposite: to have more value from Medicare. We need to bring \nit up to speed, to make sure our seniors get the same options, \nopportunities, and choices that we have as Federal employees. That is \nthe opportunity we have.\n  The problem we must address as we increase this budget from $229 \nbillion this year under the Bush proposal, the Domenici proposal, to \n$309 billion in year 6, to $459 billion in year 11 in this budget, is \nMedicare today is based on a 1965 health delivery system. Think of the \ncars you were driving in 1965. Some of them are pretty nice on the road \ntoday if they have been buffed, polished, and kept tuned. There are not \nmany people who would want to be driving today the same car they drove \nin 1965. We must continue to invest in Medicare because of outdated \nbenefits.\n  We have to add $153 billion, which we have done in the underlying \nbill because right now we do not have prescription drugs. As a \nphysician who has prescribed and written tens of thousands of \nprescriptions, I know the value of those prescription drugs. They \nabsolutely have to be a part of the toolbox, the tools, the \narmamentarium that physicians and nurses, recipients, beneficiaries, \nindividuals with disabilities, and seniors can use to maximize quality \ncare, and that is health care security.\n  There are no outpatient prescription drugs as a part of Medicare \ntoday, and\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nthat is the challenge this body has, especially as we develop policy, \nand that will come, in part, in this budget debate, but really after \nthe budget debate by the Finance Committee and elsewhere.\n  Limited access to new technologies: Most people know it takes not \njust weeks and months but years and sometimes an act of Congress to get \nnew technology considered in Medicare today. Our seniors deserve \nbetter.\n  Little preventative care today in Medicare: A lot of our seniors, as \nI travel around the country at hometown meetings say: I like my \nMedicare, and it is good. Medicare has been a hugely successful program \nover the last 35 years, and I, as a physician, have seen it day in and \nday out, and it has been hugely successful.\n  What a lot of people do not realize--and it was clearly apparent in \nthe hearings we had in the Subcommittee on Public Health of the Finance \nCommittee--is that the benefits that are in the private sector have \ncontinued to improve, where the benefits in Medicare have been \nstagnant; they have not changed or changed slowly. That is why it is \noutdated. We absolutely must strengthen, improve, and modernize it.\n\n  Right now Medicare only covers 53 percent of a senior's health costs. \nAsk a senior: Of health care costs over the next 10 years, how much \nwill be covered by Medicare? Many think 80 percent or 85 percent but in \ntruth it is 53 percent.\n  Micromanagement: Again, that is a product of us being well intended, \npassing laws year after year, and giving it to an organization called \nthe Health Care Financing Administration which has layered regulation \non regulation to the point the regulations, rules, and explanations \nthat cover that simple doctor-patient relationship amount to 135,000 \npages of regulations. The Internal Revenue Service has about 40,000 \npages of regulations.\n  Those regulations governing the relationship between the doctor and \npatient are not 45,000, 50,000, 60,000, 80,000; it is 135,000 pages of \nmicromanaging regulations. We have to simplify it. We have to \nstreamline and modernize so we can meet the individual needs of our \nseniors.\n  In this whole idea of micromanagement, improving Medicare, there are \n10,000 different prices coded for everything you do in that doctor-\npatient relationship. As you talk to a patient, you treat them, \ndiagnose them, send off their tests, and there are 10,000 different \nprices. Even on top of that, they are different in 3,000 different \ncommunities.\n  The inefficiencies, the lack of value in Medicare today, have to be \nimproved as we go forward.\n  I listed the baby boomers. There is going to be a huge increase in \nthe number of seniors. We have to prepare for the future.\n  We just had the Medicare report from the Medicare trustees. It is \nstrange. One reads the newspapers and sees this optimism about \nMedicare; that it is on sound footing right now. Medicare, one could \nargue, is on sound footing, I guess, although I will show it certainly \nis not as sound as we think. The rate at which we are depleting the HI \ntrust fund--I will show my colleagues shortly--is depleted rapidly as \nwe go forward.\n  This is the budget, so I am going to talk a little bit about the \nnumbers as we go forward, again, to show the background.\n  There are two trust funds, Part A and Part B, in Medicare. We need to \nlook at health care security--Part A is hospitals and Part B is \nphysicians and prescription drugs, which we as a body will add and \nhopefully integrate into Medicare--we need to look at it as a whole.\n  As a physician, when I am treating a patient with a particular \nproblem and I diagnose that problem, I do not start thinking of all \nthese different programs. I like to integrate that: Should that patient \ngo in the hospital? Should we treat that patient as an outpatient? \nShould we try a newly effective drug? Should we use a generic drug? One \nneeds to think in an integrated fashion.\n  If we look at just the Part A trust fund and Part B--roughly the Part \nA trust fund is about half; Part B is the other half--the Part A trust \nfund is what we talk about when we talk about solvency.\n  On this chart, if we look at just the HI trust fund, Part A, \nhospitals, green is what we actually spend and red is income. The \nimportant point is, in 15 years, in the hospital trust fund, we will be \nspending more than we will be taking in. We are deficit spending.\n  A lot of people say: We do not have to worry about Medicare \nmodernization now: why worry? That is 15 years from now; we will have \nnew technology; costs will come down; we will have prescription drugs. \nWhat they do not think about is although the Part A trust fund does not \nbegin deficit spending until 2016, look how quickly the blue line \ndiminishes over time to 2029.\n  When we look at the Medicare program as a whole, today we are deficit \nspending. Right now Medicare as a whole--Part A and Part B--is spending \nmore than it is taking in. I just showed the HI trust fund for \nhospitals, which is about half the overall program; in 2002, indeed, \nthere is a surplus. So people feel pretty good: Let's not worry about \nmodernizing Medicare.\n  Part B, which people around here for some reason do not pay much \nattention to but is a significant part, we have a draw on the General \nTreasury. We are basically taking money out of the General Treasury and \nputting it into Medicare to the tune in 2002 of $93 billion. Therefore, \nif one looks at the entire Medicare program A and B together, we are \ndeficit spending to the tune of $58 billion this year, and from 2002 to \n2011 it will be $980 billion of deficit spending.\n  I go through this explanation to set the backdrop because we have a \nhuge challenge as we go forward. We have to, I believe, inextricably \nlink new benefits, such as prescription drugs, which absolutely have to \nbe a part of Medicare--to A and B, hospitalization and physician care--\nand make it an integral part. There are lots of reasons. One I just \nshowed: We are deficit spending now. If we add on top of that further \ndeficit spending, or put a program which could potentially just \nexplode, all of a sudden our seniors lose their health care security. \nAll of a sudden a program which is in deficit spending now has a \npotential for increasing deficit spending. We have to do it the right \nway.\n\n  Adding a new benefit such as prescription drugs has to be part of \nmodernization and improving a program, an integral part of the program. \nWe will hear a call for including prescription drugs. The challenge \nbefore this body is how, given these numbers, this degree of deficit \nspending, we put in a new benefit that, I argue, has the most powerful \ninternal drive to explode, to be out of control--larger than any social \nprogram we have seen in this body.\n  That is a pretty big statement, but that is how strong this internal \ndemand is for prescription drugs.\n  Think about a mother who is dying. You want the very best drug \navailable to reverse that course. You will demand it. You will try to \npay for it in any way possible. You will ask the Government for it, the \ntaxpayer for it; you will take it out of your pocket. That is the money \nwe are seeing with prescription drugs because they are revolutionary \ntoday. Isn't it great they are, the fact you can have crippling \narthritis and for the first time you can get up and get around.\n  Look at what we are getting ready to add on Medicare, rightfully so, \nbut we have to do it the right way. This chart illustrates prescription \ndrug expenditures in the United States of America from 1965 to 1999. \nYou see the huge growth in total prescription drug expenditures. For \nseniors alone, it is probably about a third of that. If we project to \nthe future, what we are getting ready to add to Medicare--again, \nappropriately so--this is what we just saw, in red, and this chart \nshows, in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007, explosive growth. We need to come \nback and do it right. We have to integrate prescription drugs in \noverall modernization.\n  I strongly support the proposal put forth by Senator Domenici and \nPresident Bush. It increases Medicare spending to $459 billion over the \nnext 10 years and increases it by $153 billion for prescription drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of \nthis very important amendment to the budget resolution. I thank the \nSenator from Montana for his leadership on\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nthis issue and on the Finance Committee, as well as the Senator from \nFlorida and my leader on the Budget Committee, the Senator from North \nDakota. I very much appreciate his ongoing leadership on this important \nissue.\n  As a personal aside before speaking about this amendment, I come from \nthe great State of Michigan with Michigan State University. If I might \nsay to the Senator from North Dakota, we are looking forward to betting \nyou in hockey on Thursday evening.\n  Now to the serious issue before the Senate. This is an issue of \npriorities for the American people as we look at the next 10 years. We \nall agree it is difficult to look into the crystal ball 10 years from \nnow. We are being asked to do that, and many Members are cautious and \nconcerned about locking in the next 10 years on revenues since it is \nnot possible to be accurate. We know that. Chairman Greenspan called it \neducated guesses.\n  We do know when we are debating this list of priorities that the \nPresident has laid out a plan that says if you were to put Medicare and \nSocial Security surpluses aside--and he does choose to spend part of \nthose, which we will debate later--if you put that aside, the President \nhas said the only priority for the American people for 10 years is a \ntax cut geared to the wealthiest Americans that we hope will trickle \ndown to everyone else.\n  Now, in Michigan, the people I represent want a tax cut as one of the \npriorities for the future. I support an across-the-board tax cut that \ngives as much as possible to middle-income families working hard every \nday, sending kids to college, to help moms and dads and seniors with \ntheir prescriptions, and put money in their pockets, and family farmers \nand small businesses, as one of the priorities of the country. I \nsupport that. I don't think it is the only priority for the next 10 \nyears.\n  What we are talking about today in this amendment is another very \nimportant priority; that is, updating Medicare to cover the costs of \nprescription drugs to assure our seniors, who have been promised that \nMedicare would be there, that health care would be there when they \nretire, that those who were disabled and were promised Medicare would \nbe there, that in fact, it really is.\n  We all know that the only way to guarantee Medicare is to cover \nprescription drugs. That is what this amendment does. It makes it real. \nIt says when you look at this budget and you look at the real costs \nover 10 years of about $2.5 trillion that is put aside for one \npriority, a tax cut, we are asking for a very small amount, just a \nlittle amount, to come from that $2.5 trillion over into prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors to modernize Medicare--$158 billion. I \nbelieve that is a very small change with a very big impact for our \nseniors and our families.\n  I am concerned for most of our seniors. Most of the seniors in \nMichigan, most of the seniors in America, will not receive any of the \ntax cut being proposed. But if we want to put money back in their \npockets, we have a chance to do that through this amendment by lowering \nthe costs of their medicine. We all know it is the right thing to do. I \nbet there is not a person in this esteemed body who did not talk about \nthe importance of prescription drugs and how seniors shouldn't have to \nchoose between their medicine and their meals when they were out \ncampaigning.\n\n  Now is the time when the rubber meets the road, the time when we have \na chance to vote what we have talked about and the real priorities of \nthe country. I can't explain, when a senior citizen comes to me and \nsays he has been told by his doctor there is a pill he can take that \nwill stop him from having open-heart surgery, why the pill costs $400--\none pill a month, $400. Medicare will pay for the operation. It won't \npay for the pill. He asks me how that makes any sense. I have to say it \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  Now is the time to correct that. Today, right now, as we are on the \nfloor, there are seniors sitting down at the kitchen table deciding: Do \nI eat today or do I take my medicine? Do I pay my utility bill or do I \ntake my medicine? Do I cut my pills in half? Do I take them every other \nday?\n  I have doctors coming to me expressing grave concerns about seniors \nwho put themselves in serious health jeopardy by trying to self-\nregulate their medication--every other week, every other day, doing \nsomething they shouldn't to make the pills last longer. We all know the \nstories. This amendment says we are serious about fixing it.\n  This is not an issue we have made up. I heard our esteemed budget \nchairman say that every time we talk about tax cuts, we Democrats make \nup an issue and it just pops up because we want to spend money. I know \nthe issue of prescription drug coverage is not made up. Everybody in my \nState, young or old, knows the need to cover prescription drugs and \nmake them available for our seniors is not made up. It is very serious \nand it is very real. It is very unfair, as we found in a statewide \nstudy throughout my State. There we looked at the costs that uninsured \nseniors pay when they walk into the pharmacy versus somebody with \ninsurance. We found on average they pay twice as much. That is not \nfair.\n\n  If you have insurance and they can negotiate a good discount, you get \na better deal. Medicare needs to be there to give our seniors a better \ndeal. That is what this is about: updating Medicare to cover the way \nhealth care is provided today, having Medicare out there getting our \nseniors a better deal so they can live in dignity and respect and have \nthe promise kept that was made in 1965 when Medicare was enacted.\n  This is an important amendment. I commend my colleagues, again, for \ntheir leadership in this area. With just a small change, we can begin \nto get some balance back in this debate about the budget. We have a \nnumber of important priorities facing our country. I believe a tax cut \nis one of those, as is paying down the debt to keep money in people's \npockets, with lower interest rates, as are jobs. I also believe \nlowering the cost of prescription drugs is a critical part of this pie.\n  I ask my colleagues, if not now, when? We are not going to do it if \nwe are running deficits. We are not going to be able to do it if we \nmove into a serious recession. If we cannot update Medicare now and \nkeep the promise to our seniors and the disabled when we have \nsurpluses, we never will. We should admit it and stop talking about it, \nstop using it as a campaign issue.\n  This is the opportunity for us to do what everybody is talking about: \nprovide a substantial Medicare prescription drug benefit and make sure \nthat, in fact, it does something real for our seniors to allow them to \nlive in dignity and have the quality of life they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan who is \na valued member of the Senate Budget Committee. She is new to this \nbody, but she is certainly not new to the issues because she served \nwith distinction in the House of Representatives and was a leader on \nmany of these issues in the House of Representatives. She brought that \nknowledge and that commitment to the issues to the Senate.\n  There has been, really, no new member of the Budget Committee who has \nbeen any more responsive in terms of commitment to the work of the \nBudget Committee than the Senator from Michigan. She cares deeply about \ngetting our fiscal house in order and keeping it there. She cares \ndeeply about the right priorities for the country, including improving \neducation and providing a prescription drug benefit. She has made a \nvery valuable contribution to the work of the committee.\n  I think she was disappointed, as I was, that we did not have a markup \nin the Budget Committee. We did not even attempt to mark up a budget \nfor our colleagues, which is unprecedented. But I want to say she has \nmade a valuable contribution during the deliberations of the committee \nand the set of hearings we had and in producing the Democratic \nalternative. I thank her very much for those contributions.\n  Senator Dorgan from North Dakota is in the queue for time to speak, \nand I yield him 10 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am here to talk about this amendment,\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nbut I say to my colleague, Senator Conrad, I also am interested in \ncoming over at some point soon and spending a little time talking about \nthis budget resolution and especially the issue of the increase in \npublic debt. I want to go through with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, the issue of the increase in public debt over a 10-year \nperiod, which seems to me incompatible with this notion that we have \nsuch large surpluses that we can provide a 10-year tax cut costing \ntrillions of dollars. If that is the case, why is the public debt \nincreasing in this very budget resolution? I will do that at a later \ntime, but I am here now to talk about the issue of prescription drugs.\n\n  We know there are a large number of citizens, especially senior \ncitizens, in this country who cannot afford the prescription medicines \nthey must take, the prescription medicines prescribed by their doctors \nnecessary to continue a healthy lifestyle. All of us have an \nopportunity day to day and week to week, as we are in our respective \nStates, to talk to older Americans who are taking increasing amounts of \nprescription drugs and paying more for them.\n  Senior citizens represent 12 percent of our country's population. Yet \nthey consume one-third of this country's prescription drugs. Why is \nthat the case? In one century, we have increased the life expectancy in \nour country by nearly 30 years--from 48 to nearly 78. I know some wring \ntheir hands and gnash their teeth and mop their brow because of all the \nproblems we have with Medicare and also with Social Security. All of \nthose problems are born of success: people are living longer and have \nbetter lives. Let us not gnash our teeth too much about the success of \nhaving people living much longer in this country. We can and should \naddress the financing issues in Social Security and Medicare, and we \ncan do that without, in my judgment, great difficulty.\n  One of the issues with people living longer, and one of the issues \nwith the substantial amount of new medicines available to prolong life \nin this country is, how do we pay the bill? Especially if you are \nconsuming prescription drugs whose cost is increasing substantially at \na time when you have reached that retirement age, the time in life when \nyour income is decreasing a great deal, how do you address that?\n  The proposal by members of my caucus in the Senate, the Democrats, as \nwell as a proposal now by the Bush administration, is to provide a \nprescription drug benefit for senior citizens. We proposed to put it in \nthe Medicare program. The prescription drug proposal, as a part of this \nbudget, needs to be sufficient so the prescription drug benefit will \nwork for senior citizens.\n  We all know the cost of prescription drugs is going up dramatically, \n15 to 16 percent a year in increased costs for prescription drugs. Part \nof that is increased utilization and part is price inflation. But we \nall understand the consequences of these increased prices to senior \ncitizens.\n  I have told my colleagues of a woman who came to me one evening at a \nmeeting I had in the northern part of North Dakota. She was perhaps 75 \nyears old. At the end of the meeting, she approached me and said: \nSenator Dorgan, I am retired. I am getting up in age. I have to take \nseveral medicines to treat diabetes and heart trouble. But I don't have \nany money. I am left without any assets or income of any sort and I \ncan't afford to take these medicines. Yet my doctor says I really must \ntake these medicines.\n  As she began to talk to me, her chin began to quiver and her eyes \nwelled with tears and it was clear she was on the edge of crying \nbecause she knew what she had to do. She needed to take this medicine \nto prolong her life and treat her illnesses and she didn't have the \nmoney to do so. This goes on across this country all the time.\n  I was at a hearing in Dickerson, ND, one day and a doctor said he had \na senior citizen as a patient who had breast cancer. After the patient \nhad surgery, the doctor prescribed a medicine and said this medicine is \nsomething you must take because it will reduce your chances of \nrecurrence of cancer. The woman looked at the doctor and said: Doctor, \nthere isn't any way I can take that medicine. I can't possibly afford \nthat medicine. I will just have to take my chances with breast cancer.\n\n  I was at a hearing in New York with my colleague, Senator Schumer, \nwhen one of the witnesses talked about going to the grocery store but \nalways going to the back of the store first where the pharmacy was \nbecause first she had to buy her prescription drugs. Only then would \nshe know how much money she would have left to purchase food. I have \nheard that a dozen times, if I have heard it once.\n  Should we do something about this? The answer is clearly yes.\n  The Senate budget resolution provides a certain amount of money for a \nprescription drug benefit. But let me quote the Congressional Budget \nOffice Director, Dan Crippen, who said in testimony before the Senate \nFinance Committee:\n\n       If you are going to provide $150 billion over the entire \n     Medicare population--again for 10 years--it won't provide a \n     great deal for any one person.\n\n  The money provided in the Republican budget resolution does not even \ncover the cost of the President's own Healthy Hand prescription drug \nproposal. About 25 million of the nearly 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries would be ineligible for the President's plan.\n  If the amount proposed by the President in his budget were used to \nprovide a universal drug benefit in Medicare--which is really what we \nought to do--it would provide about $200 coverage for a beneficiary for \nthe first year.\n  This debate is about choices. The budget debate is always about \nchoices. The most significant choice is the front end of this debate, \nand according to the President, is the tax cut.\n  I believe we are going to enact a tax cut. I will support a tax cut. \nBut I don't believe we ought to have a tax cut to the tune of trillions \nof dollars--and, yes--that is more than $1.6 trillion as proposed by \nthe President. Everyone scores it at well over $2 trillion.\n  To do that when we don't know what the future will bring with respect \nto this economy, to do that at a time when we have the public debt \nincreasing and not decreasing, and to do that when we don't have \nsufficient resources to improve our schools, or, yes, in this \ncircumstance on this amendment, to provide enough resources so that we \nhave a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare plan, in my \njudgment, shortchanges all Americans.\n  It means we will have an increasing Federal debt--not decreasing. It \nmeans we are short of doing what we ought to do to make this a better \ncountry--improving our schools, providing for the family farmers during \ntough times, and in this amendment providing for a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare.\n  My colleagues have offered the amendment today in the hope that we \ncould reach agreement in this Senate. At least between the two \npolitical parties, doing this makes sense. Adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare program makes sense.\n  I think everyone agrees that if the prescription drugs had been \navailable when Medicare was created that are available now, clearly we \nwould have had a prescription drug benefit in the program.\n  Said differently, if we had no Medicare program but we were going to \ncreate one in the year 2001, just as clearly it would include a \nprescription drug benefit, because we are moving away from acute care \nhospital stays, we are moving towards outpatient procedures in medical \nfacilities, and especially we are moving towards prescription drugs \nthat allow people to live without having acute-care health. That is \nmuch less expensive in many ways.\n\n  These new medicines that are available are breathtaking, lifesaving \nmedicines. They are good for researchers on the public payroll--at NIH \nand elsewhere--those in private prescription drug companies, and \nothers. It is good for them. We are developing wonder drugs that allow \npeople to do things they wouldn't have before thought possible.\n  But it is very expensive. We ought to find a way to say to those who \nhave reached their declining income years in life: We want to help you \nbe able to afford the prescription drugs you need to continue to live \nyour life.\n  This isn't some luxury. This isn't some optional expenditure. The \nprescription drugs are necessary for senior citizens who are in many \ncases required to take 2, 5, 10 or even 12 different kinds of \nprescription drugs a day. It is very expensive to do so.\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n  We must pass this amendment to make room in this budget for a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. That is why I \nsupport this amendment.\n  Let describe a couple of other different priorities, if I might.\n  Mr. President, 100 years from now everyone in this Chamber will be \ndead. It is an ominous thought, but it is true. The only historical \nreference about who we were and what we did here will be to look at \nthis budget and see what we did that was considered valuable: What were \nour priorities? What did we think was important for this country?\n  This budget represents the framework by which future generations can \njudge us. Every time in this country we have tried to do something new, \nthere have been those who have said no. They opposed everything for the \nfirst time. It didn't matter what it was--Social Security, Medicare, \nminimum wage--you name it; they opposed it.\n  This budget resolution establishes our priorities.\n  Let me describe a few priorities.\n  First, a tax cut. Yes, let's so do that, and let's make it fair. Is \nit fair that the top 1 percent of the taxpayers pay about 21 percent of \nall income taxes and payroll taxes but would get 43 percent of the tax \ncut? Absolutely not. Let's do a tax cut. Let's make it fair.\n  Second, let's pay down the Federal debt. I want to ask the chairman \nof the committee and others why the public debt is increasing on page 6 \nof this budget resolution over 10 years.\n  Third, what about other priorities? I mentioned schools. Does anybody \nthink our future doesn't depend on improving our schools? Of course it \ndoes. Should we and could we improve our schools? Of course. But we \nmust have the resources to do that as well.\n  In addition to improving our schools, we know we need to pass an \namendment such as this to provide a prescription drug benefit in the \nMedicare program.\n\n  We need to have room in this budget resolution to help family farmers \ngiven these price valuations. If this country believes that we are a \nbetter country because of families living on and operating America's \nfarms all across this country, then when family farmers face collapsing \ncommodity prices, they have a right to expect that we will help them \nduring tough times.\n  There are so many other priorities to which we must pay some \nattention, such as the issue of agricultural research. I come from a \nState with a significant livestock industry. And we face the scourge of \nfoot and mouth disease--some call it hoof and mouth disease--and the \nprospect of mad cow disease, the prospect of a disease that could \ndevastate our livestock industry. This ought to persuade all of us to \naddress more quickly this issue of increases in basic research in \nagricultural areas and research in dealing with a safe food supply.\n  All of these areas require our attention.\n  Let me say again that if we are going to have a tax cut in this year, \nwe will, I hope, agree between Republicans and Democrats to a \nthoughtful and fair tax cut that says to the American people: Yes, this \nis your money. Yes, we want to give it back, and we want to do that in \na fair way.\n  But I think the American people want us to invest in the future of \nthis country as well, even as we provide tax cuts for the benefit of \nour children and pay down the Federal debt. If you run up a Federal \ndebt during tough times, it seems to me that during better economic \ntimes you ought to be able to pay it down. This country has not had a \nperiod that has been any better in general for the American economy \nthan the last 7 or 8 years. We ought not end this period with \nsubstantial increases in Federal indebtedness.\n  We have a lot of priorities. My hope is when we look back at the work \nof this Budget Committee and decisions by this Congress, we will have \nsaid: Yes, this Congress reflected the right priorities for this \ncountry; yes, we made the right investments; yes, we voted for a tax \ncut that was a fair tax cut; and, yes, we decided to commit ourselves \nnot just to talk about paying down the Federal debt but to really \npaying down the Federal debt even as we have experienced the surpluses \nthat come from better economic times.\n  I believe the hour of 12:30 has arisen. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not come to the floor to try to \nanswer all the various arguments made. I would just like to say to the \nAmerican taxpayers: It ought to be interesting to you, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica who are paying taxes, because, in fact, what is happening here \nis, instead of the opportunity to give the taxpayers back some of this \n$5.6 trillion surplus--a number we cannot hardly understand--instead of \nputting that right up at the top of the priority list, we are speaking \nabout priorities. But isn't it interesting, every single priority is to \nspend more of the taxpayers' money. All the priorities that are being \nstated here are spending a part of this surplus to spend on something \nfor Americans.\n  The whole difference is that we suggest you put the taxpayer at the \ntop of that list, not at the bottom of the list--at the top of the \nlist--and that instead of using their money for new programs and add-\nons, whatever it is, that we ought to consider them first. Included in \nthat is the President's tax plan which is good for the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, who not only do I \nrespect but for whom I have genuine affection, when he says this is \njust a question of spending versus tax cut, he knows better. Those are \nnot the choices. They really are not. The choices are tax cuts, \nspending, and addressing debt.\n  The real difference between our two plans--the biggest difference--is \nthey have twice as much for tax cuts and we have twice as much for debt \nreduction. That is the real difference. Yes, we also have some \nadditional spending for prescription drugs, education, agriculture, and \na prescription drug benefit because we think those are the priorities \nof the American people.\n  But let there be no doubt, the fundamental difference between us is \nwe are for more debt reduction; they are for more of a tax cut. That is \nwhere it lies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3308-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 172\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Baucus-\nGraham amendment. This amendment reserves $311 billion for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that will be reliable for seniors, affordable \nfor the taxpayers, and will be undeniable when it comes to being able \nto buy a prescription drug. It will put us on a road to a benefit that \nmeets patient needs, can be sustained by our U.S. Government, and yet \nis affordable with seniors.\n  Honor your father and mother is not only a good commandment by which \nto live, but it is a very good policy by which to govern. We believe we \nought to put it in the Federal law books. We should honor our fathers \nand our mothers by adopting the Baucus-Graham amendment to create a \nprescription drug benefit that does mean something for America's \nseniors.\n  Regrettably, the Bush plan is rather spartan and skimpy. It includes \nonly $153 billion for a prescription drug benefit. That seems to be a \nlot of money,\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nand it is, but when one estimates what it would take to provide a real \nprescription drug benefit, the cost is much more. That comes from \nreliable experts in the field.\n  First of all, I am concerned about how the President's plan would \nwork. It would provide block grants to States to develop programs, but \nthese programs would only be for the very low-income seniors, despite \nthe fact that half of the seniors who need help are in the middle-\nincome bracket.\n  What do I mean by low income? I mean $11,000 a year or less. If you \nare a senior and you have an income of $11,000 or less, you might be \neligible for President Bush's plan. However, as we have all gone \nthroughout our communities, what is one of the issues we hear the most? \nWe need a prescription drug benefit, say the seniors.\n  The ``sandwich'' generation is caught in the middle of providing \ntuition for their children's education and looking out for their moms \nand dads. They are saving for their own retirement, helping mom and dad \npay for their prescription drugs, and trying to afford the rising costs \nof college tuition for their children.\n  The middle class is, once again, caught in the vice. If you are in \nthe middle class, you cannot afford it. If you are very wealthy, you \ncan buy your own prescription drugs. Under the Bush plan, if you are \nvery poor, your Government will help you.\n  I want to be on the side of all senior citizens, and that is why we \nare for the Baucus-Graham approach.\n  Under the Bush plan, coverage will vary--where you live; what kind of \nplan your State set up. If my colleagues think we have had problems \nwith the Patients' Bill of Rights, wait until we get into the Bush plan \non prescription drugs. This means that a senior in Maryland might have \ngenerous coverage, but if that senior visits a sister in Virginia, just \nover the Potomac bridge, they might not have as good of a benefit.\n  We cannot have a prescription drug benefit for seniors based on the \nzip code of where they live. We are ``one nation under God, indivisible \n. . . .'' How about having one Medicare prescription drug program that \nis also indivisible. President Bush is choosing a lavish tax cut over \ncreating a real Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n\n  Let me give you a hypothetical constituent: A 75-year-old widow, on \nan income of $20,000 a year, has a stroke. Her prescription drugs will \ncost about $4,200 a year. That comes out to $350 a month. The \nDemocratic drug benefit would save her her about $150 a month or $1,700 \na year. Remember, under Graham-Baucus, the Democratic plan would save \nher $1,700. That is almost a $1,600 difference from what she would get \nin the Bush tax cut. That is what she could get in a Bush tax cut. \nRemember, at $20,000 a year, with a tax break based on income, she \nwould get $141 a year. I think if you would ask the American people \nwhat they want, they would want a prescription drug benefit that would \nhelp pay the bills as well as keep the money in the senior's \npocketbook.\n  Another example. An elderly couple with an income of $30,000 a year. \nTheir combined drug costs, say, are $6,000 a year. Their daughter is \nhelping pay drug bills, taking money from the kids' college fund. Under \nthe Democratic plan we could save them $2,000 a year. The Bush tax cut \nwould save them practically nothing.\n  These examples show that the Democrats have their priorities in \norder. First, we must make good on the promises we have made to our \nseniors. Second, we must make sure we balance the books not only today \nbut into tomorrow. The Democratic alternative is making a down payment \non that balloon payment that is coming due on Social Security and \nMedicare. The constituents who have written and called me to ask why \nthey or their parents cannot get the medicines they need do not want to \nhear about a lavish tax cut. They want to hear about Medicare, about a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit that will be reliable, affordable, \nand undeniable.\n  America is the nation that invented most of the miracle drugs. This \nwas done through the brilliance of American science and really public \ninvestments. They came through the Tax Code, the way we work with NIH. \nNo one should have to choose between lifesaving medication or putting \nfood on the table. No one should have to cut their pills in half to \nmake them last longer. No one should have to spend half of their \npension on drugs. That is why we need to pass Baucus-Graham, because we \nhave really a compelling need. Anywhere I go in Silver Spring, MD the \nsenior citizens would rather have a prescription drug benefit that will \nsave $1,700 a year and, more importantly, save a life than a $141-a-\nyear tax credit.\n\n  I hope we can get our priorities in order, our books balanced, help \nget some money into the pocketbooks of our citizens, but let's also \nmake sure we meet the compelling needs of our constituents.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that we go into a quorum call and \nthe time be charged equally.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question before we go into a \nquorum call.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend who is manager of this legislation, are \nwe arriving at a point shortly where we will be able to vote on this \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We certainly are on this side. We have used virtually all \ntime off the amendment, and we would be prepared to go to a vote very \nquickly. I put a call into two offices of Senators who are vitally \ninterested in the prescription drug amendment, and I have asked them to \ncome to the floor immediately. So we are awaiting their appearance, and \nthen we would prepare to go to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to ask another question. I think \nit would be good for the Senate, good for the country, if we voted on \nas many of these amendments as possible, so that the people of the \ncountry know how we stand on these issues. It is my understanding that \nthe Senator has a number of issues he wants to bring up in an effort to \namend this vehicle we have before us.\n  Would the Senator indicate, first of all, if he agrees we should have \na vote, and then will the Senator tell us some of the things he hopes \nwe can vote on in the next few days?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. I think it would be \nvery useful for us to use our time in a way that is disciplined so that \nwe have a debate and a discussion and that we are able to have votes on \na series of amendments after a reasonable debate. As the Senator knows, \nunder the rules, if we have not debated the amendments until the time \nruns out, we will still vote. We will do it without time for debate. So \nit is critically important that we be disciplined.\n  We believe we ought to have amendments on education, on strengthening \nnational defense, on additional paydown of debt, and, of course, we \nwill be having an important amendment on the question of whether or not \nreconciliation will be used in this process.\n\n  So those are just a few of the amendments that will be considered \nbefore we are done. It is very important that there be time for debate \nand discussion so that Members can be informed before they cast their \nvotes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, I \nthink the people in North Dakota believe the same way as the people in \nthe State of Nevada. They believe there should be a reasonable tax cut, \nbut the number-one priority of the people in Nevada is to do something \nabout the extraordinary debt that has piled up. Will the Senator from \nNorth Dakota agree that his constituents believe the same as mine?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think people in North Dakota have a great deal of \ncommon sense. They know that we have piled up an extraordinary Federal \ndebt. As we visit here today, we have a $5.6 trillion gross Federal \ndebt. Under the President's plan, that will increase to over $7 \ntrillion. So I think we have an obligation to the taxpayers of this \ncountry, to the fiscal future of our families, to do everything we can \nto put pressure on this debt, to keep it from continuing to grow. And \nthat is really the focus of the Democrat alternative.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for one more question, is the \nSenator going to have an amendment offered by someone on this side of \nthe aisle to have a discussion as to whether or not we should pay down \nthe debt more or that all the money should go to tax cuts?\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will have, in fact, a series of amendments on the \nquestion of what the priorities really are for the country. We believe \nwe should have a significant tax cut, but we do not believe we can \nafford one of the President's size without threatening to said us back \ninto deficit and without threatening to raid the trust funds of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. For that reason, we will be proposing a series \nof amendments to further pay down this national debt.\n  I notice that one of the Senators is here who has been very active on \nthe question of the prescription drug benefit and somebody who has \nreally been a leader on the Senate Budget Committee in trying to get a \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, one that would \nreally have the resources to provide a meaningful prescription drug \nbenefit. That would be the Senator from Oregon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. If there is one change \nthat the Democratic Party has tried to transmit over the last decade, \nit has been the question of emphasizing fiscal responsibility. I want \nto make it clear to the Senator from North Dakota how appreciative I am \nthat he has pounded away again and again in the committee and on this \nfloor how important it is to reduce the national debt.\n  In my view, that is the single most important message the Democrats \nhave tried to communicate over the last decade. I am so pleased he has \nemphasized it again today.\n  I will speak briefly on this question of prescription drugs because \nin the last year I have come to the floor of this Senate more than 25 \ntimes to talk about the need for a bipartisan initiative in this area. \nThe fact is, the Baucus amendment, the amendment on prescription drugs, \nwill allow Members to bring together legislators of both political \nparties to come up with a sensible prescription drug benefit that will \ncontain the spiraling costs that our seniors face.\n  It would be built around the proposition that there would be defined \nbenefits that senior citizens in every community would be entitled to. \nIt would be a benefit that would be part of the Medicare program. \nFinally, it would be a benefit that allows containment of costs by \noffering senior citizens choices and alternatives in the marketplace.\n  What pleases me about both the Baucus amendment and the alternative \nthat the ranking member, Senator Conrad, has put before this body, is \nthat it goes right to the heart of the question; that is, ensuring that \nwe have resources to do the job right. The fact is, America can't \nafford not to do this job right. I hear from physicians in my home \nState, for example, that they have actually put senior citizens in the \nhospital in order to get prescription drug coverage because those older \npeople could not afford their medicine on an outpatient basis.\n  Colleagues, think about the insanity of such a system that can rack \nup $40,000 or $50,000 worth of costs for medicines in a hospital rather \nthan spending perhaps $500 or $600 on an outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit so a senior citizen can, for example, have a leg ulcer treated \non an outpatient basis.\n  Under the Baucus amendment, it will be possible to have those \nresources, to bring together Democrats and Republicans in this body, \nand get the job done right. We all understand the extraordinary \nrevolution we have seen in the medicine field over the last few \ndecades. Everybody acknowledges if we were to design Medicare today, \nnot a Republican nor a Democrat would advocate leaving out a \nprescription drug benefit. It is going to take the resources to do the \njob right. It seems to me the Baucus-Graham amendment makes those \nresources available. By the way, it is an approach that would be \nconsistent with what we did in the Senate Budget Committee last year on \na bipartisan basis--Senator Snowe, Senator Smith, and I--and is \nconsistent with a variety of other approaches.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize what we are trying to focus on \ntoday is, first, the single most important message of Democrats in the \nlast decade, which is we have to have fiscal responsibility. That is \nwhy we emphasize today the question of paying down the debt. Second, we \ndo want this country to make a handful of well-targeted investments in \nour future. In my view, one of those key areas would be prescription \ndrug coverage. When it comes to paying for this benefit, this country \ncan't afford not to do prescription drug coverage right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask that the time be charged equally to the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will comment for a moment on the role of \nthe Senator from Oregon in the Senate Budget Committee. He has been \namong the most innovative Members in trying to find ways to extend a \nprescription drug benefit and to do it with bipartisan support. In the \nSenate Budget Committee last year, he worked with one of our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe. They \noffered the amendment that opened the door to a prescription drug \nbenefit last year. It is that model that again is being pursued this \nyear in an attempt to reach across the aisle to find bipartisan \nconsensus on a prescription drug benefit that would be meaningful for \nthe American people.\n  I wanted to take a moment while he was here to thank the Senator. He \nhas spent countless hours working to come up with prescription drug \nproposals that would have bipartisan support. I thank and commend him \npublicly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will yield briefly, I thank him for that.\n  What the Baucus amendment does is allow Members to put together that \nbipartisan effort that would encourage an approach that is within \nMedicare, with defined benefits, based on real marketplace choices, so \nthere would be cost containment. I thank Senator Conrad and Senator \nBaucus for emphasizing the two key messages of this party.\n  First, our message of the last decade, which is that fiscal \nresponsibility is paramount. One does that with the focus on debt \nreduction. Second, that we can have a handful of well-targeted \ninvestments in our country's future. That is what the Baucus amendment \ndoes. I am very pleased to be associated with both Senators' efforts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his contribution on \nthe committee.\n  To give the Senator from Montana a little backdrop, the Senator from \nMontana reserved 5 minutes off the amendment. That time is still \navailable. It is up to the Senator from Montana whether he wishes to \nuse that time or I am happy to give him time off the resolution. We \ndon't have a Member on the other side of the aisle present, but \nhopefully there are people watching and listening. We are prepared to \ngo to a vote on the prescription drug amendment. We hope the manager on \nthe other side of the aisle appears in short order and tells us what \nthe plan is on their side. We are prepared to go to a vote in very \nshort order.\n  I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't want to overdramatize this point, \nbut I think it is accurate. If this amendment doesn't pass, an \nextremely modest amendment--and I mean extremely--there is a very good \nchance, more than a 50-percent probability, that this Congress will not \npass a prescription drug benefit bill this year.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because the amount in the resolution is \nso small that seniors won't use it. Why do I say that? I say that \nroughly the $153 billion in the budget resolution under earlier \nestimates would require a deductible of about $2,000. How many seniors \nare going to want to participate in a prescription drug program with a \ndeductible of $2,000? This is voluntary. This is not a mandatory \nprogram under\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\nthis amendment. It is all voluntary. Contrast that with catastrophic, \nyears ago, which was mandatory; this is voluntary. Seniors will not use \nit. It is not worth it.\n  We will be making a false promise if we attempt to pass something \nsuch as that. We won't pass it because too many seniors will already \nhave exposed it for what it is.\n  Instead, we are suggesting, by our amendment, take a very small \nsliver out of the $1.6, $2.6 trillion tax bill, however you want to \ncategorize it. We know for sure it is a lot more than $1.6 trillion by \ndefinition. Frankly, $2.6 trillion is conservative. Take out a small \nsliver--$158 billion, that is all--and add it on to the $153 billion \nthat is contained in the budget resolution. That adds up to $311 \nbillion over 10 years for prescription drugs. That will be the \nbeginning for a modest drug prescription benefit provision for seniors \nwho now do not have prescription drug coverage because of where they \nlive in the country because they are poor or because no plan offers it.\n  Do not forget, health benefit plans today providing prescription drug \ncoverage to seniors are every year dropping more and more people from \ntheir plans. Medicare+Choice last year dropped 900,000 seniors. The \nyear before, 400,000. Why? Because costs are going up. So they are \ndropping people out, which forces them back to nothing or any Medicare \nwe may have.\n\n  I suggest taking a small sliver--it is small compared to the huge tax \ncut the President is proposing as contained in this budget resolution--\nand giving it to the literally millions of seniors who do not have any \nprescription drug coverage, with the cost of drugs rising as fast as \nthey are and utilization rising as fast as it is. Who is going to be \nhurt if we cut down one-sixth, two-sixths? It will probably come out of \nthe most wealthy, maybe a sliver out of the estate tax, maybe a sliver \nout of the top rate. Who knows?\n  Certainly, according to America's values, our country's priorities, \nwho we think we are as Americans, this only makes sense. There are \nseniors who are so wonderful--our mothers, our fathers, our \ngrandmothers, our grandfathers, many of whom gave so much to this \ncountry through the Depression. Why in the world can't we at least say \nto them, we will take a sliver out of this tax cut and give it to you, \na senior citizen who today has no prescription drug coverage? Because \nthat is what is right.\n  Let me just say this as a reminder. Senior citizens in America who \nare not now covered under a prescription drug benefit plan, some \ncompany or whatnot, pay the highest prescription drug costs in the \nindustrialized world. That is a fact. That is about 35 percent of \nAmerican seniors. Up to 50 percent are just inadequately covered or \nintermittently covered. But 35 percent of American seniors, at least, \npay more for prescription drug benefits today than do seniors in any \nother country in the industrialized world. Where is the United States \nof America? Where are we? Who do we think we are? We brag about \nourselves and our values. Let's step up to the plate. It is a very \nmodest amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  As the able Senator from Montana has indicated, we desperately need a \nprescription drug benefit. The question is, What form is it going to \ntake? Are we going to fund it fully enough so it really has any \nmeaning?\n  If we go with a prescription drug benefit of about $153 billion, the \nfact is we are going to end up with deductibles that could be anywhere \nbetween $2,000 and $15,000 for people who are sick.\n  You cannot do that. If you are going to do a prescription drug \nbenefit, you have do it properly, fund it adequately, so all people are \nable to take advantage of it.\n  That is done in the Baucus amendment because he, the Senator from \nMontana, puts it at $311 billion over a period of 10 years. It does the \njob. It means you are not going to have people paying so much out-of-\npocket expense that they simply cannot afford to go down and get \nprescription drugs at all.\n  I would say, in the panoply of things that are needed by Americans, a \nprescription drug benefit, the prospect thereof, the psychological \nbenefit thereof, the medical benefit thereof, is virtually at the top \nof the list.\n  We very recently passed something called a Coal Miners' Health \nBenefit Fund Program. It was approved by OMB, which never does that \nkind of thing, because they believe that a prescription drug benefit \nused on people of average age 80 years will in fact save money for \nMedicare, keep people out of hospitals, and keep people from having to \nuse other parts of Medicare, thus saving money overall for Medicare. We \nare never going to find out what we can do with prescription drugs, how \nmuch cost we can either save or not, until we do something and do it \nfully. The Baucus amendment does that, and I hope it is successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments on the \nprescription drug benefit. There is perhaps no senior member of the \nSenate Finance Committee who is more knowledgeable about health care \nissues than the Senator from West Virginia. The Senator from West \nVirginia has led the fight to expand health care coverage, including a \nprescription drug benefit, on the Senate Finance Committee. We very \nmuch appreciate his leadership.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum, and I ask we charge the time equally on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from North \nDakota to yield me some time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much.\n  I am very concerned. We talked very briefly a little while ago about \nthis. We keep talking about a tax cut. People in Nevada realize, if we \npay down this huge debt in any way, it will be a tax cut for everybody. \nIt will be a tax cut for everyone because we know if this burden is \ntaken away from the American people, they will pay less for their car \nand their boat--if they are fortunate enough to have one--certainly \ntheir house, and the debt they have on their credit cards every month.\n  Does the Senator agree, one of the biggest tax cuts we could give the \nAmerican people is to pay down the debt?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think, if we have learned nothing else from the 1980s, \nthe one thing we should have learned is that the best strategy is one \nthat puts our fiscal house in order and keeps it there. It is \neliminating deficits and beginning the process of paying down debt that \nhas helped us trigger the longest economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  When I look at the proposal on the other side, I see they talk about \npaying down the maximum amount of publicly held debt. But if you look \non page 5 of their proposal, the amendment that was offered here by the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the public debt, which is \ncurrently listed at $5.6 trillion, rises under that proposal to $6.7 \ntrillion. That is under the headline of public debt.\n  They have talked a lot about reducing the publicly held debt, but \nhere is the chart. Here is what has happened to the gross Federal debt \nfrom 1980 where, you can see, it was $909 billion. In 1999 it has gone \nup to $5.6 trillion. Under their proposal on page 5, they would take \nthis debt up to $6.7 trillion. That is the proposal they have before \nthis body.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I think I have the \nfloor. I would like to develop this colloquy a little bit.\n  What I heard the Senator say, as I have said on the floor before--I \nbelieve there is no one in Congress who knows numbers better than the \nSenator from North Dakota on the Budget Committee--is if we pass the \nbudget that is\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nnow before this body as it is written, the public debt will go up and \nnot down. Is he saying that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am saying what this document says. This is not my \ncalculation. This is their calculation. This is their document. This is \ntheir amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator repeat how much it goes up?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It goes from $5.6 trillion today--that is where this \nchart leaves off. And under their proposal the public debt goes up \nevery year until it reaches $6.7 trillion.\n  Mr. REID. My friend has talked a lot the last month about an idea \nthat I hope is going to be in the form of an amendment to this budget. \nAs I understand what the Senator from North Dakota has been advocating, \nif, in fact, we have a surplus--and thank goodness we do have a \nsurplus--one-third of that should be applied toward reducing the debt, \none-third should be used to give the American people a much deserved \ntax cut, and one-third should be left so that we can do something about \nthe huge class sizes--reduce class size, build some new schools, fund \nIDEA, the program for the physically and emotionally disadvantaged \nchildren.\n  Hasn't the Senator talked about the need to have one-third for tax \nreduction, one-third for deficit reduction, and one-third to make sure \nwe can fund some of the programs that even President Bush says we need? \nIs the Senator going to do that in the form of an amendment to this \npackage?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, we will. I think part of the confusion comes from \nthe language that we use. Our friends on the other side of the aisle \nare talking about reducing the publicly held debt. That is not the full \ndebt of our country. The gross Federal debt is the full debt.\n  They talk about having the maximum amount of reduction in the \npublicly held debt. At the very time they are doing that, we are seeing \nthe gross Federal debt of the country continuing to climb.\n  Their budget does not do anything about this long-term debt \nexpansion.\n  That is the difference between us. We not only are dedicating more of \nthe projected surplus to paying down the publicly held debt, which is \nreally the short-term debt--that is the debt that is outstanding in the \npublic--but we are also offering for the first time that anybody has \nhad a budget proposal before this Congress to do something about this \ngross debt, this long-term debt, this debt that is building in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It is a liability out there that is growing \ngeometrically.\n  This has already happened to the gross debt of the United States. It \nhas skyrocketed and it will continue to grow under the proposal that \nour friends on the other side of the aisle have made. Their own budget \ndocument says they are going to take the gross debt of the United \nStates, which is $5.6 trillion today, and increase it to $6.7 trillion \nall the while they talk about a massive tax cut. It really makes you \nwonder if there is not confusion about language here.\n  Mr. REID. When we talk about saving one-third of the surplus for \nprograms, one of those programs is something that President Bush talked \nabout wanting. And that is now the subject matter of the first \namendment before this body; is it not? That is a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare.\n  My first elective job was as a member of a hospital board--at that \ntime the largest hospital in Nevada, Southern Nevada Hospital. It was \nin 1965 that Medicare came into being. Medicare is a wonderful program. \nIt has been proven to be a great program even since then--imperfect but \nit is a good program. But in 1965, when Medicare came into being, there \nwas no need for prescription drug benefits because there were not a lot \nof prescriptions that met the needs of the senior population at that \ntime. It has only been in the last 35 years that prescription drugs \nhave come out that now keep people alive. They can make people more \ncomfortable, and they heal people.\n  How can we as the only superpower left in the world have a program \nfor senior citizens to take care of their medical problems and we don't \nhave prescription drug benefits? It is my understanding that in the \nSenator's amendment, one-third is going to be reserved for programs. \nPart of that money will be used for a prescription drug benefits for \nseniors. Is that not right? And in the program that the Republicans \nhave offered, there is no money in their prescription drug benefit.\n  Is that fair?\n  Mr. CONRAD. As we have said, this program provides half as much for \nprescription drugs. The budget proposal that they have made provides \n$153 billion. But everybody acknowledges that is not sufficient and \nthat there is simply not enough money there to provide a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit.\n  They are engaged in a little bit of what I would call fiscal sleight \nof hand.\n  If you look at our proposal, we take this projected surplus, and we \nare quick to acknowledge that this is a 10-year projection. It is \nhighly unlikely to ever come true.\n  We believe the prudent thing to do is to be cautious in light of the \nbasis of all we are doing being a 10-year forecast. We save all of the \nmoney for the Social Security trust fund, all of the money for the \nMedicare trust fund, and with what is left we talk about one-third for \na tax cut, one-third for these high-priority domestic needs, including \nprescription drugs and infrastructure and education.\n  Anyone who has flown or driven on a highway knows that we need \nadditional funds for infrastructure in America. And education is the \nhighest priority of the American people for additional resources.\n  We also believe we need to strengthen our national defense and then \nprovide additional resources especially for health care and disasters. \nBecause we know we are going to have a certain number of disasters \nevery year, we believe we ought to provide funding for it.\n  Finally, the last one-third would be for long-term debt and to \nstrengthen Social Security and provide a strategic reserve in case \nthese forecasts are wrong; then, of course, the interest costs \nassociated with all three of those.\n  We believe we have a cautious, conservative program--one that \ndedicates the vast majority of the money for debt reduction.\n  Here is why: The Social Security trust fund money is not needed for \nSocial Security at the moment. That goes to pay down the publicly held \ndebt. The President uses $2 trillion of that money for the same \npurpose--to pay down the publicly held debt.\n\n  We also reserve all the Medicare trust fund money. That will go for \npaying down the publicly held debt. We have $2.9 trillion reserved for \ndebt paydown.\n  In addition to that, we have another $750 billion for our long-term \ndebt. This is where our friends on the other side don't have a nickel \nfor this purpose. They don't have any money to deal with the long-term \ndebt.\n  In our proposal, of the $36.5 trillion forecasted surplus, we are \nreserving $3.65 trillion for the paydown of short-term and long-term \ndebt. That is in comparison to the President's plan that only has $2 \ntrillion. We have nearly twice as much to pay down long-term debt and \nshort-term debt.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield 5 more minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If you do not mind, we should ask the Senator from \nMinnesota who is next on our list.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just ask one more question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator indicate why he put his $2.7 trillion \nacross from non-Social Security and non-Medicare? Why is that in red?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is in red because we believe it would be profoundly \nwrong to use any of the Social Security trust fund money or any of the \nMedicare trust fund money for other purposes. That has been done in the \npast. We have just stopped doing it in the last 3 years. We believe we \nshouldn't go back to the bad old days of raiding the trust funds and \nusing the money for other purposes. We have reserved all of the Social \nSecurity money and all of the Medicare trust fund money for the \npurposes intended.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his questions. I ask the Senator \nfrom Minnesota how much time he would like.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I am actually speaking on the \namendment. I can do this in under 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the Senator from Minnesota 5 minutes off the \nresolution itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, later on I will have a chance to come \nout here, with my colleague, Senator Harkin, with an amendment that \ndeals with funding for education and children. That is the heart and \nsoul to me. I guess if there is any one issue that I am more \nemotionally connected to than any other, it would be anything and \neverything that deals with children and education.\n  But I have listened carefully to this debate. I want to say this: We \nhave all the numbers. The Republicans have $153 billion. I think we \nhave $311 billion or thereabouts. I want to get away from the numbers \nand just simply say this about this debate. For a good period of time \nthat I have been a Senator, we were running deficits. The goal was \ndeficit reduction. Then I had hoped that when the economy began to do \nbetter, and we began to see surpluses--I hope we will continue to do \nso; who knows what will happen over the next few years--but I had this \nhope that now, with an economy that was doing better, and with some \nsurpluses, that finally--finally--as a Senator from Minnesota, I would \nbe able to do really well for people. It would not just be stopping the \nworst, it would be doing the better.\n  I mentioned children and education, but I want to mention elderly \npeople and prescription drug coverage. I can tell you, in the State of \nMinnesota, 65 percent of the elderly people, senior citizens, have no \nprescription drug coverage whatsoever. They have no coverage at all. I \ncan also tell you all of the stories about people who cut the pills in \nhalf--and you have heard them all--or the stories about people during \nthe cold winter where it is either they are going to be able to afford \na prescription drug or have heat because if they get their prescription \ndrug, they can't afford their heating bill and they go cold.\n  I want to do this a different way. I want to say to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, I had two parents with Parkinson's \ndisease--two parents. That is rare. Both of them took the drug \nselegiline. It is not an inexpensive proposition. When I think about my \nown parents, and my mother Mencha Daneshevsky, who was a cafeteria \nworker, she didn't make much money. My parents did not make much money. \nI think they made something over $20,000 a year. I don't know what \ntheir income was; they didn't really tell me. But believe me, it was a \nmoderate income.\n  What we have out here is a choice. Either you are in favor of Robin-\nHood-in-reverse tax cuts, with maybe 40-plus percent of the benefits \ngoing to the top 1 percent, or you are in favor of making an investment \nabove and beyond reducing the debt and protecting Social Security and \nMedicare that everybody is talking about on our side of the aisle--and \nI say good--and you are also for making some investments in people, you \nare for making sure that senior citizens--our parents and our \ngrandparents, who built this country on their backs--are able to afford \nprescription drugs.\n  The benefit offered by the other side would not have helped my \nparents much, and it does not help most of the people in Minnesota who \nare senior citizens. I do not know why we can't do this.\n  Any day of the year, I am comfortable saying to people in Minnesota I \ndid not go for the $2.5 trillion in tax cuts. I wanted to go for some \ntax cuts. I wanted to go for tax cuts that would be a stimulus. I \nwanted to go for tax cuts that would in the main help working families, \nbut I did not go for the $2.5 trillion. Too much of it was Robin Hood \nin reverse.\n  Most important of all, I did not go for it because I felt if we had a \nsurplus, we could live up to our commitment to making sure that we \ncould afford prescription drugs. I don't know why we can't do that. I \ndon't know why we can't get real. And I don't know why we can't spend \nthe amount of money that we need to spend to make sure that people in \nour States--elderly people, senior citizens--can afford prescription \ndrugs. I just don't understand that.\n  So we will have a vote. I think the vote is on a basic value \nquestion. It is a matter of priorities. I want to come out on the floor \nand indicate my strong support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate his \ncontribution to the debate.\n  Let me just say to colleagues, very soon we will be going off this \namendment. The other side has announced their intention to provide an \namendment in the second degree to our amendment. I wish they would not \ndo that. I wish they would permit a straight consideration of our \namendment by the body. But they have announced their intention to amend \nour proposal in the second degree, and then we will have a debate on \nthe amendment that they offer. That is being drafted.\n  So if there are colleagues who are listening, if they would like to \ncome to the floor to give their opening remarks on the budget \nresolution, this would be a good time to do that. We have called a \nnumber of offices for those who are in line in terms of the informal \nqueue we have here to speak on the resolution. But if you would notify \nyour Members, those who are in the queue, to come, this would be a good \ntime to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Please state the parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the status in terms of time on the amendment \nfrom the other side, the Democrat amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes remaining on the Baucus \namendment for the Senator from New Mexico and 7 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. I say to \nmy good friend, the ranking member, and Senator Reid, we clearly do not \nintend to take a long time before we are ready to vote on this \namendment except we will offer a second-degree amendment. It is just \nbeing written up. And it is moving a lot of numbers around, which is \nnot easy, as you all know. But that is being done as expeditiously as \npossible.\n  Let me suggest that in the basic budget that we bring to the floor, \nwe have a number in it that is proposed to be used for prescription \ndrugs, along with reform of Medicare; that number is $156 billion.\n  I understand what the Democrats would like to do now, and everyone \nshould just understand it is probably the beginning of a few more like \nthis. They would take $156 billion of what our President proposes that \nwe consider the tax cut for the average American--and the marriage tax \npenalty, and a solid death reform measure, and, indeed, making sure \nthat the American families with children get a doubling up of their \nchild credit--that all of that might fit in this $1.6 trillion, but we \ndo not know what parts of it. But we are saying, let's give it a \nchance.\n  This amendment says, let's take $156 billion of that, and let's take \nit out of the tax relief measure and put it into a fund for Medicare \nprescription drugs or into the Medicare Part A trust fund. We do not \nthink that is necessary. We do not think you have to take anything out \nof the tax cut that is planned in order to make sure we have sufficient \nrevenues, sufficient resources to take care of prescription drugs. We \ncan do that.\n  As a matter of fact, we will propose an amendment that will be a \nsecond-degree amendment to that one. We will propose one that will, \nindeed, take care of and make sure that our senior citizens know that \nthere is going to be ample money for them and their prescription drug \nprogram. In fact, it could be perhaps as big as the one being \nrecommended. It is just that none of us knows. None of us knows \nprecisely what that program is going to cost because it involves \nreforming Medicare, and a prescription drug program. If you listen to \nthe voices, they are all over myriad programs in terms of what \nprescription drugs might look like.\n  So essentially, in due course, we will say, here is our proposal. And \njust so everyone understands, we will not use any of the President's \ntax relief program that is for average Americans, for\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nmarried couples, for those others who might be considered as part of \nthe tax relief effort.\n  Again I remind everyone that Senators can come to the floor from \neither side and tell us what, indeed, this tax plan is going to look \nlike because they choose to pick a part of the President's proposal--\nunderstand it is a proposal--or they choose a part of what somebody \nelse is going to propose that is going to be part of this tax plan and \ntalk as if we are doing that in this budget resolution.\n  I am sure that before we are finished, a few people listening who did \nnot want to learn about budget resolutions will learn a little bit \nbecause we have to talk a little bit of budget language but not very \nmuch.\n  Essentially, no one knows what the tax bill is going to look like. In \nfact, I am sure the Presiding Officer in his home state of Missouri has \ntalked to his people as to what he thinks it is going to look like. I \nam quite sure he did not say that it is exactly, in every respect, what \nthe President has proposed because we do not know that.\n  What we know is that $1.6 trillion out of a $5.6 trillion estimated \nsurplus can be used for tax reduction for the American people. That is \nwhat we know--$1.6 trillion, not $1.6 trillion minus a whole bunch of \nthings, such as the $156 billion we would take out of that tax reform \nproposal. We take it out and make it $156 billion less.\n  When that Medicare prescription drug plan comes up--and we will talk \nabout our amendment--we will talk about what it ought to be, and it \nwill be related to something very practical on which everybody can \ncount. Then it will say that we do not need to take it out of the tax \nrelief package if, indeed, it costs the maximum amount we are going to \nallow, which I do not believe it will. We would not be taking that \nmoney from the taxpayers. They would be getting their full tax cut. We \nwould take it out of the contingency fund in this budget.\n  As I understand it, when I started, there were 20 minutes remaining \non the amendment--10 minutes on the Democratic side on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That does not mean if someone wants to talk with the \ntime coming off the budget resolution they cannot.\n  I want to finish our discussion on the amendment and offer our \nsecond-degree amendment and have a vote on it. It would be a very good \nthing for us to explain to the American people how we are going to take \ncare of Medicare without reducing the tax cut Americans can look \nforward to in various forms. The committee that writes tax laws will \nwrite that particular bill.\n  If my friend is willing to move ahead so we can offer the amendment, \nI am willing to yield back----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from New Mexico, \nthere are 7 minutes under the control of the Senator from Montana and \n23 minutes under the control of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time. I am finished for \nnow, if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope our Republican friends are not \ngoing to propose that we have a magic asterisk for a prescription drug \nbenefit. I hope they are not going to come in with a second-degree \namendment that says: We are just going to have this money come out of \nthin air somewhere, and we are going to provide an unspecified amount \nof money for a prescription drug benefit and not identify precisely \nfrom where that money is coming.\n  On our side, we have reserved the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds in total for the purposes intended. We have not permitted a raid \non those funds for any other purpose.\n  With what is left, we provided a third for a tax cut, a third for \nthese high-priority domestic needs, including a prescription drug \nbenefit fully funded, fully identified, and the final third to deal \nwith long-term debt, strengthening Social Security so that when the \nbaby boomers retire, that promise can be kept.\n  What I am hearing is that the Republicans may propose to open up the \nMedicare trust fund to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nThat, to me, would be classic double counting. That trust fund for \nMedicare is needed to keep the promises that have already been made. If \nthey are now going to make a new set of promises and fund it out of \nthat same trust fund, that is the kind of double counting that will get \nthis country into financial trouble. That is exactly what happened in \nthe 1980s that plunged this country into dramatic deficits and a vastly \nexpanded debt.\n  Let's put up the chart about what happened back in the eighties. I \nhope we do not forget the lesson we learned then. Let's go back to 1980 \nwhen we had the proposal for massive tax cuts combined with a big \nbuildup in national defense. We can see what it did to the debt and \ndeficits of the United States. The debt skyrocketed in the decade of \nthe eighties.\n  If now we are going to hear this same old siren song--massive tax \ncut--and then we are going to also have big new spending priorities \nthat are supposed to come out of trust funds that are already \ncommitted, that is exactly the kind of fiscal folly that did such \ndamage back then. The difference is we had time to recover in the \n1980s. There is no time to recover in this decade because, at the end \nof this decade, the baby boomers start to retire, and then we will see \nthe full results of fiscal missteps, of fiscal mistakes. If we have \noversubscribed this projected surplus, we will pay a terrible price as \na nation.\n  I hope very much we do not go back to the bad old days of debt, \ndeficits, and decline. That is not the way to proceed. Instead, we \nought to be cautious; we ought to be prudent; we ought to reserve the \ntrust funds for the purposes intended and not use them for any other \npurposes.\n  Mr. President, if I can inquire as to the time remaining on the \nbudget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 21 hours 53 minutes; \nthe Democratic side has 20 hours 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much was there on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one hours 53 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Plenty of time. I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask it be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time I speak \nbe charged to the Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments in \nregard to Medicare, Medicaid, and prescription drugs, and to speak in \nopposition to the amendment pending before the Senate now, offered by \nmy friend and colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus. This amendment \npurports to say we will do something positive on prescription drugs. It \nactually takes drugs away from low-income people next year, in the year \n2002 and the year 2003.\n  The underlying budget that Senator Domenici proposed in the \nPresident's budget put in significant dollars, $11.2 billion in 2002, \n$12.9 billion in 2003, and $14.8 billion in 2004, for low-income \npeople, to get immediate assistance to help them buy expensive drugs. \nIt employs medicaid to help those who can't help themselves; let's get \nthat money to them, through the States, and make it effective now.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment before the Senate strikes that language. \nIt eliminates the $40-some-odd billion of the President's Helping Hand \nProgram and increases Medicare, raising taxes and spending, without \nMedicare reform.\n  I happen to be on the Finance Committee. I am in favor of Medicare \nreform. I want to improve Medicare and to provide prescription drug \nbenefits. I think we can do that. To say we don't want to do anything \nfor low-income people in the first 3 or 4 years, and to create a new \nentitlement for Medicare without reforming and saving Medicare\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nsimultaneously, in my opinion, is a serious mistake.\n  This amendment, while very well intended, would do damage to the \nsystem. It would not get prescription drugs to the people who \ndesperately need help, and need help now.\n  Everyone in this body knows that Medicare is a ticking time bomb. We \nneed to save it. We need to expand benefits--including prescription \ndrugs--but it cannot all be done simultaneously. We can do it the right \nway, this Congress and in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Elimination of the Helping Hand Program, where we give assistance to \nthose who need it the most, would be devastating. I urge my colleagues \nto work together, see if we can't do both, see if we can't get \nassistance to the States to help those who really need it, immediately, \nso we can have some assistance in the year 2002.\n  For an example, under the President's proposal there is $11.2 billion \nin the year 2002 for drug assistance for low-income people; under the \nBaucus amendment, there is only a $100 million expenditure for \nprescription drugs.\n  Certainly the Domenici proposal, the President's proposal, does a lot \nmore in the year 2002.\n  I compliment my colleague from New Mexico. I urge our colleagues not \nto support the underlying Baucus amendment and see if we cannot come up \nwith something to provide a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, as \nwell as reforming Medicare. I disagree with those who say we shouldn't \nuse Medicare trust funds to do that, to help pay for prescription \ndrugs.\n  Medicare is financed by a payroll tax, on all wages, at 1.45 percent. \nThat is matched by the employer, with another 1.45 percent. If my math \nis correct, that is 2.9 percent on all payroll. There was an enormous \ntax increase for Medicare that was enacted as a result of President \nClinton's tax increase in 1993. This was when they increased the base \nfor Medicare taxation away from the Social Security base, which right \nnow I believe is $80,000. The Democrats put a tax on all wages, even if \nwages equal $1 million or $2 million or $10 million. A tax of 2.9 \npercent on all wages to help pay for Medicare.\n\n  The reason there is a surplus in Medicare funds is because of an \nenormous tax increase. Basically, it is a payroll tax. It is not a \nMedicare tax as we know it. It is a payroll tax increase passed by the \nClinton administration in 1993.\n  This is a new tax for anybody who makes over the Social Security base \namount, which used to be 70-some-thousand dollars and is now climbing \nup. Why not let those people help pay for Medicare prescription drugs? \nI heard the argument, we can't use Medicare tax to pay for Medicare \nbenefit. I disagree with that. I don't think that makes sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to use common sense, to use Medicare funds to \npay for Medicare benefits. That includes prescription drugs. Do it in \ncontext with overall Medicare reform. Increasing benefits, without \nfixing the system, when we know demographically we have some challenges \nahead--is only doing a small part of the job. Unless we take every step \nnecessary to reform and provide benefits we are making a mistake.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What happens, if you take a prescription drug benefit out \nof the Medicare trust fund, to the solvency of the Medicare trust fund?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think my colleague raises an \ninteresting point. What my colleagues have tried to do on the Democrat \nside is to institute a new Medicare benefit without financing it by \nMedicare. In other words, use general revenues to finance anything.\n  I think if it is Medicare, it ought to be financed under the Medicare \nsystem. Maybe that is old fashioned. But if we are going to give it the \nMedicare designation, that is what it should be. A lot of people want \nto move a lot of different funds and have general revenues subsidize \nMedicare, but Medicare taxation is growing, and growing substantially.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. Maximum taxation right now for a \nperson who makes $76,000, paying Social Security and paying Medicare: \nSocial Security tax equals $9,000; Medicare tax equals over $2,000. I \nremind my colleagues they have to pay for those taxes with aftertax \ndollars. They already have to pay income tax on those dollars to pay \nSocial Security and Medicare tax. I am not sure everybody is aware of \nthat. I think it is grossly unfair. Maybe one of these days we will be \nable to fix that. Right now, we haven't fixed it.\n  So people can understand this dilemma, a person who makes $80,000 has \nto pay $9,000 Social Security tax, $2,000 in Medicare tax, and they \nhave to do it with aftertax dollars. So to pay that $11,000, in reality \nthey have to make about $14,000 or $15,000. That is the present system.\n  Now our colleagues are saying: That is not enough; we want to have a \nwhole lot of general taxation--in other words money coming out of your \nincome tax to also pump into the system because we are increasing \nbenefits faster than you can pay for them. That is the argument that is \nbeing made on the other side. I disagree with that.\n  I think to just say let's increase new benefits and to have it \noutside of any Medicare reform is grossly irresponsible. I tell my \nfriend and colleague, I do not think that makes sense.\n  I have a couple of other comments on the exploding cost of Medicare. \nYou can almost take whatever estimate is out there and multiply it by \ntwo or three and it is still not going to be enough. Many people are \nproposing prescription drug benefit. If you have a prescription drug \nbenefit that some people are advocating and you do not have proper cost \ncontrols and so on, this cost can explode.\n  Last year in the budget resolution we had a couple of Medicare \nprovisions. We said, let's have $20 billion we can put in immediately \nand another $20 billion contingent on Medicare reform, for a total of \n$40 billion over 5 years.\n  Then, if I remember, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, came up \nwith an amendment on the floor that said that is not enough. Let's come \nup with another proposal, let's do it to the tune, if I remember, of \n$248 billion. That was his proposal. We voted on that proposal. We \ndefeated that proposal. That proposal had enormous cost impacts and an \nenormous cost share of up to $80 copays, a huge expense. Yet it still \nwas not enough for the Democrats.\n  Now we have a proposal that is not 100 and not 40 over 5, not 138--\nthat is the President's proposal--over 10. Somehow that is still not \nenough, even though it is a lot more than we passed last year. The \nDemocrats want to double the President's figure.\n  They have not calculated a program and they do not have an estimate \nof what the copays are going to be. They don't have anything. They say \nwhatever you have, we are going to double it and you cannot use \nMedicare funds to pay for it. That simply does not make sense.\n  If somebody makes $1 million, 2.9 percent of that is $29,000. There \nare a fair number of people who make that amount. There is a lot going \ninto Medicare, and we are not going to let them use some of that money \nfor prescription drugs? That is the argument being made on the other \nside. It just does not make sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to go about dealing with prescription drug \nbenefits in a fiscally responsible way, not just to try to score \npoints. It is not responsible to double the figure just because there \nis political capital in doing so. Let's work together to come up with \nsomething that is financially responsible, that is solvent, that will \nnot be putting our kids at a disadvantage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was very interested to hear the lack of \nresponse to the question that the Senator from North Dakota posed to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. The Senator from Oklahoma answered every \nquestion except the one that was posed to him. The simple question that \nwas asked was what happens to the solvency of the Medicare trust fund \nif you use money out of that trust fund to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit?\n  The correct answer to that question is, you reduce the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund. You make the trust fund go broke even sooner. \nThat is what this chart shows.\n  If you raid the Medicare trust fund to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit, you\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nmake Medicare go broke sooner. That is why we on our side have taken \nthe fiscally responsible course. The fiscally responsible course is to \npay for a prescription drug benefit but not to touch one dime of the \nSocial Security trust fund or the Medicare trust fund because that only \nendangers the solvency of those trust funds.\n  So we have proposed a fiscally responsible plan, one that protects \nevery penny of the Social Security trust fund, every penny of the \nMedicare trust fund, and then, with what remains, provides a tax cut \nwith one-third of the money; with one-third of the money provides for \nthe high-priority domestic needs including a specific program for \nprescription drugs. No, no, this is not just a matter of putting up a \nnumber. This is based on policy. This is based on a plan that is a \nprescription drug plan that is universal. Everybody who is eligible for \nMedicare can sign up. It is voluntary. If you do not want to belong, \nyou do not have to belong. It provides enough support so people would \nactually be in the program, so you are not just getting the sickest \npeople in and have a program that will not stand scrutiny over time. \nThen, with the final third, to fund this long-term debt that is growing \nbecause of our Social Security liability.\n  That is a fiscally responsible plan. We do not rob Peter to pay Paul. \nWe do not raid the Medicare trust fund to provide a new set of benefits \nwhen you need the money in that trust fund to keep the promises already \nmade.\n  The correct answer to the question I posed to the Senator from \nOklahoma is, if you take money out of the Medicare trust fund to fund a \nprescription drug benefit, you hasten the insolvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund. It goes broke sooner. We should not do that. That is a \nmistake.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The Senator from Montana wants time off the resolution?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Five minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Montana for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I listened closely to my good friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma, and his basic arguments against the pending amendment. As I \nheard him, he had a basic argument that the pending amendment would not \nprovide benefits fast enough. I take it that he would rather follow the \nprovisions contained in the budget resolution, which he believes will \nget benefits to seniors more quickly.\n  I do not know if my good friend knows, whenever we have tried that in \nthe past--that is, block grant programs like CHIP--it takes States a \ncouple of years at least to implement the program. It is never \nsomething that comes up and is implemented right away.\n  Second, a lot of States do not want the provision that is \ncontemplated in the budget resolution. Why don't they want it? Because \nthey cannot afford it. They do not have the matching funds.\n  Furthermore, some State legislatures like Montana's meet every other \nyear. Consequently, it would take a couple of years for those States to \nenact the measure that is contemplated by the ideas of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I might also add, for those States that already do have a plan in \nplace, they will just use the Federal money to substitute for the State \nmoney. It is a zero sum game. We are not adding anything. The evidence \nand testimony before our committee are clearly along those lines.\n  I might also say that if the majority is thinking of getting a \nprescription drug benefit out of the contingency fund we hear so much \nabout, they should just work out the numbers. I know these are the \nnumbers the Senator from Oklahoma is working off of. They show that in \nthe years 2005 to 2006, the contingency fund for those years will be in \ndeficit by about $5 or $6 billion. That means that if there is any kind \nof meaningful prescription drug benefit program, it has to come out of \nthe hospital insurance trust fund. There are only two places it can \ncome from.\n  We need to provide help for our States--particularly rural States--\nand rural hospitals. It is difficult for them to makes ends meet under \nMedicare. It is important for all of us to remember that more than half \nof the income for some rural hospitals is from Medicare receipts. \nRaiding the hospital trust fund would hurt those rural hospitals, and \nthat's not something we want to do.\n  I also want to lay to rest a misconception that might exist. The \namendment I am offering contemplates Medicare reform. It does not \npreclude Medicare reform. In fact, the chairman of the committee and I, \nmy staff and the staff of the chairman of the committee, have been \ntalking about different Medicare reform options to go with a \nprescription drug benefit. It is true that there are all kinds of \ndifferent Medicare reform provisions. Obviously, the most extreme are \nnot going to be passed this year.\n  My amendment basically says, OK, there is probably not going to be \nenough money in the contingency fund.\n  And if our only other option is the hospital insurance trust fund, we \ncertainly don't want to do that. I suggest taking a very small sliver \nout of the President's tax cut proposal--about $158 billion--to fund a \nprescription drug benefit for our seniors. That $158 billion would \nsupplement the $153 billion that is already contained in the budget \nresolution, providing $311 billion total for a prescription drug \nbenefit that is going to work and that is paid for.\n  I believe that when you do something, you should do it now, and do it \nright the first time. ``Right the first time'' for me is enough to come \nout to get the program started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time will the Senator from North \nCarolina need? I will provide 10 minutes off the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We are at a unique time in our country's history. We have an \nopportunity to do things that we haven't had the chance to do before. \nBut in order to take advantage of this unique moment in our country's \nhistory, we must make the right decisions and make the right choices. I \nthink we have to begin by being straight with the American people.\n  First, we need to be honest about the fact that none of us know what \nis going to happen 5, 6, or 7 years from now. For us to suggest \notherwise is nonsense. The American people do not know what is going to \nhappen, and we don't know what is going to happen. Any reputable \neconomist in the country will say that there is no way to predict what \nis going to be happening 5 or 6 years from now in our economy.\n  Second, in being straight with the American people, we need to stop \nsuggesting that we can have it all. There is a suggestion being made by \nsome people in Washington that, in fact, we can have it all. We can \nhave a huge tax cut. We can do everything we need to do for our public \nschool system. We can give you prescription drugs. We can do everything \nwe need to do to help our military men and women. We can have \neverything. Well, that is not the truth. That is not being straight \nwith the American people. And I think the American people know this.\n  There are two basic principles around which I hope this debate will \nrevolve. First, we don't know what is going to occur 5 or 6 years from \nnow; second, no American family can have everything and we as a nation \ncan't have everything.\n\n  First, on the issue of what is going to happen 5 or 6 years from now, \nwhat we know from experience is that when budget surplus projections \nwere made--actually, they were talking about the deficit at the time in \nthe Reagan administration--the projections were off by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. When George Herbert Walker Bush was President of \nthe United States, exactly the same thing occurred. The projections \nwere off by hundreds of billions of dollars. The same occurred in the \nClinton administration. Common sense would tell us that the current \nprojections are just as speculative. The Secretary of the Treasury and \nChairman Greenspan have all suggested exactly the same thing.\n  So what we know with certainty is that we cannot predict where we \nwill be 5 or 6 years from today.\n  The President's tax cut is loaded to the last 5 years of their 10-\nyear period. The bulk of the costs and the bulk of the benefits fall in \nthat last 5 years. It\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\nis also during that last 5 years that most of the projected surplus \nfalls.\n  We have two things occurring simultaneously. The bulk of the costs of \nthe tax cut and the benefits occur at exactly the same time that the \nbulk of the surplus projection occurs, and also at the same time that \nthose surplus projections are riskiest, when they are least reliable.\n  Does it make common sense for us to have a huge tax cut, the bulk of \nwhich coincides with the time when the surplus projections are at \ngreatest risk for being wrong? We know these projections are going to \nbe wrong. That is the one thing we don't have any doubt about. We just \ndo not know how wrong. And we need to be straight with the American \npeople about that.\n  So knowing these projections are going to be wrong, what is the \nsensible thing to do? The sensible thing to do is to have a more \nmoderate tax cut that protects Social Security, that protects Medicare, \nand make sure the tax cut is fair to all the American people.\n  If 5 or 6 years from now--and we can't predict right now what is \ngoing to occur--the surpluses actually exist, and we have enacted a \nmoderate tax cut, we have done everything we can to pay down the debt, \nand if we have protected Social Security and Medicare, we can do \nsomething else. We can do another tax cut.\n  In the alternative, or even in addition, we can also do something \nabout what we know is coming in the next decade--the retirement of the \nbaby boomers. No one is talking about that, but this is going to put a \ntremendous strain on the Social Security system. But we know it is \ncoming.\n  One suggestion which has been made by the Concord Coalition is that \nwe have mandatory IRAs; that we use some part of the surplus at that \npoint to provide mandatory IRAs to the people around the country, which \nhelps deal with the demographic shift that we know is coming in the \nnext decade. This is something we can talk more about, but we need to \nstart focusing on this before it is too late.\n  What I am suggesting is the common sense thing to do, knowing the \nunreliability of the surplus projections, knowing that we need to pay \ndown our debt, knowing that we need to protect Social Security and \nMedicare, is to have a more moderate tax cut now and to pay down the \ndebt to the extent we are able to pay it down.\n  No one in this body wants to saddle our kids with these huge interest \npayments that are being made now on our national debt. And we don't \nwant to pass the debt itself on to our kids either. The best thing we \ncan do for them is make sure we pay down this debt.\n  In addition to that, we don't want to make our kids take care of us \nbecause Social Security is insolvent. They shouldn't have to take care \nof us because we failed to protect Social Security.\n  We have an extraordinary opportunity to address these problems right \nnow. The key is that we not squander it.\n  Second, I want to emphasize that we must be straight with the \nAmerican people and not suggest to them that they can have everything. \nIt is just not the truth.\n  We can have a tax cut, and we should have a tax cut. But we can't \nhave a tax cut of the size the President is proposing and do all the \nother things that are being talked about--education, for example.\n  Having been to schools all over my State in North Carolina, I know \nhow desperately we need to make a real effort to improve our education \nsystem in this country.\n  We have actually done some great things in North Carolina. Some of \nwhat the President is proposing is patterned after North Carolina--\ntough accountability, measurement, identification of the schools that \nare not performing, that are low performing, and making an intense \neffort to turn those schools around.\n  This is what we did in North Carolina when we went through that \nprocess and identified the schools that were low performing, in \naddition to having tough accountability, we sent real experts in to \nturn the schools around. In those schools that are in poor school \ndistricts that did not have the resources, we helped them; we gave them \nthe resources they needed to turn the schools around.\n  We know that needs to be done. Unfortunately, under this budget \nresolution, that is probably impossible. We cannot expect to have \neffective education reform if we don't commit ourselves to do what is \nneeded. We have to have a balanced, thoughtful approach to this issue.\n  Secondly, I want to mention our military men and women. We have \nmilitary bases that are very important to us in North Carolina. I have \nbeen there. I have talked to our military men and women. These are \npeople who are devoting their lives to protect us, to defend us. They \nhave, in many cases, inadequate housing. Some of them are having to \nlive on food stamps. This is an embarrassment to us as a nation.\n  We have to do something for our military men and women. The problem \nis, we can't do everything. We can't have a huge tax cut and still do \nwhat needs to be done in these other areas. But what we can do is have \na more moderate tax cut that doesn't jeopardize our commitment to \nimportant national interests and that doesn't jeopardize Social \nSecurity and Medicare. And most importantly, we can pay down the debt, \nnot saddle our kids with it.\n  What we ought to do is not spend money we do not have, to not spend \nmoney if we have no idea whether it will ever come into existence. Why \nis that not the responsible thing to do?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield an \nadditional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am glad to give 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the key to this--in this debate, and in our \ndiscussion, our dialog with the American people--is that we tell them \nthe truth. We do not know what is going to happen 5 or 6 years from \nnow. In addition to that, we have to be responsible when we decide what \nto do about this budget resolution. They can't have everything. They \nknow it. American families can't have everything they want, and they \nknow as a nation that we can't have everything we want.\n  We also have to make absolutely sure that this tax cut we enact is \nfair; that it is fair to everybody; that the benefits are not directed \nat a particular part of our society. We need to make sure that \neverybody gets a benefit--including those people who work but only pay \npayroll taxes and don't pay income taxes; those people need to be \nincluded in any tax cut.\n  We need to make sure it is balanced so that middle-income people all \nacross this country get a substantial benefit, so that working families \nget a substantial benefit.\n\n  So the principles we should be guided by are: No. 1, having a \nmoderate, fiscally responsible tax cut; No. 2, making sure Social \nSecurity and Medicare are protected; and, No. 3, making sure this tax \ncut is fair--fair to all Americans, not unfairly benefitting one part \nof our society.\n  In conclusion, we are at a remarkable moment in our country's \nhistory. We have a chance to have a real impact not only over the \ncourse of the next decade but over the course of the next century. But \nwe can only do it if we make the right decisions, if we are careful and \ndeliberate and thoughtful, and if we are straight with the American \npeople. We can have a balanced, moderate tax cut, giving real tax \nrelief to the American people. We can pay down our debt, which is the \nresponsible thing to do. We can preserve and shore up Medicare and \nSocial Security. And we can have a tax cut plan that is fair to all \nAmericans. But in order to do that, we have to begin by telling the \nAmerican people the truth. And the truth is, we don't know what is \ngoing to happen 5 or 6 years from now, and they can't have everything.\n  We as a nation have important decisions to make. We have important \nchoices to make. Those choices are going to have consequences for our \ncountry, and for our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator from North \nCarolina yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield time off the resolution to the \nSenator from Florida for the purposes of a question or for any other \npurpose.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from North Carolina has made such \na compelling argument. I just want to question him about his people in \nNorth Carolina and their feelings about paying down the national debt. \nWould he further expound on that?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I have town hall meetings all the time with people in \nNorth Carolina, I say to Senator Nelson. Over and over people tell me \nexactly the same thing, which is, they know that we need to pay off the \nnational debt. They know it is really important to them that their kids \nnot be saddled with this debt and the interest payments on the debt. \nThey know that what has happened over the course of the last 8 or 9 \nyears is we have taken a course of real responsibility. It is one of \nthe reasons we have had such extraordinary economic growth, such \nextraordinary productivity. They know that in their gut. They do not \nneed an economist to tell them. They know it. They know when they owe \nmoney they pay it back. That is what they expect our government to do. \nThey do not want their kids saddled with this debt. So they think it is \ncritically important. I agree with that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I suspect the people in North Carolina know, \nas do the people in Florida, that if there is an available surplus out \nthere over the next 10 years, we ought to use it wisely, be fiscally \ndisciplined; and one of the first priorities should be that we pay down \nthe national debt--that we leave some, after we enact a tax cut, in \norder to be able to pay down the national debt.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I say to the Senator, I think that is the only \nresponsible thing to do under the circumstances. That is what I hear \nfrom folks in North Carolina. The truth of the matter is, they do not \nneed some fancy projection or some economist to come tell them. It is \njust common sense. It is the sensible thing to do. And they know it is \nthe sensible thing to do.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for the question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when Senator Domenici wants the floor to \ndo something, I will yield. But I want to yield myself such time as I \nmight consume off the resolution to speak about the issue that has been \ndiscussed on the other side of the aisle.\n  I do not question the sincerity of the people who have been speaking \nto the point that we need to know what is down the road before we give \ntax cuts. The only thing that is strange about that argument is, they \nuse that argument now, at a time when we have an opportunity to let the \npeople keep some of their own money, at a time when we can have tax \nrelief for every taxpayer who pays income tax.\n  This somehow is a little bit unjust, to bring up the argument that \nmaybe we can't quite see what the future holds down the road, so we \nshouldn't give a tax cut. For decades, I have served in Congress, \nlistening to issues of spending--whether or not we should spend more \nmoney. I never heard these arguments back in the days of deficits. No \none ever said that we could not see down the road far enough, so we \nshould spend a little bit less.\n  It seems to me that it's very inconsistent to use this argument. I am \nnot questioning the legitimacy of it; I am questioning the fact that it \nis used when we are talking about tax relief for working men and women, \nwhile at the same time, they don't use it when talking about whether we \nought to spend more money. Spending more money, without consideration \nof what is down the road, got us into 28 years of unbalanced budgets \nand driving up the big budget deficit that we had. So we ought to be as \nconcerned about it on one side of the ledger as we are on the other. I \nthink it is very important--when we are talking about tax relief and \nthe priorities in the budget--that we always keep in mind that the \nAmerican people are suffering from the highest level of taxation, as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, since World War II.\n  Right now, the rate of tax is 20.6 percent of GDP.\n  What does 20.6 percent of GDP mean? Compare it to a 40-year average \nof around 19 percent. Does 19 percent going up to 26.6 percent mean \nmuch? Yes, it means a lot, because that money is run through the \nFederal Treasury. This means political decisions are made on how it is \ngoing to be spent. This process does not create new wealth. If it is in \nthe pockets of the taxpayers, whether it is spent or invested, it is \ngoing to create new wealth. Money in the taxpayers' pockets turns over \nmany more times in the economy than if government spends it. Wealth is \ncreated only in the private sector. Government does not create wealth, \nit expends wealth.\n  This situation is as if you had a 7-percent mortgage and you received \nmore income than originally intended. Would you pay down your mortgage \nat 7 percent or would you invest it in something that was going to pay \n9 or 10 percent? If you are a good business person, you are going to \ninvest it in something that pays a higher rate of return.\n  Returning this money to the taxpayers is going to give us a higher \nrate of return. It will keep us in line with the 19 percent of the \ngross domestic product which has been paid to the Federal Treasury as \ntaxes from the American people. Hopefully, it will keep us at a level \nof expenditures around the same amount or a little bit less than we \nhave spent in the past. This way, we will not build up artificially \nhigh levels of expenditures. If taxes grow to 21 percent, we could have \na downturn in the economy. Our spending never goes down. We would keep \nour spending at the high level and then return to the days of deficit \nspending.\n  From a standpoint of consistent policy, the level of taxation ought \nto be the policy which we have had for a long period of time. Taxpayers \nconsider our historical level a legitimate level of taxation, and no \neconomic harm has come from it because the last 20 years have been the \nbest economic years this country has ever had.\n  From the early days of Reagan through President George W. Bush, these \nare the best 20 economic years this country has ever had. It is because \nwe have had a fairly consistent policy of taxation that has rewarded \nproductivity and not overtaxed people. Taxes that come to Washington \nare inefficiently expended.\n  Also, if we do not do something about that 20.6 percent, at the end \nof this decade it is going to go up to 22.7 percent. It will continue \nto grow. The reason it will continue to grow is that we have real \nbracket creep which increases taxation. You go from one bracket to a \nhigher bracket. We have indexation of taxes, but that is to offset \ninflation. We have real bracket creep when money is earned at higher \nlevels by individuals, that is how we get this high level of taxation.\n  Look at the individual income tax. The income tax 4 or 5 years ago \nwas coming in at about 7.2 percent of gross domestic product. I am \ntalking just about the individual income tax. Of all the taxes that \ncome into the Federal Treasury, individual income taxes were a little \nover 7 percent of GDP. They are now over 10 percent of GDP. This is a \nvery dramatic increase in the money coming into the Federal Treasury \nfrom income taxes. From that standpoint, it seems to me this is another \nreason the people deserve income tax relief.\n  The individual income tax burden has doubled since President \nClinton's tax increase in 1993. That was the biggest tax increase in \nthe history of the country. Reducing the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of our country is where the Bush plan focuses its relief.\n\n  For the nervous nellies of the Senate who are concerned about whether \nwe can see down the road far enough when it comes to tax decreases but \nare not so concerned about seeing down the road of the future when it \ncomes to expenditures, they ought to have some confidence in Alan \nGreenspan. Mr Greenspan says that over the long term, if the Federal \nGovernment continues to collect tax revenue at this record rate, the \nFederal Government will either spend the money or become a significant \nholder of private assets.\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\n  The Federal Government becomes a significant holder of private assets \nwhen it has paid down every penny of the national debt that has come \ndue and it cannot pay down any more without paying tremendous premiums \nfor calling in the bonds. There are some savings bonds we would not \nwant to call in, whether it is young kids saving money through savings \nbonds or older people who have their money in savings bonds. They think \nit is very safe.\n  There may be some of those instruments that we will want to allow \npeople to have for their own well-being. We can pay down every cent on \nthe national debt that can be paid down. But when we get too much money \ncoming in, it burns a hole in our pocket, it will be spent. We do not \nwant that to happen. Suppose it does not burn a hole in our pocket and \nwe do not spend it. What are we going to do with it? We are not going \nto put it in a mattress at the Treasury Department. We are going to go \ninto the market and buy things that will produce a return on that \nmoney. We do not want the Federal Government upsetting the financial \nmarkets by buying things on Wall Street or even certificates of \ndeposit. When the Federal Government goes into the market, it goes in a \nbig way that distorts the market. We should not have the Government \ndoing that.\n  Everybody seems to be hung up on this $1.6 trillion tax cut. The $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut is my personal preference, not that there is anything \nmagic about it, but it is something we have talked about in an \nelection. A person who is elected ought to perform in office \ncommensurate with the rhetoric of that campaign. Consequently, if \nanybody is surprised about President Bush suggesting $1.6 trillion as \ntax relief for working men and women, the only shock they should have \nis that there is now somebody in office who ran on a platform and is \npresenting the program on which he ran.\n  That is unusual in politics at all levels in America. This President \nis determined to help reduce the cynicism towards Government, so most \nof the ideas he has suggested to Congress in his first 100 days in \noffice are those ideas on which he ran for office, and he wants to \nperform in office according to that.\n  I am fortunate as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to be able \nto work with the President who has goals I have been trying to \naccomplish before he ever decided to run for President. I am glad to be \nable to work through some pieces of legislation that are on his \nprogram, which is legislation I have wanted to accomplish.\n  It is quite easy for me to work for this program, and work for the \ntax relief for working men and women. Some of these parts of the tax \npackage are parts on which I voted to support. Pieces of program have \npassed the Senate and House and were vetoed by the previous President. \nWe now have a chance to get these through the Congress, have them \nsigned by the President, and give working men and women tax relief. I \nhope we move forward on these tax issues.\n\n  Most importantly, for people on the other side who are nervous about \na tax cut based on 10-year projections, remember, these are \nnonpolitical people making these projections. They don't have a 1,000-\npercent batting average. I have noticed them getting much better in the \nyears I have been in the Senate. They seek outside advice and outside \npredictors of the economic future may be, and compare that information \nto their own results. They take a fairly intermediate course, not one \nthat projects the most rosy scenarios for the future or the least rosy \nscenarios for the future, but intermediate scenarios. That is a fairly \nresponsible approach.\n  For those concerned about taxes, I hope those Members are as \nconsistent and concerned when it comes to expenditures as well. I hope \nyou are just as cautious in making expenditures, not knowing what the \nfuture holds, as you want everybody else to be when it comes to tax \nreductions.\n  I wonder whether or not the people who are concerned about whether we \ncan look 10 years into the future to make budget policy have any \nconcerns about the fact that Jack Kennedy had a tax cut in 1963, bigger \nthan the tax cut we are talking about, and it only looked ahead 1 year. \nWhen the second biggest tax cut of this half century was in 1981 under \nPresident Reagan, I don't know that there was any concern that we only \nlooked ahead 5 years at that time. We are trying to look further ahead \nbecause it is a wiser way to make public policy.\n  On the other hand, I wonder how the very same people, raising the \nvery same concerns about not being able to look down the road far \nenough to make a decision, ever got nerve enough to take out a 30-year \nmortgage. Surely they had to go to their banker. They had to ask the \nbanker, can I get a 30-year mortgage? They had to show the banker they \nhad the ability to repay that loan over the next 30 years. They had to \nthink for the next 30 years, what is my income going to be? Will I ever \nbe fired? They got a loan, I bet, based upon having some sort of \nconfidence in the future.\n  That is how we go about making a decision on handling the $28 \ntrillion that is coming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 \nyears. We decided that a lot of it will be spent and we had to \naccommodate for inflation during that period of time. We built in 4-\npercent increases just for inflation and some growth each of the next \n10 years. That is all figured into the $28 trillion that is coming in \nbefore we figured that we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. Out of the $5.6 \ntrillion surplus, we take all of that money that is in trust funds and \nput it off the table. We take $1.6 trillion off the table for a tax \ncut, and what we have left for emergencies is $900 billion. This can be \nused of prescription drug programs for senior citizens, and \nunanticipated expenditures.\n  We have been very cautious as we approach the future. We use the same \ntools at hand that any citizen has in looking into the future as they \nborrow or make plans on what they will spend down the road. Two \ntrillion dollars is a lot of money. My guess is this growth of the \neconomy has been figured conservatively enough that we will have much \nmore than that over the next 10 years. We just have to wait. I think \nthis is doable.\n  Some of my Republican friends said this tax cut ought to be a lot \nmore than $1.6 trillion. I think it is important to build confidence. I \nthink intellectually we can show it is doable. We can pay down every \ncent on the national debt that can be paid down over the next 10 years. \nWe can have prescription drugs, fund our priorities, and still keep \nmoney for working men and women to be further rewarded for the fruits \nof their labor and the fruits of their minds that have given us this \ngreat economy and the great economic growth we have had.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are ready to ask for a unanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Grassley be recognized to offer an \namendment on behalf of himself, Senator Snowe, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Collins, Senator Frist, and others who want to join on our \nside. That is an amendment in the first degree regarding Medicare and \nprescription drugs. I ask that the time between now and 5 o'clock be \nequally divided for debate on both amendments, and following the use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate proceed on two consecutive \nvotes, the first on or in relation to the Grassley amendment, which I \nhave just described as to its cosponsorship, to be followed by a vote \non or in relation to the Baucus amendment, without any intervening \naction or debate, and that no second-degree amendments be in order to \neither amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator from New \nMexico agree, prior to the second vote, there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two minutes equally divided, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, seniors' ability to afford prescription \ndrugs is a very serious problem. Too many seniors have to make a \npainful choice between paying for medicine or paying for rent and food. \nI have heard from many Missouri constituents on this issue. It is time \nthat Congress enacts a comprehensive prescription drug benefit for all \nseniors. This is why I am cosponsoring and supporting the amendment to \nthe Senate budget resolution that would create a voluntary\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nprescription drug benefit for all seniors through the Medicare program.\n  The Democratic amendment makes an investment in an affordable, \naccessible, and meaningful prescription drug benefit for all \nbeneficiaries. Instead of making a real investment in a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, the Republican budget resolution invests \nonly $153 billion over 10 years in this critical initiative. This \ninvestment is nowhere near sufficient to meet the need.\n  The size of the Republican leadership's tax cut would make it \nimpossible to provide the additional investment needed to meet the \ndemand of this important national priority. The Democratic amendment \nwould reduce the tax cut by $158 billion over 10 years and invest a \ntotal of $311 billion over 10 years in a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit for all beneficiaries.\n  The Democratic amendment to the budget resolution proposes a \nprescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries that does not \nuse funds from the Medicare or Social Security surpluses. The amendment \nwill provide a benefit that is voluntary, gives beneficiaries \nmeaningful protection, is affordable to all beneficiaries and the \nprogram, and ensures access to the drugs seniors and people with \ndisabilities need at the pharmacies they trust. In addition, it is \nconsistent with broader Medicare reform.\n  It is time that Congress act on this important matter.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nBaucus-Graham Medicare prescription drug amendment. The amendment sets \na total of $311 billion for the creation of a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. The need for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare \ngrows each and every year. Unfortunately, the budget resolution \ncurrently before us fails to meet our seniors tremendous need in this \narea.\n  Advances in medical science have revolutionized the practice of \nmedicine. And the proliferation of pharmaceuticals has radically \naltered the way acute illness and chronic disease are treated and \nmanaged. Further fueling these advancements have been annual increases \nin the budget of the National Institutes of Health, NIH. This year, the \nNIH is slated to receive an increase of $2.8 billion, which not \ncoincidentally just happens to be equal to the total increase in the \nentire Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, budget.\n  While the allocation of $153 billion for both Medicare reform and the \ncreation of a prescription drug benefit is probably the most blatant \nexample of how our most vulnerable citizens are being shortchanged by \nthe budget resolution, the overall budget for HHS is laden with vital \nprograms that are being decimated so the Administration can fund an \never-growing and misguided tax cut. However, we will not know exactly \nwhich programs have been sacrificed until after the budget resolution \nhas already passed.\n  With regard to pharmaceuticals, I am deeply concerned that we are \ncreating a situation like the classic story of Rapunzel, except in this \ncase, scientists and remarkable new medical treatments are in the ivory \ntower and the people who would most benefit from these lifesaving \nadvancements are on the other side of the moat with no bridge.\n  Thanks to the years we held the course of fiscal discipline, we now \nhave a historic opportunity to fund our nation's priorities, prepare \nfor future expenditures and return some of the remaining surplus back \nto the American taxpayer. Later this week, an alternative budget \nresolution will be offered which I believe strikes the right balance of \nfiscal discipline and investing in our priorities. It includes adequate \nfunding for a universal Medicare prescription drug benefit for every \nsenior in America.\n  We are already painfully aware of the fact that remarkable advances \nin medical science, particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals, do not \ncome without a cost. Since 1980, prescription drug expenditures have \ngrown at double digit rates and today prescription drugs constitute the \nlargest out-of-pocket cost for seniors. For millions of seniors, many \nof whom are living on a fixed income and do not have a drug benefit as \npart of their health insurance coverage, access to these new medicines \nis simply beyond reach.\n  Even more alarming, it is estimated that 38 percent of seniors pay \n$1,000 or more for prescription drugs annually, while 3 in 5 Medicare \nbeneficiaries lack a dependable source of drug coverage. This lack of \nreliable drug coverage for today's seniors is reminiscent of the lack \nof hospital coverage for the elderly prior to the creation of Medicare. \nBack in 1963, an estimated 56 percent of seniors lacked hospital \ninsurance coverage. Today, after all our investments in health care and \nprevention, 53 percent of seniors still lack a prescription drug \nbenefit. This is unacceptable.\n  The need for a Medicare prescription drug benefit is a top concern \nfor the elderly and disabled in my home state of Rhode Island. Many \nseniors continue to be squeezed by declines in retiree health insurance \ncoverage, increasing Medigap premiums and the capitation of annual \nprescription drug benefits at $500 or $1000 under Medicare managed care \nplans. Seniors in my state are frustrated and burdened both financially \nand emotionally by the lack of a reliable prescription drug benefit. As \ntheir Senator, I am committed to doing all I can to relieve them of \nthis tremendous burden.\n  While the need for a prescription drug benefit is clear and the \ndesire on the part of some members of Congress is there, action on \nMedicare prescription drug legislation has been slow. I sincerely hope \nthat this chamber can have the courage to fulfill the promise we made \nover 30 years ago to provide for seniors' health care needs. Clearly, \nin today's world that means the provision of prescription drug \ncoverage. The time is now to make the step from rhetoric to action on a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. We should all feel compelled to \nseize this opportunity to strengthen and enhance Medicare for the new \nmillennium.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe Senator Grassley has the proposed amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 173 to Amendment No. 170\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. This is for Senator Grassley, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Collins, and Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Domenici, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Frist, proposes an \n     amendment No. 173 to amendment numbered 170.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49 strike lines 15 through line 6 on page 50 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 203. RESERVE FUND FOR PRESCRIPTIONS DRUGS AND MEDICARE \n                   REFORM IN THE SENATE.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution, or a conference report thereon is \n     submitted, which reforms the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and \n     improves the access of beneficiaries under that program to \n     prescription drugs, the Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise committee allocations for the \n     Committee on Finance and other appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates and allocations of new budget authority (and the \n     outlays resulting therefrom) in this resolution by the amount \n     provided by the bill, joint resolution, or conference report \n     but not to exceed $300,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal \n     years 2002 through 2011. The total adjustment made under this \n     section for any fiscal year may not exceed the Congressional \n     Budget Office's estimate of the President's medicare reform \n     and prescription drug plan (or, if such a plan is not \n     submitted in a timely manner, the Congressional Budget \n     Office's estimate of a comparable plan submitted by the \n     Chairman of the Committee on Finance).\n\n  Senator Grassley's Talking Points on his Medicare Amendment to the \n                           Budget April 2001\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with \nSenators Snowe, Domenici, Collins, and Frist this afternoon represents \nSenate Republicans following through on our commitments. We joined \nPresident Bush in committing to strengthen and improve Medicare to meet \nthe needs of older Americans. And the amendment I am offering \ndemonstrates that we will keep that promise.\n  This amendment provides the flexibility necessary for the Finance \nCommittee to craft legislation that not\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nonly provides necessary reforms and improves access to prescription \ndrugs, but does so in a responsible fashion--so we're not left with \nuncontrollable spending.\n  I hear from constituents all the time about things in Medicare that \nneed to be updated. And while prescription drugs is the most visible \nimprovement, it is surely not the only one.\n  Medicare is operating on a system that is almost a half-century old. \nThere is little doubt in anyone's mind that this system is not only \nout-of-date, but that it cannot support the surge of baby boomers that \nwill enter the program over the next decade.\n  We owe it to our beneficiaries to provide high-quality 21st century \nmedicine, we owe it to our providers to let them deliver the care they \nwere trained to provide instead of spending all of their time on \npaperwork and regulations, and we owe it to our taxpayers to make sure \nwe're spending every dollar wisely--and not wastefully.\n  I think we have a real opportunity to get Medicare legislation done \nthis year and the amendment I am offering today allows us an \nopportunity to do just that.\n  I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues here \nin the Senate to craft a Medicare proposal that makes sense for \nbeneficiaries and that is fiscally responsible for our taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my good friend from Iowa, my chairman, is \nattempting, in a good-faith way, to figure out how we are going to get \na greater prescription drug benefit to our seniors. It is clear our \nseniors need it. The only question that is facing this body is simple: \nwhich of the two alternatives, the one offered by the chairman or the \none offered by myself, is more likely to get them the benefit?\n  The circumstance is a bit awkward, a bit difficult. My chairman and \nmyself are offering competing amendments. In a real sense, they are \nvery similar. It is about the same thing. We are both trying to get a \nprescription drug benefit, and in each case the amount is roughly the \nsame, $300 billion. The amendment of the Senator says up to $300 \nbillion over 10 years. The amendment I am offering says we will add \n$158 billion to the current $153 billion. That comes out to $311 \nbillion. So we are both talking about $300 billion total in \nprescription drug benefits for the next 10 years for our senior \ncitizens who, essentially, are currently not covered.\n  The question really is, Why are we here? We are both talking about \n$300 billion. What is the big deal? Why don't we just agree and get on \nwith the other amendments?\n  The point is there is an honest, good-faith difference of opinion as \nto which of the two is more likely to provide the actual prescription \ndrug benefits. The amendment I have offered very simply states we will \ntake $158 billion out of the $1.6 trillion tax bill and add that to the \nbudget resolution of $153 billion, which means a specific $311 billion \nfor prescription drug benefits which includes reform.\n  My amendment does not in any way preclude Medicare reform. Certainly, \nMedicare reform has to be addressed, and I think we should begin to \naddress it this year in the Finance Committee.\n  The amendment offered by my chairman--he is a great guy, I might add. \nHe is a great Senator and great chairman of the committee. But I think \nwe have a little bit of an honest difference of opinion as to which \napproach is more likely to get the result. His amendment, if I might \nread it, is very simple. I will cut out the useless words and just \nstate the pertinent words: If the Committee on Finance of the Senate \nreports a bill or a joint resolution which reforms the Medicare program \nand improves the access of beneficiaries, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee may--underline the word ``may''--revise committee allocations \nthat are appropriate.\n  It goes on to say the total adjustment made may not exceed the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of the President's Medicare reform \nand prescription drug plan.\n  Basically, there are several soft phrases and soft words which raise \nquestions as to the degree to which this is going to come to pass. The \nfirst soft word is ``if'' the Committee on Finance. It doesn't direct \nthe Committee on Finance to report out a prescription drug bill. It \njust says ``if.'' Of course, who knows what the Committee on Finance is \ngoing to do if it is not mandatory.\n  Second, it provides even if the Committee on Finance reports out this \nbill, the committee on budget ``may'' revise committee allocations. Not \nthat it shall revise committee allocations, only that it may.\n  I think there is probably a pretty good reason why the word is \n``may'' and not ``shall.'' That is, to be honest, because we do not \nhave the dollars. The contingency fund--everybody has a claim to it. It \nmost likely will not be there. The only other alternative is to go into \nthe hospital insurance trust fund. We certainly do not want to do that.\n\n  The practical result of this amendment, it seems to me, from any fair \nreading, is that most likely--even though we intend to have the dollars \nthere, intention is not enough--as a practical matter, the dollars are \nnot going to be there so we will not have a meaningful prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  It also provides the chairman of the Budget Committee ``may'' provide \nthis allocation only ``if'' it does not exceed the estimate of the \nPresident's plan in Medicare reform. So it really precludes us in the \nSenate from adopting any prescription drug plan or Medicare reform plan \nother than the President's. I think we should have a little leeway on \nwhat we are doing.\n  So the alternative we face is very simple. It is a very simple \nalternative and Senators will differ about it. Clearly some Senators do \nnot want to touch the tax cut. They think it is what it should be. \nOther Senators think it is maybe too much. But the choice is very \nsimple. I think this is a fair statement and it is pretty hard for \nanybody to come up with anything very different than what I am going to \nsay.\n  The choice is to reduce the President's tax cut--or the Budget \nCommittee tax plan--by about $158 billion over 10 years and add that to \nthe prescription drug benefit called for in the budget resolution for a \ntotal of $300 billion, and specify that--which means roughly $311 \nbillion for a prescription drug benefit along with reform--that is \noption 1--or option 2 is no reduction in the President's tax plan but \nhope that maybe the Finance Committee will report out a bill, the hope \nthat maybe the chairman of the Budget Committee will come up with the \nreallocation, and that basically it must conform with the President's \nnumber.\n  I love to think we have the money there under the contingency fund \nfor Medicare prescription drugs that is not out of the hospital \ninsurance trust fund but somewhere else. But this is all so simple. I \ndo not have the list in front of me, but all of the claims on the \ncontingency fund are just innumerable. Alternative minimum tax, it is \nthe tax extenders, it is some business tax cuts, it is pension reform, \nit is emergency assistance, it is defense.\n  Does anybody here think in the next 10 years the President of the \nUnited States is not going to, under NMD, offer a big significant boost \nin defense spending, say, next year or the following year? We know it \nis coming. There is nothing left in this contingency fund. It is just \nnot there.\n  I do not want to get too technical about this, but even under the \nbudget resolution provided for on the floor, in years 5, 6, and 7, the \namount of the contingency trust fund is negative, is $6 billion or $7 \nbillion during that period. That means any plan has to come out of the \nhospital insurance trust fund.\n  I made my point. It is a simple alternative. One is definite. It \ntells the Finance Committee to come up with $300 billion. The other is \na big maybe. And the maybe is based on very shifting stands. It is just \nnot solid enough to support the conclusion that the money is going to \nbe there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time do \nwe have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 81 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 13 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 2 minutes and then I will ask Senator \nFrist\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\nto manage on my side. I have to leave the floor. He and Senator \nGrassley will finish up the debate.\n  I say to everybody listening, the plain and simple fact is we propose \nwe not reduce the President's $1.6 trillion tax cut as a means of \npaying for prescription drug reform because we believe that is exactly \nwhat the contingency fund of $500 billion was intended for. We provide \na mechanism to make sure that if the President poses a permanent fix to \nMedicare, or the Finance Committee writes one, in each event they will \nbe funded not to exceed $300 billion.\n  The Senator says there is a lot of ``ifs'' and ``maybes.'' I want to \nclose by saying: Whatever happens to their amendment, there is no \nprescription drug bill until the committee writes one, right? So you \nare saying you are putting the money in and it is all full of ifs and \nands and buts and maybes; to wit, you have to write a bill.\n  Nobody knows when the bill will be written. Why do we put the money \nin? We are not sure what it is going to be. We have estimates from $346 \nbillion to $500 billion, if necessary.\n  We think we are doing the judicious thing leaving the tax cut intact \nand providing for prescription drug reform that is significant that can \nbe up to but not exceeding $300 billion. And we will assign it to the \ncommittee on the happening of either of two events: the President \nsubmits one which the Congressional Budget Office estimates or the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee produces one that is \ncosted out. And then we give them the money but not to exceed $300 \nbillion.\n  That is the summary underneath our proposal. Unless and until we \nwrite a bill, there will be no money spent on Medicare prescription \ndrugs because we still have to write the reform measure.\n  I yield the floor at this point. I yield it to my two friends.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what a difference a few hours makes. What \na dramatic transformation. When we proposed this morning a prescription \ndrug benefit and the funding for it of $311 billion, the other side \nsaid: There the Democrats go again. All they want to do is spend money.\n  But here we are at 4:30 in the afternoon and the Republicans are \nback. And what do they want to do? They want to spend almost the \nidentical amount of money.\n  What has occurred here is absolutely fascinating. There has been a \ntransformation. It has been really quite remarkable. All of this \nmorning the Republican line was, Oh, the Democrats just want to spend \nmoney. But by 4:30 in the afternoon the Republicans want to spend the \nsame money. The difference is they want to raid the Medicare trust \nfund, and we want to protect the Medicare trust fund. We want a \nprescription drug benefit directly and clearly out of surpluses outside \nof the trust funds.\n  Let me show you why the proposal of our friends on the other side \nwill put us right into the trust funds. This chart shows the surpluses \navailable under the Republican budget proposal year by year. As you can \nsee, in the year 2005, there is only $7 billion available before they \nare into the Medicare trust fund. They are here proposing $300 billion \nof expenditures for a prescription drug benefit. When you divide $300 \nbillion by the 10 years covered, that is about $30 billion a year. If \nthey use $30 billion in the year 2005 for a prescription drug benefit, \nguess what. They are using Medicare trust fund money to fund a \nprescription drug benefit. What is wrong with that? That way leads to \nbankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund at an earlier date. That leads to \ninsolvency of the Medicare trust fund at an earlier date.\n  That is why our amendment is superior. It is better fiscally. It is \nbetter for a prescription drug benefit because we will not permit \nraiding the Medicare trust fund to fund a prescription drug benefit. We \nprotect every penny of the Social Security trust fund, every penny of \nthe Medicare trust fund, and we fund a prescription drug benefit--the \n$300 billion they are talking about--out of what is remaining. They are \nfunding the Medicare prescription drug benefit out of the trust fund.\n  It is just as clear as it can be. This amendment ought to be \nrelabeled the ``Grassley Raid the Medicare Trust Fund Amendment.'' That \nis what we ought to call it because that is what it does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Michigan seek time? I yield the Senator from \nMichigan 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to share the concern expressed by \nmy colleagues who have been providing leadership on this budget \nresolution. I respect the chairman of the Finance Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  I must rise to indicate that I could not be more concerned about the \napproach that is being taken on this amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the underlying Baucus amendment that provides a real \nprescription drug plan for our seniors. No ifs, ands, or buts. It is \nreal. It is there, and it will not come out of the Medicare trust fund.\n  As to what was said by our distinguished Senator from North Dakota \ntalking about the Medicare trust fund, this budget resolution, \nunfortunately, is a big shell game. It starts by saying, except for \nMedicare and Social Security, every penny-plus will go to a tax cut to \nwealthiest Americans; every penny projected for 10 years of any \npossible surplus. Then, to pay for funding, it moves Medicare trust \nfunds of $500 billion-plus over into something called the contingency \nfund.\n  We have been spending a lot of time trying to shore up Medicare and \nSocial Security and protect it for the future. We know the baby boomers \nare going to be retiring within the next 11 years. The last thing we \nneed to do is be spending those trust funds.\n  But because of the way this budget resolution is put together, the \nentire Medicare trust fund goes from about being protected over to \nbeing spent.\n  This proposal, unfortunately, spends Medicare in order to provide \nsome possible prescription drug coverage. It is an amendment that goes \nagainst itself.\n  We need to be protecting the current Medicare trust fund, modernizing \nMedicare, and adding dollars so we are strengthening it in terms of \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Earlier this afternoon I heard comments on the other side of the \naisle talking about how we don't know how we are going to pay for this \nproposal, that seniors are going to have to wait, and that we can't \nafford to do this. How long do the seniors of this country have to \nwait? How long do they have to wait?\n  I have been in the Congress only 4 years-plus--four in the House and \nnow in this distinguished body in which I am so honored to serve on \nbehalf of the people Michigan. But in the entire time I have been here, \nwe have been talking about updating Medicare to cover prescription \ndrugs. And every day we wait there are thousands or millions of seniors \nwho are sitting down at the kitchen table in the morning saying: Do I \neat today or do I get my medicine? Do I pay the utilities today or do I \nget my medicine?\n  We don't have that same sense of urgency that I hear from the \nfamilies in Michigan. We need to have that. Our seniors can't wait.\n  We don't need smoke and mirrors. We don't need a shell game. We don't \nneed to spend the current Medicare trust fund. We need to be honest and \nupfront and say that we are willing to take just a small part--less \nthan 7 percent of the tax cut being proposed--to be moved over and \nprovide the seniors of our country help with prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  The majority of seniors will not benefit from this tax cut. They \nwon't receive the tax cut. The tax cut that we can provide for them, \nand the money we can put back in their pockets, is by giving them help \nwith their medicine and giving them help with the cost of prescription \ndrugs. That is money back in the pockets of the senior citizens and \nthose with disabilities in our country. I think they deserve something \nin their pockets as well.\n  While I support a tax cut that is across the board and geared to \nmiddle-class taxpayers, small businesses, and family farmers, I think \nwe can also, if we do this right and we are honest about it and if we \nput together the right priorities, make sure we keep the promise. If we \ndo not do it now, when will we?\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nup to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 16 minutes \n15 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes. Please notify me \nwhen 2 minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier this morning, we have a \ntremendous opportunity, I believe. It is reflected by amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle. That opportunity is to expand Medicare in \nterms of its benefit coverage; that is, adding prescription drugs, \nwhich is critically important. It is vital if we want to be able to \nlook seniors and individuals with disabilities in the eye and say: We \nare going to give you health care security.\n  That is what Medicare is all about. Why? Because prescription drugs, \nI believe, has to be a part of Medicare, just as the hospital bed or \ninpatient hospitalization or outpatient care, to fulfill that \nresponsibility. But to have health care security, it requires us, I \nbelieve, to do more than just add a benefit which none of us really \nknow how to add on. None of us have developed the policy through which \nwe can deliver these services as of yet. But adding that benefit alone \non to a structure which has, as good as it is, real problems, problems \nin terms of solvency--and what that means really is sustainability--is \nirresponsible. When you look at a 40-year-old, or a 50-year-old, or a \n60-year-old, they want to know that the Medicare program is going to be \nthere 20 years later. Today we cannot say that in good conscience, \nunless we modernize the system, improve the system, and strengthen the \nsystem.\n\n  The way the debate has evolved over the course of the day, now we \nhave two very clear choices. One adds prescription drugs in a right way \nand one does so in a wrong way. The right way, I believe, is Senator \nGrassley's amendment. The wrong way is Senator Baucus's amendment. I \nwant to explain why.\n  We link the Grassley amendment to modernization, to strengthening the \nsystem, to improving the Medicare system, including prescription \ndrugs--something their amendment does not do. Theirs addresses only the \nprescription drug concept and does not, as was just said, link to that \nimprovement, that strengthening, that modernization. We want to be able \nto respond to that individual's needs. That is what Medicare reform is \nall about.\n  We believe strongly that reform must be a part of our response--and \nthat is why it is spelled out in the Grassley amendment--where, yes, we \nare committed to spending an additional $150 billion. That is what the \namendment does. But it says on top of that we will spend up to another \n$150 billion after the policy is formulated. Right now we do not have \nthe policy.\n  The reason why it is so important to at least think about the \npolicy--to make policy before we fund it--is because of this figure \nshown right here in relation to prescription drugs. This chart shows \nthe prescription drug demand and the response to that demand from 1965 \nto 1999. This shows how much has been expended overall. The whole point \nof this chart is that you can look at what has happened over the last 4 \nto 5 years. There has been explosive growth of prescription drugs. And \nwe are talking about trying to fund this in some way for seniors, but \nwe do not have the policy yet. So the Grassley amendment says, if we \ndevelop that policy--when we develop that policy--either by the \nPresident of the United States or the Finance Committee, then let's \nfigure out how much it costs and place that into the budget for up to \n$300 billion; and only after that has been costed out, so we will know \nwhat that policy is going to cost the taxpayers.\n  Why? If you look ahead on this chart--and on the red chart I showed \nyou to 1999 how much we have been spending; I showed you the explosive \ngrowth here--if we do not do it right, with the right policy, if we do \nnot include prescription drugs in Medicare, and integrate it in such a \nway that we have the tools that in some way can control the cost, \nconstrain the cost, look at what is going to happen. This chart shows \nwhat is projected to happen if we do not do anything: explosive growth.\n  So what we are layering--again, for all people, not just seniors; \nseniors are about a third of this--if we superimpose and place this, \nwithout Medicare reform, on our Medicare system, we cannot look seniors \nin the eye and say this program is going to be around in 10 years or 15 \nyears. It simply cannot be sustained.\n  I showed earlier today why that is the case. It is because we are \ndeficit spending. We are spending more in Medicare today. If you look \nat Part A and Part B, Medicare in the whole, we are spending more today \nthan we are taking in. We are deficit spending even in the Part A. The \nhospital trust fund will be deficit spending in 2016, but today we are \nrunning a deficit. If we superimpose, without the policy, a program of \nprescription drugs on Medicare without reform, I believe we are \nbehaving irresponsibly, if we are looking at the sustainability of \nMedicare long-term.\n\n  Medicare's problem today: Just look at Part A. It is going bankrupt \nby 2029. Deficit spending in just 15 years. It only covers 53 percent \ntoday of beneficiaries' health care costs. That is right now. And that \nis going to get worse over time unless we modernize the system.\n  There is no coverage for prescription drugs. It is a generational \ntimebomb. We are going to be doubling the number of seniors coming into \nthe system over the next 30 years.\n  Congressional mandates right now through HCFA have resulted in \n135,000 pages of regulations governing that doctor-patient \nrelationship. Medicare has simply not kept pace, in terms of quality, \naccess, and the delivery of health care, with our private systems.\n  So in about 15 minutes we are going to have a choice. The choice is \nbetween two amendments, both of which address prescription drugs on the \npart of the Senate, in the effort, the commitment to include \nprescription drugs as a part of Medicare. Something, I think just about \neverybody agrees on. But, again, there is a right way and a wrong way.\n  I support Senator Grassley's amendment because it says, yes, let's \nspend the $153 billion that is in the underlying bill, and once we come \nup with the policy, which we do not have--nobody in this body has it--\nthrough the Finance Committee or from the President of the United \nStates, if it is going to cost up to $300 billion, we will be willing, \nthrough Senator Domenici and the Budget Committee, to add another $150 \nbillion, for a total of $300 billion; but it has to be tied to reform, \nto modernization, to strengthening the system.\n  I oppose the Baucus amendment in large part because it does not tie \nit to reform in any way. It does not basically say, to engage \nprescription drugs responsibly and integrate it into the system, you \nhave to modernize the system itself.\n  Secondly, it unnecessarily takes money out of the taxpayers' pocket. \nBasically, the way they have theirs worded versus the Grassley \namendment, the Grassley amendment comes out of the contingency fund. \nThe Baucus amendment takes the money away from the taxpayer by cutting \nthe tax relief which every hard-working tax-paying American deserves \ntoday.\n  I believe this is a very important issue. I believe it does \ndemonstrate the overall commitment on behalf of the Senate that \nprescription drugs are important, that we have an opportunity to \nstrengthen, to improve, and to modernize the health care system for \nseniors, for individuals with disabilities; and we ought to seize that \nopportunity, but we should not behave irresponsibly and throw \nadditional money at a problem that we have not even fully developed the \npolicy to solve.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support the Grassley amendment and \nto defeat the Baucus amendment when that comes forward.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for up \nto 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened very closely to my good friend\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nfrom Tennessee. I, first, want to make it very clear that the amendment \nI am offering does contemplate reform, because I do believe we need to \nmove this year to begin Medicare reform at the same time we are \nproviding prescription drug benefits. I want to clear the air on that.\n  Second, I do not want to belabor this argument. We will be voting \nvery soon. But just to remind Senators, there is a big difference \nbetween my amendment and the amendment on the other side. We have the \nsame number of dollars $300 billion for a prescription drug benefit. \nBut the amendment offered by Senator Graham and I is definite. It \nprescribes a prescription drug benefit. The other amendment says \n``maybe,'' and maybe out of a contingency fund.\n  I want to make this point because it is so glaringly true. We all \nknow there ``ain't'' no money in the contingency fund. There just \n``ain't.'' And the reason is because it has been called for so many \ntimes--whether for such reasonable things as agricultural provisions, \ndisaster assistance or other provisions in the Tax Code. There isn't \ngoing to be a contingency fund by any stretch of the imagination. It is \njust a hope and a prayer at best. Or else it comes out of the hospital \ninsurance trust fund. And, of course, that is not a great option.\n  So essentially what it comes down to is this: You have a choice, \nSenators: You vote for a prescription for prescription drugs or you \nsay: Call me in the morning. That is the choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think I have 8 minutes left. I yield myself 4, and \nthen Senator Frist wants to speak again.\n  I will address some of the things the Senator from North Dakota and \nthe Senator from Montana have touched on. The first is to express the \nphilosophy behind the way we have handled this amendment, saying that \nthe Senate budget chairman can plug in a figure after the Senate \nFinance Committee has produced a bill. The basis of this is that we \nought to develop the policy and then put in the amount of money it \ntakes to carry out the policy.\n  I have no crystal ball to tell me what amount might be necessary for \na bill. My friends on the other side have this crystal ball telling \nthem we must have $311 billion for Medicare. They are going to develop \na policy around a certain amount of money. I don't think that is the \nway to do business.\n  Another difference between these approaches is that they are going to \nreduce the amount of tax relief that goes to working men and women by \nsome $158 billion. We will use the reserve fund, meaning the money that \nis left over. After we take out $153 billion of the surplus for \nMedicare and $1.6 trillion for tax cuts, there is still $900 billion \nleft. Ever since the President proposed his budget, we all understood \nthat some of this left over money would be used for prescription drugs. \nWe are not going to deny the working men and women of this country a \ntax break that they deserve. We have the money to fund this, but we \ndon't know how much money we need just yet.\n  We think it is wise to develop the policy first and then pay for the \npolicy you develop, rather than putting up X number of dollars, such as \nour opposition does, and then building some policy around it.\n  Now, reading my amendment, my opponents came up with the idea that \nthis amendment is too flexible. Well, flexibility does not mean \ninaction. Our Senate Finance Committee is going to produce a \nprescription drug program for senior citizens and at the same time make \nincremental improvements and changes to Medicare. So he may speak about \nflexibility. The insinuation is that that is an excuse for no action. \nThe last election was all about prescription drugs. The last election \nwas a mandate to deliver on that. This President is committed to \ndelivering on that, and we are going to.\n  I yield myself 1 more minute. I point out to my friend from Montana \nthat his amendment doesn't guarantee a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit any more than mine. We leave opportunities to develop Medicare \npolicy just as they do. Now, let me just chime in for a second and \nthank Senator Smith of Oregon for joining me on this amendment.\n  Now let me address the accusation by my colleague from North Dakota \nthat the amendment I offer today raids the Medicare trust fund. This is \nabsolutely ludicrous. I want to make clear that under my amendment the \nMedicare surplus will continue to go into the Medicare trust fund. The \nMedicare trust fund is just like a bank account. When you make a \ndeposit, it increases the balance in your account, and only you can \ntake that money out. But this does not mean that the bank can't use \nthat money to make loans and pay expenses. In fact, that is exactly \nwhat any good bank does. At the end of the day, when you go to take \nyour money out of the bank, it is there, because the bank has to make \ngood. When it comes to the Medicare trust fund, the Government has to \nmake good too. My amendment does nothing to change that.\n  I yield the remainder of the time we have to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very briefly will summarize again my \nsupport for the Grassley amendment and my opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Montana.\n  Very quickly: What does the Domenici substitute have in it? It is \nvery important because this reflects the commitment of President Bush \nand the Senate budget proposal that is before us.\n  No. 1, in year 1, fiscal year 2002, for Medicare, we will be spending \n$229 billion. In year 10, when we march out 10 years, that will be \nincreased to $459 billion. That is an increase of 111 percent, an \naverage annual increase of over 7\\1/2\\ percent. That means over the \nnext 5 years in Medicare, in hopefully a modernized, strengthened, \nimproved program, we will be spending $1.3 trillion and, over the next \n10 years, $3.3 trillion.\n  What the Grassley amendment does is basically this. It says in this \nprocess of modernization--it is carefully linked to modernization--we \ncan have up to another $150 billion over that period of time after the \npolicy is formulated by the President of the United States or by the \nSenate Finance Committee. That is acting responsibly. It recognizes \nthat policy has not been discussed to the degree it needs to for us to \nin any way project what coverage for prescription drugs will be.\n  I support the Grassley amendment because it allows a total of $300 \nbillion if we modernize, and it says it right in the amendment. I \noppose Senator Baucus's approach because it takes the money from the \ntaxpayers unnecessarily--that same $300 billion. And No. 2, it does not \nlink it to modernization. We just heard that it does, but if you read \nit, nowhere in the Baucus amendment does it say anything about \nmodernizing, strengthening or improving the program.\n  I am very pleased, very proud of the amendment before us. I urge the \nsupport of all of our colleagues for the Grassley amendment, with \nopposition to the Baucus amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in my 60 seconds let me say there are two \nareas of agreement. Apparently we have now agreed that it is going to \ntake in the range of $300 billion over 10 years to have a credible \nprescription drug benefit. That is a significant advance. No. 2, \nfrankly, there is no disagreement with the fact that we should strive \nto reform Medicare. We all start with exactly the same language, which \nis on page 49 of the amendment, which talks about the Finance Committee \nreporting reforms in Medicare.\n  What we also heard in our most recent hearing on this subject is that \nthe most anybody has ever suggested that reform could amount to would \nbe approximately $50 billion in a $3 trillion Medicare program over the \nnext 10 years. Let's not exaggerate what kind of savings we are going \nto get.\n  Where we disagree is how we are going to finance this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Where we disagree is how we should finance this. What the \nRepublicans are saying is we should do this by essentially using the \nPart A trust fund. That is the trust fund which people have paid in \nthrough their payroll tax and from which they have an expectation of \nreceiving--to read from the Medicare benefits booklet--hospital stays, \nskilled nursing facilities, home health care, hospice care, and blood \ncare--all the things which are financed out of the Part A trust fund. \nThat is what is going to be raided as we try to now finance a major \nprescription drug benefit.\n  We should stay with the proposal of the Senator from Montana to \nfinance this responsibly by reducing by less than 10 percent the \nprojected tax reduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am delighted to co-sponsor this amendment \nwith Senator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee. \nThis amendment has a simple but critical purpose: to increase by $147 \nbillion the reserve fund in this resolution for a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit and Medicare reform. That is, this amendment would nearly \ndouble the reserve fund to $300 billion, with monies coming from the \non-budget surplus.\n  Let me note that nothing in this amendment commits Congress to spend \nthe entire reserve fund. Indeed, in truth we do not yet know what \nadditional resources will be needed. We will know better when the \nCongressional Budget Office reports estimates several weeks from now on \na variety of Medicare reform and prescription drug proposals.\n  In short, this additional reserve amount will help ensure that the \nPresident and Congress will have sufficient resources to enact both a \nprescription drug benefit and other badly needed Medicare improvements \nthis year.\n  I am sure my colleagues are very aware of the need for prescription \ndrug coverage, I think the facts underlying this national problem for \nour nation's senior citizens bear repeating.\n  When Medicare was created in 1965, it emphasized the private health \ninsurance model of the time, inpatient health care. In fact, the \noriginal Johnson Administration Medicare proposal was only for hospital \ncare. Doctor's services, and other outpatient care, was added by \nCongress as a voluntary program.\n  Today, thirty-six years later, Medicare, although a great blessing to \nour nation's seniors, is sadly out of date. It is past time to bring \nMedicare ``back to the future'' by providing our seniors with \nprescription drug coverage. Indeed, hardly a day goes by without some \nannouncement of a new and exciting breakthrough in drug therapy, \nbreakthroughs that promise better care for millions of Americans.\n  The lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit is the biggest hole, \na black hole really, in the Medicare system. HCFA will tell you that up \nto 65 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug coverage from other \nsources. But that number simply doesn't tell the whole story.\n  Specifically, fourteen percent of Medicare beneficiaries get drug \ncoverage from one of the three Medigap policies that cover drugs. Two \nof these policies require a $250 deductible and then only cover 50 \npercent of the cost of the drug with a $1,250 cap. Needless to say, you \ncan reach that cap awfully fast with today's drug prices.\n  The third policy provides a cap of $3,000 but the premium ranges \nanywhere from $1,699 to $3,171 depending on where you live. That is a \nlot of money for someone living on a fixed income.\n  About 15 percent of seniors get drug coverage from participating in \nMedicare HMOs. However, we know the Medicare+Choice program has been \nunder great pressure over the last few years, making this source of \nprescription drugs less reliable.\n  And another 16 percent receive coverage from Medicaid. Of course to \ndo that, they must be very low-income to begin with and may have to \nspend a great deal out of pocket for their drugs, what we commonly \nrefer to as ``spending down'', before they are eligible in a given year \nfor coverage.\n  Finally, there are those lucky enough, 29 percent, to have employer \nsponsored drug coverage through their retiree program.\n  Medicare fails today's elderly patients in other ways. The preventive \ncare services offered under Medicare, while greatly expanded, are still \ninsufficient to help seniors remain healthy, and therefore avoid more \nexpensive care later. And routine services such as annual physicals, \nvision tests and hearing aids are not covered.\n  Medicare also only provides limited financial protection. Indeed, we \nmust always remember that Medicare is not just about health care, but \nprotection against potentially high costs of health care. The program \nhas a fee-for-service cost-sharing structure that still leaves seniors \nvulnerable to high costs. Indeed, the traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare program covers only 53 percent of the average senior's annual \nmedical expenses.\n  Moreover, management of the Medicare program is burdened by vast \nbureaucratic complexity and operates in a non-competitive, inefficient \nmanner. It lacks the flexibility to operate differently.\n  Medicare's financing and accounting is confusing. Medicare currently \nmaintains separate trust funds, one for inpatient hospital and post-\nacute care, and one for physician fees and other outpatient costs. This \nseparation leads to misleading assessments of Medicare's financial \nstatus and again reflects a different era of medicine. There is \nirrefutable evidence that Medicare's finances are not sustainable or \naffordable in the long-term.\n  I daresay that no one in this chamber would disagree that Medicare \nneeds improvements. This amendment will make reform possible.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership of \nthe President on Medicare reform. The President has laid down six \nprinciples, which in my view are the starting point for our efforts. \nThe President is preserving committed Medicare's guarantee of access to \nseniors. Every Medicare recipient must have a choice of health plans, \nincluding the option of purchasing a plan that covers prescription \ndrugs. Medicare must cover expenses for low-income seniors. Reform must \nprovide streamlined access to the latest medical technologies. Medicare \npayroll taxes must not be increased. And reform must establish an \naccurate measure of the solvency of Medicare.\n  The funding for this amendment would come from the on-budget surplus. \nI know that is a particular problem for some Members across the aisle, \nbecause that surplus represents cash from HI payroll tax. Of course, HI \ntaxes are credited first to the HI trust fund, so there is no solvency \nimpact.\n  But for those Members who believe that this source of funds is a \nproblem, let me simply point out that in 1972, when the Finance \nCommittee first reported Medicare outpatient drug provisions, those \nprovisions would have been funded directly from the HI payroll tax.\n  I urge all Senators who believe as I do that we must add a Medicare \nprescription drug plan and improve Medicare in other ways to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has come down to this: We both agree \nroughly on the amount of money necessary to fund a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are $300 billion; we are \nat $311 billion. There is not much difference there.\n  There is a profound difference on how to fund that amount of money. \nWe say do not use the trust funds of Social Security or Medicare. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle say raid the Medicare trust \nfund, which we believe is a profound mistake. We ought to fund this \nproposal, but we ought to do it the right way. We ought to do it the \nfiscally responsible way. We ought to do it without raiding a dime of \ntrust fund money.\n  That is our proposal. That, I believe, deserves the support of our \ncolleagues. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen seconds. Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself the rest of the 18 \nseconds.\n  Remember, our amendment uses Medicare money for Medicare. Part A \nMedicare money is going to be used for Medicare. Part B Medicare money \nis going to be used for Medicare. We are even going to put general fund \nmoney in there to use for Medicare.\n  How much more do you want? We're putting medicare money aside for \nMedicare and we're putting extra money aside for Medicare. How much \nplainer can it be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It could be clearer if you did not raid the Medicare \ntrust fund for a new benefit, a new promise, when you need the Medicare \ntrust fund money to keep the previous promises. That is how clear it \nis.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Have you ever heard money is fungible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n173. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 65 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate on the Baucus amendment.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the next vote be 10 \nminutes.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think at this point it would be \nappropriate to welcome the Vice President to the Chamber. We are glad \nyou are here. We hope you will stick around to break the next tie.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. I say to the Senator from North Dakota that is my \nintention.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, don't say that. The next time we want \nyou in the Chair, we will spread the word to you.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I congratulate those who voted for this \namendment, because we have now established that we want a $300 billion \nprescription drug benefit plan over 10 years. Several hours ago, we \nwere at $153 billion. According to the budget resolution, we are now at \n$300 billion. So there is agreement.\n  The amendment now pending basically says, OK. Since we have agreement \nin theory on what the amount should be, let's now lock it in and make \nsure that the money is, in fact, there. The amendment offered by \nSenator Graham and I does that. It locks in the money by telling the \nFinance Committee to come up with a prescription drug bill, by taking \njust a small sliver $158 billion out of the $1.6 trillion tax bill for \nprescription drugs. That, with the $153 billion already in the budget \nresolution, provides $311 billion to give seniors what they need--a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit.\n  Now that we have established $300 billion, let's make sure that we \nput our money where our mouth is. Let's lock the money away instead of \nproviding a hope and prayer that the dollars are going to be there for \nthe prescription drug benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just say this is a typical \namendment from that side of the aisle. They would say to our President \nthat we don't like your tax cut, and we want to take $156 billion of it \nand we want to spend it. They would say they are spending it for some \nvery special purpose. But we can accomplish the same without \ndiminishing what our taxpayers should be getting. They should be \ngetting the President's $11.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  It is plain and simple. This amendment reduces that by $156 billion \nand puts it in an account to be spent. Whatever they are going to spend \nit for, it is the beginning of a tax-and-spend approach on the floor \nfor the remaining 2\\1/2\\ or 3 days.\n  I hope on our side we stay fast. We all voted. We ought to vote the \nsame way. In this instance, it is a ``no'' vote on our side, and they \nwill not prevail, if you will just do what you did. Do it one more \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader and after \nconferring with the minority, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrassley be recognized to offer an amendment relative to agriculture \nand, following the reporting by the clerk, the amendment be laid aside \nand Senator Johnson be recognized to offer an amendment regarding \nagriculture.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the debate tonight run \nconcurrently on both first-degree amendments and the Senate resume \ndebate at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, and the time between 9 a.m. and 10:30 \na.m. be equally divided for closing remarks on the agriculture issue.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order prior \nto the votes just described, the votes occur in a stacked sequence \nbeginning at 10:30 a.m., with 2 minutes prior to each vote for \nexplanation, and the first vote occur in relation to the Grassley \namendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Johnson \namendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following those votes, Senator \nHarkin be recognized to offer an amendment relative to education.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution on Wednesday, there be 35 \nhours remaining for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I make the \nfollowing statement for the information of all Senators. In light of \nthis agreement, there will be no further votes this evening. Any \nSenator with an interest in agriculture and agricultural issues is \nurged to remain tonight to debate the issue.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for working through this procedure in a fair way and an \nefficient way. We have used the time relatively well today.\n  We now have scheduled the next two amendments, or really three \namendments because there will be two first-degree amendments on \nagriculture and then we will go to an education amendment. We also are \nscheduled to vote on agriculture with time to debate that both this \nevening and tomorrow.\n  I want to send a clear message to those colleagues who are concerned \nabout agriculture, as the chairman described. My colleagues need to be \nhere tonight to discuss this issue because there will be limited time \ntomorrow morning. We will have only an hour and a half when we come \nback in tomorrow morning to conclude debate on this important set of \namendments.\n\n  If there are colleagues on either side of the aisle who are concerned \nabout agriculture and want to participate in that debate, they need to \nknow tonight affords the best opportunity because there will be limited \ntime tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously I am going to yield to my \noverused colleague who was asked to offer the last amendment because it \ncame within the jurisdiction of his Finance Committee. Tonight we ask \nthat he offer the Republican amendment, the bipartisan amendment on \nbehalf of agriculture, because he is an expert on agriculture and a lot \nof people listen attentively to what he has to say.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Grassley, and he can offer the amendment \nwe have been discussing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 174\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a fair and very generous \nbipartisan agricultural amendment. I am a family farmer. To be fair to \nmy son, my son makes most of the decisions and does most of the work; I \ntry to help him on weekends. I see my role on weekends as being a hired \nman for my son because I don't live with it every day as he does and I \nwant to rely upon his expertise. But I do have that background and I \nbring that background to my colleagues to show some understanding and \nsensitivity that we all ought to have toward the family farmer and \nagriculture in general.\n  I know what the agricultural community is currently going through. I \nthink the plan in this amendment will address the immediate needs to \nstabilize net income, provide enough funding to significantly \nstrengthen a future counter-cyclical program, offer additional money \nfor regulatory relief, enhance conservation efforts, and is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Some Members might wonder why it is tough to be a farmer in our \ncurrent agricultural community. Why, without Government assistance, net \nincome, cash income for the farm is projected to fall to $50.7 billion, \nwhich is $4.1 billion below the 1990 to 2000 average of $54.8 billion.\n  I will lay out some factors. First, input cost. Natural gas prices \nhave recently hit record highs, directly impacting farm fertilizer \nprices and availability. Almost all of the nitrogen we get for the \nrecord corn crops we raise in our State comes from anhydrous ammonia, \nmade from natural gas. The cost is passed through to the farmer.\n  Due to the past administration's inability to enact a workable energy \npolicy, farmers were left to cope with significant fluctuations in \nprice and demand. These fluctuations have dramatically increased the \ncost of hydrogen fertilizers and these increased input costs will \ncertainly have a substantial impact on corn producers across the Nation \nduring the coming growing season.\n  After input costs, it is legitimate to bring up the issue of \nregulations and their increase in costs. We have the Environmental \nProtection Agency preparing to implement new rules for concentrated \nanimal feeding operations which will impact an estimated 376,000 \nconfined livestock operations in our country. For example, the costs \nincurred for compliance for cattlemen could average well over $100,000 \nper farm. The costs would involve structural measures, engineering \nfees, and the development of a comprehensive nutrient management plan.\n  After regulations comes low commodity prices. These are probably the \nmost obvious of all things that people in the city read about regarding \nthe farm income situation. Today in my hometown of New Hartford, IA, \nwhere we deliver our corn and soybeans, the cash price for corn is \n$1.78 and $4.03 for soybeans. These are not lucrative margins. The lack \nof profitability and production hurts. Three years in a row of low \nprices--except for soybeans--are lower now than ever before. These low \nprices have been the rule for the last 3 years. These low prices can \nactually take some of the best farmers to the breaking point.\n  After low commodity prices, we have the frustration with the \ninternational trade of agricultural products. The European Union still \nspends a huge amount on agricultural export subsidies. These subsidies \nof the European Community are the most trade distorting, even trade \ndisruptive, of all agricultural policies. They depress the prices that \nwould otherwise apply to commercial trade. In so doing, they harm \nthe ability of our farmer to compete with European farmers in third \ncountry markets. They also reduce the incentive to engage in more \nefficient production.\n\n  The truth is, until we get the European Union to agree to reduce its \nexcessive spending on export subsidies, we will not be as competitive \nas we could be and should be in world agricultural markets. As a \nresult, our farmers will continue to get lower prices in world \nagricultural products as long as the American farmer is competing \nagainst the German treasury, as opposed to competing against the German \nfarmer. We can compete against that farmer, but it is very difficult to \ncompete against the German treasury.\n  The best way we can address this problem is to launch a comprehensive \nnew round of multilateral trade negotiations at the World Trade \nOrganization ministerial meeting in Qatar and engage the Europeans \ndirectly on this issue. Successfully launching a new round of global \ntrade talks is hardly a sure thing. We have a lot of work to do before \nwe can make this happen. I am not certain we have the necessary \ninternational political consensus on this point. Even if we were to \nadvance that new round right now, it would still be a few years before \nwe would see the economic impact, assuming--and you cannot always \nassume--that American agriculture will win at the bargaining table the \nway we hope we will win.\n  We do get victories. Over a period of time we have seen trade \ndistorting practices on agriculture and tariffs on agriculture come \ndown--quite frankly, not as much in the agricultural area as they have \ncome down in almost every other area of manufactured products and \nservices.\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\n  We have another trade frustration, and that is the country of China. \nCurrently, negotiations on China's access to the World Trade \nOrganization are stalled in Geneva because China is insisting on \nclaiming developing country status with respect to their agriculture. \nThis would mean that China would be entitled to exempt a higher \nproportion of trader distorting domestic support spending from the \nagreed upon caps on such spending than it would be if China is \nconsidered to be a developed nation.\n  Higher domestic support for agriculture and China would mean less \nexcess for American farm products to China. Although this is of \nprospective harm, not one we are facing immediately, it certainly will \nnot help our farmers if we don't get China to change its position. This \nisn't something for which we have to wait 5 years. These sorts of \nnegotiations of China's success to the World Trade Organization are \ngoing on at various times now or in certain periods of the near months \nwe are in and the months that have passed. This is something that China \nis going to have to agree to if they expect to get in the World Trade \nOrganization, that they are coming in as a developed nation to meet \nfully their responsibilities in the World Trade Organization, not \nbegging for some special treatment.\n  The list of factors affecting the agricultural economy does not \ndetail all of the reasons that our agricultural economy is failing. But \nit does lay out a number of good reasons why we should be concerned \nabout the strength of the family farms. Our amendment adds $63.5 \nbillion to agriculture's mandatory Commodity Credit Corporation price \nsupports, related programs, and conservation.\n\n  Adding this $63.5 billion to the existing $94.2 billion already in \nthe baseline will add up to $150.7 billion in the support for the \nagricultural economy over the next 10 years of this budget resolution. \nI believe the additional budget authority provided in the baseline will \nallow the Agriculture Committee to begin the process of establishing \nthe parameters for our next farm bill. In the interim, the $5 billion \nprovided in fiscal year 2001, the year we are in now, and the $7.35 \nbillion provided for economic assistance, will help farmers survive.\n  I know my friends and neighbors of Iowa need assistance and a better \ncounter-cyclical program; that is, improvements in the farm program. \nWhen we use the word ``counter-cyclical,'' that implies that there will \nnot have to be a dependence upon Congress from year to year voting \nadditional money, but there would be a program that would kick in under \ncircumstances of lower prices.\n  I also know we need to provide this assistance in a fashion that \nimproves our fiscal responsibility. Massive cash infusions are not the \nlong-term answer to the challenges facing the American farmer. The 1996 \nfarm bill was not created under the assumption that it was the only \ntire on the wagon. When we passed the 1996 bill, it was supposed to be \nsupported by tax relief and assistance, like the farmers savings \naccounts legislation that I have continuously introduced and was in a \nbill the President vetoed last year, and hopefully will be in a bill \nthe new President will sign.\n  In addition to that, we promised in 1996 increased trade \nopportunities but, in the period of time since then, we failed to pass \ntrade promotion authority for the President. We also took too long to \ngive farmers new and improved risk management options which, just last \nyear, 4 years late, after it was promised, we finally passed a new crop \ninsurance program.\n  Due to partisan opposition regarding free trade and tax relief, the \nonly additional wheel that has been placed on this wagon is this crop \ninsurance reform I talked about, and the Government was a long time \ngetting that passed. Any farmer knows if you only have two wheels on a \nfour-wheeled wagon, it does not roll along very well. So if there is, \nduring this debate, criticism of the 1996 farm bill--and there can be \nsome legitimate criticism of the 1996 farm bill--remember, it should \nnot be judged as the total product we promised the farmers in 1996 \nbecause what we provided for was a safety net. We found out 3 years \nlater that safety net had some holes in it. We had to pass in 1998, \n1999, and 2000, as we are doing now for the year 2001, some patching of \nthat safety net, not because that is something we knew needed to be \ndone in 1996, but because it was a promise that we made in 1996 that \nthere would be a safety net there for farmers, and the money that was \nprovided in 1996 for each of the next 7 years was not enough money. \nKeeping our promise to the family farmers, we enhanced that in 1998, \n1999, 2000, and we will do it again in 2001.\n\n  So if there is criticism of the 1996 farm bill, remember that we \nhave, in fashioning past farm bills, when there was a crisis we didn't \nanticipate when the bill was passed, we supplemented. Go back to 1985, \n1984, 1986, in that period of time when we put the ``payment in kind'' \nprogram in place. We did not anticipate using that, but because of the \nlow prices, we did.\n  We did not anticipate using paid diversions to take land out of \nproduction, but we used those. They were additional supplemental \npayments that were not anticipated.\n  So it does not matter whether it is the 1996 farm bill or the 1990 \nfarm bill or the 1985 farm bill or the 1981 farm bill. When you look \nahead 5 years, or as we did in 1996, 7 years, nobody expects you to \nanticipate all the problems farmers are going to have and write a bill \nthat is going to anticipate it all. But somehow I think people want to \nleave the impression that is what was intended in 1996. There isn't \nanybody who has that sort of clairvoyance. So, consequently, we have to \nact from time to time. That is exactly what we are doing here with this \namendment.\n  The other thing I do not want to hear criticism of is that we did not \ninclude the farmers savings account as was promised in 1996. We did not \ngive other trade opportunities as was promised in 1996. We did not \nprovide crop insurance in 1996 as we promised in 1996. We delivered on \nthat in the year 2000. And there are other issues as well. So we have \nto keep this in perspective.\n  We have to get those four wheels on the wagon so it rolls along well. \nAs chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am committed to \nproviding the much needed tax relief and expand the opportunities our \nfarmers need. But the Congress also made a pledge to family farmers \nthat they would experience this transition throughout the 1996 farm \nbill. The fact we could not get the wheels on the wagon, coupled with \nthe disastrous recession experienced by our eastern Asian trading \npartners, which triggered significant slumps in demand for our \nagricultural commodities has forced the Congress to provide assistance.\n  If during this period of time the Federal Reserve Board had been a \nlittle bit more concerned about liquidity as opposed to inflation, we \nwould have had a little easier and better time as well.\n  In addition, this amendment works hand in hand then with the $1.6 \ntrillion tax relief package we hope to pass through the Senate Finance \nCommittee. This tax cut package will help American farmers in several \nways. First and foremost, farmers generally do business as proprietors, \npartners, and in subchapter S corporations.\n  That means marginal rate cuts through this tax bill will help \nfarmers.\n  Second, many family farmers cannot pass on the farm to their children \nbecause of the death tax. The Bush tax cut would rid us of this death \ntax.\n  Finally, there are tax cuts such as the farmer savings accounts, to \nwhich I have already alluded three times, that will help farmers \nweather the downside of the cyclical business patterns of farming.\n  The assistance we provide should not lead to more problems for the \nfamily farmers. If government spending is fiscally irresponsible, we \nwill continue to witness artificial land prices and inflated cash \nrents. This doesn't serve the family farmer. It only makes it more \ndifficult for farmers who rent ground to make a profit.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I particularly thank \nSenator Miller of Georgia for his co-sponsorship of this amendment so \nthat it is in fact a bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment to the \nbudget resolution pertaining to agriculture to follow on the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa discussing the changes needed relative to \nagriculture itself. This amendment is cosponsored by my colleague, \nSenator Conrad of North Dakota.\n  This amendment will provide permanency of farm aid for this crop year \nand will increase the budget for the next 10 years so that Congress can \nbegin to fashion a new farm bill.\n  This amendment includes $9 billion in emergency farm assistance for \nfiscal year 2001 and $88 billion in additional agricultural assistance \nabove the Congressional Budget Office baseline over the years 2002 to \n2011, including a minimum of $9.4 billion for farm conservation \nprograms. This is roughly a 50-percent increase over the baseline \nfunding for conservation.\n  Finally, of the $88 billion in additional funds provided to \nagriculture during fiscal years 2002 through 2011, $58 billion is \nprovided for the fiscal years 2003 through 2007, assumed to be the \nfirst 5 years of the new farm bill and also the period when the need \nfor additional assistance, frankly, will be greatest.\n  We have found an immense shortcoming in the existing farm \nlegislation, and we have augmented that funding in recent years --3 \nyears in a row now--with ad hoc disaster legislation. We seek to make \nroom in this year's budget debate for the eventuality of the need for \nan additional augmentation to address this year's disaster in the same \nmanner as we have in the past years.\n  Frankly, the budget numbers contained in this amendment will be less \nthan what many of the farm organizations are coming to Washington \ncontending they will need. Nonetheless, it will assure the ability of \nCongress to address these issues both for the coming fiscal year and \nduring the duration of the coming farm bill.\n\n  I know there are those who will suggest that there is a contingency \nfund, and we can turn to that in the event those funds are needed. But \nthe contingency fund, as outlined by the President, consists largely of \nMedicare trust fund dollars. And secondly, the predictable demands on \nthose dollars--the need for increased spending for defense, for tax \nextenders, for alternative minimum tax reform, for pension reform, for \nany number of other issues which we know very well will need to be \nbrought up during this Congress--will more than overwhelm the \ncontingency fund. The responsible approach is, instead, to provide \nexplicitly for agriculture in the course of working up this budget \nresolution.\n  I believe there will be a significant tax cut. My constituents want a \ntax cut. I support a significant level of tax relief. But we need to \nmake sure, as we approach this budget resolution, that while on the one \nhand we do secure the funding necessary for significant tax cut relief, \nparticularly for middle-class and working families, at the same time we \nbalance it in a thoughtful fashion so that we are allowed to pay down \ndebt, strengthen Medicare, strengthen education, and, among other \nthings, take care of our needs in rural America.\n  Rural America has not prospered over this past decade in the way that \nmost of the rest of our Nation has. These have been growing times, \nprosperous times across much of America. Much of the rural side of our \nNation has struggled under population loss, under low incomes, under \nstaggeringly low agricultural prices, all at the same time input \ncosts--from fertilizer to fuel--have gone through the roof.\n  Farmers and ranchers all across our Nation have been caught in a \nterrible bind these last several years, and we need, in the course of \nputting together this budget resolution, to make sure we have provided \nthe necessary resources so that the Ag Committee can go on with the \nconstruction of a new farm bill and so we can avoid the uncertainty of \ndisaster relief in the coming year.\n  Since 1997, our Nation's family farmers have experienced a price \ncrisis of simply enormous proportions, perpetuated by a series of \nweather-related disasters in certain regions. Surplus crop production \nboth here and abroad, weak global demand--exports are down--\nagribusiness consolidation resulting in a loss of market access, and an \ninadequate farm safety net, all of these coming together are prime \nreasons, in my opinion, for what is a price crisis both in the grain \nsector and the livestock sector of our ag economy.\n  Moreover, given the input-intensive nature of production agriculture, \nmany farmers and ranchers are having to pay more each year for their \ncritical inputs. This situation has put them in a price-cost squeeze, \nmaking it nearly impossible to earn returns that cover their expenses.\n  As a result of woefully inadequate farm bill price protection, \nCongress has enacted multibillion-dollar disaster programs over the \nlast 3 years--in fact, a record $28 billion in fiscal year 2000. It \nshould be noted that direct Government payments accounted for around \nthree-fourths of net cash income from major field crops in 1999 and for \nabout two-thirds in the year 2000.\n  USDA predicts 2001 may be the worst year ever. Without supplemental \nincome or emergency aid, USDA estimates that net farm income in 2001 \ncould reach its lowest level since 1984-- the absolute depth of the \nfarm crisis in this Nation in recent generations.\n\n  That said, I am disappointed that the underlying budget resolution \ndoes not include funding for a new farm bill that will ensure economic \nsecurity for family farmers, ranchers, and rural communities now and \ninto the future. It is clear that the 1996 farm bill's promise to \ncreate a bridge to prosperity and less dependence upon Government \nassistance for farmers has been broken. Three years of costly ad hoc \ndisaster and economic aid programs illustrate the need to revise our \nfarm policy now and to do it in a financially responsible way.\n  I believe Congress can and should amend current farm policy \nimmediately to provide a more predictable and secure safety net for \nfamily farmers. Our amendment also will provide for that opportunity.\n  I am pleased to join the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, to include funding in the fiscal year 2002 budget \nresolution so that Congress can, in fact, enact changes to the \nunderlying farm bill and provide a more predictable and responsible \nsafety net for our farmers and ranchers throughout this Nation.\n  There will be tax relief, and there will be significant tax relief. \nBut while the President is correct that the budget surplus, to the \nextent that it exists, is the American people's money, it is also the \nAmerican people's farm problem, the American people's education \nproblem, the American people's debt reduction problem, the American \npeople's crisis in any number of other areas which must be addressed in \na thoughtful and responsible manner in the course of putting together \nthis budget resolution.\n  It is my hope, rather than this unending partisan head knocking that \nhas gone on here for far too long, that in fact we can reach some \nbipartisanship in the creation of this budget resolution which will set \nthe framework then for the budget and tax discussions for the remainder \nof this 107th Congress.\n  It makes no sense to me that there has been such a lack of \nwillingness to negotiate, such a lack of willingness to bring both \nsides together in a bipartisan fashion. What we have here is the \npeople's budget problem. It is one that is solvable if people of good \nfaith will work together in a constructive fashion, understanding there \nis give-and-take that will be necessary on both sides.\n  It seems to me what is not constructive, what is not helpful, is \nwhere either side takes a ``my way or the highway,'' ``nothing is \nnegotiable,'' ``one side has all the wisdom in the world'' kind of \napproach, either to agricultural policy or to any other aspect, any \nother component of the budget issues facing us in America today.\n  So I look forward to offering this amendment and to continuing debate \nin the future on the financial aspects of what will be required to \nbring rural America into the level of prosperity\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\nand opportunity that the rest of America has enjoyed and experienced \nover this past decade.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold the suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, I withdraw my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the underlying amendment offered by \nSenator Grassley from Iowa and the amendment that will be offered as a \ncounter to it is exactly what needs to be discussed when we talk about \nthe Federal budget. What are our priorities? What do we think is \nimportant in this country? What do we as Senators and Members of the \nHouse believe ought to be done? What ranks near the top?\n  We come, those of us from farm country, to the Congress saying family \nfarming is important to this country. We believe that family farming \ncontributes something very substantial to America; it always has. There \nwas an author who died some years ago named Critchfield who described \nwhat family farming provides to our country. He described the origin of \nfamily values coming from family farms, and rolling from family farms \nto small towns, to big cities, refreshing and nourishing the family \nvalues of our country. I believe that to be the case. I believe a \nnetwork of food producers across this country is important to this \ncountry's strength and its security.\n  Some take the position that it does not matter whether we have family \nfarmers. They say: Corporations will farm America. We don't need people \nliving out on the land. We have dairy operations in California that \nmilk 3,500 cows three times a day.\n  Those are agrifactories, not family farms. We have corporations that \nwill buy land and have tractors big enough to plow as far as you can \nsee. And, yes, they will produce America's food. But this country will \nhave lost something if we decide that family farming is not important \nin our future. It will have lost part of its culture and its heritage.\n  Europe has taken a different tack, a different road.\n  Europe has already decided family farms are important. They want \npeople to be able to live out on the land, to produce their food, and \nto be able to make a decent living producing their food. The result is, \nin rural Europe, farmers are doing well and small towns are thriving, \nas compared to this country where small towns are dying and family \nfarmers are struggling and rural economies are shrinking like prunes.\n  We have an opportunity in this country to decide what kind of future \nwe want, what kind of an economy we want.\n  In speaking about farming and its culture for a moment, I come from a \ntown of nearly 300 people. I graduated from a high school class of \nnine. In my hometown and towns similar to it all across the rural State \nof North Dakota, wonderful things result from a culture that is \nimportant to this country.\n  Let me give an example. In one community in North Dakota, a man and \nhis wife run a gas station, according to news reports. But they don't \nwant to work all day because they are of retirement age. So at about 1 \no'clock in the afternoon, they close their gas station, hang the key to \nthe gas pump on a nail by the door to their gas station, and also have \na pad there so if when they are closed you need gas, you take the key, \nunlock the pump, fill your car, and make a note that you have taken \ngas. Yes, that happens in America, in rural America, in a very small \ntown in North Dakota.\n  Another small town in North Dakota, as part of our rural culture, \ncan't keep a cafe open, a town restaurant. So they have all members of \nthe community who are able-bodied sign a sheet to say when they will \nwork for nothing to keep the restaurant open. That is the way they have \na restaurant in their town.\n  Another community had a grocery store close up, and so the city \ncouncil decided the town would build a grocery store. I was there the \nday they opened it with a high school band playing on Main Street in \nthis little town of Tuttle, ND, proud as the dickens at the new grocery \nstore they had built for themselves. Some would call it socialism \nbecause it is not a private grocery store. The town decided to put \ntogether a little nonprofit group, and they built their own grocery \nstore because they lost the store they had. Wonderful things happen in \nrural cultures where family farms support small towns.\n  In my home county, some long while ago, there was a robbery. In my \nlittle town a robbery is almost unheard of. It prompted the county \nsheriff, after investigating, to say that there had been no sign of \nforced entry for the cash that was stolen because the people had gone \non vacation for 2 weeks and had not locked their home. Let me repeat \nthat. The people had gone on vacation for 2 weeks and had not locked \ntheir home. Why? Because they didn't have a key for their home in any \nevent.\n  The county sheriff of my home county put out a missive to all the \nfolks in the county saying, if you are going to vacation, you should \nconsider locking your home. And a good many people in my hometown said \nthat was a real problem because they didn't have locks. Then he said \nsomething very radical. He said: When you park your vehicle on the main \nstreet in Hettinger County, you should consider taking the keys out of \nthe vehicle. A couple of ranchers observed to the county newspaper that \nthey wondered what if people needed to use their pickup trucks. That \nhappens in rural America. That is a rural culture. That is something \nthat is important. That comes from family farms dotting the landscape, \nproviding the economic blood vessels by which small towns survive and \nthrive.\n  In this country all too often family farmers are hanging on by their \nfingertips, struggling during tough times with collapsed commodity \nprices. Small towns are shrinking and dying all across this country.\n\n  I have a map that I haven't brought to the floor. I will bring it to \nthe floor when I offer an amendment in a couple of days that shows the \ncounties in this country that have lost 10 percent of their population \nin the last 25 years. It is blocked out in red. It is a big egg-shaped \narea from North Dakota down to Texas. We are depopulating rural \nAmerica. The middle part of America is losing its population, a century \nafter we homesteaded rural America, a century after we told people: You \ngo out and if you take 160 acres of land and improve that land and \nbuild a farm, we will give you the 160 acres. That was under the \nHomestead Act. That is how people went to the Dakotas at that time. \nThat is how my great-grandmother went there with four kids after her \nhusband had a heart attack. She went to Hettinger County, ND, and \npitched a tent, built a home, and created a farm, and the Government \ngave her 160 acres of land under the Homestead Act. That is the way we \npopulated rural America.\n  Now that county, as virtually every other county in America, is \nshrinking like a prune because farmers can't make a living when prices \ncollapse and prices have gone down and down and stayed down.\n  Now the question is, Does this Congress care? Does this country care? \nAre we going to, in public policy, decide that family farmers matter, \nthat we want our food produced with a broad network of food producers, \nfamilies living out there with the yard light shining on a yard and \ncontributing to a culture of the type I have just described that is \nsomething unique and wonderful in this country or are we going to take \nthe position that some take that the family farm is similar to the \nlittle old diner that got left behind when the interstate came through \nand we have fond memories of it--but so long.\n  I hope this Congress decides that family farmers matter to this \ncountry. The space between New York and Los Angeles is not just air \ntime. It is a lot of good country. When you get to the middle of \nAmerica, you find a lot of good people. They struggle to produce crops \nagainst all the odds.\n  Some say: Why do you need something special for farmers? Farmers are \nno different than the hardware store in town. But farmers are very \ndifferent. A farmer borrows money to put a seed in the ground in the \nspring, borrows money to fuel the tractor to put that seed in the \nground, and then fertilizes\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nthat seed and hope it grows. If it grows, it is good luck, that crop. \nIf it grows, it is good luck for the farmer. But it might get eaten by \ninsects, it might be destroyed by hail, disease, all number of elements \nover which farmers have no control can affect that crop. And perhaps if \nthe farmer is lucky enough to take that crop off in the fall and haul \nit to an elevator, in a world in which nearly half the people are \nhungry, the grain trade now tells that farmer the food you struggled to \nraise has no value.\n  Think of that. In a world in which 500 million people go to bed with \na severe ache in their belly every night because it hurts to be hungry \nand in a world in which half the people don't have enough to eat, our \nfarmers are told their food has no value. It somehow is not a national \nasset. There is something fundamentally bankrupt about that kind of \nthought.\n  My point on this amendment and on this bill is this: Are we going to \nkeep skipping around here, just sort of doing enough to avoid the \ncharge that we are not doing anything or is this Congress going to \ndecide that one of its priorities is to do something to help family \nfarmers so we have family farmers in our future? Does agriculture or \nfamily farming matter? We will see.\n\n  We know what matters to some. We know to some the only thing that \nmatters is a $1.6 trillion tax cut. I am for tax cuts. It is not \nexactly political heavy lifting to be for tax cuts. That is zero \ngravity in politics. You want to go out and say you are for tax cuts. \nThat is not exactly heavy lifting. I am for tax cuts. I am not for $1.6 \ntrillion. I am not for taking money out of the Medicare trust fund in \norder to do it. I am not for tax cuts at the expense of education or \nfamily farming. I am not for tax cuts at the expense of paying down the \ndebt. I am for tax cuts that make sense for our country, that allow us \nalso to pay down the Federal debt, to improve our schools, to help our \nfarmers, and to do the other things we need to do in this country to \nmake this a good place in which to live.\n  This is all about priorities and balance. We are going to have a \ncouple of amendments offered on the issue of funding agriculture. One \nis going to be short. The other, shorter than I would like, will \naddress this issue in a much more robust way. We can choose what is our \npriority.\n  Look in the rear-view mirror a few years and dig out the debate in \nthe Congressional Record that preceded the most recent debate on \nFreedom to Farm. See who said what. Those who said they were friends of \nfamily farmers said we were headed towards nirvana; I see a day in the \ngolden sunset in which farmers will no longer be dependent on the \nGovernment and we will have robust, aggressive, decent prices for \nfamily farm products all across the country; farmers will be able to \nmake a good living.\n  They said that when wheat was $5.50 a bushel. And they put in place a \nfarm program that said: We have a new theory. Our theory is, we don't \nneed countercyclical help for farmers. When we have a price valley, let \nfarmers fall into the valley. We don't need a bridge across that price \nvalley.\n  So Congress passed that legislation. I didn't vote for it. Congress \npassed that legislation. The price of wheat collapsed, from $5 right \noff the table. It just flat collapsed.\n  Every single year since that time, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill \nhas been demonstrated a failure. It doesn't work. We are going to \ntransition for 7 years with transition payments or so-called AMTA \npayments out of any kind of support for family farmers. That never made \nsense. If a country says family farming doesn't matter, then that is \nthe route to take. But I expect most in this country believe family \nfarming matters a great deal. Certainly most in this Chamber profess \nthey believe that.\n  If that is the case, let us finally put together a farm program that \nworks. Let's stop shadowboxing. This is all political shadowboxing. \nLet's decide this is a priority. And on this day and in this way, we \nwill put together a program that works, something that says to family \nfarmers: You matter, too. You are part of our future. We care about \nfamily farming.\n  I am not going to be apologetic for saying this is important to my \nState and to our region of the country. This is important to our entire \nNation.\n  As I indicated when I began, Europe has already made this decision, \nand good for them. This country ought to as well. Europe long ago \ndecided they were hungry once and they will not be again.\n  How do you make certain you are not hungry? You make certain you have \na network of food producers dotting the land, family farms producing \nAmerica's food--in this case, producing Europe's food. You decide you \nare going to pay people who work hard on family farms a decent return \non that which they produce.\n  As I said earlier, it is inconceivable to me that which we produce in \nsuch great abundance and that which the world needs so desperately--\nfood, coming from our family farms--is deemed to have so little value \nby the grain trade.\n  Part of this is an issue some of us will work on together as well, \nand that is all the monopolies in every direction farmers face. Do you \nwant to put your grain on a railroad? Guess what. The railroads are in \nmonopoly or near monopoly. They are very few. They will tell you where \nyou are going to be and what they are going to charge.\n  Do you want to sell your grain? It does not matter what kind of \nmilling you are talking about selling it into. The top three or four \nfirms are going to control almost all of them.\n  Do you have some animals you want to sell--fat steers or hogs? Sell \nthem into the production cycle, and guess what. Two, three, or four \nfirms are going to control 70 or 80 percent of all of the processing.\n  In every direction farmers face monopolies. They have their fist \naround the neck of the marketing bottle in a way that chokes family \nfarmers every single way. We need to do something about that. It is \ntime for this country to stand up for some antitrust enforcement and \nbust some trusts and break some monopolies.\n  Today we are talking about the priorities. With this budget, what are \nwe committing to decide we are going to have a nation of family farmers \nin our future? I hope we will make the decision to do enough.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Iowa is short. It is not \nenough. It does not meet the needs. In any case, it comes from, in \nlarge part, the so-called contingency fund. David Copperfield is on \ntelevision with his special, talking about illusions. He has his match \nin this Chamber with respect to illusions. We have been hearing about \nthis mythical contingency fund for hours and hours, and we will hear \nabout it all week. It is an illusion.\n  To the extent any part of it is real, a significant part comes from \nthe Medicare trust fund which was supposed to have been in a lockbox. \nSo now we are talking about Houdini, not David Copperfield, because \nsomebody opened the lockbox and put it in the so-called contingency \nfund.\n  We can do a lot better than that. Let us decide this is a priority, \nthat family farmers matter, that family farmers are a priority for this \ncountry, and fund it the way it should be funded. We should reject the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa and accept the amendment to \nbe offered by my colleague from South Dakota and my colleague from \nNorth Dakota tonight or tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a place where we have some \nfundamental agreement and yet some disagreement on how to accomplish \nthe goal.\n  We face a crisis in American agriculture. It is deep, it is abiding, \nand it is devastating.\n  Let me put up a chart that shows what USDA tells us will happen to \nnet farm income in the period from 2000 to 2002, the last 2 years on \nthis chart. One can see that net farm income is going to plunge unless \nwe take action.\n  Senator Grassley is to be commended for taking action by offering his \namendment. I disagree with some of the specifics, but I commend him for \nstanding up for American agriculture at a time of extreme need.\n  The next chart shows what our major competitors are doing in \ncomparison to what we are doing to support our producers.\n  The European Union, our biggest competitors in world agriculture, is \nproviding $313 an acre of support per\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nyear to their producers. By comparison, we are providing $38 an acre \nfor our producers. Europe is doing nearly 10 to 1 over and above what \nwe are doing--nearly 10 to 1. Those are the very difficult \ncircumstances our farmers face.\n  We are telling our farmers: You go out there and compete against the \nFrench farmer and the German farmer, and while you are at it, take on \nthe French Government and the German Government as well.\n  That is not a fair fight.\n  That is just the first part of the equation. Let us go to export \nassistance. This chart shows that the European Union is flooding the \nworld with agricultural export subsidies. The blue part of this chart \nis the European share of world agricultural export assistance. One can \nsee the Europeans account for 83.5 percent of all the world's \nagricultural export subsidies. The U.S. share is that little red piece \nof the pie, 2.7 percent.\n  The Europeans are outgunning us on export assistance 30 to 1--10 to 1 \non domestic support, internal support, and 30 to 1 on export \nassistance. We wonder why American agriculture is in trouble. We worry \nwhy Europe is gaining world market share. It is very clear if one does \nan analysis of why that is occurring. It is because they are providing \nmuch greater assistance to their producers than we are to ours.\n  Let us go to the next chart. Here is the history from 1991 to the \nyear 2000. The green line is the prices farmers pay for inputs. That \nline goes up, up, and away. The red line is the prices farmers have \nreceived.\n  One can see that the peak of what farmers received was in 1996, right \nbefore we enacted the last farm bill. Since then, prices farmers have \nreceived have gone down, almost straight down.\n  The gap between the prices farmers pay and the prices on what they \nsell is growing, is dramatic, and is devastating. That is what has led \nto the crisis in American agriculture. That is what requires a \nresponse. That is why the Senator from Iowa is proposing this \namendment. That is why we will propose an alternative that we think is \nsuperior, that is better, that has more funding because, very frankly, \nwhat the Senator from Iowa has offered is inadequate: $63.5 billion \nover 11 years will not come close to matching what the Europeans are \ndoing. It will not come close.\n  Our amendment provides $97 billion over that 11-year period. We fund \nit in the first year, in the current budget year, out of the surplus \nand in the succeeding years out of the President's proposed tax cut. We \nwould reduce the size of his tax cut slightly to provide additional \nsupport to agriculture.\n  Why don't we adopt the proposal of Senator Grassley? Very simply \nbecause once again the proposal he is offering goes right into the \nMedicare trust fund to provide support for agriculture.\n  This next chart shows year by year. This is the problem I addressed \non prescription drugs. It repeats itself. These are the year-by-year \nnumbers in the Republican budget. In the year 2005, they only have $7 \nbillion available without going into the Medicare trust fund. The next \nyear they only have $12 billion available.\n\n  Senator Grassley's proposal spends $9 billion in the year 2005 for \nthis package. He is going into the Medicare trust fund to provide the \nresources for agriculture. We say, no. We want to provide the resources \nfor agriculture. We have an amendment at the desk to do it. We provide \n50 percent more so we can come close to matching our major competitors, \nthe Europeans. We say, no, we are not going to tap the Medicare trust \nfund to do it. We are not going to tap the Social Security trust fund \nor the Medicare trust fund for any other purpose, we don't care how \nlaudatory. We think it is wrong.\n  If any company in America tried to tap the retirement funds of their \nemployees or the health care trust funds of their employees, they would \nbe headed to a Federal institution, but it would not be the U.S. \nCongress. They would be headed to a Federal institution. They would be \nheaded for a stretch. It is illegal. You can't raid the trust funds if \nyou run a company. You can't raid the retirement funds of your \nemployees. You can't raid the health care trust funds of your \nemployees, and we shouldn't either. We have stopped this practice the \nlast 3 years and we shouldn't take it back up. We ought to draw a \nbright line and say no raiding of the Social Security trust fund, no \nraiding of the Medicare trust fund, not in any year.\n  That is why we have a different proposal. Our proposal says very \nclearly, yes, additional assistance to agriculture and substantially \nmore than is in the Grassley plan. We have $97 billion over 11 years; \nhe has $64 billion over 11 years. I think the more important difference \nis we will not raid the Medicare trust fund to do it. In the first \nyear, this current fiscal year, we take it out of the $96 billion of \nnontrust fund surplus that is available, and in the succeeding years, \nwe take it by reducing slightly the President's proposed tax cut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 176\n\n(Purpsoe: To provide emergency assistance to producers of agricultural \n  commodities in fiscal year 2001, and additional funds for farm and \n      conservation programs during fiscal years 2002 through 2011)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, the only way to resolve the current crisis \nin American-Chinese relations is the prompt and safe return of the 24 \nAmerican airmen now being detained by the Chinese military on Hainan \nIsland and by the swift return of the U.S. Navy's plane. Only after \ntheir return can we begin to discuss other issues with China over this \nand other incidents affecting our relations.\n  I am deeply disturbed by the delay in allowing American embassy \npersonnel to meet with our service personnel, and I am concerned about \npress reports that they are being detained in separate areas. I \nunderstand our bilateral consular agreement requires the Chinese to \nprovide full access to American citizens within four days but nothing \nprecludes them from giving such access sooner. Indeed our consular \nagreement with China requires consular access to all American citizens \nwithin 48 hours of receipt of official notification of their detention. \nAs Chinese officials issued statements concerning their detention on \nApril 1, China may already be in violation of its consular agreement \nwith us. The fact that American consular officials are already present \non Hainan Island and the extraordinary circumstances surrounding our \nplane's emergency landing on Hainan provide the Chinese authorities \nwith an opportunity to demonstrate their good will.\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n  Press reports that Chinese personnel have entered our plane and \nremoved equipment are also deeply disturbing. Under international law, \nthe plane enjoys sovereign immune status as the incident took place in \ninternational air space and the plane should not have been entered or \ntampered with. There is no doubt about the location of the incident as \neven the Chinese Foreign Ministry press spokesman, Mr. Zhu Bang Zao, \nacknowledged that it took place 104 kilometers, or 65 miles, at sea.\n  This incident is the most recent in a series of serious episodes in \nAmerican-Chinese relations since the establishment of diplomatic \nrelations between our two countries. When the Chinese embassy was \nmistakenly bombed in Belgrade, we moved quickly to assume \nresponsibility and to make appropriate amends. I hope that the Chinese \nare now willing to take similar steps to defuse the situation and \nrestore the trust necessary between two great nations. It behooves both \ncountries to exercise restraint and respect for each other. The first \nstep towards resolution is for China to release our detained personnel \nand equipment. Perhaps they do not realize how profoundly affected \nAmericans are by the perception that their fellow citizens are being \nmistreated or misused as tools of political propaganda. The seizure of \nthe U.S.S. Pueblo by North Korea and the takeover of the American \nEmbassy in Iran, as examples, remain sores in the American psyche. We \ndeeply resent the mistreatment of Americans for simply being Americans \ndoing their duty under the protection of international law and \nagreements. We can also understand China's concern over the loss of its \npilot and plane. We regret their loss but prolonging this crisis can \nbenefit neither country nor lead to a reconciliation between us.\n  A first step needs to be taken. I hope the leaders of our two \ncountries do so soon by opening a direct dialogue. May God bless our \nservicemen and women who are now suffering this time of trial. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with them constantly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3334-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3334-S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday, at long last, the United States \nSenate voted to take a first step toward reforming our campaign finance \nsystem. This long awaited vote comes after years of partisan delay \ntactics which have long prevented us from taking an up-or-down vote on \nthis bill. It also comes after an election in which $3 billion was \nspent in an effort to elect or defeat candidates. Today we have the \nchance to pass reform which at the very least demonstrates that we've \nlearned a lesson from years of scandal and year upon year of runaway \nspending.\n  But let me be clear about something: despite the rhetoric we have \nheard on the Senate floor, the bill we vote on today is not sweeping \nreform that will give one party or the other the edge when it comes to \nfunding campaigns. Instead, this bill simply restores, to a certain \ndegree, the campaign finance reform laws that we enacted more than 25 \nyears ago. Back then, in the post-Watergate era, we recognized that it \nwas time to prevent secret stashes of cash from infiltrating our \npolitical system. We succeeded in that effort, and I believe the system \nworked reasonably well for some time, until the recent phenomena of \nsoft money and sham issue advocacy overtook the real limits we had \nestablished for our campaign system.\n  I want to take a minute, to talk about how we got to this point in \nwhich our system so desperately needs this modest reform bill. Federal \nlaw has prohibited corporations from contributing to federal candidates \nsince 1907. This nearly hundred-year-old ban was enacted in recognition \nof the fact that corporations accumulate great wealth that could be \nused to distort electoral outcomes. Labor unions likewise have been \nbarred from contributing to candidates since 1943. In addition, the \npost-Watergate campaign finance law capped individual contributions to \ncandidates, parties and PACs. These limits were put in place after the \ncountry learned a hard lesson about the corrupting influence of money \nin politics.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Election Commission and the courts opened \nthe loopholes that ultimately eviscerated our reform efforts. Soft \nmoney first came into play in 1978 when the FEC, the toothless watchdog \nof our campaign finance laws, opened the door to the cascade of soft \nmoney by giving the Kansas Republican State Committee permission to use \ncorporate and union funds to pay for a voter drive benefitting federal \nas well as state candidates. The costs of the drive were to be split \nbetween hard money raised under federal law and soft money raised under \nKansas law. The FEC's decision in the Kansas case gave parties the \noption to spend soft money any time a federal election coincides with a \nstate or local race.\n  Sham issue advocacy too, has a history that defies the intent of \ncampaign finance laws. In what remains the seminal case on campaign \nfinance, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that campaign finance \nlimitations applied only to ``communications that in express terms \nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for \nfederal office.'' A footnote to the opinion says that the limits apply \nwhen communications include terms ``such as `vote for,' `elect,' \n`support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote \nagainst,' `defeat,' `reject.' '' The phrases in the footnote have \nbecome known as the ``magic words'' without which a communication, no \nmatter what its purpose or impact, is often classified as issue \nadvocacy, thus falling outside the reach of the campaign finance laws.\n  Until the 1992 election cycle, most for-profit, not-for-profit, and \nlabor organizations did not attempt to get into electoral politics via \nissue advocacy. However, that year a group called the Christian Action \nNetwork ran an ad that stretched the distinction between express \nadvocacy and issue advocacy to its limits. The ad, which was broadcast \nat least 250 times just before the presidential election, was described \nby a court as giving candidate Bill Clinton a ``sinister and \nthreatening appearance'' before finally wiping his image from the \nscreen. The 30-second spot, entitled ``Clinton's Vision for a Better \nAmerica,'' denounced what the Christian Action Network labeled \nClinton's ``homosexual agenda.'' The ad never used Buckley's ``magic \nwords'' and the Court of Appeals decided that the ad was a discussion \nof issues related to ``family values'' rather than an exhortation to \nvote against Clinton in the upcoming presidential election.\n  The ad by the Christian Action Network and others like it opened the \nflood gates to more so-called issue advocacy in later elections, \nresulting in the half-a-billion dollars in sham issue ads that \ninfluenced the 2000 elections.\n  Soft money and sham issue advocacy became predominant features of our \ncampaign finance system even though neither was intended to play a role \nin our campaigns when the post-Watergate reform laws were written. The \nresult? Last year approximately $1 billion in soft money contributions \nand sham issue ad expenditures influenced our federal elections. Many \nwho oppose reform will argue that both soft money and sham issue ads \nare constitutionally protected and should be allowed to continue \nunfettered. I would like to take just a moment to address those \narguments.\n  We have been told that the ability to donate hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in soft money is constitutionally protected. The truth is, \nbanning soft money contributions does not violate the Constitution. The \nSupreme Court in Buckley held that limits on individual campaign \ncontributions do not violate the First Amendment. If a limit of $1000 \non contributions by individuals was upheld as constitutional, then a \nban of contributions of $10,000, $100,000 or $1 million is also going \nto be upheld. It simply cannot be said that the First Amendment \nprovides an absolute prohibition of any and all restrictions on speech. \nWhen state interests are more important than unfettered free speech, \nspeech can be narrowly limited. Speech is limited in cases of false \nadvertising and obscenity. In addition, we are not, as the saying goes, \nfree to yell ``fire'' in a crowded movie theater. In those cases, there \nis a compelling reason to limit speech. Buckley, too, said that the \nrisk of corruption or the appearance of corruption warranted limits on \nindividual campaign contributions. Soft money contributions to \npolitical\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\nparties can be limited for the same reason.\n  In addition, in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri PAC, the Supreme Court \nrecently justified its decision to uphold a $1050 contribution limit \nfor elections in Missouri, stating that it was concerned with ``the \nbroader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large \ncontributors.'' It went on to say: ``Leave the perception of \nimpropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption that large donors \ncall the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part \nin democratic governance.'' I think the Supreme Court's language bodes \nwell for the likelihood that a soft money ban will be upheld.\n\n  Likewise, I believe that the electioneering provisions of the bill \nwill be upheld. It's a trickier case, but I would submit that the \nbright line test in McCain-Feingold satisfies the Supreme Court's \nholding in Buckley. The so-called ``magic words'' test of express \nadvocacy has come to provide what is a wholly unworkable test that I \nbelieve was never the intention of the Court. The magic words test \nelevates form over substance, and in practice has proven meaningless. \nThe proof of that is in the half-a-billion dollars in sham issue ads \nthat were aired last year.\n  I would add that the test in this bill does not stop any \nadvertisements. Advertisements that simply discuss issues, without \nnaming candidates are always permissible. Advertisements that air \nwithin 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election can \ndiscuss issues, as long as the ads do not depict a particular \ncandidate. And any advertisement can be aired at any time, as long as \nit is paid for with hard money.\n  A final argument opponents of reform like to make is that we spend \nless on campaigns than we do on potato chips or laundry detergent. But \nI would ask the proponents of this argument whether what we are seeking \nin our democracy is electioneering that has no more depth or substance \nthan a snack food commercial. Because, despite the ever-increasing sums \nspent on campaigns, we have not seen an improvement in campaign \ndiscourse, issue discussion or voter education. More money does not \nmean more ideas, more substance or more depth. Instead, it means more \nof what voters complain about most. More thirty-second spots, more \nnegativity and an increasingly longer campaign period. Less money might \nactually improve the quality of discourse, requiring candidates to more \ncautiously spend their resources. It might encourage more debates, as \nwas the case in my own race against Bill Weld in 1996, and it would \ncertainly focus the candidates' voter education efforts during the \nperiod shortly before the election, when most voters are tuned in, \ninstead of starting the campaign 18 months before election day.\n  The American people don't buy the arguments made by opponents of \nreform. The American people want us to forge a better system. A \nnational survey conducted by the Mellman Group in April of last year \nfound that by a margin of 68 percent to 19 percent, voters favored a \nproposal that eliminates private contributions, sets spending limits \nand gives qualifying candidates a grant from a publicly financed \nelection fund. That same survey also found that 59 percent of voters \nagree that we need to make major changes to the way we finance \nelections. But perhaps the most telling statistic from this survey is \nthat overwhelming majorities think that special interest contributions \naffect the voting behavior of Members of Congress. Eighty-seven percent \nof voters believe that money impacts Members of Congress, with 56 \npercent expressing the belief that if affects the members ``a lot.'' \nEven when asked about their own representatives, the survey again found \nthat voters overwhelmingly believed that money influenced their \nbehavior. Eighty-two percent believe campaign contributions affect \ntheir own members, and 47 percent thought their representatives were \naffected ``a lot.''\n  McCain-Feingold is an important piece of legislation that begins to \ntackle the problems of soft money and issue advocacy I have outlined. I \nsupport this legislation, but I would note one serious shortcoming of \nthe bill. It won't curb the rampant spending that drives the quest for \nmoney. Unfortunately, we all recognize that creating spending limits is \nnot a simple proposition. In the 1996 Buckley case, the Supreme Court \nstruck spending limits as an unconstitutional restriction of political \nspeech. An important caveat to its decision is that spending limits \ncould be imposed in exchange for a public benefit. I wish we had at our \ndisposal a number of bargaining chips, public benefits that we could \ntrade in exchange for spending limits. However, unless the Supreme \nCourt reverses itself, something I am certainly not expecting in the \nnear future, we must accept that if we want to limit the amounts spent \non campaigns, we must provide candidates with some sort of public \ngrant.\n  The votes we have taken on various amendments addressing public \nfunding make it clear that a lot of my colleagues aren't ready to \nembrace public funding as a way to finance our campaigns. But it is, in \nmy opinion, the best constitutional means to the important end of \nlimiting campaign spending and the contributions that go with it. \nUltimately, I believe in the potential of a system that provides full \npublic funding for political candidates. I would also support a partial \npublic funding system, such as the one I offered in an amendment to \nthis legislation. That amendment would have freed candidates from the \nneed to raise unlimited amounts of money by providing with ``liberty \ndollars'' in the form of a two-for-one match for small contributions, \nin exchange for the candidates agreeing to abide by spending limits. I \nbelieve that any system that reduces candidates' reliance on private \nmoney and encourages them to abide by spending limits will ultimately \nbe the best way to truly and completely purge our system of the \nnegative influence of corporate money.\n  Many of our states are already engaging in a grand experiment to see \nif full or partial public funding of campaigns serves the goals of \nreform. At the state level, politicians are learning that the cost of \ncampaigns can be capped without reducing the effectiveness of a \ncampaign. Challengers are becoming more competitive as their campaigns \nare infused with public money. Incumbents are learning that they can \nspend less time fundraising and more time governing if they avail \nthemselves to public campaign funds. And our citizens are learning that \ntheir faith in the political process can be restored as money no longer \nappears to influence the political process.\n  I am pleased that my home state of Massachusetts is one of the states \nthat is experimenting with a Clean Money, Clean Elections law. The law, \nwhich voters adopted by referendum in 1998, will go into effect this \nyear and will provide candidates for state office with full public \nfunding if they agree to abide by spending limits. A recent survey of \nvoters across the state found that three-fourths support the law. I am \noptimistic that the majority will grow after the law is put to its \nfirst test during the upcoming elections.\n  It seems that Clean Money, Clean Elections laws are off to a good \nstart in the states. But we need to know more about how well these \nprograms work. That is why I am pleased that the managers of this bill \naccepted an amendment I offered that will require the GAO to examine \nthe impact of Clean Money, Clean Elections laws in states where they \nhave been enacted. Specifically, my amendment will require the GAO to \ndetermine more about the candidates who have chosen to run for public \noffice using Clean Money, Clean Elections funds. It will provide us \nwith concrete figures on which offices attract Clean Money, Clean \nElections candidates, whether incumbents choose to use clean money, and \nthe success rate of Clean Money candidates.\n\n  In addition, the GAO will be able to determine whether Clean Money, \nClean Elections programs reduced the cost of campaigns, increased \ncandidate participation or created more competitive primary or general \nelections.\n  We should encourage states to experiment with reform. I believe an \nobjective study as required by this amendment will better enable \nleaders at the state level to evaluate the Clean Money, Clean Elections \noption. In the end, we may all learn that there is an important role \nfor public financing in state and ultimately federal elections.\n  As I said before, this bill, which bans soft money, regulates sham \nissue ads, and provides a study for public funding systems provides a \ngood first start to\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nreform, and I will therefore support it. I have one serious reservation \nabout the bill, however, and that is its increase in the hard money \nlimits. Although I fully understand the argument that the limits have \nnot kept up with inflation, I am concerned that the increases in \nindividual limits and, most especially, aggregate limits, do not take \nus in the right direction of decreasing the amount of money in \nelections. Moreover, this increase simply enables the tiniest \npercentage of the population that currently contributes large \ncontributions to contribute even more. This increase does nothing at \nall to increase the role the average voter plays in our election \nprocess.\n  Nevertheless, the vote yesterday is a victory for reform--but it \nneeds to be the first vote, not the last. I want to offer my \ncongratulations to my friends Russell Feingold and John McCain on this \nvictory for reform, passage of a bill that breaks free from the status \nquo and will help us restore the dwindling faith the average American \nhas in our political system. For too long we've known that we can't go \non leaving our citizens with the impression that the only kind of \ninfluence left in American politics is the kind you wield with a \ncheckbook. This bill reduces the power of the checkbook and I am proud \nto support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3336-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STATEMENT OF INTENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, the Josephson Institute of Ethics, a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit organization, recently released its survey on \nviolence and substance abuse in the United States. The survey finds \nthat a disturbing number of young people have easy access to guns and \nhave brought those guns and other weapons to school in the past year.\n  According to those surveyed, 47 percent of all high school students \nand 22 percent of all middle school students reported having easy \naccess to guns. Of those students who reported drinking at school in \nthe past 12 months, those with easy access to guns jumped to an \nastonishing 71 percent for high school students and 59 percent for \nmiddle school students.\n  Furthermore, 14 percent of high school students and 11 percent of \nmiddle school students admitted that they brought weapons to school in \nthe past 12 months. Again, those numbers increased dramatically among \nstudents who also reported drinking at school at some point in the last \nyear to 48 percent for high school students and 57 percent for middle \nschool students.\n  Easy access to guns among our young people is dangerous, but access \nto guns paired with access to alcohol or drugs is recipe for disaster. \nAnd while the vast majority of students will be safe in their \nclassrooms, our youth's easy access to firearms makes 36 percent of \nhigh school students and 39 percent of middle school students feel \nunsafe at school. Unfortunately, unless Congress and acts to curb youth \naccess to guns, in some cases, that fear may become a reality for more \nand more students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3336-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRESSMAN NORMAN SISISKY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to the \nmemory of my dear friend, Congressman Norman Sisisky. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I was shocked and saddened at hearing the news of his \nsudden passing last Friday. We have lost a respected and treasured \ncolleague; the people of Virginia have lost one of the most committed \nand effective men ever to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives; \nand America has lost a distinguished member of what Tom Brokaw has \ncalled ``the greatest generation.''\n  Norm Sisisky was a classic example of the devoted public official our \nfounders envisioned serving in ``the people's house.'' For Norm was a \nman of the people, someone who worked hard, played by the rules and \nmaintained a steadfast commitment to his family and community.\n  That he excelled in politics is no surprise to those of us who knew \nhim. He genuinely liked and respected people and they returned that \nwith the trust and affection. His trademark grin and infectious laugh \ndrew people to him. Norm never took himself too seriously, and always \ntook great delight in good-natured banter.\n  But he did take his job seriously. He was an aggressive advocate for \nhis constituents in Virginia's 4th Congressional district for the past \n18 years. He never forgot his roots, and never wavered in his \ncommitment to fighting for the little guy, and he never lost sight of \nhis role as their voice in our great system.\n  But of all his many and important public accomplishments, Norm \nSisisky was probably proudest of his service in the U.S. Navy, and of \nhis advocacy in Congress for our servicemen and women. Those of us who \nhave had the privilege of watching Norm battle on behalf of our armed \nservices from his position on the House Armed Services Committee were \nalways impressed by his extensive knowledge and his keen insight. And \nwe were inspired by his determination to keep our defenses strong, even \nif we in the Senate occasionally had to face his formidable presence in \ndisagreement in conference.\n  I will forever remember Norm Sisisky as a man of considerable skill, \ndevotion, humor, and honor. He leaves behind a loving family, devoted \nfriends, and a strong nation. That is his proud legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3336-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, as we welcome the blooms of spring this \nApril, we should also take a moment to focus on the well-being of our \nmost precious resource, our children. Since 1983, April has been \nnationally recognized as Child Abuse Prevention Month. Since then, \norganizations like Prevent Child Abuse America have been passionate \nadvocates for our children and have raised awareness of this egregious \nproblem. In my own state of Wisconsin, the local chapter of Prevent \nChild Abuse America in Madison has been an effective leader in the \nfight against child abuse.\n  Child abuse is an urgent national problem. According to Prevent Child \nAbuse America, more than three million children were reported to child \nprotective service agencies as alleged victims of child abuse or \nneglect in 1998, and about one million of these reports were confirmed. \nAnd these numbers just reflect those cases that were reported. \nUndoubtedly, many more cases go unreported.\n  Child abuse is not only physical harm, but it can also include \nemotional abuse and mental damage resulting from physical abuse. The \ndocumented physical and emotional harm to children includes chronic \nhealth problems, low self-esteem, physical disabilities, and the \ninability to form healthy relationships with others.\n  Protecting our children should be a national priority. I urge my \ncolleagues and others to support child abuse prevention efforts to \nprotect our nation's greatest resource, our children. Working together, \nwe can help end child abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3336-5", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3336-S3337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Avera has made a solid \ninvestment in the community and the state, and it was only logical that \nthe clinic should provide quality health care services to our veterans \nin the Aberdeen area. This is good news for veterans in northeastern \nSouth Dakota because they will be able to receive many medical services \nat the clinic without having to drive several hours to the Sioux Falls \nveterans hospital.\n  Congratulations also need to go to Avera St. Luke's Hospital, Dr. \nSteve Redmond, Physician's Assistant Kevin Vaughan, Clinic \nAdministrator Leonard Severson, the clinic's support staff, and CR \nAssociates on their new partnership with the VA.\n  Veterans are our country's heroes, and their selfless actions will \ninspire generations of Americans yet to come. Our country must honor \nits commitments to veterans, not only because it is the right thing to \ndo, but also because it is the smart thing to do.\n  I will continue to lead efforts to ensure that our nation's military \nretirees and veterans receive the benefits they were promised years \nago. While I am pleased with some improvements in military health care \nfunding passed into law last year, I am concerned that more needs to be \ndone.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments to recognize an outstanding group of young people from Bucks \nCounty, PA. The Central Bucks East High School Choirs, under the \ndirection of E. Scott Teschner and the String Orchestra, under the \ndirection of Eileen Telly, traveled to Washington, DC and Virginia to \nbe adjudicated in Music Festivals throughout the weekend of March 30, \n2001.\n  The 25-member String Orchestra performed at Lanier Middle School in \nFairfax, VA on Saturday, March 31, and the choirs sang at W.T. Woodson \nHigh School, also in Fairfax. These choirs include a 165-voice Concert \nChoir, 16-voice Varsity Singers, 16-voice Men's Ensemble and 27-voice \nWomen's Ensemble. Later that evening, these talented students \ncelebrated at an awards banquet and dance, and on Sunday, April 1, \n2001, they traveled to the West Terrace of the United States Capitol \nfor a public performance.\n  This group of students has been recognized for their outstanding \nchoral abilities in Washington, Williamsburg, Orlando, Boston, and \nMontreal. In addition, they have been recognized since 1991 as the \n``Outstanding Choral Program'' in every festival in which they have \nparticipated. Performances are judged according to National Standards \nof Excellence by college choral professors, and the Central Bucks East \nChoirs consistently earn ``Superior'' ratings. In addition, they are \nfrequently honored with the ``Special Adjudicators Award for \nDistinguished Performance,'' presented only to the elite choirs in the \nnation. These singers have also received the ``Spirit of the Festival \nAward'' for the last 2 years, which is awarded to the organization that \nbests represents their community and school, and that is the most \ncooperative and enthusiastic during the festival.\n  It is without a doubt that this group is an outstanding \nrepresentation of young people in Pennsylvania and across the country. \nThey have demonstrated tremendous talent both musically and through \ntheir leadership and maturity.

ARBELIA GREER PENNINGTON WOOD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to \nacknowledge and congratulate Mrs. Arbelia Greer Pennington Wood, a \nresident from my home State of Michigan, who will be celebrating her \n116th birthday on Friday, April 6, 2001.\n  The child of a sharecropper, Mrs. Wood, who is affectionately called \n``Ma'' by her nephews and nieces, was born in Caledonia, MS in 1885. \nRaised in Alabama, she moved to Detroit in 1934. Throughout her life, \nshe has been guided by devotion to her family and a deep and abiding \nfaith. Though widowed twice, Mrs. Wood has never been alone. She has \nbeen actively involved in the lives of her extended family, which \nincludes not only her nieces and nephews, but also children in her \nneighborhood. Family members and friends have all commented on her \ncooking abilities and her ability to teach families about cooking, \ngrammar and even carpentry.\n  In addition to a multitude of nephews and nieces, Mrs. Wood has been \nblessed to be part of a family noted for its longevity. Her mother \nlived to be ninety-three years old. A brother of hers lived to be \neighty-nine, and many of her younger siblings are currently in their \neighties and nineties. One of her nieces has designed a website \ndedicated to her beloved ``Ma.'' On that website is posted a verse from \nthe Book of Genesis: ``Sarah lived to be 127 years old.'' I cannot help \nbut think that this verse has not only been an inspiration but also a \nchallenge to Ardelia's family.\n  Mrs. Wood has seen the turn of two centuries. She has also displayed \nimmense courage throughout her life. Twice she has successfully battled \nbreast cancer. In addition, she has participated as a civil rights \nactivist. As a child, Mrs. Woods refused to take the advice of her \nwhite doctors to identify herself as being Caucasian. Later in life, \nshe demanded that a Mt. Clemens, MI restaurant serve herself and her \ndarker skinned husband whom they were denying service. The restaurant \neventually relented. Arbelia has witnessed the many changes that have \naffected our society. By caring for her family, actively participating \nin her church and serving as a midwife, Arbelia Greer Pennington Wood \nhas quietly worked to make this country a better place. Such daily acts \nof commitment and civic duty are the foundation upon which this nation \nis built.\n  Mrs. Arbelia Greer Pennington Wood can take pride on the occasion of \nher 116th birthday. I am honored to join her family in wishing her a \nblessed and happy birthday. I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating Mrs. Arbelia Greer Pennington Wood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3337-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3337-S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN RED CROSS, MID-RIO GRANDE CHAPTER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \norganization that celebrates a special anniversary in New Mexico this \nmonth. The Red Cross, Mid-Rio Grande Chapter this April celebrates its \n85th anniversary of being a humanitarian presence in my home state.\n  Last May, the devastating Cerro Grande wildfire destroyed hundreds of \nhomes in Los Alamos and caused the evacuation of more than 25,000 \npeople in the region. New Mexico residents, business leaders and \nnumerous agencies generously responded to support a relief effort. But \none agency stood out as a leader in the swift response to meet \nemergency needs of the thousands of families affected: the American Red \nCross.\n  The Albuquerque-based Mid-Rio Grande Chapter serves as the Red Cross' \nlead unit for disaster services in New Mexico. As such, the Mid-Rio\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nGrande Chapter, working with sister chapters in Los Alamos and Santa \nFe, coordinated more than 2,000 volunteers to help ensure that shelters \nwere opened, meals were served, and mental health counselors, nurses, \ncaseworkers and others were available to work with families faced with \nrebuilding their homes and their lives.\n  This relief effort, while one of the largest in the state's history, \nis only one example of the services this Red Cross Chapter provides to \ndisaster victims.\n  Over the decades, the agency's services have evolved to continue to \nmeet the needs of the communities it serves. The Red Cross was founded \nin 1881 by Clara Barton. During WWI and WWII, the Red Cross provided \nextensive services to the members of the U.S. military, supplying more \nthan 80 percent of the bandages used on the battlefields and in the \nmilitary hospitals. Red Cross nurses and volunteers served in those \noverseas hospitals, as well as the VA hospitals back home.\n  Following the wars, new services were formed to meet the needs of \nveterans. The Red Cross began to expand into home and workplace first \naid programs. Swimming lessons and lifeguard training, once unheard of, \nbecame a part of hundreds of thousands of children's lives and \ncontinues today. CPR and first aid are still taught every week at the \nMid-Rio Grande Chapter and around the state and country. In Albuquerque \nand central New Mexico alone, more than 13,000 people are trained every \nyear.\n  In New Mexico, the Red Cross also runs a bone and tissue \ntransplantation program. They work closely with United Blood Services \nto help ensure an adequate blood supply.\n  In addition to the Albuquerque chapter, the Red Cross also operates \nchapters in Clovis, Farmington, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Los Alamos, Roswell \nand Santa Fe.\n  Throughout program's lifetime, one service has remained constant: \ndisaster relief. Response to fires, floods, windstorms, winter storms, \nhazardous material spills, transportation accidents, and search and \nrescue operations has all been part of the everyday work of the \nAmerican Red Cross, Mid-Rio Grande Chapter. Just last year, they \nresponded to 229 disasters and assisted 285 families, not including the \naid given to victims of the Cerro Grande Fire. The Chapter also trains \nthousands a year in disaster education in an effort to help people \nprevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies.\n  This year, as the Chapter celebrates its 85th anniversary of service, \nwe honor years of commitment and the contributions volunteers have made \nto our communities by improving and saving lives. These services are \nmade possible only through the generous donations of the people of New \nMexico and the nation.\n  I commend the efforts of the Mid-Rio Grande Chapter of the American \nRed Cross. I encourage everyone to learn more about the Red Cross and \nits support services. It is a great organization that relies on public \nsupport to ensure that it remains strong and ready to respond to \nemergency and public safety needs in Albuquerque, the state, the \nnation, and the world. It is hard to imagine what this country might \nhave been like without the great contributions of one of the world's \noldest and largest humanitarian organizations--the American Red \nCross.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3338-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3338-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3338-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3338-S3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1297.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a program for fisheries habitat protection, restoration, and \nenhancement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fishable \nWaters Act with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be listed as a cosponsor. This \nis consensus legislation from a uniquely diverse spectrum of interests \nto establish a comprehensive, voluntary, incentive-based, locally-led \nprogram to improve and restore our fisheries.\n  Put simply, this legislation enables local stakeholders to get \ntogether to design water quality projects in their own areas that will \nbe eligible for some $350 million in federal assistance to implement \nfor the benefit of our fisheries and water quality. It does not change \nany existing provisions, regulatory or otherwise, of the Clean Water \nAct.\n  The Fishable Waters Act complements existing clean water programs \nthat are designed to encourage, rather than coerce the participation of \nlandowners. This legislation will work because it will empower people \nat the local level who have a stake in its success and who will have \nhands-on involvement in its implementation.\n  It is supported by members of the Fishable Waters Coalition which \nincludes the American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the \nIzaak Walton League of America, the National Corn Growers Association, \nthe National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the Bass Anglers Sportsman \nSociety, the American Fisheries Society, the International Association \nof Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the Pacific Rivers Council. These \ngroups have labored quietly but with great determination for several \nyears to produce this consensus proposal to build on the success of the \nClean Water Act.\n  As my colleagues understand, it is at great peril that anyone in this \ntown undertakes to address clean water-related issues but the need is \ntoo great and this approach too practical to not embrace it, introduce \nit, and work to achieve the wide-spread support it merits.\n  A companion bill, H.R. 325, has been introduced by Congressman John \nTanner in the House. That bipartisan measure is cosponsored by \nRepresentatives Abercrombie, Blunt, Boehlert, Allen, Clement, Nathan, \nDingell, English, Christopher, Johnson, Leach, Pallone, Saxton, \nStenholm, and Whitfield.\n  Joining us last year for the kickoff were representatives of the \nFishable Waters Coalition and a special guest, a fishing enthusiast who \nsome may know otherwise as a top-ranked U.S. golfer, David Duval. ``Why \nam I here? I like to fish. I've done it as long as I can remember,'' \nDuval said. ``I want my kids to be able to have healthy habitats for \nfish. I want my grandkids and my great-grandkids to be able to do what \nI enjoy so much, and I think this could make a big difference.''\n  This bipartisan and consensus legislation is intended to capture \nopportunities to build on the success of the Clean Water Act. It \nenables local stakeholders to get together with farmers who own 70 \npercent of our nation's land to design local water quality projects \nthat will be eligible for some $350 million in federal assistance for \nthe benefit of our fisheries and water quality.\n  Instead of Washington saying, ``you do this and you pay for it'' and \ninstead of Washington saying, ``you do this but we'll help you pay for \nit'', this legislation lets local citizens design projects that can be \neligible for federal assistance. For farmers, the idea of protecting \nland for future generations is not an abstract notion because the \nfarmers in my State know that good stewardship is good for them and \ntheir families. Their challenge is that while they feed this nation and \nprovide some $50 billion in exports, they do not have the ability to \npass additional costs onto consumers like corporations do. For the 2 \nmillion people who farm to provide environmental benefits for \nthemselves and the rest of the nation's 270 million people, they need \npartners because they cannot afford to do it by themselves. This \nlegislation recognizes that reality.\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\n  While one can expect a great deal of controversy surrounding any \ncomprehensive Clean Water effort, the consensus that has built around \nthis approach is cause for great optimism that this legislation will be \nthe vehicle to make significant additional progress in improving water \nquality.\n  I am pleased to continue work on the Fishable Waters Act with the \nbroad coalition to move the legislation forward to passage and I thank \nmy colleagues Senator Lincoln and Congressman Tanner. This new \ngeneration approach empowers people at the local level who have the \ngreatest understanding and the most at stake in the success of \nenvironmental protection. I will be working with new members of the \nBush Administration aggressively because I believe that this is \nphilosophically consistent with their modern approach to environmental \nprotection.\n  I congratulate members of the Coalition for producing and supporting \nthis consensus legislation and I look forward to working with Senator \nLincoln and my other Senate colleagues to move this legislation \nforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the text of a one-page summary of \nthe bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Fishable Waters Act Bill Summary in Brief\n\n\n                                PURPOSE\n\n       This legislation begins with the premise the while great \n     progress has been made in improving water quality under the \n     Clean Water Act, more opportunities remain. The particular \n     emphasis on this legislation is on opportunities to address \n     fisheries habitat and water quality needs.\n       The findings include that it shall be the policy of the \n     United States to protect, restore, and enhance fisheries \n     habitat and related uses through voluntary watershed planning \n     at the state and local level that leads to sound fisheries \n     conservation on an overall watershed basis.\n       To carry out this objective, a new section is added to the \n     Clean Water Act.\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n       The legislation authorizes the establishment of voluntary \n     and local Watershed Councils to consider the best available \n     science to plan and implement a program to protect and \n     restore fisheries habitat with the consent of affected \n     landowners.\n       Each comprehensive plan must consider the following \n     elements: characterization of the watershed in terms of \n     fisheries habitat; objectives both near- and long-term; \n     ongoing factors affecting habitat and access; specific \n     projects that need to be undertaken to improve fisheries \n     habitat; and any necessary incentives, financial or \n     otherwise, to facilitate implementation of best management \n     practices to better deal with non-point source pollution \n     including sediments impairing waterways.\n       Projects and measures that can be implemented or \n     strengthened with the consent of affected landowners to \n     improve fisheries habitat including stream side vegetation, \n     instream modifications and structures, modifications to flood \n     control measures and structures that would improve the \n     connection of rivers to low-lying backwaters, oxbows, and \n     tributary mouths.\n       With the consent of affected landowners, those projects, \n     initiatives, and restoration measures identified in the \n     approved plan become eligible for funding through a Fisheries \n     Habitat Account.\n       Funds from the Fisheries Habitat Account may be used to \n     provide up to 15 percent for the non-federal matching \n     requirement under including the following conservation \n     programs:-The Wetlands Reserve Program; The Environmental \n     Quality Incentives Program; The National Estuary Program; The \n     Emergency Conservation Program; The Farmland Protection \n     Program; The Conservation Reserve Program; The Wildlife \n     Habitat Incentives Program; The North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Program; The Federal Aid in Sportfish \n     Restoration Program; The Flood Hazard Mitigation and Riverine \n     Ecosystem Restoration Program; The Environmental Management \n     Program; and The Missouri and Middle Mississippi Enhancement \n     Project.\n       The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to develop an \n     urban waters revitalization program ($25m/yr) to improve \n     fisheries and related recreational activities in urban waters \n     with priority given to funding projects located in and \n     benefitting low-income or economically depressed areas\n       $250 million is authorized annually through Agriculture for \n     the planning and implementation of projects contained in \n     approved plans.\n       States with approved programs may, if they choose, transfer \n     up to 20 percent of the funds provided to each state through \n     the Clean Water Act's $200 million Section 319 non-point \n     source program to implement planned projects.\n       Up to $25 million is authorized annually through Interior \n     for measures to restrict livestock access to streams and \n     provide alternative watering opportunities and $50 million is \n     authorized annually to provide, with the cooperation of \n     landowners, minimum instream flows and water quantities.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my neighbor and \ncolleague from Missouri, Kit Bond, in introducing the Fishable Waters \nAct. This bill is aimed at restoring and maintaining clean water in our \nNation's rivers, lakes, and streams. This bill will provide much needed \nfunding for programs with a proven track record of conserving land, \ncleaning up the environment, and promoting clean and fishable waters. \nThis legislation takes the right approach to reducing non-point source \npollution. It's voluntary. Its incentive-based. And it encourages \npublic-private partnerships.\n  Our State Motto, ``The Natural State,'' reflects our dedication to \npreserving the unique natural landscape that we cherish in Arkansas. We \nhave towering mountains, rolling foothills, an expansive Delta, \ncountless pristine rivers and lakes, and a multitude of timber \nvarieties across our state. From expansive evergreen forests in the \nSouth, to the nation's largest bottomland hardwood forest in the East, \nas well as one of this nation's largest remaining hardwood forests \nacross the Northern one-half of the state, Arkansas has one of the most \ndiverse ecosystems in the Untied States. Most streams and rivers in \nArkansas originate or run through our timberlands and are sources for \nwater supplies, prime recreation, and countless other sues. We also \nhave numerous outdoor recreational opportunities and it is vital that \nwe take steps to protect the environment.\n  This bill utilizes current programs within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture that have a proven track record of reducing non-point \nsources of pollution and promoting clean and fishable waters through \nvoluntary conservation measures. Existing USDA programs like the \nWetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nConservation Reserve Program, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, \nassist farmers in taking steps towards preserving a quality \nenvironment.\n  CRP and WRP are so popular with farmers that they will likely reach \ntheir authorized enrollment cap by the end of 2001. Farmers wouldn't \nflock to these programs unless there was an inherent desire to ensure \nthat they conserved and preserved our Nation's water resources.\n  Arkansas ranks second in the number of enrolled acres in USDA's \nWetlands Reserve Program because our farmers have recognized the vital \nrole that wetlands play in preserving a sound ecology and efficient \nproduction.\n  WRP is so popular in AR that we have over 200 currently pending \napplications that we cannot fill because of lack of funding. That's \nover 200 farmers that want to voluntarily conserve wetland areas around \nrivers, lakes, and streams. We need to fill that void in funding for \nthese beneficial programs. This bill will help farmers in Arkansas and \nacross the nation to voluntarily conserve sensitive land areas and \nprovide buffer strips for runoff areas.\n  Farmers makes their living from the soil and water. They have a \nvested interest in ensuring that these resources are protected. I don't \nbelieve that our nation's farmer shave been given enough credit for \ntheir dedicated efforts to preserve a sound environment for future \ngenerations.\n  As many of you know, farming has a special place in my heart because \nI was raised on a seventh generation farm family. I know first hand \nthat farmers want to protect the viability of their land so they can \npass it on to the next generation. This bill is about more than \nagriculture through. It strikes the right balance between our \nagricultural industry and another pastime that I feel very strongly \nabout, hunting and fishing.\n  Over the years many people have been surprised when they learn that I \nam an avid outdoorsman. I grew up in the South where hunting and \nfishing are not just hobbies, they're a way of life. My father never \ndifferentiated between taking his son or daughters hunting or fishing, \nit was just assumed that we would all take part. For this, I will be \nforever grateful because I truly enjoy the outdoors, and the time I \nspent hunting and fishing is a big part of who I am today. We are \nblessed in\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nArkansas to have such bountiful outdoor opportunities. For these \nopportunities to continue to exist we must take steps to ensure that \nour nation's waters are protected. Trout in Arkansas' Little Red River \nand mallards in the riverbottoms of the Mississippi Delta both share a \ncommon need of clean water. And that is what we are ultimately striving \nfor with this legislation: an effective, voluntary, incentive based \nplan to provide funding for programs that promote clean water.\n  I want to again stress the importance of voluntary programs.\n  We cannot expect to have success by using a heavy-handed, top-down \napproach to regulate our farmers, ranchers, and foresters into \nenvironmental compliance. Trying to force people into a permitting \nprogram to reduce the potential for non-point runoff may actually \ndiscourage responsible environmental practices.\n  I agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our nation's impaired \nrivers, lakes, and streams, but firmly believe that a permitting \nprogram is not the best solution to the problem of maintaining clean \nwater. Placing another unnecessary layer of regulation upon our \nnation's local foresters will only slow down the process of responsible \nfarming and forestry and implementation of voluntary Best Management \nPractices.\n  This legislation takes the right approach to clean and fishable \nwaters. It's voluntary. It's incentive-based. And it encourages public-\nprivate partnerships to clean up our Nation's rivers, lakes, and \nstreams.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in the fight for clean and \nfishable waters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 679. A bill to establish the Arabia Mountain National Heritage \nArea in the State of Georgia, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish the Arabia Mountain National heritage Area in the State of \nGeorgia. The significance of this area and the need to act now is \nunderscored by Metro Atlanta's unprecedented rate of growth. In fact, \nit has been said that Atlanta is the fastest growing city in \ncivilization.\n  The area surrounding Arabia Mountain is located only 20 minutes east \nof Atlanta, near my home town of Lithonia. I speak from personal \nexperience when I say that this area has seen the effects of Metro \nAtlanta's unbridled expansion, particularly in the past decade. As a \nresult, vital open spaces and farmlands have all but disappeared.\n  I believe it is essential to preserve what remains of significant \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources in this region. The terrain \nsurrounding Arabia Mountain contains a diverse ecosystem consisting of \nrare plant species, wetlands, pine and oak forests, streams and a lake. \nAdditionally, this area is home to many historic sites, structure, and \ncultural landscapes, including the last remaining farm in DeKalb \nCounty. On a personal note, I can remember when this town was known as \nthe dairy belt of Georgia. Now, we are down to a single working farm.\n  My legislation reflects what has been a real grass roots effort to \npreserve this vital landscape. Over the past several years, local \ncitizens have been working in conjunction with city, county, and State \nofficials to move forward with plans to preserve these resources. In \nfact, this project has already benefited from significant private \ncontributions of land, money, and professional services which have \nenabled the Arabia Mountain Heritage Area Alliance to produce a \ndetailed feasibility study which was released on February 28, 2001. \nHowever, local efforts to protect and preserve the resources of the \narea will not fully materialize without the technical assistance of \nFederal agencies.\n  Under my bill, the National Park Service, NPS, will be authorized to \nprovide essential technical support in order to develop and implement a \nplan to manage the natural, cultural, historical, scenic, and \nrecreational resources of the heritage area. Taking into account the \ndiverse interests of the governmental, business, and nonprofit groups \nwithin the area, the management plan will assist the local governments \nin adopting land use policies which maximize the many resources of the \nregion.\n  I have personally visited this area, and I must reiterate my strong \ninterest in this important preservation effort. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record, and urge my \ncolleagues to join me in enacting this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to help ensure general aviation aircraft access to \nFederal land and to the airspace over that land; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nBackcountry Landing Strip Access Act of 2001. Last year, Senators Craig \nand Burns, and I introduced similar legislation. Although the \nlegislation did not pass, we were able to successfully attach a \nmodified one-year version of our bill to the Interior Appropriations \nConference Report for FY 2001, prohibiting federal funds from being \nused to close any airstrips on lands administered by the Department of \nthe Interior. The legislation I introduce today represents a \ncomprehensive, long-term solution to the problem of backcountry \nairstrips being temporarily or permanently closed. This bill will \npreserve our nation's backcountry airstrips and require a public review \nand comment period before closure of these airstrips.\n  Idaho is home to more than fifty backcountry airstrips and the state \nis known nationwide for its air access to wilderness and primitive \nareas. Unfortunately, many backcountry airstrips have been closed or \nrendered unserviceable through neglect by federal agencies responsible \nfor land management. These closures occur without providing the public \nwith a justification for such action or an opportunity to comment on \nthem.\n  Our bill would address this situation by preventing the Secretary of \nInterior and the Secretary of Agriculture from permanently closing \nairstrips without first consulting with state aviation agencies and \nusers. The legislation would also require that proposed closures would \nbe published in the Federal Register with a ninety-day public comment \nperiod. The bill directs the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, after consultation with the FAA, to adopt a nationwide \npolicy governing backcountry aviation. I would like to mention that \nCongressmen C.L. ``Butch'' Otter and Jim Hansen are also promoting \nbackcountry aviation access in the other body.\n  This bill and its House companion include a finding of fact that \nacknowledges the role of backcountry airstrips in supporting aerial \nfirefighters. This finding was not included in the versions introduced \nlast year but it pays tribute to those who joined in last summer's \nfirefighting and disaster relief efforts.\n  For aerial firefighters backcountry airstrips are analogous to fire \nengines in a firehouse. In addition, other general aviation craft \ndepend on backcountry strips to provide a safe haven in the case of \nemergency. Without the airstrips, these pilots would have little chance \nof survival while attempting an emergency landing. Furthermore, access \nto the strips ensures a fundamental American service--universal postal \ndelivery. Without access to backcountry airstrips, citizens who live \nand work in remote areas would not receive their mail.\n  Pilots often discover that an airstrip has been closed only when they \nattempt to use it. This represents a grave danger to those who have not \nbeen made aware of an airstrip's closure. This bill would ensure that \neveryone with an interest in backcountry aviation remains informed of a \nproposed closure and is allowed to comment on it.\n  This bill is simply about safety and general aviation access. It does \nnot reopen airstrips that have already been closed, nor does it burden \nfederal officials with the responsibility to operate and maintain these \nsites. In fact, pilots themselves regularly maintain backcountry \nstrips.\n  The Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act does not harm our forests or \nour wilderness areas. In fact, backcountry airstrips are regularly used \nby forest officials to maintain forests and trails, conduct ecological \nmanagement projects, and produce aerial mapping. Airstrips are located \nin remote, rugged areas of the west where there are few visitors. Many \nlanding strips have no more than 3-6 takeoffs and landings in a year, \nand are mainly used for emergency landings.\n  When the Frank Church Wilderness Act was established in Idaho, it \nincorporated a provision that existing landing strips cannot be closed \npermanently or rendered unserviceable without the written consent of \nthe State of Idaho. This bill extends the success of the Frank Church \nWilderness Act provision nationwide to preserve airstrips in Idaho as \nwell as other states. In Idaho, we have evolved into a cooperative \nrelationship with federal land managers. I believe the rest of the \ncountry can benefit from this philosophy of cooperation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in our efforts to preserve the \nremaining backcountry strips.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrestore the link between the maximum amount of earnings by blind \nindividuals permitted without demonstrating ability to engage in \nsubstantial gainful activity and the exempt amount permitted in \ndetermining excess earnings under the earnings test; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation which would have a tremendous impact on the lives \nof many blind people. This bill restores the 20-year link between blind \npeople and senior citizens in regards to the Social Security earnings \nlimit which has helped many blind people become self-sufficient and \nproductive.\n  When the Congress passed the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act in \n1996, we unfortunately broke the longstanding linkage in the treatment \nof blind people and seniors under Social Security, which resulted in \nallowing the earnings limit to be raised for seniors only and did not \ngive blind people the same opportunity to increase their earnings \nwithout penalizing their Social Security benefits.\n  My intent when I sponsored the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act \nwas not to break the link between blind people and the senior \npopulation. In 1996, time constraints and fiscal considerations forced \nme to focus solely on raising the unfair and burdensome earnings limit \nfor seniors. I am pleased that H.R. 5, the Social Security Earnings \nTest Elimination bill, finally eliminated this unfair tax on earnings \nfor seniors 65 to 69 years of age. This law is allowing millions of \nseniors to continue contributing to society as productive workers.\n  Now we should work together in the spirit of fairness to ensure that \nthis same opportunity is given to the blind population. We should \nprovide blind people the opportunity to be productive and ``make it'' \non their own. We should not continue policies which discourage these \nindividuals from working and contributing to society.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to one I sponsored in \nthe last two Congresses. If we do not reinstate the link between the \nblind and the seniors, blind people will be restricted to earning \n$14,800 in the year 2002 in order to protect their Social Security \nbenefits.\n  There are very strong and convincing arguments in favor of \nreestablishing the link between these two groups and increasing the \nearnings limit for blind people.\n  First, the earnings test treatment of our blind and senior \npopulations has historically been identical. Since 1977, blind people \nand senior citizens have shared the identical earnings exemption \nthreshold under Title II of the Social Security Act.\n  Now, senior citizens will be given greater opportunity to increase \ntheir earnings without losing a portion of their Social Security \nbenefits; the blind, however, will not have the same opportunity.\n  The Social Security earnings test imposes a work disincentive for \nblind people. In fact, the earnings test probably provides a greater \naggregate disincentive for blind individuals since many blind \nbeneficiaries are of working age, 18-65, and are capable of productive \nwork.\n  Blindness is often associated with adverse social and economic \nconsequences. It is often tremendously difficult for blind individuals \nto find sustained employment or any employment at all, but they do want \nto work. They take great pride in being able to work and becoming \nproductive members of society. By linking the blind with seniors in \n1977, Congress provided a great deal of hope and incentive for blind \npeople in this country to enter the work force. Now, we are taking that \nhope away from them by not allowing them the same opportunity to \nincrease their earnings as senior citizens.\n  Blind people are likely to respond favorably to an increase in the \nearnings test by working more, which will increase their tax payments \nand their purchasing power and allow the blind to make a greater \ncontribution to the general economy. In addition, encouraging the blind \nto work and allowing them to work more without being penalized would \nbring additional revenue into the Social Security trust funds as well \nas the Federal Treasury. In short, restoring the link between blind \npeople and senior citizens for treatment of Social Security benefits \nwould help many blind people become self-sufficient, productive members \nof society.\n  I am pleased that this Congress will be focusing on the overall \nstructure of the Social Security system and working together for \nsolutions which would strengthen the system for seniors of today and \ntomorrow without placing an unfair burden on working Americans. It is \nabsolutely crucial that we include raising the earnings test for blind \nindividuals as a part of any Social Security bill we enact this year.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important \nmeasure to restore fair and equitable treatment for our blind citizens \nand to give the blind community increased financial independence. Our \nnation would be better served if we restore equality for the blind and \nprovide them with the same freedom, opportunities and fairness as our \nnation's seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a refundable credit against income tax for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance, and to establish State health insurance \nsafety-net programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators \nBob Torricelli of New Jersey and Bob Smith of New Hampshire, in \nintroducing the bipartisan Fair Care for the Uninsured Act of 2001, \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\naimed at ensuring that all Americans, regardless of income, have a \nbasic level of resources to purchase health insurance. I am pleased \nthat House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and Representative Bill \nLipinski of Illinois have joined in introducing companion legislation \nin the House of Representatives.\n  As we all know, the growing ranks of uninsured Americans, currently \n43 million, remains a major national problem that must be addressed as \nCongress considers improvements to our healthcare delivery system. The \nuninsured are three times as likely not to receive needed medical care, \nat least twice as more likely to need hospitalization for avoidable \nconditions like pneumonia and diabetes, and four times more likely to \nrely on an emergency room or have no regular source of care as compared \nto Americans who are privately insured.\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act represents a major step toward \nhelping the uninsured obtain health insurance coverage through the \ncreation of a new refundable tax credit for the purchase of private \nhealth insurance, a concept which enjoys bipartisan support.\n  This legislation directly addresses one of the main barriers which \nnow inhibits access to health insurance for millions of Americans: \ndiscrimination in the tax code. Most Americans obtain health insurance \nthrough their place of work, and for good reason: workers receive their \nemployer's contribution toward health insurance completely free from \nfederal taxation, including payroll taxes. This is effectively a $120 \nbillion per year federal subsidy for employer-provided health \ninsurance. By contrast, individuals who purchase their own health \ninsurance get virtually no tax relief. They must buy insurance with \nafter-tax dollars, forcing many to earn twice as much income before \ntaxes in order to purchase the same insurance. This hidden health tax \npenalty effectively punishes people who try to buy their insurance \noutside the workplace.\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act would remedy this situation by \ncreating a parallel system for working families who do not have access \nto health insurance through the workplace. Specifically, this \nlegislation creates a refundable tax credit of $1,000 per adult and up \nto $3,000 per family, indexed for inflation, for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance; would be available to individuals and \nfamilies who don't have access to coverage through the workplace or a \nfederal government program; enables individuals to use their credit to \nshop for a basic plan that best suits their needs which would be \nportable from job to job; and allows individuals to buy more generous \ncoverage with after-tax dollars. And of course the states could \nsupplement the credit.\n  This legislation complements a bipartisan consensus which is emerging \naround this means for addressing the serious problem of uninsured \nAmericans: Instead of creating new government entitlements to medical \nservices, tax credits provide public financing to help uninsured \nAmericans buy private health insurance. President Bush has proposed a \nsimilar tax credit for health insurance coverage, and Senators Jeffords \nand Breaux have introduced their own health insurance tax credit \nproposal here in the Senate. I applaud their efforts for advancing this \nimportant public policy initiative, and look forward to working with \nthem to develop a clear mandate for helping America's uninsured.\n  I would like to apprize our colleagues of a couple of improvements \nwhich we have added to last session's bill that I believe will help \nbring about an even more positive impact on America's uninsured \npopulation. First, in an effort to keep premiums affordable for older, \nsicker Americans, our Fair Care legislation calls for the creation of \nsafety-net arrangements administered at the state level and funded by \nassessments on insurers. Often called high-risk pools, such \narrangements currently exist in 28 states and would be expanded to all \n50. In addition, our Fair Care legislation this session would further \nreduce premiums by permitting the creation of Individual Membership \nAssociations, through which individuals can obtain basic coverage free \nof costly state benefit mandates.\n  In reducing the amount of uncompensated care that is offset through \ncost shifting to private insurance plans, and in substantially \nincreasing the insurance base, a health insurance tax credit will help \nrelieve some of the spiraling costs of our health care delivery system. \nIt would also encourage insurance companies to write policies geared to \nthe size of the credit, thus offering more options and making it \npossible for low income families to obtain coverage without paying much \nmore than the available credits.\n  It is time that we reduced the tax bias against families who do not \nhave access to coverage through their place of work or existing \ngovernment programs, and to encourage the creation of an effective \nmarket for family-selected and family-owned plans, where Americans have \nmore choice and control over their health care dollars. The Fair Care \nfor the Uninsured Act would create tax fairness where currently none \nexists by requiring that all Americans receive the same tax \nencouragement to purchase health insurance, regardless of employment.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues will join Senators Torricelli, \nSmith and me in endorsing this bipartisan legislation to provide people \nwho purchase health insurance on their own similar tax treatment as \nthose who have access to insurance through their employer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 683\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national original, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Murray, Mikulski, Boxer, Stabenow, Kennedy, Durbin, \nTorricelli, Leahy, Inouye, Akaka, Kerry, Wellstone and Feingold to \nreintroduce the Fair Pay Act, a bill to combat pay discrimination \nagainst women.\n  You might think since Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the \nwage gap wouldn't exist. Unfortunately, however, women continue to be \npaid only 76-cents for every dollar a white man earns according to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. Women of color experience the most severe \npay\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\ninequities: African American women earn only 62-cents on the dollar, \nHispanic women only 54 cents.\n  Earlier today, I released a draft report by the Department of Labor's \nWomen's Bureau that helps to explain the wage gap and gives us insight \ninto fixing it.\n  This report was done based on my request in the FY 2000 Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill. I asked the Women's Bureau to analyze wage data \nfrom federal contractors collected over the last two years, focusing on \nthe causes of the wage gap between men and women. This is the first \ntime in at least a decade that such a comprehensive review and analysis \nof wage data was conducted.\n  This three-part draft report, finalized by the Department of Labor in \nJanuary, used updated wage data, including detailed data gathered from \na sample of nearly 5,000 of our nation's federal contractors.\n  This report confirms that the wage gap is real, it's caused in large \npart by discrimination and women in female-dominated jobs suffer the \nmost. Specifically, the report found that at least one-third, or about \n11 cents on the dollar, of the pay gap is caused by pay discrimination \nagainst women.\n  How'd we get there? The study found if you compare women and men, in \nthe same jobs, in the same firm, with the same experience and skills, \nthey are still only paid 89 cents for every dollar a man earns. That \n11-cent gap is unexplained, and is what we believe is pay \ndiscrimination.\n  But if you look at women's overall pay against men, when you take \ninto account all of the women who are segregated into what's considered \n``women's work'' and receive lower wages, the pay gap becomes 28 cents.\n  If this kind of occupational segregation were eliminated, the wage \ngap would close between 10 and 40 percent, according to this report.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We can start closing the pay gap \nright now by simply paying women what they're worth. That's where the \nFair Pay Act comes in.\n  The Fair Pay Act would require that employers pay their workers based \non skills, effort, responsibility and effort, regardless if the job is \nconsidered so-called ``women's work.''\n  Millions of women today work in so-called ``women's jobs,'' as \nsecretaries, child care workers, social workers and nurses. These jobs \nare often ``equivalent'' in skills, effort, responsibility and working \nconditions to similar jobs dominated by men. But these women aren't \npaid the same as the men. Work that women have traditionally done \ncontinues to be undervalued and underpaid.\n  That's what the Fair Pay Act would address.\n  Our bill says that pay discrimination based on the number of women in \na job is not only un-American, but it is also illegal.\n  It doesn't make sense that a nurse practitioner earns less than a \nphysician's assistant. Or that a lead administrative assistant makes \nless than a city bus driver. Or that a social worker earns less than a \nparole officer.\n  I've heard the argument that we don't need the Fair Pay Act, that \n``market forces'' will eventually take care of it. The market can't and \nisn't supposed to take care of everything. You can't fix discrimination \nwith the ``invisible hand.''\n  Take a look at this chart of the wage gap over the last 20 years. If \nwe continue to rely on ``market forces,'' it will be another century \nbefore there's true pay equity for women.\n  In fact, this study accounts for market forces, and it says that pay \nin women's jobs has increased, but not nearly enough.\n  If we had relied on market forces in the past, our country never \nwould have set a minimum wage and we wouldn't be taking Family Medical \nLeave to care for our newborns or loved ones. We never would have had \nthe Equal Pay Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Some argue that its impossible to compare the wages of different \njobs. But, it's done all the time by labor consultants who use ``point \nsystems'' based on skills, responsibility and effort required to \ndetermine the value of a job. Jobs that are different may still receive \nthe same total score, meaning, the jobs should be paid about the same. \nCompanies would also develop their own evaluation systems and set their \nown wages.\n  My state and 19 others have ``fair pay'' laws and policies in place \nfor their public employees, and my state has never been stronger.\n  Fair pay is not just a women's issue. It's a working family issue. \nIt's a retirement issue. When women aren't paid what they're worth, we \nall get cheated. And national polls show that fair pay is a top \npriority for women.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Fair Pay Act, we owe it to \nAmerica's working women and their families.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of \nthe Fair Pay Act. I hope that this is the Congress that will see this \nimportant piece of legislation enacted. I fear the consequences if we \ndo not.\n  For thirty-eight years, since enactment of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, \nwe have been striving to close the pay gap between men and women. We \nhave made some progress, but not nearly enough.\n  Today, despite all efforts, women on average earn only 77 cents for \neach dollar that men earn. That's simply not acceptable. As Susan \nDailey, U.S. President of the National Business and Professional Women \nsaid, ``Is it acceptable then for women to leave at 1:48 on Thursday \nafternoon because that's three quarters of a work week?'' No, these \ndifferentials are simply not acceptable.\n  Due to the wage gap, it is estimated that the average 25-year-old \nwoman will lose approximately $500,000 over her working lifetime.\n  That's unfair, it's unjust. And for that reason alone, we need to \nsupport legislation that will address the root causes of this pay \ninequity.\n  But not only is it unjust to women, it's unfair to the whole family. \nIt is estimated that the wage gap annually costs America's working \nfamilies $200 billion. Over ten years that's $2 trillion in lost income \nto families as a result of wage disparities. That's more than the \nentire tax cut the Bush Administration is anxious to give back to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of the population!\n  This bill can lift families out of poverty. If married women were \npaid the same as men, their families' rate of poverty would fall by \nmore than 60 percent. If single working mothers earned as much as their \nmale counterparts, their poverty rates would be cut in half.\n  That's what this bill is about, paying everyone a decent wage, the \nwage they deserve, so that they can support their families with \ndignity.\n  I'm proud that my home state of Minnesota is a leader on this issue. \nOur state comparable worth law is one of the strongest on the books and \nserves as a model for other states. In Minnesota, under our law, both \nstate and municipal employees get the benefits of this important \nprotection.\n  I hope we can follow suit on the federal level. I urge my colleagues \nto act swiftly on this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 685. A bill to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to \nstrengthen working families, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill increase a working family's chances to remain self-sufficient and \noff of Welfare. Given the dramatic decline in the welfare caseload \nsince 1996, the question remains whether individuals leaving welfare \nwill remain off welfare. In order to fortify the successful welfare \nreform efforts of the last five years, I along with a bipartisan group \nof Senators have brought together a legislative package designed to \nhonor work, personal responsibility and strengthen a family's chance to \nstay self-sufficient.\n  The Strengthening Working Families Act includes six initiatives \ndesigned to support the efforts of families who have made it off \nwelfare, but are at risk of falling backward--especially in a weak \neconomy. The provisions of the package include: (1) Promotion of \nResponsible Fatherhood; (2) Distribution of Child Support Directly to \nFamilies;\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n(3) Expansion of the EITC for Larger Families; (4) Restoration of the \nSocial Services Block Grant; (5) Encouragement of Employer-sponsored \nChild Care; and (6) Reauthorization of The Safe and Stable Families \nAct.\n  The Strengthening Working Families Act provides those who are trying \nto be responsible with a hand-up, not a hand-out. It honors our values, \nin this case the values of work and self-sufficiency, and strengthens \nfamilies who take responsibility for their children emotionally and \nfinancially.\n  This proposal to support continued personal responsibility comes as \nthe first stage of welfare reform ends and Congress prepares to tackle \nwelfare's hardest cases in the 2002 reauthorization of Temporary Aid to \nNeedy Families, TANF. Since the welfare system was reformed to require \nthat individuals take responsibility for themselves and their families, \ncaseloads have declined. After peaking at 5.1 million families in March \nof 1994, the number of families on welfare has declined by more than \nhalf, to 2.2 million families in June of 2000. The employment rate for \nsingle mothers has increased from 57 percent in 1992 to almost 73 \npercent in 2000. Even among those remaining on the welfare rolls, work \nhas increased sharply, from about 8 percent of adults in 1994 to 28 \npercent in 1999.\n  This is a fiscally responsible approach that will be good for \nfamilies and good for American taxpayers. As Governor, I reformed \nwelfare in Indiana. In 1994, we spent $247.8 million in Indiana on \ndirect welfare payments to families. By the year 2000, we reduced that \nnumber by sixty-six percent, to $83.8 million. If you help people find \nwork and dignity, they become self-sufficient.\n  A number of recent studies show that between 18 percent and 35 \npercent of those who leave welfare return to the rolls, however. While \nthese rates are reflective of a good economy with ample employment \nopportunities, the next few months will indicate what will happen to \nthe welfare rolls during a slowing economy. Many of those who left the \nrolls are in jobs sensitive to economic downturns: 46 percent are in \nthe service industry and 24 percent work in retail.\n  The total cost of the package is estimated at $11.5 billion; 80 \npercent or $8.5 billion of which is directed in tax cuts for working \nfamilies and small businesses. The administration's budget blueprint \nincludes funding for two titles of this bill: Title I, the fatherhood \nprograms, were included at $64 million a year, $315 million over five \nyears; as well as Title VI, the child welfare program, in its entirety.\n  In particular, Title I of the bill which promotes responsible \nfatherhood mirrors S. 653, The Responsible Fatherhood Act of 2001, a \nbill I introduced earlier this Congress with Senator Domenici. Many of \nAmerica's mothers, including single moms, are heroic in their efforts \nto make ends meet while raising good, responsible children. Many dads \nare too. But an increasing number of men are not doing their part, or \nare absent entirely. The decline in the involvement of fathers in the \nlives of their children over the last forty years is a troubling trend \nthat affects us all. Fathers can help teach their children about \nrespect, honor, duty and so many of the values that make our \ncommunities strong.\n  The number of children living in households without fathers has \ntripled over the last forty years, from just over 5 million in 1960 to \nmore than 17 million today. Today, the United States leads the world in \nfatherless families, and too many children spend their lives without \nany contact with their fathers. The consequences are severe, a study by \nthe Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency found that the best \npredictor of violent crime and burglary in a community is not the rate \nof poverty, but the rate of fatherless homes.\n  The Responsible Fatherhood Act of 2001, does three primary things to \nhelp combat fatherlessness in America. First, it creates a grant \nprogram for state media campaigns to encourage fathers to act \nresponsibly. Second, it funds community efforts that provide fathers \nwith the tools necessary to be responsible fathers. Finally, the bill \ncreates a National Clearinghouse to assist states with their media \ncampaigns and with the dissemination of materials to promote \nresponsible fatherhood.\n  I want to thank Senator Snowe for her leadership on this bill. With \nher support not only does each individual piece of this legislation \nenjoy bipartisan support, the entire package is bipartisan. In \naddition, I want to thank Senators Bob Graham, Joseph Lieberman, \nBlanche Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Herb Kohl, Tim Johnson, John Breaux, \nHillary Clinton, John Rockefeller and Thomas Carper for their support.\n  This bipartisan package to promote personal responsibility will allow \nus to continue to discuss the successes of welfare reform. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nStrengthening Working Families Act of 2001. I would like to thank \nSenators Bayh and Snowe for working so diligently to put this package \ntogether. I am pleased that my Child Care Infrastructure Act is \nincluded, and I believe it will go a long way towards providing working \nfamilies the tools they need to succeed.\n  That's because this bill is based on a simple premise: that working \ncouples who decide to have a family should not be penalized because \nthey both must keep working.\n  Unfortunately today, many working parents today do not have access to \nan essential tool for success at work: quality child care. According to \nthe Children's Defense Fund, the average annual cost of child care can \nbe more than the average annual cost of public college tuition. And \nnothing adds more to these high costs than the dramatic shortage of \nquality child care in this country.\n  Increasing the supply of child care has clear benefits, for children, \ntheir parents and businesses. Research on the brain has proven the \nimportance of early childhood programs to a child's chances of long-\nterm success in school and in adult life. I have visited many employer-\nsponsored child care centers in Wisconsin, and they are so often state-\nof-the-art facilities that significantly enhance early childhood \neducation. And just as importantly, parents are more productive at work \nwhen they know that their children have safe, reliable child care.\n  This bill is aimed at increasing the supply of child care for working \nfamilies. We provide a 25 percent tax credit to businesses who are \nwilling to take actions to increase the supply of quality child care, \nincluding the construction and operation of an on-site or near-site \nchild care center, or providing child care subsidies for their \nemployees.\n  Increasing the supply of affordable child care is just one part of \nthe fight to help working families succeed, and this bill makes \nbusinesses a true partner in that effort.\n  I am also pleased that the Strengthening Working Families bill also \nincludes ``The Child Support Distribution Act,'' which is similar to \nlegislation I've been working on since 1998, the ``Children First Child \nSupport Reform Act''.\n  This bill takes significant steps toward ensuring that children \nreceive the child support money they are owed and deserve. In Fiscal \nYear 1999, the public child support system collected child support \npayments for only 37 percent of its caseload, up from 23 percent in \n1998. Obviously, we still need to improve, but States are making real \nprogress. It's time for Congress to take the next step and help States \novercome a major obstacle to collecting child support for families.\n  There are many reasons why non-custodial parents may not be paying \nsupport for their children. Some are not able to pay because they don't \nhave jobs or have fallen on hard times. Others may not pay because they \nare unfairly prevented from spending time with their children.\n  But other fathers don't pay because the public system actually \ndiscourages them from paying. Under current law, over $2 billion in \nchild support is retained every year by the State and Federal \ngovernments as repayment for welfare benefits, rather than delivered to \nthe children to whom it is owed. Since the money doesn't benefit their \nkids, fathers are discouraged from paying support. And mothers have no \nincentive to push for payment since the support doesn't go to them.\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\n  It's time for Congress to change this system and encourage States to \ndistribute more child support to families. My home State of Wisconsin \nhas already been doing this for several years and is seeing great \nresults. In 1997, I worked with my State to institute an innovative \nprogram of passing through child support payments directly to families. \nPreliminary results show that when child support payments are delivered \nto families, non-custodial parents are more apt to pay, and to pay \nmore. In addition, Wisconsin has found that, overall, this policy does \nnot increase government costs. That makes sense because ``passing \nthrough'' support payments to families means they have more of their \nown resources, and are less apt to depend on public help to meet other \nneeds such as food, transportation or child care.\n  We now have a key opportunity to encourage all States to follow \nWisconsin's example. Title II of the Strengthening Working Families \nbill gives States options and strong incentives to send more child \nsupport directly to families who are working their way off, or are \nalready off, public assistance. Not only will this create the right \nincentives for non-custodial parents to pay, but it will also simplify \nthe job for States, who currently face an administrative nightmare in \nfollowing the complicated rules of the current system.\n  We know that creating the right incentives for non-custodial parents \nto pay support and increasing collections has long-term benefits. \nPeople who can count on child support are more likely to stay in jobs \nand stay off public assistance.\n  This legislation finally brings the Child Support Enforcement program \ninto the post-welfare reform era, shifting its focus from recovering \nwelfare costs to increasing child support to families so they can \nsustain work and maintain self-sufficiency. After all, it's only fair \nthat if we are asking parents to move off welfare and take financial \nresponsibility for their families, then we in Congress must make sure \nthat child support payments actually go to the families to whom they \nare owed and who are working so hard to succeed.\n  Last year, a House version of this bill passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote for 405 to 18. We must keep the momentum going in this \nCongress, and finally make child support meaningful for families. \nAgain, I want to thank Senators Snowe and Bayh for working with me on \nthis issue and for including it in this package.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the Working Families package to invest in a series of \nbipartisan initiatives to support and encourage families that are \n``playing by the rules,'' but struggling to make ends meet as they \nraise their children.\n  This legislation combines key legislative proposals to help working \nfamilies, including a targeted expansion of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit, EITC, for families with three or more children. It is simple \ncommon sense that parents with more children need more help in making \nends meet. This bill would give the most needy families up to $496 more \nin the EITC to help working families live with dignity. Our legislation \nalso includes key provisions to streamline and improve the EITC, which \nis one of our most effective programs to combat child poverty.\n  Another key component of this package would reauthorize and expand \nthe Safe and Stable Families Act with an additional $200 million a \nyear, as proposed by President Bush. I helped to create this program in \n1993 with Senator Bond, and it was expanded and improved in 1997 as \npart of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Since this act became law, \nwe have dramatically increased the number of adoptions from foster \ncare. Therefore, we need to increase funding for adoption services and \nto help the children and their new families overcome the years of abuse \nand neglect. Further, the bill would improve the Chafee Independent \nLiving program by offering a $5000 scholarship to teens from foster \ncare to encourage them to attend college or pursue vocational training. \nAbused and neglected children are among the most vulnerable in our \nsociety and they deserve our support and care.\n  For many years, I have worked closely with Senator Graham and a \nbipartisan coalition to restore funding to the Social Service Block \nGrant, a flexible program to enable states to provide support for needy \nchildren, families, seniors and the disabled. During the welfare reform \ndebates, we promised flexibility to the states and full funding of the \nSocial Services Block Grant at $2.38 billion, and we should keep that \npromise and restore funding.\n  Providing provisions to improve our child support system to get \npayments to the families first has been a longstanding priority for me. \nFatherhood is a major issue for our families, and from my work on the \nNational Commission on Children over a decade ago, I know that children \ndo best in families with committed, caring parents. Investing in \nquality child care is an obvious concern as we continue our efforts on \nwelfare reform and face the challenges of our new economy in which most \nmothers work.\n  We should be working together to help our children and our families, \nso I hope that we will be able to promote this package of bipartisan \ninitiatives that are targeted to some of our most vulnerable families, \nwho are working hard but need help to raise their children with \ndignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/03/senate-section/article/S3353-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 172.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Resolution (S. Res. 41) designating April 4, 2001, as \n     ``National Murder Awareness Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, S. Res. 41 designates April 4, 2001 as \n``National Murder Awareness Day.'' In 1999 alone, 15,533 people were \nmurdered in the United States according to FBI statistics. Murder \naffects not only the victims themselves, but it affects the lives of \ncountless other family members and friends of victims. While murder \nrates have decreased from their record highs in the 1980s, further \nimprovement is needed as the murder rate in 1999 was still 5.7 per \n100,000 inhabitants--24 percent higher than the 1950 murder rate.\n  To help address the glaring murder problem in our country, I \nintroduced the National Murder Awareness Day resolution with my \ncolleague Senator Sessions. This resolution will raise awareness of the \ndevastating impact murder has on our country. In addition, it \nrecognizes the important role local communities can play in combating \nthe thousands of senseless murders that occur each year.\n  The idea of devoting a day to raising murder awareness originated \nwith Citizens Against Crime, a grassroots victim's rights organization \nlocated in Selma, Alabama. This group was successful in having the \nAlabama state legislature designate April 4, 2000 as Alabama's ``Murder \nAwareness Day.'' According to Citizens against Crime, this designation \nwas overwhelmingly successful in mobilizing community resources to \naddress the problem of violent crime in Alabama.\n  Mr. President, the murder problem in America is complex and will \nrequire concerted efforts by people and communities throughout our \ngreat country. The National Murder Awareness Day resolution reflects \nthe importance of these efforts. I am pleased my colleagues joined me \nin passing this important resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
