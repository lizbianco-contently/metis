Mr. President, we are moving on today, I am pleased to \nnote, to deal with this business of pharmaceuticals. It is a very \nimportant issue, one that we have struggled with for some time. I am \nnot particularly impressed with the system we have used. I am afraid it \npretty much spells out the fact that it is going to be very difficult \nfor us to come together with any real meaningful legislation with \nregard to pharmaceuticals. There are a couple of reasons for that. I \nthink we could have done it a little differently.\n  One, of course, is we do not have a budget. We have not brought up a \nbudget resolution. So the question of funding always comes up. That is \nthe reason for the votes this morning to try and waive a point of order \non the budget. Not only does it affect this issue, of course, but the \neffect is that it is irresponsible not to have a budget for this coming \nyear and be able to have the protections that a budget provides.\n  We have been talking a long time about the failure of business to do \nthings properly. This is certainly a failure, it seems to me, of the \nCongress not to have a budget resolution. We have not had it brought \nup.\n  The other problem is we are dealing with the very broad subject of \npharmaceuticals, which does not have before it a proposition that has \nbeen treated by the committee. Obviously, almost all the issues that \ncome before the full Senate--and certainly there are those that are \ndifficult issues--have gone through the committee, and much of the \nventing, much of the argument, much of the discussion has been done in \nthe committee, and then the committee has come forth with a majority \nvote.\n  This is the second time recently we have had bills come to the floor \nthat are complicated and difficult without having had their exposure in \nthe Senate committee.\n  The energy bill, which we are still involved with, which was on the \nfloor for several weeks, was pulled from the committee. It was not \nallowed to come through with a committee recommendation, and the same \nthing with the Finance Committee. So we find ourselves in a very \ndifficult position.\n  Nevertheless, that is where we are. We have several propositions \nbefore us. One is the Graham-Kennedy-Daschle bill, which was in the \ncommittee but apparently would not have received a majority vote in the \ncommittee, so it therefore was not brought to a vote. This creates a \nvery large increase of Government bureaucracy and basically ultimately \nsets price controls in pharmaceuticals, has fairly restrictive formulas \nfor the majority of managed-care companies.\n  The Graham bill has plans to cover at least one name brand drug but \nnot more than two in each therapeutic class. Pharmaceuticals is a \ndifficult issue: How to provide them in terms of distribution; are they \na part of this case in the Graham bill; and will they really become \npart of Medicare?\n  The competing bill, they have done more in the private sector, and it \nis separate somewhat. It is a real tough job to encourage people to do \nit as economically as can be done. How will generics become hopefully \nmore used and useful than they have in the past and therefore reduce \nsome of the costs? How is the distribution done so consumers have some \nchoices in terms of not only brands that are available to them but, \nfrankly, some of us are concerned in States where we have low \npopulation whether or not there will be opportunities for consumers to \nhave some choices, whether they will be able to use the local \ndrugstore, or whether they will all have to be mail-in kinds of things.\n\n  So it is a tough decision. There are differences in the two \nproposals. One will be a part of Medicare and will be handled by the \nGovernment. The other will be a private sector delivery system that \nwill be set up.\n  In the case of the Government system, of course, whoever does the \ndistribution will not have to make any particular choices with regard \nto costs or helping to reduce them. But on the other hand, in the \nprivate sector the more they can make it economical, the more \nprofitable it will be.\n  So I am hopeful as we go through this, we can seek to set forth the \nbest proposition that is possible, at the same time taking into account \nspending, and the spending in the two bills are quite different. The \nDemocrat bill, the Graham bill, over a period of 7 years, is basically \ntwice as expensive as the other bill. It costs in the area of $600 \nbillion. The other one is very expensive as well, about $330 billion \nover the course of 10 years. So either one is going to be very \nexpensive, but one quite less expensive than the other. Certainly we \nneed to take a look at the expenses.\n  The tripartisan plan seems truly to find some common ground between \ntraditional Democrat and Republican views, and that is useful. It \nreforms Medicare. It provides a prescription drug benefit to ensure \nthat seniors do have coverage more similar to employee-sponsored plans \nthat, of course, we have been accustomed to in the past.\n  I hoped this proposal could have been debated more--I have already \nmentioned that--in committees. It spends $330 billion over 10 years to \nprovide prescription drugs for seniors. Even at that, whoever thought \nwe would be talking about something in the area of $330 billion? \nNevertheless, that is the case. It is a compromise between various \nproposals.\n  In addition to simply the drug benefits, it spends $40 billion to \nmake some overdue changes in Medicare Parts A and B, which need to be \ndone. We have not made changes in Medicare for some time. The prices \nand payments have caused it to be difficult for people to get services. \nIt tends to bring the Medicare into the 21st century. It does spend \n$370 billion over 10 years to make those changes, but I think it is a \nreasonable proposal. It has a monthly premium, which I think is \nreasonable if they are going to have these kinds of services. It has an \nannual deductible which, again, is not unusual in terms of insurance \npayments of these kinds. I think first dollar payments are very \nimportant in terms of any insurance program. It has a benefit cap. The \nGovernment pays 50 percent for seniors with drug costs up to $3,400. It \nhas catastrophic coverage beginning at $3,700. Seniors will then be \nresponsible for only 10 percent of the cost above that.\n  So it is a tough program. It is one of the programs, however, that \ndoes deal with seeking to solve the problem without excessive \nexpenditure. Low-income assistance below the 150 percent Federal \npoverty level is good for the entire structure. There is no so-called \ndoughnut, middle ground, for low-income seniors, and that is good. This \nis the program that provides assistance, of course, to all seniors, and \nfor their drug costs. It gives them access to discounted drug prices, \nand seniors generally now are the only group who pay full retail prices \nfor drugs.\n  So I am hopeful as we go into this afternoon's program, even though \nunder the circumstances of bringing these bills this way without having \na budget we will have to have 60 votes to get one passed, I hope we \nwill give some thought to the only one that is indeed bipartisan, in \nfact, tripartisan, in nature, so we have the best opportunity of \nfinding success in the Government to provide pharmaceutical and drug \ncoverage to seniors, something that almost everyone agrees needs to be \ndone.\n\n  The question is how it is best done, and how we deal with the costs, \nthe distribution; what ought to be the difference in access between \nlow-income and those who are not; what we do to make some improvements \nin Medicare. This seems to be the proposition before the Senate that \ncan provide for these benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our time is very short this morning, so \nI will be brief. Let me discuss the key criteria Senators should \nconsider.\n  First, is the drug coverage permanent and dependable? Under the \ntripartisan amendment, drug coverage would be a permanent part of the \nMedicare entitlement, for the 21st Century.\n  Under the Graham amendment, however, that coverage disappears into a \nblack hole. The benefit expires the very same year the baby boomers \nbegin to retire. In my view, it's terribly irresponsible to pull a \n``bait and switch''\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\non people who depend on Medicare. How will my colleagues explain to \nseniors in 2010 that they are out of luck because of a gimmick they \nused to hide the true cost of their proposal? I ask the Senate to \nsupport permanent, dependable drug coverage.\n  The Graham amendment seriously restricts Medicare enrollees who want \naccess to brand-name drugs. Its restrictive policy will result in long \nlines for ground-breaking drugs. Why? Because Senator Graham requires \nMedicare enrollees to wade through a bureaucratic appeals process in \norder to get needed drugs that are off the formulary. And it's not a \nshort list--their formulary denies access to at least 90 percent of \nbrand-name drugs!\n  We've heard a lot about gaps in coverage. Mr. President, here's the \nbiggest gap of all: the gap between the large number of brand name \ndrugs beneficiaries may need, and the paltry number Medicare would \ncover under the Graham amendment. Of the 2,400 brand name drugs \napproved by FDA, less than 10 percent would be covered. What a gap in \ncoverage.\n  Our amendment, on the other hand, sets policies to ensure that \nMedicare enrollees get the drugs they need. We do not limit them to an \narbitrary number of drugs in each class, as Senator Graham does. We \nsupport making generic drugs an option, with lower cost-sharing, but we \ndon't think depriving seniors of access to brand-name drugs is the way \nto go about it. So that is a key difference.\n  Our opponents have talked a great deal about the fact that less than \n20 percent of beneficiaries would face a gap in coverage under the \ntripartisan amendment. But compare that number with the number of \nbeneficiaries who would experience a gap in coverage under their \namendment. Under the Graham amendment, fully 100 percent of enrollees \nwould lack full access to brand-name drugs in Medicare. When you lay \nthe two gaps against one another, isn't it clear that their gap, which \nwill affect all enrollees, is the worse one?\n  Our bill also delivers a cost-effective, quality benefit. CBO says \nthat the only way to contain the cost of a drug benefit is to ensure \nthat drugs are delivered efficiently.\n  In turn, CBO says that the only way to have drugs delivered \nefficiently is to have true competition among private plans that stand \nto make money if they drive hard bargains with drug manufacturers. \nThat's what our amendment offers.\n  Now, our opponents have gone on and on about private plans not being \nwilling to deliver a drug benefit. Well, they too rely on a private \nsector delivery system, although it is non-competitive and thus is so \nexpensive.\n  We have worked hard to ensure our delivery system works. Our \nopponents say that insurers will refuse to participate, even though the \ngovernment lays $340 billion on the table and bears 75 percent of the \neconomic risk, and even though CBO projects it to work everywhere in \nthe country. But what happens in the off-chance that private plans \nwon't want to participate?\n  Well, here's what will happen. The government has a duty--mandated in \nour bill--to do what it takes to ensure a drug benefit for every last \nMedicare beneficiary. If insurers won't participate at the level of \ncompetition we expect, the Secretary must adjust the competition bar \ndownward until they will participate.\n  At a last resort, we would end up with a Graham-type delivery model \nin which pharmacy benefit managers are simply government contractors, \nbearing only minimal performance risk. Put another way, our Plan B is \nSenator Graham's approach. So why are our opponents so afraid of that?\n  Under no circumstances will our bill allow any senior, anywhere, to \ngo without access to a drug plan. It's an ironclad guarantee, and it's \nright there in our bill.\n  Now, the Senator from Massachusetts has repeatedly objected to the \nasset test for the low-income benefit in our bill, as if it's something \nnew. What a red herring! There has been asset testing for low-income \nMedicare populations since 1987, under the Qualified Medicare \nBeneficiary program and the Specified Medicare Beneficiary programs. \nAnd Senator Kennedy and his Democratic colleagues voted for it \noverwhelmingly. There's nothing but politics behind those objections.\n  Another thing the tripartisan amendment offers is an enhanced option \nin Medicare. The enhanced option will add protection against the \ndevastating costs of serious illness, and make preventive benefits free \nto help seniors avoid serious illness in the first place. And it is \ncompletely voluntary--seniors get to choose, and they don't need to \ntake it in order to get drug coverage.\n  What does the Graham amendment have to offer beyond drugs? Nothing. \nWhy would anyone want to deny Medicare beneficiaries the choice of free \npreventive benefits and better protection against serious illness? I \nwill let the other side answer that.\n  The choice is clear. The Graham amendment offers drug coverage that \nswiftly disappears into a black hole, and it has the biggest gap of \ncoverage of all. The tripartisan amendment is the right prescription \nfor 21st century medicare. Because that is the biggest gap of coverage \nof all. The tripartisan plan is the right prescription for 21st century \nMedicare.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in the last 2 weeks the Senate has taken \nup two of the most important issues facing the American people. First, \nwe took on the issue of corporate governance. We passed a tough, new \nregulatory framework to deal with the cronyism and corruption in \nAmerica's private sector. Now we are moving on to deal with \nprescription drugs for seniors.\n  I have talked to many seniors in my State. They are really worried. \nThey are worried about corporate scandals and they are worried about \nthe impact these scandals are having on the market. They are watching \nthe Dow Jones go down along with their life savings. While they see \ntheir life savings evaporating, they also see the cost of their \nprescription drugs going up. These two issues are linked. The crisis in \ncorporate governance and the crisis in our markets, and also the whole \nissue of making affordable prescription drugs available to seniors, are \nlinked together.\n  Seniors now are talking about their own lives and times and families. \nThe two things they do not want to worry about at this point in their \nlives are outliving their savings and the rising cost of prescription \ndrugs. With the evaporation of their savings and the escalation of the \ncost of prescription drugs, they are really scared.\n  We have faced many fears in the United States of America this year. \nWe salute our military and others who are working on homeland defense. \nBut we really need to provide another defense, a defense against the \nfear of outliving your savings and not being able to afford the \nprescription drugs you need. In my State, my constituents are fairly \nconservative investors. They put money in CDs. I don't mean the kind \nthat are rock and roll recordings, I mean certificates of deposit. Or \nthey put money into conservative mutual funds. We had many of those \nfamily funds run right in Maryland.\n  What did they see? They saw as Greenspan lowered interest rates, it \nmeant a lower return on their conservative investments. Again, what is \nhappening in the stock market, they see the downside of the Dow Jones \nand no one is trusting the numbers and no one is trusting the CEOs.\n  Because of what was happening to the cost of prescription drugs, many \nfamilies got help from their adult children. But their own adult \nchildren are worried about the loss of jobs and the loss of economic \nsecurity as well. What we see in the private sector is that it is being \nsqueezed in terms of the benefits it had hoped to provide.\n  In my own State, what we see is that American manufacturing, such as \nthe American automobile industry, is competing against Japanese \ncompanies that do not have to pay for prescription drug benefits \nbecause they have a national health care system. Steel in my State is \nin bankruptcy because of predatory foreign competition. It is \nstruggling to keep its promises to workers and retirees, providing \npensions and health care.\n  I even see it as someone who appropriates funds for the veterans \nhealth care system. More and more veterans who do not have service-\nconnected disabilities are turning to VA because of\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nthe prescription drug benefit. The collapse of the system in which they \nwere able to afford that benefit is having them turn to other systems.\n  We need a prescription drug benefit, and we need it now.\n  Considering the possibility of passing a prescription drug benefit, \nit has to be a meaningful benefit, not just slogans and sound bites. \nSeniors need a benefit they can count on, and it needs to follow these \ncriteria. First, any benefit we pass has to be voluntary. It must be \nrun by Medicare, not by insurance companies that simply gatekeep, that \nprivatize profits and socialize risks.\n  The second thing is the benefit must be the same for all seniors, no \nmatter where they live. No benefit should vary from State to State.\n  Then, who should decide what medications a senior gets? The decision \nshould be made by the doctor, not an insurance gatekeeper. Of course, \nit needs to be affordable to seniors and also to the taxpayer.\n  I believe the Democratic plan, the Graham-Miller plan, which I \nsupport, meets these criteria. It answers the questions that seniors \nask me as I am out and about talking to them.\n  Who runs it? Our plan is run by Medicare.\n  Is it available anywhere I live? Our plan says yes.\n  Who decides what medicines I get? Your doctor.\n  Is it affordable? You bet. There is no deductible; premiums are $25; \ncopays are defined, specific, and reasonable; catastrophic drug costs \nare covered if you have to spend more than $4,000 on prescription \ndrugs.\n  This is what our plan is. It is voluntary. It is available anywhere. \nIt is going to be run by Medicare, not by insurance companies. The \nother plans fail those criteria and therefore I believe fail seniors. \nThe Republican and tripartisan plans do not provide a benefit under \nMedicare. They turn it over to the insurance companies. Remember them? \nThey are the same people who brought us Medicare+Choice, and they \npulled out, leaving seniors without coverage throughout my State. \nPeople had signed up believing it was going to be a benefit, but after \nthey squeezed their profits, they dumped the seniors. We cannot have \nthe same experience in this bill.\n  Another problem is the benefit will not be the same for all seniors. \nIt will vary according to different plans and different States. If in \nfact it is going to be a Federal program, it should be uniform and \navailable in every State.\n  Who decides the prescription drugs? Once again, insurance companies \nwill be the gatekeepers, not doctors, and their decisions will be based \non profits, not patient care.\n  These plans will not be affordable for seniors. They are going to \nhave a high deductible, copayments that fluctuate, and also an \nenormous, huge gap in coverage. The tripartisan plan--on which I know \nthere was serious effort--leaves people without a drug coverage between \nthe costs of $3,400 to $5,000 a year. For $1,500, you are on your own.\n  These plans raise more questions than they answer. How would a senior \nknow what he or she is getting? How would they know what is covered? \nWho will make sure that insurance companies stick by the plans they \noffer? And how do seniors pay for their medicine in the gap months? \nAmerica's seniors need their questions answered. They deserve more than \nthat. They deserve--and they need--a real benefit under Medicare.\n  I know the Presiding Officer could tell me stories he hears in his \nown State of Rhode Island. I hear them wherever I go in my home State. \nI hear them from seniors, and I hear them from their families. When you \nlisten to the families, you hear heart-wrenching stories. With the \ncollapse of manufacturing in my State, it is even worse. The fact is \nthat the farmers in my State are facing drought and will have to turn \nto Federal assistance. The fact is that watermen, who are out there on \nthe Chesapeake Bay during this heat trying to forage for crabs, are \nforaging for their health care. We have to help meet those needs.\n  I held a hearing earlier this year on the healthcare benefits of \nsteelworker retirees where I heard from retired steelworkers and their \nwidows. If steel goes under, these people will lose their prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  I was particularly touched by a story from a steel-widow--Gertrude \nMisterka. She has diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, \nasthma, and periodic chest pains.\n  She asked her pharmacist how much her medications would cost her \nwithout her retiree coverage. He told her--about $5,800. Gertrude may \nlose her health care from Beth Steel. Under the Republican and the \nTripartisan plan, assuming she could get coverage from a Maryland \ninsurer, she'd pay a $250 deductible and up to $33 in monthly premiums. \nThat is $646 a year, before buying a single pill, and, she could still \nhave no coverage for total drug costs between $3,450 and $5,300.\n  How does that help her? She needs a benefit that she can count on. \nBeth Steel and other American manufacturing companies need the Federal \nGovernment to offer a Medicare benefit so their workers are taken care \nof.\n  By passing a Medicare prescription drug benefit Congress will deliver \nreal security to America's senior. Retirement security means more than \npension security. Seniors need healthcare security to be at ease in \ntheir retirements.\n  Congress created Medicare as a promise to our seniors. It guaranteed \nmeaningful healthcare coverage. Medicare kept seniors healthy and \nrelieved their fears of being bankrupt by huge hospital bills. But \nMedicare didn't keep up with medical advances. To be a meaningful \nsafety net, Medicare must include a prescription drug benefit. To be a \nmeaningful benefit, Congress can't leave it up to insurance companies. \nPromises made to our seniors must be promises kept.\n  I really hope we will pass a senior prescription drug benefit that is \nmeaningful, affordable, available nationwide, and that we do it now. \nTruly honor your father and mother. It is a great Commandment to live \nby, and it is a great Commandment to govern by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nMaryland who spoke so eloquently about the need for real Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. I thank her for her leadership for our \nseniors over the years, both in Maryland and around the country. I join \nher today, and I would like to start by sharing some additional \nstories, some voices from Michigan.\n  I have been inviting people to join me in a prescription drug \npeoples' lobby. The idea of the people's lobby is to counter the huge \nspecial interest lobby in the form of the prescription drug lobby that \nwe see every single day. We know there are six drug company lobbyists \nor more for every Member of the Senate. Yet what we are doing here is \nso important to people--businesses, farmers, seniors, families--and \ntheir voices need to be heard in this debate. I am very confident, if \ntheir voices are heard, the right thing will be done.\n\n  So I would like to share a story from Christopher Hermann from \nDearborn Heights, MI. He writes now as a member of our People's Lobby:\n  I am a Nurse Practioner providing primary care to Veterans. I am \nreceiving many new patients seeking prescription assistance after they \nhave been dropped by traditional plans and can no longer afford \nmedications. Many of them have more than $1,000/month in prescription \ncosts.\n  The Vets are lucky! We can provide the needed service. Their spouses \nand neighbors are not so lucky.\n  I also have such a neighbor. ``Al'' is 72, self-employed all his life \nwith hypertension. When he runs out of his meds due to lack of money, \nhis blood pressure goes so high, he has to go to the emergency room and \nbe admitted to prevent a stroke. I provide assistance through \npharmaceutical programs, but this is not guaranteed each month. We \neither pay the $125.00 per month for his medications, or Medicare pays \n$5,000.00 plus each time he is admitted. It's pretty simple math to me.\n  I would agree with Mr. Hermann that it is pretty simple math, that \nwhat we are talking about is saving dollars in the long run by helping \npeople stay out of the hospital and remain healthy. It is important \nthat it be a real program that is defined, that folks can count on \nevery month.\n  Let me also share a story from Debbie Ford from Clio, MI, who called\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nmy office. Her 72-year-old mother cannot afford a supplemental, so the \nfamily pays for her prescriptions. This is a very common story, as I \nknow the Presiding Officer knows. She is the widow of an ironworker \nwhose pension continued for only 10 years. She gets what assistance she \ncan--food assistance, energy credits--but no medication assistance. Her \nSocial Security disability is $800 a month. She has resorted to pill \nsplitting and borrowing medication from others who have prescription \ncoverage.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. This is the United States. \nWe should have folks having to either split pills or borrow medication \nin order to get what they need to live.\n  Let me also share something from Myra McCoy of Detroit, MI. She says:\n\n       I receive disability due to a number of medical problems; \n     it is not a choice for me. My poor health has been the \n     hardest thing I have ever had to deal with in my life and it \n     started at age 35, my whole life over. I have lost so much \n     and the depression has made it so bad, I'm in so much debt \n     for medication, I have a second mortgage I can't afford \n     because of my medication.\n       I've been robbing Peter to pay Paul for medication and \n     trying not to lose my mind in the process. It is hard to talk \n     about this even after ten years. I hope something can be done \n     about the high cost of medication.\n       We do live in a time of damaged care, if I could work again \n     I would just to cut the cost of my medication. I would like \n     to know what has to happen to make sure all people get \n     treated fairly!\n\n  I thank Myra for sharing this as a part of the People's Lobby.\n  Now is the time to get it right, to make it fair, to make prices \naffordable for everybody, and to have a real plan.\n\n  What do we have in front of us? We have two kinds of plans: One \npassed by the House, a similar one called the tripartisan plan \nsupported by my good friend from Vermont and Senator Breaux from \nLouisiana, joining with the Republicans in this plan; and then we have \na separate plan which is being supported by the Democrats in the \nSenate.\n  What are the differences? What does it mean to the people I have been \ntalking about today, and so many others?\n  The question is, Which plan guarantees seniors a defined benefit and \npremium? They know they receive the benefit, and they know what the \npremium will be every month. This is a pretty important issue to \nfolks--to have a regular benefit, and they know what it is, they know \nwhat it will cost.\n  The Democratic plan will provide that. The other plans--Republican or \ntripartisan--will not.\n  Seniors receive the same benefit regardless of where they live. That \nis a very important issue. Whether you are in the upper peninsula of \nMichigan or the southwestern tip of Benton Harbor, St. Joe or Detroit \nor Saginaw or Bay City or Alpena, it should not matter where you live, \nyou should be able to have the predictability of knowing the same plan \nexists with the same premium for you. The Democratic plan does that. \nThe other plan in front of us does not.\n  Seniors are guaranteed affordable coverage throughout the whole year. \nPeople debating this issue have talked about the so-called doughnut \nhole. People probably think we are debating breakfast or something, but \nthe reality is, there is a gap in every plan, except the Graham-Miller-\nKennedy plan, supported by the majority.\n  For the other plans, you would be paying all year but there would be \npart of the year--in some cases a majority of the year--where you would \nnot receive any help, even though you have to continue to pay. I do not \nthink that is a very good idea.\n  The plan that we have in front of us, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy plan, \nwould guarantee people that if they pay all year, they get coverage all \nyear.\n  Another important principle: Seniors are guaranteed access to local \npharmacies and needed prescriptions. Under our plan, yes; under the \nother plan in front of us, no.\n  And then, finally, seniors retain their existing retiree coverage. \nThis is very important. I have a lot of retirees in Michigan, retired \nautoworkers and others, who have coverage and we want to make sure they \ncan keep their coverage. Our plan would say yes to that; the other plan \nwould say no.\n  On the last point, let me share that the Congressional Budget Office \nhas estimated that a similar provision to the one that is in the \ntripartisan plan, a similar provision that was in the House plan would \nprompt about one-third of the employers to drop retiree coverage. This \ntranslates into about 3.6 million seniors who would lose their \ncoverage. That is not a good deal.\n  What we have in front of us is an optional plan, optional under \nMedicare, so you can get the full clout of Medicare and get a group \ndiscount. People are covered all year. It is affordable. It is \nreliable. It has a premium of $25 a month. It is clear. Every month you \npay you are getting help with your bill. It is a very clear, \nstraightforward effort to make sure that low-income seniors are fully \ncovered, without out-of-pocket expenses.\n  And we make sure that we keep intact Medicare because one of the real \nconcerns I have, in the long run, is that by forcing seniors to retain \ncoverage through private drug-only insurance plans or HMOs--such as the \ntripartisan plan does--I am concerned that ultimately we are moving to \na privatization of Medicare. It certainly is a step in that direction, \nwhich would be certainly something that I would strongly, strongly \noppose.\n  So I say to people today--even though we are voting today--if there \nare not the votes for either of the two plans in front of us, we are \ngoing to be continuing to work in a direction to get the kind of plan \nthat we need.\n  I urge people across the country to get involved and go to a Web site \nthat has been set up--fairdrugprices.org--to sign a petition, to get \ninvolved, to share their story, to make their voice heard in this \ndebate.\n  There is nothing more important than the debate in front of us--to \nthe economy, to the cost of business, to the out-of-pocket expenses for \nour seniors and for our families.\n  It needs to be done right. We have the right plan. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Graham-Miller-Kennedy plan. If, in fact, that \nis not adopted, I urge that we keep these principles in whatever plan \nthat we are able to construct.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for not \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 8 minutes available.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. He may have all of that 8 minutes and whatever else the \nSenate wants to do for another 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will proceed for 8 minutes. I first \ncommend all of our colleagues who have devoted so much effort and \nleadership on the issue we have the privilege of debating today.\n  It is largely through their collective efforts that we have the \nchance to provide our seniors with the most significant expansion of \nthe Medicare program in over 35 years an opportunity to provide them \nwith the most important weapon in our healthcare arsenal prescription \nmedicines.\n  This is an opportunity that we cannot let political differences block \nfrom going into law this year.\n  Many of our colleagues have come to the Senate floor during this \ndebate and voiced either opposition or support for the two amendments \nthat we will vote on today.\n  Our colleagues from both sides of the aisle have made pointed \ncriticisms and voiced their strong objections over specific provisions \nin both of these measures.\n  There are honest differences and disagreements over the details of \nhow we should develop this Medicare prescription drug expansion.\n  However, it is important that we recognize something that few have \nmentioned, and that is, there is extraordinary agreement that we should \ncreate this benefit.\n  We are not debating the question of whether but instead, the question \nof how to best provide medicines for our seniors. Senators from across \nthe political spectrum, liberal to conservative, Republican, Democrat \nand Independent have declared their support for providing prescription \ndrugs.\n  We should not let this opportunity pass today because we may not see \nit again for a very long time.\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\n  Today, we will have the opportunity to vote on two approaches for \ncreating this new entitlement.\n  One approach has been offered by my friends, Senator Graham and \nSenator Miller, and others; and it is an approach with merit and one \nthat I gave serious consideration to supporting.\n  The other measure is one that many have come to call the Tripartisan \nMedicare bill. It is called the Tripartisan bill because it was \ndeveloped by Senators who are Republican, a Democrat and myself, the \nlone independent in the U.S. Senate.\n  But that is a bit of a misnomer, because it is not about being \ntripartisan--or even nonpartisan.\n  This proposal should not be about politics. It is about providing \nolder Americans with the medicines they need through the best Medicare \nprogram we can afford. We can only do that by finding a measure that at \nleast 60 of our colleagues can support. We have to get 60 votes to get \nit out of here.\n  I am very proud to join my colleagues here today in support of the \ntripartisan bill, the 21st Century Medicare Act. Senators Grassley, \nSnowe, Breaux, Hatch, and I have dedicated ourselves to this effort.\n  We have had many policy discussions over the course of the last year \nand each have made their particular contributions to the underlying \nbill. I am honored to be a part of this outstanding group of \nlegislators.\n  I believe our bill is the best opportunity we have to enact a \nmodernized and strengthened Medicare program that will for first time \nprovide a meaningful and affordable prescription drug benefit for all \nof our seniors.\n  This measure guarantees the promised care of the original Medicare \nprogram created in the mid-1960s and it delivers the benefits of \ntoday's modern health care system.\n  These are the key provisions of the 21st Century Medicare Act.\n  First, our legislation preserves the traditional Medicare program for \nour seniors today and tomorrow.\n  Our bill does not weaken traditional Medicare, make it more expensive \nor less available.\n  If the traditional Medicare program is what seniors want then it will \nbe there for them plain and simple--guaranteed.\n  Second, we create an all new voluntary enhanced fee-for-service part \nto the Medicare program that provides new benefits such as disease \nprevention screenings and coverage for catastrophic health care costs \nwhile continuing all of the services available under traditional \nMedicare.\n  Our enhanced Medicare program protects our sickest seniors from the \nhigh costs of repeated hospitalizations that Medicare doesn't pay for \nat this time. Our enhanced Medicare would establish a single, $300 \ndeductible that will save seniors hundreds of dollars in high \nhospitalization costs.\n  In addition to better benefits for our sickest seniors, the enhanced \nMedicare plan provides better disease prevention benefits so our \nhealthy seniors can remain healthy. These benefits, which are not now \nprovided under traditional Medicare, include: tests to detect breast, \nprostrate, and other cancers early when they are most treatable; adult \nvaccines that prevent a host of diseases; tests to predict the loss of \nbone mass before people break their hips and other bones; and, medical \nnutritional therapy to make sure seniors are getting the nutrition they \nneed to keep them healthy.\n  Finally, the 21st Century Medicare Act ensures that seniors will have \naccess to prescription drug coverage no matter where they live. I know \nmy colleagues will spend the rest of today praising or criticizing the \ndetails of each other's proposal for providing the prescription drug \nbenefit, but I want to be straight to the point: our plan is \ncomprehensive, affordable and sustainable into the future. Is it \nperfect? No, it probably isn't perfect, but it is a good solid plan \nthat will provide seniors with a significant drug benefit at an \naffordable cost.\n  Yesterday, Senator Snowe, my good friend and co-sponsor of the 21st \nCentury Medicare Act, pointed out that this language is not a line \ndrawn in the sand. I agree with her. It is a legislative proposal that \nwas developed, like the one our colleagues, Senators Graham and Miller \nhave proposed, in a good faith effort. I think all of the principal \ncosponsors of these bills and many of our other colleagues are willing, \nand can agree to further refine this measure during a conference with \nthe House, but let's get them out of here.\n  Over the next hours there will be detailed descriptions of competing \nideas and competing proposals debated here on the Senate floor, and I \nlook forward to that debate. I have examined the proposals that are \nbeing proposed and this is what I found that is unique about our 21st \nCentury Medicare Act. It strengthens Medicare by building on programs \nwhere patients and their doctors can choose the best course of \ntreatment and it ensures that a better Medicare will be there for \ntoday's seniors.\n  It improves Medicare by providing a comprehensive prescription drug \nbenefit and new voluntary disease-prevention benefits that will help \nseniors live longer, healthy lives. And, it guarantees that the \nbenefits of today will be there for seniors tomorrow.\n  I am very proud to join my colleagues Senators Grassley, Snowe, \nBreaux and Hatch in support of the 21st Century Medicare Act. This \nlegislation is the result of over a year of concentrated effort and it \nincludes in it provisions that should garner the support of a wide \nmajority of our colleagues.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to resolve our \ndifferences and enact this quality health care program and prescription \ndrug benefit for our seniors. I urge my colleagues to begin that effort \nwith their support of the 21st Century Medicare Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 7\\1/2\\ minutes and then my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Carnahan, be allowed to speak for 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to share \nthe story of Betty Almeida, a gentle southern lady of 75 years and a \nlife-long resident of Atlanta, who just last week came face to face \nwith the hard reality that she can no longer afford the medications she \nneeds. Betty called my office shortly after visiting her local \npharmacy, where she had discovered that the cost of the two medications \nher doctor prescribed for her was simply too much for her to afford. \nShe had been following the prescription-drug debate in Congress for \nsome time, but last week, with a new sense of urgency, she called me to \nplead for swift action.\n  Betty had been retired for a year when she learned she had a heart \ncondition. Unable to afford the medications she needed to keep her \ncondition under control, she came out of retirement and went back to \nwork just to earn money to pay for her prescription drugs. For a while, \nthat arrangement, though a hardship, enabled Betty to earn just enough \nto pay for her medicine. But recently, after Betty underwent a surgical \nprocedure to remove a blockage from her heart, her doctor prescribed \ntwo new medications: one to treat an irregular heartbeat and one to \nlower her cholesterol to a safe level. Thank God these wonderful, life-\nsaving drugs exist. But when Betty approached the pharmacy counter last \nweek hoping to buy them, she was asked for $197 for the cholesterol-\nlowering drug and almost $150 for the other. Fortunately, it was Senior \nCitizens Day, so Betty was able to make use of a $5 discount. Still, \nthe combined cost of the two medications--nearly $350--was far beyond \nwhat Betty could afford. And so, as she stood at the counter, Betty \nfaced a choice: which condition would she treat? Her doctor told her \nshe needed to treat both, but Betty couldn't afford to do that, so she \nhad to choose. Which did she need more: a regular heartbeat, or safe \ncholesterol levels that would prevent future blockages?\n  The time to pass a prescription drug benefit for seniors like Betty \nis now. Actually, the time was yesterday, but it would be an act of \ngross negligence on the part of the Congress--and a violation of a \npromise--if we fail this year to bring Betty and so many others the \nhelp they desperately need. The Graham-Miller-Cleland bill has received \nhigh marks from the AARP and\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nwill, if passed, bring meaningful relief to Betty. Forced to choose, \nBetty elected to forego the cholesterol-lowering medication because of \nits $200 cost. Under the prescription drug program established by the \nGraham-Miller-Cleland bill, Betty would pay just $40 for the $200 \ndrug--one-fifth the cost. There would be no deductible to meet first, \nand there would be no gap in coverage. Over the course of a year, Betty \nwould pay $4,200 just for the two heart drugs I mentioned without \ncoverage. Under the Graham-Miller-Cleland bill, her annual out-pocket-\nexpenses on medications, even after factoring in the $25 monthly \npremium, would be just $1,260--a 70 percent reduction in yearly costs. \nUnder the House bill, however, Betty's annual out-of-pocket expenses \nfor just those two drugs would be $3,500--her savings, just 17 percent.\n  For Betty, and for the millions like her, I urge my colleagues in \nthis body and in the House to pass the Graham-Miller-Cleland Medicare \nprescription drug benefit without delay. Anything less is unacceptable.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Cleland asked for 7\\1/2\\ minutes and \ntime for the Senator from Missouri, and that is fine. To be fair, we \nshould also give the minority 7\\1/2\\ minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat they be given 7\\1/2\\ minutes and that the vote occur at or around \n11 o'clock, whenever that time runs out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, next week marks the 37th anniversary of \nthe day the Medicare program was signed into law. President Johnson \ntraveled to Independence, MO to sign the bill in the presence of Harry \nS. Truman, who began the fight for the Medicare program in 1945. I am \nsure that our effort today to add a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare is the type of common sense measure that President Truman \nwould understand. Without this benefit, the Medicare program does not \nprovide seniors with the security and protection its Founders intended.\n  If you have expensive and debilitating surgery, Medicare will pick up \nvirtually the whole cost. But Medicare will not pay a single penny for \nprescription drugs that would cure your condition and make the surgery \nunnecessary. That does not make sense.\n  So today the Senate has an historic opportunity. People such as Annie \nGardner from Columbia, MO will be watching us closely. She is an \nimpressive 63-year-old, retired, mother of five adult children. But she \nsuffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. She lost her health \ninsurance and then could not afford her prescriptions. First she \nrationed her prescriptions by taking half the prescribed amount, even \nthough she knew, as a former nurse, that this was a dangerous practice. \nLater she had to quit purchasing the drugs entirely because of other \nexpenses, like fixing her car and paying increased taxes on her house.\n  In 21st century America, no one should have to make this type of \nchoice. Today we have the chance to make Medicare the kind of program \nthat we all want it to be. But we have before us two very different \nplans.\n  In my view, the benefit plan proposed by my colleagues Bob Graham and \nZell Miller is the superior choice. Their bill would create a benefit \nprogram that seniors could afford and could count on regardless of \nwhere they live.\n  Assistance begins with the very first prescription and is the same \nall year long. Senior will pay a monthly premium and then $10 for \ngeneric drugs and $40 for brand name drugs. There are no gaps or limits \non the coverage. And once you hit the catastrophic cap of $4,000, you \ndo not pay another dime for prescription drugs.\n  The alternative plan before the Senate is riddled with complexities \nand gaps. Before getting any benefits, seniors pay a $250 deductible. \nAfter that, seniors must pay 50 percent of the cost of their \nprescriptions. And then, once seniors have paid $3,451 on drugs--which \nis a great deal of money for virtually all seniors in Missouri--the \ncoverage simply stops. But seniors still have to continue paying their \nmonthly premium. The coverage does not start up again until seniors \nhave laid out $5,300.\n  Under this plan, seniors will be paying a different amount almost \nevery month. Some months they will get coverage--others they will not. \nI do not believe this is what seniors want from a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  The same flaws occur in the alternative plan for the treatment of low \nincome seniors. But our plan would give low income seniors assistance \nwith copayments and premiums, and 220,000 senior citizens in Missouri \nwould qualify for this assistance. But under the alternative plan, low \nincome seniors will have to pass rigorous assets test.\n  Mr. President, the reason we are passing a drug benefit is so seniors \ndo not have to sell the family possessions to pay for their \nprescriptions. I cannot understand why the alternative plan would \nrequire low-income seniors to sell off assets to qualify for additional \nhelp.\n  My other concern is that seniors be guaranteed access to a benefit no \nmatter where they live. Under the Graham-Miller plan, all seniors, \nregardless of whether they live in a rural or urban area, would have \nguaranteed access to a reliable, affordable benefit administered by the \nMedicare program.\n\n  We all know that the Medicare system is not perfect, but it is \nreliable, has always been there for our seniors, and always will be \nthere in the future.\n  The alternative plan we are voting on today, however, creates a risky \nstructure that does not guarantee that all seniors will be able to \naccess the benefit.\n  Seniors in rural areas would have the greatest risk of being left \nempty-handed. How do I know this? Because the Republican plan gives \ngovernment subsidies to drug HMOs to administer the benefit. This is \nthe same system that Medicare+Choice runs on.\n  Seniors in rural Missouri know that Medicare+Choice programs have \nshut down all over the state. We do not want the same thing to happen \nto the prescription drug benefit. Our seniors deserve a dependable \nbenefit, under Medicare, available to all.\n  Today is the day when we can put this program in place. We have a \nchoice between an affordable, secure, and reliable benefit that will \nwork for seniors--and a confusing plan that will not provide security \nand stability.\n  Mr. President, the Irish poet, Seamus Heaney, wrote that:\n\n       Once in a lifetime, the longed for tidal wave of justice \n     can rise up . . . and hope and history rhyme.\n\n  Today we have a chance to perfect the Medicare Program, and I pray we \nhave the courage to seize the moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7185-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7185-S7186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PROTECTING WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND HEALTH IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, \nwomen were forbidden to work or attend school. They weren't allowed to \nleave their homes unless they were accompanied by a male relative. For \nexample, women who laughed out loud or wore shoes that made clicking \nnoises could be beaten. There were many other examples of how women \nwere so poorly treated.\n  After the fall of the Taliban, we heard encouraging news from \nAfghanistan. Women could go back to work and to school. They were no \nlonger forced to wear burqas; that was a matter of choice.\n  A recent report from the United Nations found that now nearly 3 \nmillion Afghan children are attending school, and 30 percent of these \nkids are girls.\n  In fact, women took part in last month's Loya Jirga, a national \nconference to choose an interim government, and four women were \nappointed to positions in the interim Afghan Government.\n  Earlier today, I had the pleasure of meeting these courageous women. \nI met them in the Senate. Habibha Surrabi is Minister of Women and \nRefugee Affairs in Afghanistan. She was a professor of pharmacy at \nKabul University, but was forced to flee when the Taliban took over in \n1996. In Pakistan, she worked for refugee organizations where she \nfocused on the rights of women, education, human rights, health care, \nand sanitation.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n  After September 11, President Bush promised not only to fight al-\nQaida in Afghanistan but here in Washington to work to restore peace \nand democracy in that war-torn country. The President promised \npromoting women's rights in Afghanistan would be an important part of \nthat mission.\n  Although the Taliban has been routed and al-Qaida is on the run, \nAfghanistan is far from peaceful today. Some say the country is on the \nverge of a civil war as rival warlords battle for control of the \ncountryside.\n  Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir was assassinated 2 weeks ago. The \ninternational group, Human Rights Watch, reported local warlords are \nforcing young men to serve in their militias against their will. The \nUnited Nations has halted its return of refugees to parts of \nAfghanistan because of the increased violence.\n  On top of threats to their safety, families suffer from sabotage and \nfrom shortages of food, water, and health care because warlords are \ndisrupting humanitarian aid deliveries. These humanitarian aid \ndeliveries are essential. If they cannot be made, then the country \ncannot proceed.\n  Unfortunately, the gains Afghan women appeared to be making after the \nfall of the Taliban in many instances are simply an illusion. Afghan \nwomen continue to feel unsafe and most are afraid to remove their \nburqas. Many of the women who participated in the Loya Jirga a matter \nof weeks ago have been threatened and intimidated. Violence against \nwomen remains pervasive. They have no recourse or protection.\n  Aid workers, foreigners, and Afghan women and children have been \ntargeted for robberies, assaults, and rapes. I was told by the Minister \nof Women and Refugee Affairs with whom I met earlier today about some \nbrutal things that have taken place in that country, such as a 14-year-\nold girl raped. I have it in my mind and it is hard to get it out. \nWomen's rights in Afghanistan will not be secure if there is no law or \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent I be extended an additional 3 \nminutes and that same time be extended to the Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the rights of women in Afghanistan will not \nbe secure if there is no law and order in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's \nnew government does not have the resources, no matter what their will, \nto combat warlord infighting, banditry, and lawlessness while trying to \nreestablish institutions of a civil society that were destroyed by the \nTaliban.\n  Interim President Karzai has requested international troops to help \nmaintain order across the country. We have countries that are willing \nto come in and help. They have been told by our country that they \nshould not come. Afghan women say they feel safer when international \npeacekeeping troops are present. That is obvious.\n  United Nations Secretary Kofi Annan has called for more peacekeepers, \nand there has been a call by both parties for more peacekeepers in \nAfghanistan. Yet the Bush administration has not yet committed to \nincreasing the number of troops engaged--in fact, they have pushed \nagainst it--in peacekeeping, and they also refuse to allow the \nInternational Security Assistance Force, ISAF, to operate outside \nKabul. We need these troops. We need this presence outside Kabul. \nAfghan is more than Kabul. It is a country that has great traditions \nand has a tradition of peace, except for the past 20 years. It can be \nreestablished.\n  When President Bush began military operations in Afghanistan, he \npromised Afghanistan would have a stable, democratically elected \ngovernment that can govern in peace. We should not be skeptical of his \npromises. He should follow through on the promises he made. President \nBush owes that to the American people, but especially to the people of \nAfghanistan. We cannot let the people of Afghanistan down again, and we \ncannot allow either our allies or enemies to believe America does not \nstand by its promises.\n  Today I call on the President of the United States to expand the \nInternational Security Assistance Force immediately to stop the \nviolence, allow humanitarian aid to reach impoverished areas, and \nprotect Afghan women and children. They need our help, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a Republican member who wishes to \nspeak. I wonder if I can get a Democratic member to speak. If not, I \nwill go ahead. Is there anyone waiting to speak on the Democratic side? \nIf they are, I do not want to lose the time.\n  Mr. REID. How much time do the Republicans have now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will proceed, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7186-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7186-S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak once again, before the \nvote this afternoon at 2:45 p.m., on the Graham prescription drug bill \nand point out that that bill sunsets in the year 2010. Also, it omits \ncoverage of most drugs. First of all, the fact the bill sunsets on \nDecember 31, 2010, ought to be an overriding factor of how people vote \non this amendment.\n  Pages 78 and 79 of the bill say ``drug coverage must stop after \nDecember 31, 2010.'' That is section 1860(k), for people who want to \nlook it up and verify what I am saying.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill would not provide, if enacted, a \npermanent Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  In the tripartisan bill, we are talking about a plan that is \npermanent. There is no sunset because we know that senior citizens on \nDecember 31, 2010, are not going to sunset themselves. They are going \nto need prescription drugs on January 1, 2001, just as much as they did \non December 31, 2010.\n  We have a bipartisan program that is permanent and continues drug \ncoverage in the future. Why? Because prescription drugs ought to be a \npart of Medicare as much in the year 2002 as hospitalization was a very \nimportant part of Medicare in 1965.\n  Medicare beneficiaries should understand that there is no guarantee \nthat a prescription drug plan being offered by Senators Graham, Miller, \nand Kennedy, will continue to cover their drug expenses after 2010.\n  Some refer to this as a sunset, but I wish to make clear, as this \nchart points out very well, that this is just one very obvious big \nblack hole in this program that will sunset in the year 2010. \nSunsetting a Medicare Program seems to be a very strange thing to do. \nMedicare is an entitlement program. Dependability has been one of its \ncentral features. So why should a new drug benefit be any different \nthan any other program that we have--hospitalization, doctor care, or \nother provisions in Medicare that we have had since 1965.\n  There is no need to speculate as to why the sponsors sunset their \nprogram in 2010. It is a device to make the costs of the bill appear \nlower than it otherwise would be. In other words, it is a mere gimmick.\n  I point out another very crucial flaw with the Graham amendment and \nrestrictive formularies that might keep beneficiaries from getting help \nwith their medications that they and their doctor prefer. If we look at \nthe tripartisan plan, any drug that is available, generic or patent \nthat is available, what the doctor and what the patient decide is best \nfor them is going to be available. There is a lower copay for generic \ndrugs. We want to promote generic drugs over patented drugs if that is \npossible, but for sure we should not in any way limit the availability \nof drugs as is being done under the Democrat plan.\n  We have a poster that shows that 100-percent brand name drugs, albeit \napproved by the FDA, are going to be available under the program we \nhave in the tripartisan bill, but only 10 percent of the brand name \ndrugs are covered by the Graham-Daschle-Kennedy plan, a Government-run \nprocess certain to be time consuming and bureaucratic. If a beneficiary \nwants to appeal the fact that the drug they want and their doctor wants \nfor them is not available under the Kennedy plan, it is possible to go \nthrough a Government appeal process to get the preferred drug covered.\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\n  Why should we put people to that test of bureaucratic decisionmaking \nwhen we have other programs that are available to make the drug that \nthe doctor wants and thinks best for that patient? We do have that in \nthe tripartisan plan. Controls on the pharmacy that can participate in \nthe program, surely this is the biggest gap in coverage.\n  In any case, the important point is it is going to take another act \nof Congress to continue the program once it sunsets in the year 2010. \nOnce a program like this sunsets, it could be difficult to pass \nlegislation which would be required to extend it. I do not think that \nis a particularly good deal for our seniors. Having a drug benefit that \ndisappears into a black hole is a terrible idea, as sunsetting is \nequivalent to disappearing into a black hole.\n  I would like to have Senators who are still in doubt about how they \nare going to vote this afternoon look at the tripartisan 21st century \nMedicare amendment as a reasonable alternative because it is \nbipartisan, because it is middle ground between the least expensive and \nthe most expensive plans. It is not a big cost to Medicare, and it is \nsomething that brings permanency and that is predictable well into the \nfuture for Medicare. That is what we should have, and that is what we \nhave in the tripartisan drug plan.\n  Any Senators on my side of the aisle who want to speak should get \nhere soon.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a \ncomprehensive and affordable prescription drug benefit for America's \nseniors. At the same time, we must modernize the entire Medicare \nbenefits package by promoting regional equity in Medicare spending to \nensure access to Medicare's basic services.\n  The absence of affordable prescription drug coverage for most seniors \nis devastating, and we must address this issue with the same vigor that \nour predecessors in Congress brought to their effort to enact the \noriginal Medicare program.\n  The addition of a prescription drug benefit will be the largest \nexpansion of the Medicare program since it was initiated in 1965. But \nwe should not simply add a benefit, we must get it right.\n  Congress must pass an attractive benefit with an affordable premium \nand a provision on catastrophic costs that is an insurance policy for \nall Medicare beneficiaries. While I recognize that the cost of any new \nbenefit will be shared with Medicare beneficiaries, any deductibles or \nco-payments must be low enough to ensure significant participation in \nthe program.\n  I am very encouraged that my colleagues from Florida and Georgia have \nrecognized the importance of a comprehensive benefit through the \nMedicare program. It is affordable, comprehensive, and reliable. I am \nparticularly supportive of their effort to fund a defined benefit with \nno deductible.\n  While I am certainly open to working with my colleagues on the \nbenefit structure, I am very concerned about proposals to enact this \nbenefit outside the Medicare program that would amount to a privatized \nbenefit. Past efforts to offer privatized benefits outside the Medicare \nbenefit structure have simply not worked in Wisconsin.\n  The Medicare+Choice program has offered very few choices to most \nWisconsin seniors. While the structures of some of the private Medicare \nprescription drug benefits are plainly different from the \nMedicare+Choice program, I remain concerned that states like Wisconsin \nwill end up with few choices. As with Medicare HMOs in the \nMedicare+Choice program, Wisconsin seniors will likely be faced with \nlittle choice with Medicare prescription drug HMOs.\n  We must also harness the purchasing power of the Medicare program to \nensure that the Federal Government gets a fair price for the \nprescription drug program. That's the reason why I support the Hatch-\nWaxman reforms in the underlying bill.\n  By closing a series of loopholes in the original Hatch-Waxman law, \nthese reforms will increase competition by preventing brand-name \npharmaceutical firms from blocking generic drugs from entering the \nmarket. While I strongly support the original Hatch-Waxman law because \nit promoted competition and consumer choices, the reforms in the \nunderlying bill will modernize the law and strengthen competition in \nthe marketplace.\n  If we simply allow pharmaceutical companies to dictate the price of \nprescription drugs to consumers, the cost of the prescription drug \nbenefit will skyrocket out of control. I am not advocating price \ncontrols. But we must ensure that taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries \nget a fair price.\n  And I have further concerns on behalf of American taxpayers, as each \nof the proposals we are likely to consider actually digs our deficit \nhole deeper at a time when our budget deficit already is getting worse \nevery day.\n  In its recently released mid-session review of the budget, the Office \nof Management and Budget estimates that the budget deficit for the \ncurrent fiscal year, the one ending on September 30, will be a whopping \n$165 billion, and that includes the Social Security Trust Fund \nbalances.\n  If you look at the real budget deficit--the one that does not use the \nSocial Security Trust Funds to help mask our fiscal problems--the \nfigure is $322 billion.\n  The projected $322 billion deficit for this year is just shy of the \n$340 billion deficit that we faced when I was first elected to the U.S. \nSenate in 1992.\n  We spent the balance of the last decade climbing out of that deficit \nhole, and in the end, thanks to the virtuous cycle of fiscally \nresponsible budget policies and a growing economy, we were able to \nbalance our books and actually began to pay down some of the massive \nFederal debt that was racked up during the 1980s and early 1990s.\n  But in the course of a little over a year, thanks in large part to \nthe fiscally reckless tax cut enacted last year, the administration and \nCongress have squandered what was achieved during the previous eight \nyears.\n  Even OMB's estimate of the real deficit over the next five years is \nover $1 trillion! And that estimate may be based on overly optimistic \nassumptions.\n\n  It is against that backdrop that we are now considering Medicare \nprescription drug proposals.\n  There is no doubt that we need to modernize Medicare by adding a \nprescription drug benefit. I strongly favor such a reform. But we \nshould find offsets to fund a drug benefit.\n  It would be far better if we pay for this new program. Unless we pay \nfor this needed reform, it will always be at risk of being severely cut \nback or even eliminated. Medicare beneficiaries can not rely on any \ndrug benefit enacted under such circumstances, and we will do a \ndisservice to them if we do so.\n  We must enact a real prescription drug benefit, one that provides \nmeaningful help to seniors, and one which beneficiaries will know will \nbe there for them when they really need it, not placed on the budget \nchopping block the instant it is enacted.\n  Congress could achieve some of these cost savings by modernizing \nother aspects of the Medicare program. For example, I am hopeful that \nthe Senate will consider proposals to modernize the underlying Medicare \nprogram to promote regional fairness among Medicare beneficiaries.\n  We must address Medicare's discrimination against Wisconsin's seniors \nand health care providers. The Medicare program should encourage the \nkind of high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services that we have in \nWisconsin. By encouraging this high-quality, low-cost care, we may well \nachieve cost savings to the program and offset part of the cost of a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  To give an idea of how inequitable the distribution of Medicare \ndollars is, imagine identical twins over the age of 65. Both twins \nworked at the same company all their lives, at the same salary, and \npaid the same amount to the Federal Government in payroll taxes, the \ntax that goes into the Medicare Trust Fund. But if one twin retired to \nNew Orleans, LA, and the other retired in Madison, WI, they would have \nvastly different health care options under the Medicare system. The \ntwin in Louisiana would get much more.\n  For example, in most parts of Louisiana, the first twin would have a \nwide array of options under Medicare. The high Medicare payments in \nthose areas allow Medicare beneficiaries to choose between an HMO or \ntraditional fee-for-\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nservice plan, and, because area health care providers are reimbursed at \nsuch a high rate, those providers can afford to offer seniors a broad \nrange of health care services. The twin in Madison would not have the \nsame access to care. Because of low Medicare payments in Madison, there \nis no option to choose an HMO, and there are fewer health care agencies \nthat can afford to provide care under the traditional fee-for-service \nplan.\n  How can two people with identical backgrounds, who paid the same \namount in payroll taxes, have such different options under Medicare? \nThey can because the distribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 \nStates is grossly unfair to Wisconsin, and much of the Upper Midwest. \nWisconsinites pay payroll taxes just like every American taxpayer, but \nthe Medicare funds we get in return are much less than what other \nstates receive.\n  The low payment rates received in Wisconsin are in large part a \nresult of our historic high-quality, cost-effective practice of health \ncare. In the early 1980s, Wisconsin's lower-than-average costs were \nused to justify lower payment rates. Since that time, Medicare's \npayment policies have only widened the gap between low- and high-cost \nstates.\n  I have introduced a package of legislation that will take us a step \nin the right direction by reducing the inequities in Medicare payments \nto Wisconsin's hospitals, physicians, and skilled nursing facilities. \nAt the same time, my proposals would establish pilot programs to \nencourage high-quality, cost-effective Medicare practices. My proposal \nwould reward providers who deliver higher quality at lower cost. It \nwould also require that the pilot states create plans to increase the \namount of providers providing high-quality, cost-effective care to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Congress must modernize Medicare and add a prescription drug benefit. \nIt should do so in a fiscally-responsible manner. And it must also \nrestore basic equity to the Medicare program and stop penalizing higher \nquality providers of Medicare services.\n  The issue before us is an important one. And it is important enough \nto do it right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nissue of adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. As \na part of the debate on this drug pricing bill, we are considering \namendments to provide Medicare beneficiaries with coverage for their \nprescription drug costs. This would be the largest expansion of any \nFederal entitlement program since Congress enacted Medicare in 1965. \nAnd as I listen to the debate, I am concerned that this body is \nignoring some very serious issues, namely the cost of what we are doing \nand whether we can afford to take this action given the current budget \nsituation.\n  I think each of us here today would agree that the Medicare program \nis outdated. If we were creating this program from scratch right now, \nthere is no question that we would include coverage for prescription \ndrugs. Medicines have become integral to the treatment of disease, in \nmany cases replacing costly surgical procedures. However, in our desire \nto address one serious flaw in Medicare, I am concerned that we are \nmissing the broader questions of the impact of our actions on future \ngenerations of taxpayers and on the sustainability of the Medicare \nprogram. We cannot legislate in a vacuum.\n  I want to begin my remarks by reminding my colleagues of the \ndemographic time bomb we are facing in this country. The first wave of \nthe 76 million baby boomers will begin retiring in 2008. Between now \nand 2035, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double. We \nwill go from having 3.4 workers to support Medicare and Social Security \nbeneficiaries today to 2.3 workers by 2026. Not only is the over-65 \npopulation growing rapidly, but they are living longer. Increased life \nexpectancy is a good thing, but it also has serious implications for \nthe Federal budget and entitlement spending.\n  According to the Medicare Trustees' most recent report to Congress, \nthe Medicare Part A Trust Fund is scheduled to be in a cash deficit \nbeginning in 2016 and will go bankrupt in 2030. Spending on Medicare \nPart B, which covers outpatient services, is growing at a faster rate \nthan our economy. Over the next 10 years, the Medicare trustees \nestimate that Part B spending will increase on average by 6.1 percent \neach year, compared to a growth rate in the economy of 5.1 percent per \nyear. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Federal \nexpenditures on Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid combined will \ngrow from the current 7.8 percent of GDP to 14.7 percent of GDP in \n2030. I think it's important to remember that the Federal Government \nhas generally taken no more than 20 percent out of the economy in taxes \nto fund the government. Entitlement spending is moving dangerously \nclose to that limit.\n  David Walker of the General Accounting Office testified before the \nSenate Budget Committee earlier this year, and he warned us that by \n2030, absent any changes to Social Security and Medicare, there will be \nvirtually no money left for discretionary spending such as national \ndefense, education or law enforcement. This estimate does not take into \nconsideration any new spending Congress may authorize, such as adding a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit or increasing Medicare payments to \nhealth care providers. As inadequate as the current Medicare program \nmay be, it is not sustainable even in its current form.\n  In addition, I feel compelled to offer additional context to this \ndebate. We all know that our world and budget situation have changed \ndramatically over the past 10 months. The latest projections from the \nOffice of Management and Budget are that our deficit this year could \nreach $165 billion. In addition, the requirements of protecting our \nNation and combating terrorism have placed urgent new claims on Federal \nresources.\n  In fiscal year 2002, we will spend at least $29.2 billion on homeland \nsecurity. The supplemental appropriations bill would spend an \nadditional $5.8 billion, bringing the total to nearly $38 billion. The \nPresident's budget request for fiscal year 2003 proposes spending of \n$37.7 billion for homeland security. This amount is double what we were \nspending on homeland security items prior to the September 11 attacks. \nThe Brookings Institute recently recommended funding of $45 billion for \nfiscal year 2003 on homeland security.\n  We are also in the process of considering the President's proposal to \ncreate a new Department of Homeland Security. The cost of creating this \nnew department could be another billion dollars. The truth is that we \njust don't have a good notion of how much homeland security spending \nwill cost in the coming years, but we know that the costs will be \ntremendous, and we know that we must spend whatever it takes.\n\n  On top of these security-related claims on our Federal resources, we \nneed to remember that a majority of Congress just voted to increase \nspending on farmers by $90 billion above the current level over the \nnext 10 years. I opposed that legislation, because I believe much of \nthat money would be better spent on other priorities, including a \nprescription drug benefit. And let us not forget that we voted in May \nto create a new, $20 billion federal health care entitlement for \nworkers displaced by trade. These things add up. We're spending money \nwe no longer have.\n  I do believe that Congress should address the needs of the one-third \nof seniors who have no prescription drug coverage now. But when I look \nat the cost of adding a prescription drug benefit, it is clear to me \nthat there is just no inexpensive way to provide seniors with a \nmeaningful drug benefit. CBO projects that seniors' spending on \nprescription drugs over the next 10 years will be $1.8 trillion. That \nis 21 percent higher than CBO's 10-year estimate from last year. \nAlthough two-thirds of that increase is due to the changing budget \nwindow, dropping the low-cost year, 2002, and adding the higher cost \nyear, 2012, this projection still concerns me.\n  The various Medicare prescription drug proposals we are debating have \n10-year cost estimates ranging from a low of $150 billion for the \nHagel/Ensign, bill to $370 billion for the tripartisan bill, to as much \nas $600 billion for the Graham/Kennedy bill. Can we really rely on the \naccuracy of these numbers?\n  Last year's budget resolution set aside $300 billion over 10 years \nfor Medicare modernization and a prescription drug benefit. My \ncolleagues on the\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nother side of the aisle strongly supported that $300 billion number as \nsufficient to pay for a Medicare drug benefit. If we were to trend that \n$300 billion forward one year, we would be looking at a $350 billion \ndrug package. This year, the budget resolution that was reported by the \nSenate Budget Committee, but never passed by the full Senate, contains \n$500 billion over 10 years for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and \nfor increased Medicare provider payments and for providing health \ncoverage to the uninsured. How is it that we are even considering a \n$600 billion bill that would only provide prescription drug coverage?\n  I am firmly in the camp of those who believe that we should not add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare without also making much-needed \nchanges to strengthen the program. The Medicare and Social Security \nTrustees advise us that we can make relatively small changes now to put \nthe Medicare and Social Security programs on sound financial footing \nfor the future. But, the longer we wait, the harder it will be. This \ndebate over a Medicare prescription drug benefit provides us with an \nexcellent opportunity to begin taking steps that will make Medicare \nsustainable over the long term.\n  I want to commend the members of the tri-partisan group for their \nefforts to put us on the path toward a strengthened Medicare program. \nThey have worked hard for more than a year to craft their bill to \nprovide a reasonable and permanent drug benefit, unlike the proposal of \nmy colleague from Florida. And, they have drafted the only proposal \nthat makes any meaningful improvements to the Medicare program. I \nbelieve that the tri-partisan proposal would provide greater security \nfor today's seniors and for tomorrow's seniors. The new fee-for-service \nplan, Medicare Part E, would make the transition to Medicare more \nseamless for those Americans who are beginning to age into the Medicare \nprogram by providing them with a benefit that more closely resembles \nthe private health plan they are used to. The tri-partisan bill would \nalso provide seniors with protection from unusually high health care \ncosts for the first time.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Finance Committee has not been \ngiven the opportunity to mark up either the tri-partisan bill or any \nother Medicare prescription drug bill. It is a shame that the Majority \nLeader has decided once again to by-pass the committee process, which \nmight have yielded a product that could garner the 60 votes needed to \npass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Even more important is that \nwe would not be in the current parliamentary situation of needing 60 \nvotes to waive a budget point of order on these bills if the Senate had \npassed a budget this year.\n  In the likely event that neither of two comprehensive prescription \ndrug proposals garners 60 votes, then I would hope we could at least \npass the Hagel/Ensign proposal. The Hagel/Ensign amendment would \nprovide the neediest seniors with assistance with their prescription \ndrug costs. It would allow all seniors to benefit from group discounts. \nAnd, it would provide all seniors with protection from unusually high \ndrug costs. These benefits could be implemented immediately, and the \nproposal would buy us time to find bipartisan consensus on an \naffordable, comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  I hope we can carry forward the spirit of the tri-partisan group and \nwork together to address the needs of our seniors who lack prescription \ndrug coverage, bring Medicare into the 21st century and set it on sound \nfinancial footing, and do so while recognizing the new budget world in \nwhich we live.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan).

On this vote, the yeas are 98, the nays are 0. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Madam President. It is my understanding we are \nnow in postcloture debate time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                    The Andean Trade Preference Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the failure of the Congress to enact the Andean Trade Preference \nAct, the importance of this issue in our hemisphere, and the absolute \ncriticality of us acting before we go out for the August recess on the \nAndean Trade Preference Act.\n  Madam President, America is facing a crisis in its relations with our \nLatin\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nneighbors. Political instability and a fierce backlash against free \nmarket reforms are hobbling friendly democratic governments across the \nregion, with consequences that clearly endanger the democratic and free \nmarket tide that has swept the continent in the past decade. Yet \npartisan wrangling over other issues has prevented Congress from \nrenewing the Andean Trade Preference Act, even though both Houses have \napproved it. It is time to stop the politics and send the President an \nAndean trade bill, immediately.\n  Madam President, wrongly, the Andean Trade Preference Act has been \nlinked to the larger issues of trade adjustment authority and other \ntrade issues. I do not know why that is the case.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines the inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question then?\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is that?\n  Mr. REID. The question I have----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do I have the floor, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor and may \ndecline to yield for an inquiry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I decline to yield.\n  I remind my colleagues that only a few years ago we in Washington \nwere congratulating ourselves on living in a hemisphere that, with the \nexceptions of Cuba and Haiti, had embraced freedom and free markets \nafter long years of military rule and statist economic policies.\n  Although there remained deep poverty, aggressive free market reforms \nwere seen as the best way to improve the welfare of people across Latin \nAmerica.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, regular order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Expanded trade policies, including the Andean Trade \nPreference Act and America's vision of a hemispheric trade area----\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair to call for the regular order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Lent momentum to the Latin reform agenda, which produced \nreal gains in people's daily lives and provided a critical base for the \nconsolidation of democratic institutions and free markets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is calling for the \nregular order in debate. Under cloture, debate must be germane.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona should confine his \nremarks to the question before the body.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nArizona be extended up to 15 minutes to speak on any subject he \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Nevada. I intend to be brief.\n  I do believe this is an important issue. The other body is going out \nat the end of this week--in just 3 days. Unless we act on the Andean \nTrade Preference Act, it will have significant consequences, both socio \nand economic, in our hemisphere.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for allowing me this time.\n  Today, as we look south, the picture is altogether more bleak, and \ndeeply troubling in the eyes of both Americans and the people of Latin \nAmerica. Free market reforms are undergoing a crisis of legitimacy as a \nresult of political mismanagement, corruption and cronyism, and because \nmany of the easy reforms have already been made. It is fair to place \npart of the blame on a failure of national leadership in parts of Latin \nAmerica. But almost every government in the hemisphere has been \ndemocratically elected, and will be held democratically accountable. \nWhat is more worrisome, and within our power to change, is Washington's \nhands-off policy toward some of the very partners we touted only a few \nyears ago as a symbol of Latin America's success, their policy \naccomplishments made possible with the support of the United States.\n  Today, as our friends in the Andean region grapple with the problems \nof poverty, terrorism, drug trafficking, and the forces of political \nextremism, leaders in Washington squabble over unrelated issues that \nhold up speedy passage of the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act. \nThis trade measure is not controversial. Were it to face an up-or-down \nvote, it would probably garner 90 votes of support. But a political \ndecision made with no consideration of the plight of our Andean \npartners--to bundle the noncontroversial ATPA into a trade package \nincluding trade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance--is \nhaving stark consequences in Latin America at exactly the same time as \nthe backlash against reformist economic Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.\n  In Bolivia, the president of the country's coca-growers' association, \nan avid opponent of free market policies, won enough votes in the next \npresidential election to force a runoff against a more mainstream \ncandidate, in defiance of all pollsters' predictions. In Colombia, a \nnew President with a historic mandate for change needs our support \nagainst the narcoterrorists that threaten his government; strangely, we \nprovide the aid his government needs But not the trade that is so \nimportant to his people, and that costs America nothing. In Ecuador, \npolitical instability grows as the spillover from Colombia's war and \nthe depth of poverty threaten state institutions. In Peru, a \ndemocratically elected president who, as an opposition leader, stood \ndown a dictatorship has been forced by popular pressure to fire the \nvery reformers within his cabinet who hold the key to his country's \ndevelopment. America is not to blame for every setback on the road to \nfree market, democratic governance in Latin America. But we are to \nblame when we abdicate our responsibility to advance our interests and \nsupport our friends with the trade preferences that they believe to be \ncritical to their economic future.\n  Madam President, on Friday the New York Times ran a front-page story \nhighlighting the growing political instability that increasingly haunts \nLatin American leaders who understand that their country's development \nhinges on a reform agenda supported by the United States. The article \ntraces a political rift over free-market reforms that runs straight \ndown the continent, from Venezuela to Argentina, and whose consequences \nthreaten to upend the extraordinary progress Latin American reformers \nhave made since they ended the era of military dictatorship and statist \neconomics. I ask unanimous consent the Times article be printed in the \nRecord, as well as an opinion piece by John Walters, our drug czar, \nentitled ``Just Say Yes to ATPA.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 2002]\n\n       Still Poor, Latin Americans Protest Push for Open Markets\n\n                            (By Juan Forero)\n\n       The protest that shook this colonial city last month was \n     very much like others in Latin America recently. There were \n     Marxists shouting 60's-era slogans, and hard-bitten \n     unionists. But there was also Fanny Puntaca, 64, a shopkeeper \n     and grandmother of six. Though she had never before \n     protested, Ms. Puntaca said, she could not bear to see a \n     Belgian company buy what she called ``our wealth''--the \n     region's two state-owned electrical generators. So armed with \n     a metal pot to bang, she joined neighbors in a demonstration \n     so unyielding that it forced President Alejandro Toledo to \n     declare a state of emergency here, suspend the $167 million \n     sale and eventually shake up his cabinet. ``I had to fight,'' \n     Ms. Puntaca said proudly. ``The government was going to sell \n     our companies and enrich another country. This was my voice, \n     my protest.''\n       Across Latin America, millions of others are also letting \n     their voices be heard. A popular and political ground swell \n     is building from the Andes to Argentina against the decade-\n     old experiment with free-market capitalism. The reforms that \n     have shrunk the state and opened markets to foreign \n     competition, many believe, have enriched corrupt officials \n     and faceless multinationals, and failed to better their \n     lives.\n       Sometimes-violent protests in recent weeks have detailed \n     the sale of state-owned companies worth hundreds of millions \n     of dollars. The unrest has made potential investors \n     jittery,and whipsawed governments already weakened by \n     recession. The backlash\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\n     has given rise to leftist politicians who have combined \n     pocketbook issues and economic nationalism to explosive \n     effect. Today the market reforms ushered in by American-\n     trained economists after the global collapse of Communism are \n     facing their greatest challenge in the upheavals sweeping the \n     region. ``The most worrying reading is that perhaps we have \n     come to the end of an era,'' said Rafael de la Fuente, chief \n     Latin American economist for BNP Paribas in New York. ``That \n     we are closing the door on what was an unsuccessful attempt \n     to orthodox economic reforms at the end of the 90's.''\n       For at time the policies worked, and many economists and \n     politicians say they still do. The reforms increased \n     competition and fueled growth. Stratospheric inflation rates \n     fell back to earth. Bloated bureaucracies were replaced with \n     efficient companies that created jobs. The formula helped \n     give Chile the most robust economy in Latin America. In \n     Mexico exports quintupled in a dozen years. In Bolivia, \n     poverty fell from 86 percent of the population in the 70's \n     to 58.6 percent today.\n       Still, the broad prosperity that was promised remains a \n     dream for many Latin Americans. Today those same reforms are \n     equated with unemployment and layoffs from both public and \n     private companies, as well as recessions that have hamstrung \n     economies. ``We privatized and we do not have less poverty, \n     less unemployment,'' said Juan Manuel Guillen, the mayor of \n     Arequipa and a leader in the antiprivatization movement here. \n     ``On the contrary. We have more poverty and unemployment. We \n     are not debating theoretically here. We are looking at \n     reality.'' Indeed, 44 percent of Latin Americans still live \n     in poverty, and the number of unemployed workers has more \n     than doubled in a decade. Tens of millions of others--in some \n     countries up to 70 percent of all workers--toil in the \n     region's vast informal economy, as street vendors, for \n     instance, barely making ends meet. Economic growth has been \n     essentially flat for the last five years.\n       Popular perceptions--revealed in street protests, opinion \n     polls and ballot boxes--are clearly shifting against the \n     economic prescriptions for open markets, less government and \n     tighter budgets that American officials and international \n     financial institutions have preferred. A regional survey \n     supported by the Inter-American Development Bank found last \n     year that 63 percent of respondents across 17 countries in \n     the region said that privatization had not been beneficial. \n     ``It's an emotional populist attitude people have,'' said \n     Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, \n     a Washington-based policy analysis group. ``It may not be \n     reasoned, but it's real, and it's explosive and it's not \n     going to be easily contained by coming up with arguments that \n     free trade is the wave of the future.''\n       In Brazil, South America's largest country and its economic \n     engine, revulsion with American-led market orthodoxy has \n     fueled strong support for the labor leader Luiz Inacio da \n     Silva, known as Lula, who is now the front-runner in the \n     October presidential election, to the chagrin of worried \n     financial markets. In Paraguay protests last month blocked \n     the $400 million sale of the state phone company by President \n     Luis Gonzalez Macchi, whose government has been dogged by a \n     dismal economy and corruption charges. This week deadly \n     demonstrations led the president to declare a state of \n     emergency. In Bolivia the country's political landscape was \n     redrawn this month when Evo Morales, an indigenous leader who \n     promised to nationalize industries, finished second among 11 \n     candidates for president. This spring, the sale of 17 \n     electricity distributors in Ecuador fell through in the face \n     of political resistance, a blow to a country that has adopted \n     the dollar as its currency and is heavily dependent on \n     foreign investment. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, President Hugo \n     Chavez's left-leaning government has been intent on scaling \n     back reforms, exacerbating the divisions that led to his \n     brief ouster in April. The backlash in many of these \n     countries gathered momentum with the economic meltdown in \n     Argentina, which forced a change of presidents after \n     widespread rioting in December.\n       While the causes are multifold, many Argentines blame the \n     debacle on a combination of corrupt politicians and the \n     government's adherence to economic prescriptions from abroad \n     that have left the country with $141 billion in public debt, \n     the banking system in ruins and one in five people \n     unemployed. Argentines now look for possible salvation from \n     Elisa Carrio, a corruption fighter in Congress who has been \n     scathing in her criticism of the International Monetary Fund. \n     She is now the early favorite in the upcoming presidential \n     election. ``This has created the backlash because now there's \n     a debate all around Latin America,'' said Pedro Pablo \n     Kuczynski, Peru's former economy minister and a favorite of \n     Wall Street who resigned under pressure last week. \n     ``Everywhere you look people say, `The guys followed the \n     model and they're in the soup. So obviously the model does \n     not work.' ''\n       The backlash comes as foreign direct investment in Latin \n     America has fallen steeply, dropping from $105 billion in \n     1999 to $80 billion in 2001. A big reason for the decline is \n     that many big-ticket sales of state companies to private \n     investors have already been completed. But economists like \n     Mr. Kuczynski, who say market reforms must continue for \n     capital-poor Latin economies to progress, are worried. \n     Bolivia, for instance, was an early convert along with Chile \n     in the 1990's to what is called the neoliberal model. It \n     reined in loose monetary policies and shrank the government \n     by unloading dozens of state-owned companies to private \n     international investors. The results, particularly in taming \n     inflation and reducing poverty, were impressive.\n       But in one of Latin America's poorest nations, it is hard \n     for Bolivian officials to talk about progress to the wide \n     portion of the population that continues to live in grinding \n     poverty and feels that entitlements the government once \n     provided in the form of subsidized rates for water and \n     electricity have been stripped away. The better services that \n     have accompanied the sale of state enterprises have left many \n     indifferent, particularly in impoverished areas where \n     residents have invested their own money and sweat to string \n     up electrical lines or put in water pipes and drainage. \n     ``Clearly if you're poor and have no water, sewage and live \n     in a rural area, having three long distance telephone \n     companies when you have no phone lines doesn't make a bean of \n     difference,'' Bolivia's president, Jorge Quiroga, \n     acknowledged in an interview.\n       In Peru the resistance to privatization and market reforms \n     is especially pronounced and, for its government, puzzling. \n     Unlike most of Latin America, the economy here has steadily \n     grown since Mr. Toledo's election in June 2001 as the \n     government has continued sales of assets begun during the \n     decade-long rule of Alberto K. Fujimori. Government officials \n     say the program has been successful. Phone installation, \n     which used to take years and cost $1,500 or more, now costs \n     $50 and takes a day or two. Electrical service, once shoddy \n     and limited, has spread across the country. The privatization \n     of mines, which is nearly complete, has improved efficiency \n     and output so much that employment in that sector and related \n     activities has increased to more than 60,000 today from \n     42,000 in 1993. But government belt-tightening also led to \n     widespread layoffs. Mr. Toledo's government has been hit hard \n     by protests and popular discontent, much of it fueled by its \n     inability to alleviate poverty. Many have blamed the \n     privatizations, seeing them as a vestige of the corruption-\n     riddled presidency of Mr. Fujimiri, who is now in exile in \n     Japan.\n       Here in Arequipa, where the economy was already limping, \n     when word came that the government was about to sell the two \n     state-owned electric companies, Egasa and Egesur, people \n     recalled that Mr. Toledo had campaigned on a pledge never to \n     sell the companies to private owners. It did not matter that \n     the government promised Arequipa half the sale price, and \n     that the investor, the Brussels-based Tractebel S.A., would \n     invest tens of millions of dollars more to improve services. \n     The promises were not believed. Soon the workers federation, \n     neighborhood organizations and university students organized \n     protests, suspecting that higher electricity costs and \n     layoffs were on the way. ``Thanks to our fight, our \n     perseverance, the government backed down,'' Alejandro \n     Pacheco, a leader in the protests here, told a roomful of \n     supporters this week. ``Now we need to do this in the rest of \n     Peru.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Hill, Mar. 20, 2002]\n\n                          Just Say Yes To ATPA\n\n                           (By John Walters)\n\n       It is rare when an easy-to-understand, bipartisan foreign \n     policy initiative that is embraced by all the countries \n     involved and lauded by the Federal Government for its \n     effectiveness is developed and passed into law. It is rarer \n     still when such an initiative is allowed to simply slip away \n     due to legislative indifference or neglect. Yet that could be \n     the fate of one of our most effective South American policy \n     initiatives.\n       On December 4, 2001 the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) \n     expired. Although the House has voted to extend ATPA, the \n     Senate has not yet acted. There is a temporary duty deferral \n     in place, but if it is allowed to expire without being \n     reauthorized, thousands of people in the Andean region will \n     suffer--and we will have needlessly lost a valuable tool in \n     our ongoing anti-drug efforts.\n       ATPA simultaneously furthers two important policy goals: \n     stimulating legitimate economic growth while destabilizing \n     the drug trade. To make progress in the fight against illegal \n     drug production we must provide alternative and expanded job \n     opportunities to support economic growth and democratic \n     institutions in the Andean region. For the past ten years, \n     ATPA has been a powerful trade tool in the fight against \n     illicit drug production and trafficking by successfully \n     helping our Andean allies (Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and \n     Peru) develop legitimate commercial exports as alternatives \n     to the illegal drug industry--an industry that supplies \n     Colombia's leading terrorist group, the FARC, with an \n     estimated $300 million a year.\n       ATPA's benefits to the region's development are \n     indisputable. In 1991, the last full year before ATPA was \n     implemented, the United States imported $12.7 billion in \n     total commodities from the Andean nations. In 2000, the U.S. \n     imported $28.5 billion in total commodities from these \n     nations, a 125 percent increase. One of the great successes \n     tied to ATPA is the Andean region's development of a robust \n     flower industry--an industry that is especially important \n     because of the large number of economically distressed people \n     it employs. There are often as many as ten employees per \n     hectare of flower-producing land involved in cultivating the \n     flowers for export. ATPA has also generated significant\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\n     job opportunities in other industries, such as fruits and \n     vegetables, jewelry, and electronics. These new jobs draw \n     workers who otherwise might have been drawn to drug-producing \n     narco-terrorist groups for employment.\n       Our economy has realized direct benefits from this program \n     as well. Under ATPA, U.S. exports to the Andean region have \n     soared, growing by nearly 65 percent to a total of $6.3 \n     billion in 1999.\n       Now that the House has voted, the Senate should act \n     quickly. The passage of ATPA reiterates our commitment to \n     helping the Andean region develop economic alternatives to \n     drug crop production. We know that drug production in this \n     region is tied to our country's demand for these poisonous \n     substances. But as we work to cut the demand for drugs in the \n     United States, we must support our southern neighbors in \n     their efforts to build their economies and promote democracy.\n       Last week the House also passed H. Res. 358, which \n     expressed the support of Congress for the democratically \n     elected government of Colombia and its efforts to counter \n     terrorism. I applaud their actions and wholeheartedly agree \n     that we must actively support our neighbors in Colombia and \n     the Andean region. ATPA is a direct and tangible way for the \n     United States to demonstrate this support.\n       Letting ATPA lapse would not just be a missed economic \n     opportunity; it would be a threat to regional stability. Our \n     goal is to help these countries create an economic and social \n     environment in which legitimate industry, rather than \n     narcotics cultivation and trafficking, is the norm. We have \n     the opportunity to help our neighbors build and expand their \n     economies and democratic institutions. Renewing ATPA is a top \n     regional priority and a top anti-drug priority. I urge the \n     Senate to act quickly.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Renewing the Andean Trade bill is the most immediate \naction we could take to remind our partners in the region of our \ncommitment to reform and free markets. Unfortunately, Congress' \ninaction on ATPA is rightly viewed by our friends in the region as a \nsymbol of America's unfortunate disregard for their plight in this \ndifficult time. It is time we paid attention. I urge immediate action \nfrom the conferees to the trade bill to separate out and pass ATPA. \nThis issue is critical to American leadership and economic growth in \nthe Andean region, as its leaders will tell anyone who listens. America \nhas too much at stake to turn our back on our Andean partners, who \nconfront threats from terrorists, drugs, and poverty that threaten \ntheir governments and their people's future. Our friends in Peru, \nColombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia cannot wait much longer.\n  Madam President, I do not want to hold up the progress of the Senate \non this important prescription drug bill. But I think it is generally \nregarded as factual that we will probably not provide trade promotion \nauthority or trade adjustment authority to the President of the United \nStates before the other body goes out at the end of this week. That \nwould be a terrible mistake.\n  I will come to the floor on Wednesday or Thursday and ask consent \nthat we move, take up, and pass the Andean Trade Preference Act. I \nbelieve that is probably the only way we will get this done before the \nCongress goes out for the August recess.\n  We have a serious situation in our hemisphere from Mexico to the \nTierra del Fuego. Argentina, once the fifth largest economy in the \nworld, is facing an economic crisis of incredible proportions. \nVenezuela is in a chaotic socioeconomic situation. Peru, Bolivia, and \nEcuador are all in various stages of extreme difficulties. Colombia is \nin the midst of a civil war which at least, if they are not losing, \nthey are probably not winning either.\n  This is a modest proposal. I have been visited by the leaders of \nthese countries, and they say the following: We do not want aid, but we \ndo want trade.\n  This is a trade agreement that was made by the first Bush \nadministration. It should clearly be passed. It would get 90 votes in \nthis body if it were up by itself. We should address it, move it \nforward, and do these nations a small favor. We could pay a very heavy \npenalty in terms of socioeconomic difficulties in our own hemisphere if \nwe do not act quickly on this issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to be associated with my friend \nand colleague from Arizona and thank him for his tenacity in raising \nthis issue. The Senate is being very irresponsible in not passing the \nAndean Trade Preference Act.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona. I will be happy to join him in \nmaking that unanimous consent request and ask that our colleagues join \nus in helping these four allies. I appreciate our friend from Arizona \nbringing the matter to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I hope we won't have to \ndo it. We owe it to these very great allies of ours in a very difficult \ntime to act before we go out. The other body goes out at the end of \nthis week.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for his indulgence. I thank my \ncolleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend our Senate leadership for \nmoving so promptly to the consideration of the nomination of Dr. \nRichard Carmona to be Surgeon General of the United States.\n  Today, the U.S. Senate is in the midst of an historic health care \ndebate. So it is appropriate that we consider at this time a nominee to \nthis position of such crucial importance to the public health.\n  The Surgeon General is our Nation's doctor. He is our country's \nprincipal official on health care and health policy issues. He is the \nleader of the Public Health Service and the Service's Commissioned \nCorps, one of the seven uniformed services of the United States.\n  In fact, almost exactly 204 years ago, the Public Health Service was \ncreated on July 16, 1798. President John Adams signed a law creating \nwhat was then called the Merchant Hospital Service for the care of sick \nor injured merchant seamen. Boston was the site of the first such \nfacility, but the Service soon extended through the Great Lakes, the \nGulf of Mexico and to the Pacific.\n  As our country grew in the 19th century, so did the Service. It was \nService physicians who inspected the immigrants who arrived at Ellis \nIsland. Even then, the Surgeon General was at the head of national \ndisease prevention campaigns against cholera, tuberculosis, and \nsmallpox.\n  When the Service was renamed the Public Health Service in 1912, it \nwas the Surgeon General who was at the forefront in combating the great \ninfluenza epidemic of 1918. At a time when modern medicine was in its \ninfancy, this epidemic took more than 600,000 lives, the worst epidemic \nin American history.\n  I raise this history to make a simple point. The Surgeon General has \nbeen, and continues to be, one of the most important job in our \nNational Government. Our Nation has faced extraordinary public health \nthreats in the past, and today, the challenges are just as grave.\n  Once, the threat was cholera. Today, it is AIDS. Smallpox threatened \nour cities in the 19th century. Today, it is bioterrorism. It will be \nthe Surgeon General who will continue to promote and protect the health \nof all Americans.\n  Over the years, our country has been blessed with courageous and \noutspoken Surgeons General. They did not allow politics to blunt their \nwork to alert the public to health threats. By speaking the truth about \npublic health, they enabled millions of our fellow citizens to live \nlonger, fuller lives.\n  We remember Dr. David Satcher's work on mental health and against the \ntobacco industry, and Dr. C. Everett Koop's historic leadership on \nAIDS. There is Dr. Julius Richmond's pioneering work on Head Start and, \nof course, Dr. Luther Terry's landmark report on smoking.\n  These are big shoes to fill. But today, our country needs another \nsuch champion of public health. We need a strong and independent \nSurgeon General who will put public health first, and leave politics \nand ideology well behind.\n  In this new century of the life sciences, the Surgeon General must \nhelp us take the breakthroughs at the lab bench and ensure they improve \nthe lives of all Americans. He must lead our country in preventing \ntobacco use by our children and youth, expanding access to health care, \nending disparities in health care among our nation's communities, \nimproving childhood immunization rates, preparing for the threat of \nbioterrorism, and preventing the spread of the AIDS epidemic.\n  These are heavy responsibilities, and they demand an individual of \nextraordinary expertise and experience, who has demonstrated a strong \ncommitment to improving the public health.\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\n  Dr. Carmona comes to us with an impressive background. He has taken \non many important responsibilities. He is a trauma surgeon, a decorated \npolice officer, a former health care administrator, and a former Green \nBeret. He is a father of four children. In addition to his heroic \nservice in the Army and as a law enforcement officer, Dr. Carmona made \nhis professional mark in the fields of trauma care and bioterrorism \npreparedness.\n  The Committee carefully considered Dr. Carmona's nomination. In both \nhis oral testimony and in response to written questions from the \nCommittee, he satisfactorily addressed all the tough questions that \nwould be expected for someone nominated to this important position.\n  Dr. Carmona impressed us with his commitment to preventive health, \nand made particularly clear his intention to aggressively oppose \ntobacco use by our children and youth and to combat the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.\n  Dr. Carmona is a trauma surgeon and nurse by training. But he has \nassured us that he will also listen to, and learn from, the greater \npublic health community. There is an army of health professionals and \neducators in our country eager to help him do his job. Theirs is an \narmy waiting to be led in the campaign for better health.\n  I would close by noting that Dr. Carmona is endorsed by the National \nSafe Kids Campaign, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Dental Association, and the \nNational Hispanic Medical Association.\n  For these reasons, I support Dr. Carmona to be Surgeon General of the \nUnited States, and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of his \nnomination.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of Dr. \nRichard Carmona to be Surgeon General. He is clearly the person we need \nat this critical time for this position.\n  Dr. Carmona is exceptionally qualified for this important position. \nThe President has announced that the new Surgeon General will address a \nnumber of important health issues, among them, helping America prepare \nto respond to major public health emergencies, such as bioterrorism.\n  Dr. Carmona's education and extensive career in public service have \nprepared him to lead ably on all health issues facing Americans today. \nHe received his medical education from the University of California at \nSan Francisco and a Masters of Public Health at the University of \nArizona. He is currently a Clinical Professor of Surgery, Public \nHealth, and Family and Community Medicine at the University of Arizona, \nas well as Chairman of the State of Arizona Southern Regional Emergency \nMedical System. Dr. Carmona has published numerous scholarly articles \non such varied subjects as emergency care, trauma care and responses to \nterrorism.\n  He is also currently a Deputy Sheriff in the Pima County Sheriff's \nDepartment SWAT team and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations named him the Nation's Top Cop in 2000.\n  Dr. Carmona has also been an administrator of a community hospital. \nAdditionally, he was a Special Forces Medic and served in Vietnam, \nwhere he received the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and a Combat \nMedical Badge.\n  As you can tell, Dr. Carmona not only has the medical experience to \nbe Surgeon General, but also other expertise that will be necessary for \nthe Surgeon General position at this crucial time. Unfortunately, one \nof the key areas Dr. Carmona will be involved in is bioterrorism. He \nwill provide valuable leadership in helping to prepare the United \nStates for possible future attacks. It is very important for America to \nbe able to turn to trusted leaders if such a terrible event should \noccur and Dr. Carmona has the experience and skills necessary to \nrespond to such events.\n  I have no doubt that Dr. Carmona will be an excellent Surgeon General \nand help our nation deal not only with bioterrorism, but other pressing \nissues such as alcohol and drug abuse, and overcrowding in hospital \nemergency rooms. Dr. Carmona will also be able to bring guidance in \nthese other critical areas. His experience in trauma care will help \nguide him in dealing with the multitude of problems that are affecting \nhospital emergency rooms. I urge every Senator to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today in support of Dr. Richard \nCarmona, the President's nominee to be the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States.\n  The job of Surgeon General is a challenging and evolving one. The \ntraditional requirements of disease prevention and health promotion \ncontinue to be vitally important. We must have a Surgeon General who is \nqualified and prepared to address these issues.\n  However, in this post-September 11 world, being the chief Public \nHealth Officer also involves addressing the very real threat of \nbioterrorism. Therefore, it is imperative that our Surgeon General have \nthe background and ability to deal with this new threat.\n  Fortunately, the President selected a candidate for this position who \nis uniquely qualified to address all of these requirements of the job. \nI won't attempt to recite all of his numerous accomplishments and \nqualifications, but I would like to briefly touch on a few, simply to \nillustrate why I believe this is the right man at the right time for \nthis job.\n  Dr. Carmona's educational background, with a medical degree and a \nMasters in Public Health, provides a solid foundation. It is his \nexperience, however, that solidifies his qualification for this \nposition.\n  Dr. Carmona has a tremendous amount of hands-on experience as a \ntrauma surgeon, professor, and medical director of the Arizona \nDepartment of Public Safety Air Rescue Unit. His experience as a \nprofessor at the University of Arizona has given him the opportunity to \nteach about public health, surgery, and family and community medicine. \nAs a result, he has spent a great deal of time dealing with those more \ntraditional aspects of the job.\n  As for the more recent responsibilities that come with being named \nSurgeon General, Dr. Carmona has been working on the issue of \nbioterrorism since the mid-1990's. He has worked to develop seminars on \nbioterrorism for medical students. Furthermore, he recognizes the \nimportance of coordinating the schools of public health with other \nlocal agencies to prevent and respond to potential threats.\n  While I could spend much more time touting the qualifications of Dr. \nCarmona, I will instead end by saying I am thankful that this \nremarkable American has answered the President's call to serve.\n  As a New Mexican, I am pleased to extend a neighborly welcome to \nsomeone else from the great Southwest. As a U.S. Senator, I am proud to \ncast my vote to confirm him as the Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Dr. Richard Carmona to be Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  Dr. Carmona's inspiring story is the living embodiment of the \nAmerican dream. A high school dropout, Richard Carmona first served our \nnation with the Special Forces in Vietnam, where he became a decorated \nGreen Beret. Upon his return, he obtained his high school equivalency \nand became the first member of his family to graduate from college. He \nwent on to become a nurse and later enrolled in medical school, \nspecializing in trauma surgery.\n  When he graduated, Dr. Carmona relocated in Tucson, Arizona, and \nestablished southern Arizona's first trauma center. Later he continued \nhis education, obtaining a master's degree in public health from the \nUniversity of Arizona, where he now serves as a member of the faculty. \nAs a professor, Dr. Carmona shares his knowledge and experience in \nclinical surgery, public health and community medicine with our \nnation's future doctors.\n  Always in pursuit of more challenges, in 1986, Dr. Carmona joined the \nPima County Sheriff's Department as a surgeon and a part-time SWAT team \nleader. Today, Dr. Carmona is a celebrated Deputy Sheriff. In fact, he \nhas received the honor of ``Top Cop'' from the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, and is one of the most decorated policemen in \nArizona.\n  In addition to his service, Dr. Carmona is a motivating community \nleader. He has stressed the importance of local preparedness, and \nwarned of the dangers of a biological assault long before September 11. \nAfter the terrorist attacks, Dr. Carmona recognized the\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\npsychological impact of the events on Tucson residents, and coordinated \na team of mental health experts to assist them in dealing with the \nassociated trauma. Due to his bioterrorism experience, he was also put \nin charge of implementing southern Arizona's bioterror and emergency \npreparedness plans.\n  Although Arizona will surely miss this phenomenal man, and I know he \nwill miss Arizona, in Richard Carmona, our nation will gain an \ninvaluable leader. With his military and law enforcement background, \ncoupled with his demonstrated commitment to public health and community \npreparedness, Dr. Carmona is extraordinarily, perhaps uniquely \nqualified to address the needs of our nation as Surgeon General.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to favorably support this outstanding \nnominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the nomination? If \nnot, without objection, the nomination is confirmed.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider \nthe vote by which the nomination was confirmed be laid upon the table, \nand the President be immediately notified of the action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will be brief and yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, I hope this week the Senate will be able to pass a \npositive prescription drug proposal. It may be mission impossible. I \nwish that was not the case.\n  If we would have done it the ordinary way, the regular way, the way \nwe have handled almost all Medicare bills in the last 20-some years, \nevery single one except for one, it would have gone through the Finance \nCommittee and been reported out with bipartisan support. Frankly, that \nbill would have been the basis, the foundation for reporting a bill \nthat would eventually become law.\n  Unfortunately, we were not allowed to do that in this case. This \nparticular bill happens to be probably the most important and the most \nexpensive expansion in Medicare history, more expensive than any other \nchanges and amendments we have made to Medicare since its creation in \n1965. Yet we haven't had a hearing in committee on this proposal or the \nother proposals. We haven't had a markup. We had some bipartisan \nmeetings, but we didn't have a chance to have a bipartisan markup. \nMaybe it is because it was likely that the product to be reported \nwouldn't have been what the majority leader wanted. It would have been \na majority of the members of the Finance Committee.\n  I am very troubled by what we see in the Senate time and time again. \nIf we have a committee that may not report something that the majority \nleader wants, we don't let the committee work. That happened earlier \nthis year when we had a very extensive, expensive energy bill. Twenty-\none members of the Energy Committee didn't get to offer an amendment. \nNow we have 19 members of the Finance Committee who have not reviewed \nthis product or didn't have a markup on this product.\n  We are going to be voting at 2:45 on a bill that was introduced by \nSenator Graham and Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle and others. It \nis 107 pages. The committee has not reviewed this. We didn't have a \nhearing on it.\n  I guess we now have somewhat of a scoring by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and they say it is $594 billion over the next 10 years. We find \nout it doesn't go 10 years. This is a benefit that is started but \nstopped. It doesn't start until the year 2005, but it stops in the year \n2010. So we are going to pay part of your prescription drugs, but we \nare going to stop after a few years.\n  I find that to be very hypothetical at best. In fact, it wouldn't \nhappen. Once you start an entitlement program, you never stop it, \nespecially one that would be as popular as this.\n  But what are we starting? Some of us were estimating that the \nDemocrat proposal, as originally outlined--I say ``the Democrat \nproposal''; Senator Graham and some Democrats are supporting other \nproposals, but the Graham-Kennedy-Daschle proposal was going to be a \nlot more expensive than $600 billion.\n  Keep in mind the budget we passed with bipartisan support last year \ncalled for $300 billion. Keep in mind the President requested $190 \nbillion. Yet now we find one at 600. I thought it would be more \nexpensive. The reason why it is not is because they decided to ration \nprescription drugs.\n  If our colleagues would look on page 62, it says:\n  The eligible entity [health plan] shall . . . include . . . at least \n1 but no more than 2 brand name covered outpatient drugs from each \ntherapeutic class as a preferred brand name drug in the formulary.\n  In other words, you can come up with one, maybe two drugs in each \ntherapeutic class. For arthritis there must be a dozen drugs. For blood \npressure there must be at least eight or nine or ten brand name drugs. \nOnly one or two are going to get payment. The rest of it, you are on \nyour own. If you are not the Government-chosen drug, I am sorry \npatients, you don't get any help from the Federal Government. You don't \nget any help from this new drug benefit. You are out of luck. You are \non your own.\n\n  The beneficiary is responsible for the negotiated price of the \nnonformulary drug:\n  In the case of a covered outpatient drug that is dispensed to an \neligible beneficiary, that is not included in the formulary established \nby the eligible entity for the plan, the beneficiary shall be \nresponsible for the negotiated price for the drug.\n  In other words, beneficiary, you pay 100 percent. You choose or take \nthe Government-selected drug, which would be a very small percent. \nMaybe that would cover about 10 percent of eligible drugs in the entire \npopulation. If you don't get that drug, you are out of luck. You are \nresponsible for 100 percent.\n  I could go on and on. We are limited on time. I have several speakers \non our side who wish to address this. This is one of many serious \nmistakes that are in this bill. It is one of the mistakes we made by \nfollowing the process of not marking it up in committee. I am sure if \nit had been discussed in the Finance Committee, we would have modified \nit. Unfortunately, we didn't have that chance.\n  If I thought this were going to pass, we would be talking about it a \nlot more because it has several fatal flaws that would be very \ninjurious to America's health. It would mean rationing of prescription \ndrugs; certainly something that we don't want to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Graham-Daschle-Kennedy \namendment at 2:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7194-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7194-S7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 812) to amend the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act to provide greater access to affordable \n     pharmaceuticals.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dorgan) Amendment No. 4299, to permit commercial \n     importation of prescription drugs from Canada.\n       Graham Amendment No. 4309, to amend title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act to provide coverage of outpatient \n     prescription drugs under the medicare program.\n       Hatch (for Grassley) Amendment No. 4310, to amend title \n     XVIII of the Social Security\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\n     Act to provide for a medicare voluntary prescription drug \n     delivery program under the Medicare program, and to modernize \n     the Medicare program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I point out to my friend from Oklahoma \nthat there are no provisions in his bill that are going to require the \ninsurance companies to provide more than two drugs in any therapeutic \ngroup in a formulary. There is none. What is beyond that is what the \ncost will be.\n  In our bill, if the doctor recommends that a patient have a \nparticular brand name drug that is not on the formulary, the patient \ncan have it. We write in our bill how much that patient will pay, which \nis $40. But there is no such provision in the bill the Senator is \ntalking about.\n  The Senator cannot show in his bill what the premiums are, what the \ncost is for premiums, deductibles, or the copay. It is going to be what \nthe insurance company wants to do. It is a blank check for the \ninsurance companies. There is no provision in there that indicates what \nthe costs will be. That is the big difference.\n  Under the Graham proposal, which was spelled out in great detail last \nevening by Senator Graham and others, beneficiaries will be able to get \nthat off-formulary drug, and the price will be $40.\n  On page 29:\n\n       Treatment of medically necessary nonformulary drugs will be \n     whatever is medically necessary.\n\n  Madam President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nrequest, we had Senator Gregg managing the time. Senator Grassley will \nmanage the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I was listening to the comments made by \nmy friend from Oklahoma. It is too bad he wasn't here in 1965 because \nhe could have joined the chorus of voices on that side of the aisle \nthat argued against Medicare. He would have fit right in. If you read \nthe debate, it is almost like listening to it again. So it is too bad \nmy friend wasn't here in 1965. He could have led the charge against \nMedicare.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I only have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I was wondering why you were guessing what I might have \ndone in 1965.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just taking it from your approach here because you \nwant to basically--what the Senator is saying is he wants to turn this \nover to the insurance companies. A lot of people wanted to do that in \n1965, to turn Medicare over to the insurance companies.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield when I get done.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would appreciate it, if my colleague is questioning my \nmotives----\n  Mr. HARKIN. The point is, the Senator from Oklahoma and other people \non that side are saying turn it over to the insurance companies. He \ntalks about rationing, but what the Republicans want to do is give \nprivate insurers a free ride, charge seniors whatever they want, and \nthen they will be able to tell them what drugs they take. That is what \nthe insurance companies do now anyway.\n  Look at the debate on Medicare. Turn it over to the insurance \ncompanies. You can just go back to 1935 and look at the debate on \nSocial Security. We have heard the same echoes all the time down \nthrough the years that we cannot do this. Well, it is time we do it. It \nis time we make good on the promise to 44 million Americans who rely on \nMedicare.\n  The choice is very clear: You either do it under Medicare, which is \nproven and has a proven track record; it cuts out all of the middlemen \nin the middle ground and gets the drugs right to seniors, or you can go \nin the other direction and say we will do it through the insurance \ncompanies, which is exactly what the bill on the Republican side \nproposes to do.\n  I know a little bit about this personally. My father was quite old \nwhen I was born. When I was in high school, my father was already in \nhis late sixties, and he had worked just enough quarters to qualify for \nSocial Security. He worked most of his life in coal mines, but during \nthe war and right after the war he worked enough just to qualify for \nSocial Security. But he would get sick every winter. We didn't have \ndrug coverage. He would go to the hospital, and thank God for the \nSisters of Mercy, who would take care of him and send him back home \nagain. I happened to be in the military in 1965 when Medicare passed. I \ncame home on leave and saw my father, and he had his Medicare card. \nHead held high, he could go in and be taken care of without relying on \ncharity. But the one thing that was missing was prescription drugs.\n  My father is long gone, but for others since that time, the one thing \nthat is missing is prescription drugs. I have never been able to \nunderstand why it is that if you get sick and you go to the hospital, \nMedicare pays for all your drugs, but if you want to stay healthy, stay \nat home, Medicare won't pay for your drugs. That has never made sense \nto me. It seems to me you would want to get the drugs to the elderly to \nkeep them as healthy as possible, to keep them at home, so they don't \ngo to the hospital.\n\n  My friend from Oklahoma mentioned rationing. We hear rationing, \nrationing. I say to my friend, go to Iowa right now and talk to the \nlow-income elderly in Iowa. Here is their rationing. They cannot pay \nfor their prescription drugs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. They cut them in half, or they decide whether or not to \npay their heating bills in the winter or take their drugs; and when \nthey have to cut back on their drugs, they get sicker and sicker, and \nthey go to the hospital, and of course then Medicare pays for all their \ndrugs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I said I will yield when I get through with my statement.\n  So the Graham-Miller proposal is the one that does it through \nMedicare. It is the one on which seniors can rely, and it is rock \nsolid.\n  This is the proposal the Republicans have right here on this chart.\n  For example, they say, under their plan, a senior with $1,000 in drug \ncare costs still pays $913. That is 91 percent that they still have to \npay. And 18 percent of seniors have drug costs of about $250. Under \nthis, they would pay everything. Eighteen percent have drug costs of \n$1,000. Under the Republican proposal, they would pay 91 percent, $913. \nSeventeen percent of seniors have $2,000 in drug costs a year. Under \nthe Republican proposal, they would pay $1,413, or 71 percent. Twenty-\nthree percent of seniors--about one out of four--have $4,000 a year in \ndrug costs. Under the Republican bill, they would pay $2,688 out of \npocket, or 67 percent. If they have $5,000 in drug costs, they are \ngoing to pay 74 percent out of pocket. What kind of insurance is that, \nwhere you are paying 91 percent, 71 percent, 67 percent, or 74 percent \nout of your own pocket? Would you buy insurance like that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would you buy any kind of insurance--say a homeowners \npolicy, and if your house burned down, you would pay 91 percent? Or if \nyour car gets wrecked and it has to be fixed up, you would pay 71 \npercent of the fees. What kind of insurance proposal is that?\n  It is nonsense, not insurance. It is just another rip-off for the \ndrug companies. Again, this does not provide adequate coverage and it \ndoesn't contain costs.\n  Two weeks ago, I had a roundtable discussion in Iowa with insurers, \nbusiness leaders, and consumers about drug costs. They were united in \nsaying that not only are rising drug costs hurting seniors, they are a \ngrowing problem for employers trying to maintain affordable health \ninsurance for workers. It is a problem for younger workers, feeling the \npinch of higher health insurance premiums and cost sharing as a result. \nThese Iowans were adamant, saying that any bill we pass has to have \nsome new tools to hold down the rising drug prices.\n  Only the Graham-Miller bill makes progress toward cost containment. \nIt\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\nincludes a bipartisan plan that will close the loopholes that have \nallowed drug companies to block lower cost generics from coming on the \nmarket. It addresses the issue of the 30-month rollover that they get \nall the time. The bill on that side doesn't do that. It is crucial \nbecause generic drugs cost a fraction of what the name brand equivalent \ncosts, and they are just as safe and effective. But only the Graham-\nMiller bill addresses that issue of bringing generics on the market and \nproviding for that competition with brand names.\n  The Graham-Miller bill has the Stabenow amendment, which will allow \nStates to provide the discounts they get through Medicaid to others in \nthe State, including seniors.\n  There is also the important Dorgan amendment, which says drugs could \nbe reimported from Canada by pharmacists. If you want to know how \nimportant this is, talk to my friend Marie, a 67-year-old retired nurse \nfrom Council Bluff. She dedicated 43 years of her life to helping \nothers. She told me she is lucky compared to her friends because she is \nonly on three medications. She recently got an advertisement from a \ndrug company in Canada that would sell her drugs to her for less. She \ndid some research and got a prescription from her doctor. She is saving \nover $80 a month right now.\n\n  She has a friend who takes tamoxifen, an anticancer drug for breast \ncancer. She tried buying her tamoxifen from the Canadian company. In \nthe United States, it cost her $319 for a 3-month supply. It cost her \n$37 from Canada.\n  The problem with that is that individuals are doing that, and they \nare leaving out their local pharmacists. It is vitally important for \nthe elderly to have communication and a relationship with their local \npharmacist to make sure they are taking the right drugs and the right \ndose.\n  While I think it is fine for seniors to get their drugs from Canada \nreimported, we have to make sure local pharmacists can do the same \nthing. Let them reimport the drugs from Canada at that same price. The \nRepublican bill does not do that, but the Graham-Miller bill does.\n  Today we have a chance to pass a bill that will contain costs, that \nwill provide affordable and reliable prescription drug coverage without \ngaping holes. We have the chance to make sure we bring generics on the \nmarket sooner to provide competition and to let our pharmacists \nreimport drugs from Canada at a cheaper price for our consumers.\n  All of that is in the Graham-Miller-Kennedy amendment, not in the \nGrassley-Breaux-Jeffords, et al, amendment. If you want good coverage, \nif you want to close the loopholes, vote for the Graham-Miller bill and \nnot the fake substitute on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nOklahoma, and then I would like to immediately yield 9 minutes to the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I do not intend to object. If the \nSenator from Oklahoma should be provocative, which for a moment or two \nhe might be, I hope I can yield a moment to the Senator from Iowa just \nto be quiet, calm and reserved, and then go to the 9 minutes for \nSenator Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The provocation standard is recognized. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do we have that understanding?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, people are entitled to their own \nopinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The tripartisan \nbill--and I will let Senator Grassley and Senator Breaux and others \ndefend it--says for people with incomes less than 150 percent of \npoverty, the Federal Government, or this new plan, will pick up 95 \npercent of the drug--95 percent.\n  Under the Democrat proposal, if you do not have the Government-chosen \nplan or prescription drug, you get zero. Zero. Not 9 percent, not 50 \npercent.\n  The chart the Senator from Iowa has is incorrect. Under the basic \nplan, if you have an income above 150 percent of poverty--in other \nwords, above $20,000 for a couple--the Federal Government picks up half \nthe prescription drug cost up to $3,450--half, 50 percent--and you \nchoose your drug, not the Government choosing the drug. There is a big \nbasic difference in this plan. You get to choose the drugs, not the \nFederal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for 1 minute to respond.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I heard the Senator from Oklahoma. Talk \nabout a Harry Houdini magic trick and trying to pull a funny curtain \nover issues. If you are below 150 percent of poverty, then it picks up \n95 percent, but what he is not telling you is there is an assets test.\n  Take someone in Iowa who has an automobile worth $4,500. We need cars \nin Iowa. We do not have mass transportation. If you have a $4,500 car, \nyou are not eligible for less than 150 percent of poverty. That is the \nassets test. If you have a burial plot worth $1,500, then you are out \nof the 150-percent poverty test; $2,000 worth of furniture, you are \nout. They are not telling you that. Have him stand up and tell you \nabout the assets test and tell my elderly in Iowa, many who are below \n150 percent of poverty, that they cannot have a $4,500 car, that they \ncannot have a $1,500 burial plot, that they cannot even have $2,000 \nworth of furniture in their house. If they do, they do not qualify. Go \nahead and tell them that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, with my colleague's indulgence, I ask \nunanimous consent that I follow the Senator from Louisiana for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank my colleague \nfor yielding me time.\n  On this amendment, on the argument in which the two colleagues were \nengaged, there is already an assets test for Medicare. The assets test \nis part of the concept of delivering health care in this country. If \nsomeone has low income but has assets--a house in Florida, a large bank \naccount, investments in stock--those assets are always considered to \ndetermine whether a person is eligible for Medicaid. We have all \nsupported that. It is not new.\n  The purpose of my taking the limited time that I have is not to \ncriticize the other approach because our approach cannot be good just \nbecause the others are deficient. The tripartisan plan should be able \nto stand on what it stands for, not because the Graham plan is \ndeficient in any particular area. So I am not going to spend my time \ntalking about any perceived deficiencies in their plan but rather \nexplain what we have presented to the Senate.\n  Legislating is the art of the possible. It is not trying to get \nsomething done that cannot happen. There are a number of proposals \ntrying out how we are going to do what everybody thinks we should do, \nand that is an attempt to provide some reform to Medicare and at the \nsame time do what we should have done in 1965, and that is to cover \nprescription drugs under Medicare.\n  Prescription drugs today are equally as important as a hospital bed \nwas in 1965. Mostly that is on what Medicare tried to focus. It should \ncover prescription drugs, we all agree. There are various proposals as \nto how we should do that, ranging from $150 billion over 10 years, the \nHagel proposal from the Republican side; the House has a plan for about \n$350 billion which includes provider givebacks; the Graham proposal is \n$594 billion dollars; our proposal is Medicare reform and a \nprescription drug plan that is about $370 billion, which I think fits \nbetween the various proposals.\n  Every one of us should remember from where the money is coming. The \nmoney on any plan is coming from the Social Security trust fund. Our \nplan, the Graham plan, the Hagel plan--all of it is taking the money \nfor the people today out of the trust fund for Social Security for our \nchildren and our\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\ngrandchildren. That is from where it is coming.\n  I can say I want $1 trillion, but from where is it coming? We have to \nbe realistic in these economic times to recognize there is not a whole \nlot of money floating around that we can do with what we think is \nappropriate without doing grave damage to the Social Security trust \nfund for our children and our grandchildren.\n  What we have tried to do in the tripartisan approach is to figure out \nwhat is a good drug delivery system and what is an affordable price. I \nmentioned the price we have is about $370 billion, which includes about \n$30 billion for reforming Medicare, which desperately needs reforming.\n  The model we have used is to ask: What has worked? One approach that \nhas worked is the health care plan I have as a Senator--it is a pretty \ngood plan; we wrote it--as do about 9 million other Federal employees. \nIt is contained in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan that we \nget every year. We get to choose our drug plan or our health plan. We \nhave private contractors come in and say: This is what we can offer to \nprovide you health care at this price.\n  What we have tried to do in the tripartisan plan is say let's combine \nthe best of what Government can do with the best of what the private \nsector can do. Some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle would \nsay the private sector should do everything--keep the Government out of \nit. Some on my side of the aisle will say we need to have a Government-\nrun program because nothing else is going to work.\n  The truth is, the best of what both can do needs to be combined, and \nthat is exactly what the tripartisan plan has attempted to do. We \ncombine the best of what Government can do, i.e., helping to raise the \nmoney to pay for it; No. 2, supervising it to make sure nobody in the \nprivate sector tries to scam it; to have Government controls and \nGovernment approvals over all segments of participation, and then what \nthe private sector can do is bring about innovation and bring about \ncompetition to help keep costs down. So that is the proposal we have \nbefore the Senate.\n  Some have said that is not going to work because the big insurance \ncompanies are somehow going to try to rip off the beneficiaries in this \ncountry. Well, there are insurance companies right now that provide \nMedicare to beneficiaries, which is supervised by the Federal \nGovernment. Blue Cross and Aetna regularly provide all of the benefits, \nthe hospitals and doctor coverage, under a contract with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What we are saying is have the same type of delivery system for \nprescription drugs but have the plans have some of the risks. We are \ntalking about Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Aetna and Merck-Medco, \nnational operations that are big boys in this business. Under the \nGraham plan, they say we are going to have a management contract with \nthem, but if they overshoot their costs and their costs are more than \nthey say they are going to be, the taxpayer is going to pay the \ndifference. The difference in our plan says these guys are big players \nand if they say they can provide prescription drugs for $100 per \nbeneficiary, and it ends up costing $102, they are going to have to \nassume the risk. They are going to have to eat their mistake, not the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  Why is that important? It is important because if they know they are \non the hook for some of the risk, they are going to have an incentive \nto negotiate the best possible price with the pharmaceutical companies \nin order to make sure the price they say they can do it for is, in \nfact, that price or even less. They will then have an incentive.\n  What kind of an incentive does a provider have if they know when they \nbid costs more than that, the taxpayer is going to pick up the cost? \nThat is exactly what the other approach does and why I think the \napproach, by saying these companies should have some of the risk, not \nall of it, but they ought to have enough risk to make sure they \nnegotiate and compete, and that is one of the differences in our plan.\n  All of this is done under the supervision of the Health and Human \nServices Secretary to make sure the plans they present do not try to \nscam the beneficiaries, do not try to cherry-pick only the healthiest. \nThe Government can do that, and in our plan the Government does that.\n  One of the other concerns I have had is that people have said it is \nnot going to work in rural areas; Medicare+Choice does not work in \nrural areas. And that is true. One of the reasons is that \nMedicare+Choice has to do a lot more than just provide prescription \ndrugs. They have to have a hospital in a rural area, doctors, emergency \nrooms, ambulance services, all the things that are necessary to create \na health care system in a rural area. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nthat is a very difficult challenge.\n\n  If only prescription drugs are being delivered, that infrastructure \nis not needed. The only thing that is needed is a doctor to write a \nprescription and a drugstore to fill it, or a mailbox if one chooses to \ndo it by mail order. The entire infrastructure is not needed as it is \nunder Medicare+Choice.\n  What we say in the bill very clearly is that every administrator \nshall, consistent with the requirements, approve at least two contracts \nto offer a Medicare prescription drug plan in an area. What that means \nis that every person, even in the most rural part of America, has to \nhave at least two people or two companies offering prescription drugs \nto the people in that area. If only one bids, the Government can make \nthe assumption of the risk even greater until one gets at least two \nplans to compete. If one ends up with only one, the Government will be \nthe one that provides the other alternative.\n  So rural areas are protected. Can't we tighten that up? I am \ncertainly willing to try and do it. I think we state very clearly that \nevery part of the country has to have at least two plans offered to \nthem on a competitive basis. That is what the law would be. The \nGovernment has to make sure that there are two plans, and if someone \ndoes not get two plans, then the Government will come in and offer the \nprescription drugs to the people in the area.\n  Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, pick the most rural \npart of New York or the most rural part of Montana and there is a \nFederal employee who probably works in one of those counties that has \nFederal health insurance. They get it in the most rural part of this \ncountry, under a system that utilizes private contractors to provide \nit. They get their prescription drugs under the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan.\n  The other part is that people have said there is too much flexibility \nin our plan. Every plan that everybody gets, including mine, has \nflexibility of choice. We can pick the plan that is actuarially \nequivalent and pick the one that makes the most sense for us.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would conclude by saying I think we have offered \nsomething that is possible, that is doable and that we can actually \nadopt. I think that is a good suggestion this body ought to take under \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, Eli Lilly has a discount card. It is \ncalled Lilly Answers. The card is supposed to give low-income seniors a \n30-day supply of any Lilly drug for a $12 fee. Sounds like a great \ndeal, but when one reads the fine print, it turns out that a lot of \ndrugs are excluded.\n  Noland Decks from Winona sent me this letter about his sister:\n\n       I am writing to relate to you the prescription medicine \n     situation for my sister, Hazel Decks, who has Parkinson's \n     disease. Her income is such that she has qualified for the \n     Lilly Answers program which is supposed to give her a one \n     month supply of Permax for $12. When I approached the \n     pharmacy to get her prescription refilled, I was informed \n     that Eli Lilly has chosen to exclude this medication from the \n     program, in spite of the fact that the bottle says it is \n     manufactured by Lilly. I contacted Lilly and could find no \n     one who would explain why. I now believe that they will not \n     allow it because it is too expensive. The 30 day supply costs \n     Hazel $375.\n\n  For Parkinson's medication. I had two parents with Parkinson's \ndisease.\n\n       Her Social Security check is $479 a month.\n\n  I give this example because in 5 minutes I cannot even begin to cover \nthe ground, but there are about three or four thoughts that come to \nmind as we come close to a vote. First, I do not think, based upon what \nwe have seen in the last month or two, anybody any longer would believe \nthat the Arthur\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nAndersens of this world should be writing any kind of reform \nlegislation when it comes to securities reform, when it comes to \nprotecting investors and consumers. I do not believe that hardly \nanybody in the Senate would argue that when it comes to a clean air \nbill or a clean water bill that environmental polluters should write \nthat legislation.\n  So it is, I do not believe that the pharmaceutical companies ought to \nbe writing a prescription drug benefit plan. I think it is a mistake.\n  What are the differences? I will not go through all the numbers. \nEverybody has heard the numbers. To me, the differences are as follows: \nIn the Graham-Kennedy-Miller plan, at least there is a defined benefit. \nDoes it sound familiar, a ``defined benefit''? Not defined \ncontribution. Senior citizens' prescription drug coverage is part of \nMedicare. It is a defined benefit. They know what they are going to be \neligible for and they are going to have the coverage.\n  The competing proposal basically has the Federal Government farming \nout a subsidy to private health insurance plans, Medicare managed-care \nplans, and basically saying we hope to give enough of a subsidy that \nthey then will provide the benefit. It is a suggested benefit. It is \nnot a defined benefit. There is no security for senior citizens with \nthis alternative.\n  For my own part, I will go one step further. When there is too high a \ndeductible or there is a doughnut hole where a lot of seniors are \nworried about what they are going to do about these expenses as they \nrun up $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 a month, that is the other big issue. We \ndo not want to have a huge gap where people get no coverage, and that \nis exactly what is in the competing proposal.\n  Finally, I say to all of my colleagues, which is a different point, \nbut I get a chance to say this, I want to see us do better on discounts \nand cost containment. I want to see us for sure support the Schumer-\nMcCain amendment on generic drugs. I want to make sure this \nreimportation from Canada actually is put into effect--it looks like \nthe administration does not want to--because of the huge discount for \nsenior citizens and other seniors as well. I would personally like to \nsee the Federal Government become a bargaining agent for 40 million \nMedicare recipients, and in the Graham-Kennedy-Miller bill there is \nallowance for the different managers around the country, benefit \nmanagers to do that work getting discounts. I want to see the States \nbuilding on the Stabenow amendment and see States able to recoup some \nof the savings they get from exacting a discount for people with no \ncoverage now and adding that on to medical assistance.\n\n  Colleagues, what is going on is there are quite a few Senators in \ngood faith--I don't assume bad faith--who do not believe there is a \nmajor government role here. They do not believe this ought to be part \nof Medicare. They are not quite sure they believe in Medicare, though \nit has been an enormously successful program. We should extend \nprescription drug benefits to Medicare and make it a clear, defined \nbenefit that is affordable for senior citizens. That is the right thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 5 minutes and \n40 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Madam President, soon we will vote on one of the most important \nmatters facing the Nation--whether to provide within Medicare a \nprescription drug benefit. In order to strengthen Medicare, we must \ninclude affordable prescription drug coverage as part of the package. \nToo many seniors today find prescription drugs unaffordable. The high \ncost of prescription drugs serves as a barrier between seniors and the \nhealth care security they deserve--which this body has promised them.\n  There is only one proposal that accomplishes the goal of modernizing \nMedicare and including a prescription drug benefit within Medicare: \nthat is the tripartisan bill. Senator Snowe, a Republican, Breaux, a \nDemocrat, Jeffords, an Independent, Hatch, a Republican, Grassley, a \nRepublican, Collins, a Republican, and Landrieu, a Democrat, \ncollectively have sponsored this bill which reduces the cost of \nprescription drugs and provides a stable and sustainable prescription \ndrug benefit. The word ``sustainable'' is critical.\n  The tripartisan bill provides low-income seniors and those with \ninitially high drug costs special additional coverage in order to give \nthem security. It expands and improves Medicare benefits under the \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service program that seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities are comfortable with and understand \ntoday. It begins the critical element of instilling competition as we \nseek to add a new benefit--which means prudent decisionmaking will be \nmade. The tripartisan bill is designed to be permanent, sustainable, \naffordable and responsible. Even though the cost--$370 billion--goes \nbeyond what was intended in the initial budget, I believe it is a \nreasonable first step.\n  In closing, the tripartisan bill is not perfect, but it is clearly \nmore responsible than the alternative bill. Many think $370 billion, \nthe cost of this bill, is high. And it is high, especially since it is \nnot coupled with as much reform as I think will be required to \nultimately strengthen Medicare. Additionally, the bill lacks some of \nthe necessary reforms that are needed to make Medicare truly \nsustainable--considering that the number of seniors will double in the \nnext 30 years. Finally, the bill is not immediate, but neither is the \nalternative bill.\n  The time to help seniors is now. We must act now, act responsibly, \nand implement a plan that can be sustained. I will support the \ntripartisan bill because it provides the best and only real opportunity \nfor progress this year on this important issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  This debate taking place in the Senate is about people's lives. We \nhave senior citizens who desperately need a prescription drug benefit. \nThis is what they want. They want one that is affordable and reliable. \nIt is no more complicated than that.\n  The Graham-Miller bill meets that criteria. Unfortunately, the bill \nfrom the other side does not for at least two major reasons. It turns \nthe prescription drug benefit over to private insurance companies. The \ninsurance companies themselves have said this will not work. It will \nnot work because they are in the business of making a profit. They will \nonly go to the markets where it is profitable. That means there will be \nmillions of senior citizens around this country with no access to a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Second, it has an enormous gap in coverage. For those who have $400 a \nmonth in prescription drug costs, there will be 3 or 4 months toward \nthe end of the year where they will get no coverage at all, no help for \ntheir prescription drugs, although every month they are writing a \npremium check. That makes no sense. Those problems are taking care of \nin the Graham-Miller bill.\n  In addition, we have to bring the cost of prescriptions under \ncontrol. That is why, no matter what, we have to pass the underlying \nbill that gets generics in the marketplace, stops the frivolous use of \npatents to keep generics out of the marketplace so we can have \ncompetition and bring down the cost of prescription drugs for everyone.\n  Second, to allow, in a safe fashion approved by the FDA, for drugs \nfrom Canada at lower cost to be brought into the United States so folks \ncan buy at a lower cost.\n  Third, to allow States to make prescription drugs available to the \nuninsured at the same cost of those of us with health insurance and \nthose in the Medicaid Program pay, to make the same cost available to \nthem that is available to everyone else so they are not taken advantage \nof.\n  Those things will help make this prescription drug benefit \naffordable.\n  Last, in addition to all of that, this has to be considered in the \ncontext of a responsible fiscal budget, in order to get this country \nback on the path to fiscal discipline. In January of 2001, there was a \n$5.6 trillion projected surplus; $5 trillion of it is gone. Why? The \nbiggest single reason is because of a tax cut proposed by the President \nthat\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\nhas now been passed and signed into law.\n  To get this country back on the path to fiscal discipline, which it \nso desperately needs to be able to afford a prescription drug benefit, \nwe ought to do at least three things; First, we ought to have pay-as-\nyou-go rules apply in this Congress; Second, we ought to follow \nspending caps; Third, we ought to do something about the top layer of \nthe tax cut for the 1 percent of Americans, the highest earning, \nrichest people in America, scheduled to go into effect in the year \n2004, to ask them to give up that tax cut in order to help their fellow \nAmericans, in order to help us get back on the path to fiscal \ndiscipline and operate this Federal Government and this Federal budget \nin a responsible way.\n  The American people want us to do all these things. Give them a real \nprescription drug benefit, one that is affordable, one that is \nreliable, one they know they can depend on to bring down the cost of \nprescription drugs and find a way to pay for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I may consume of the \nremaining 2 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  First, I am happy to hear the Senator from North Carolina mention the \nprescription drug program has to be within the context of a fiscally \nsound budget process. I agree with that. But I think that is very much \nan argument for a piece of legislation that is permanent as the \ntripartisan plan is, as opposed to a sunsetted provision coming from \nthe other side of the aisle that is $370 billion as opposed to $595 \nbillion, the latter being the figure from the other side of the aisle. \nJust basically getting more for your money in the sense that CBO has \nscored the tripartisan program as the only program that brings down \ndrug prices because of competition and the efficiency with which they \nare delivered as opposed to the program on the other side of the aisle \nthat is very much a partisan plan as opposed to our bipartisan plan \nthat drives up the price of drugs according to the CBO, which is our \nnonpartisan scoring arm.\n  Also, for the benefit of the Senator from Massachusetts who is still \nhere and my colleague from the State of Iowa who is not here, I go back \nto the assets test. I think they think they have something. But the \npoint of the matter is, they do not. We have heard these repeated \nobjections to the assets test for low-income benefits in our bill as if \nit is something new. That is a red herring. There has been an assets \ntest for low-income Medicare populations since 1987, and I happen to \nknow that these programs passed by overwhelming margins--under the \nqualified Medicare beneficiary program as one example, as a specified \nMedicare beneficiary program as a second--and these programs have \npassed overwhelmingly with the support of my Democrat friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I think that is injecting an argument into the program that is not \nlegitimate.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? What \nis pending?\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4309 and 4310\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes for debate, to be equally divided between the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, whom I do \nnot see in the Chamber yet, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to vote for the Graham-Miller \namendment because it is, to my mind, the best proposal before us. It \nwill provide affordable prescription drug coverage throughout the \ncountry. I think that is the best policy.\n  But it now appears there may not be enough votes for that amendment. \nThe same, I might add, is also true of the Grassley amendment, which \nembodies the so-called tripartisan approach.\n  If that turns out to be the case, we will be at a stalemate. At that \npoint, we will have to decide whether there is some way to resolve our \nremaining differences so we can write a prescription drug bill that can \npass.\n  With that in mind, I would like to briefly discuss the three key \nremaining differences.\n  The first, and probably most significant, is referred to as the \ndelivery model. That may sound like some kind of technical jargon, but \nit is actually a very important matter and will determine whether we \nare passing some theoretical, pie-in-the-sky prescription drug benefit \nthat works on paper but fails out in the real world or whether we are \npassing one that will really get prescription drugs to seniors at \naffordable prices.\n  There are two approaches.\n  Under the Graham-Miller approach, prescription drugs will simply be \nadded to the existing Medicare Program, with some new incentives for \nefficient administration.\n  Under the Grassley approach, in contrast, prescription drugs will be \nprovided through a new, market-based system that relies on private \ninsurance companies.\n  People may ask: Why not try something new? What is wrong with a new \nmarket-based system?\n  Simply this: The new system is untested and may leave seniors without \nadequate coverage, especially in rural States such as my State of \nMontana.\n  Let me explain. Montana seniors, like those living in other rural \nareas, lack the rich retiree coverage options their urban counterparts \nenjoy. There just are not as many large companies offering benefits to \nretired workers in my State of Montana as there are in other parts of \nthe country.\n  We also do not have any Medicare+Choice plans offering free or low-\ncost drugs to beneficiaries as in places such as Florida or some other \nparts of the country. In addition, our Medigap rates are higher than \nthe national average and Medicaid coverage is lower.\n  On top of all that, we have been burned in the past by the promises \nof competition and efficiency. Rural areas often get the short end of \nthe stick when we deregulate and leave people at the complete mercy of \nmarket forces that favor highly-populated areas. Consider airline \nderegulation, managed care, and energy deregulation, to name a few.\n\n  I don't want to overstate the case. I'm not saying that a new \napproach is absolutely unworkable. But I am not willing to buy a pig in \na poke. I want a reasonable assurance that a private insurance model \nwill work.\n  I know that many other Senators share my concern. How can we address \nthis concern? Is there another way, another idea? There may be.\n  In essence, we would shift to a new, market-oriented system but do it \ngradually, with plenty of safeguards to make sure that it really works, \nespecially in rural areas and other underserved areas.\n  The resulting system might not be quite as efficient as some would \nlike but in exchange, it is more stable than it otherwise would be \nunder the private model.\n  The second key difference, between the two main proposals, is how \nmuch to spend on a prescription drug benefit. Clearly, we are talking \nabout a big investment of government dollars, and even at the amounts \nwe are considering here, we won't buy a benefit that will meet seniors' \nexpectations.\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n  The proposals that include a so-called doughnut, or coverage gap, \ngive pause for concern, simply because during some parts of the year, \nseniors would not receive any assistance. I don't want to belabor the \npoint, as I know many others have talked about this problem over the \npast few days.\n  To my mind, the Graham-Miller bill is right about on target, and I \nhope that those who support the Grassley approach can, in the spirit of \ncompromise, agree to devote some further resources to helping our \nseniors.\n  The final key difference involves what is referred to as ``Medicare \nreform.'' That means making additional changes to the Medicare system, \nbeyond those necessary to provide a prescription drug benefit.\n  With due respect to the proponents of reform, I believe that we \nshould keep our eye on the ball. We have limited resources. Many of the \nreforms are untested and, in some cases, risky. We will have other \nopportunities to consider broader changes to the Medicare program.\n  In light of this, I suggest that we defer the debate about additional \nreforms until a later date, and concentrate on prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Those are the key differences. Delivery model, spending, and other \nreforms.\n  Are they significant? They certainly are.\n  Can they be resolved? If we roll up our sleeves and put the interests \nof seniors ahead of politics or theory, we will get it done.\n  I yield the floor and encourage my colleagues in the next several \ndays to work to find a compromise that gets the large vote and protects \nour seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the moment is at hand when the Senate will \ndetermine the fate of prescription drug coverage for our Nation's \nseniors. I hope we will not allow a 60-vote threshold to stand between \nus and the possibility of passing a meaningful benefit for our Nation's \nseniors. That would be doing a tremendous disservice to those seniors \nwho desperately need prescription drug coverage. I hope we will avoid \nthe procedural gymnastics and do what is right.\n  The tripartisan plan is the only plan that has across-the-aisle \npolitical support. We worked on this endeavor for more than a year. I \nhope Members of the Senate will give it serious consideration.\n  The facts speak for themselves on the tripartisan plan. Our plan is \npermanent. It does not sunset as the Graham proposal that sunsets after \n2010. The language is right in the legislation. We have never, ever \nadded a temporary benefit to the Medicare Program in its 37-year \nhistory, and we should not start now. It is providing a false hope to \nseniors who need this type of coverage. They should not have to beat \nthe clock when it comes to their own health care. I guess you had \nbetter not get sick after 2010 because that benefit will expire.\n  The tripartisan plan is universal, applying to seniors no matter \nwhere they live in America, with the lowest premium offered of any bill \neither in the House or the Senate, thanks to a 75-percent Federal \nsubsidy, which is higher than what Federal employees get under their \nhealth care coverage. Our opponents' plan not only creates a higher \npremium, but they also increase the prices of prescription drugs. That \nis not our projection; it is the projection of the Congressional Budget \nOffice that estimates it could be anywhere as high as 15 percent, but \nat least 8 percent, in driving up the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n  It is also estimated under the tripartisan plan that 99 percent of \nseniors will participate, and 80 percent of those who do will never \nreach our benefit limit of $3,450.\n  I remind Members that we have a catastrophic benefit of $3,700 to \nprotect people's out-of-pocket costs that are very high. Seniors in our \nplan will pay less on copayments, less on copayments under our plan for \n39 out of the top 50 prescribed drugs for seniors. And we cover all \ndrugs--brand name, generics--unlike the plan offered by the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Graham who leaves out most of the brand name \nprescriptions. In fact, only 10 percent of the brand name drugs will be \ncovered under that legislation. Under the tripartisan plan, seniors \nwill have access to all drugs.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is an important feature because by excluding most of \nthe brand names from coverage, that means you are denying seniors \naccess to the most innovative and cutting-edge therapies available. \nThat is not the kind of coverage we want to provide because that is a \nhuge gap in coverage.\n  Finally, I hope we will not allow this issue to die today here on the \nfloor. I appeal to my colleagues to do everything they can to prevent \nkilling this legislation. We need to get something done. These votes \ntoday are going to be very important in determining who wants the \npolitics or who wants the issue.\n  We want progress. The best way to get progress on this most vital \nissue to our Nation's seniors is by supporting the tripartisan plan \nthat has bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I hope Members of this body will support this plan that will do more \nto help our Nation's seniors in providing them a much-deserved \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in recent days the Senate has begun to \nconsider a number of proposals designed to help Americans afford their \nneeded prescription drugs, not the least of which is to create a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. This is an important debate, and \none that has been a long time in coming to the floor of the Senate. Now \nwe have the opportunity to not just talk about creating a Medicare drug \nbenefit but to prove to our Nation's seniors and disabled that we stand \nby our word. The amendment offered by Senators Graham, Miller, and \nothers is the best proposal before us, and it is one that I urge my \ncolleagues to support.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this piece of legislation \nbecause it is the only one that would create a new, voluntary \nprescription drug benefit within the Medicare Program that all \nbeneficiaries would be eligible for. Under the Graham-Miller proposal, \nMedicare beneficiaries will receive assistance starting from the moment \nthey buy their first prescription drug. There is no deductible and \nthere is no gap in coverage, ensuring that no senior will be left \nstranded without the drugs they need. Beneficiaries would be \nresponsible for copayments of $10 for generic drugs and $40 for \nmedically necessary preferred brand name drugs until they have reached \n$4,000 of out-of-pocket spending, at which point Medicare pays all \nexpenses. This bill provides low-income seniors and those with \ndisabilities with extra assistance by covering the premiums and copays \nfor those living below 135 percent of poverty, and giving premium \nassistance to those between 135 and 150 percent of poverty. In my State \nof Vermont, 28,000 of our 87,000 Medicare beneficiaries have incomes \nless than 150 percent of poverty and thus will qualify for this extra \nassistance available under the Graham-Miller proposal.\n  This amendment will help our seniors get the drugs they need, no \nmatter where they live, what their income, or how sick they are. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important measure that will put \naffordable prescription drugs within the grasp of some of our most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy amendment that would establish a guaranteed Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for all seniors.\n  Approximately 19 million seniors in the United States have little or \nno prescription drug coverage. Prescription drugs are the largest out-\nof-pocket health care cost for seniors. Many who cannot afford drug \ncoverage often do not take the drugs their doctors prescribe, and one \nin eight senior citizens is sometimes forced to choose between buying \nfood and buying medicine. While numerous seniors live on modest fixed \nincomes, prescription drug costs have increased by more than 10 percent \na year since 1995. Medicare needs a voluntary prescription drug benefit \nso\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\nseniors have the same protection against the high cost of prescription \ndrugs as they have for hospital care.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy amendment is the most comprehensive \nMedicare prescription drug benefit proposed in the Senate thus far. It \nprovides coverage to all seniors regardless of their health or income. \nIn Hawaii, 159,000 senior citizens and disabled Medicare beneficiaries \nwould be eligible for coverage under the Outpatient Prescription Drug \nAct, 41,000 low-income seniors in Hawaii would qualify for additional \nassistance under the plan.\n  Affordable premiums and copayments are key components of the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy plan. For example, if a senior spends $4,000 on \nprescription drugs, she would reach the catastrophic limit and all \nadditional drug expenses would be covered under this proposal. Seniors \nwill not lose their current employer retirement coverage and will not \nhave to rely on the public benefits provided by the plan. There also \nwould not be a asset test required for participation in the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy program.\n  The competing amendment proposed by the Senator from Iowa is well \nintended, but the Grassley amendment would not provide adequate \ncoverage for seniors. The Grassley amendment would result in 26,000 \nseniors in Hawaii losing their existing retirement coverage, 47,000 \nseniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries in Hawaii would fall into \nthe benefit hole and would have to continue paying premiums and paying \nhigher drug costs while not receiving any benefits. The Grassley \namendment would also include a means test to qualify for additional \nassistance that would prevent seniors with assets greater than $4,000 \nfrom qualifying for additional assistance.\n  Today, the Senate has a historic opportunity to provide seniors with \nthe missing piece of health care coverage that is urgently needed. We \nmust ensure that all seniors are provided with an affordable and \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit for all seniors. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the plan which does this, the Medicare Outpatient \nPrescription Drug Act.\n  Mr. VOINVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \ntripartisan prescription drug proposal before the Senate. I applaud the \nefforts of Senators Grassley, Breaux, Hatch, Snowe, and Jeffords, in \ndeveloping this legislation.\n  Their work is the culmination of a year's effort to bridge the gap \nbetween the Medicare of 1965 and the Medicare for today and the future. \nAs my colleagues know, when Medicare was enacted in 1965, Congress made \na commitment to our Nation's seniors and disabled to provide for their \nhealth security. Unfortunately, that security is on shaky ground \nbecause Medicare has not kept up with the evolving nature of health \ncare. The delivery of health care has vaulted ahead so dramatically 37 \nyears after the inception of Medicare, that this system which was once \nsufficient is now anticipated and ineffective.\n  For example, conditions that used to require surgery or inpatient \ncare can now be treated on an outpatient basis with prescription drugs. \nIt is time for Medicare to reflect the realities of today's health care \ndelivery system. The vast majority of my colleagues will agree when I \nsay providing prescription drug coverage through Medicare is the next \nlogical step towards modernizing the program. The best way to deliver \nsuch a benefit, however, is a point on which a number of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle disagree. My colleagues from the Finance \nCommittee have found a solution that is a good compromise and is result \nthat can be agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, I \nwould venture to say that the tripartisan proposal has the support of a \nmajority of Senators.\n  Unfortunately, a simple majority will not suffice. As my colleagues \nknow, we are working under the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution, \nwhich set aside $300 billion for a prescription drug benefit. Because \nwe never voted on a fiscal year 2003 budget resolution, the first time \nthe Senate has not done so since 1974, we have no choice but to stay \nwithin the parameters of 2002 funding levels. The fact of the matter is \nwe have stacked the deck against passing any sort of meaningful benefit \nthat costs over $300 billion, regardless of whether the majority of \nSenators support the proposal.\n  Regardless, the bar has been raised to pass prescription drug \ncoverage, which clearly indicates that any bill that passes through \nthis body will have to be bipartisan in nature--or tripartisan in this \ncase. The tripartisan bill is the only measure we have before the \nSenate that bridges both parties and is a benefit that can pass.\n  We cannot delay any further. Each year we delay means another year \nour Nation's seniors will be forced to do without. already we have \nheard too often of seniors that have had to choose between food and \nprescription drugs. I, for one, am ready to go to my constituents in \nOhio and say we were able to move past partisanship and provide real \nsecurity for their health. The tripartisan proposal does that. We must \nact now, and we must act responsibly.\n  It is vital that we pass a prescription drug benefit this year, and \nit is vital that we pass one that is fiscally responsible. Ideally, the \nFederal Government would able to pay for every pill ever needed for \nevery senior. Unfortunately, we live in the real world and are subject \nto limited resources. I would like to take a few moments to shed some \nlight on our Government's current fiscal condition. Last year, the \nCongressional budget Office predicted a unified budget surplus of \n$313billion or fiscal year 2002. As my colleagues know, this rosy \nbudgetary picture is no longer the case. Recent budget projections show \nthat the Federal Government is in much worse fiscal condition than we \nthought. These new projections show that the Federal Government will \nspend the entire Social Security surplus in both the current fiscal \nyear and in fiscal year 2003 and we will be borrowing $52 billion this \nyear and $194 billion in 2003.\n  With this in mind, it is imperative that we act not only to provide \nMedicare benefits for today's beneficiaries, but also for the baby \nboomers who will arrive in 2011. If we do not act responsibly in \nproviding a benefit, we will end up writing IOUs not only for Social \nSecurity, but for this benefit as well. The tripartisan proposal \nstrikes a balance between providing seniors and the disabled access to \nneeded prescription drugs today and doing so in a fiscally sensible way \nthat will allow benefits to extend to future generations.\n  I cannot say the same for the Graham-Miller bill. Top the best of my \nknowledge,I cannot definitively state what the Graham-Miller bill will \ncost. My colleagues on the other side claim that their bill will cost \n$450 billion over 6 years. Then, after 6 years, as their bill is \ncurrently written, the benefit would sunset.\n  However, let us make the assumption that the Graham-Miller bill \npassed and their benefit did not sunset. What would that mean for the \nAmerican people? I have a sneaking suspicion that $450 billion will \nsomehow become $800 billion or as much as $1 trillion over 10 years. \nThis is on top of the estimated $3.6 trillion it will cost the Federal \nGovernment to provide basic Medicare services for seniors and the \ndisabled. As I see it, under the Graham-Miller bill, the American \npeople get stuck between choosing cyanide and hemlock.\n  Senator Grassley and the others in the tripartisan group have put \nbefore the Senate a proposal that would cost $370 billion as scored by \nCBO. The natural question that I think the American people would like \nto know is what does $370 billion buy? In my opinion, $370 billion \nprovides a real prescription drug benefit that is affordable to both \nthe beneficiaries and the Federal Government.\n  Under the tripartisan proposal, premiums would be $24 a month, an \namount that is lower than the Graham-Miller bill. After a $250 \ndeductible, the Government would cover half of all prescription drug \ncosts up to $3,450.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that the \nso-called doughnut hole after $3,450 will be the financial ruin of \nevery senior. The truth is that the vast majority of seniors, 80 \npercent, would never even hit that hole. Moreover, the hole exists only \nuntil the beneficiary accrues another $250 in costs, at which time the \ngovernment would pay for 90 percent of all remaining drug costs.\n  While this benefit will greatly help seniors throughout the Nation, \nthere are still some seniors for whom the $24 per month premium and \nadditional\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\ncost-sharing is still too high. For those individuals, the tripartisan \nbill provides protections that will allow access to prescription drugs. \nFor those seniors under 135 percent of poverty, the tripartisan plan \nwould provide a full subsidy for monthly premiums. In addition, the \nGovernment would cover 95 percent of their prescription drug costs to \nthe initial benefit limit and 100 percent above the stop-loss limit. \nAnd for those seniors between 135 and 150 percent of the poverty level, \nthe tripartisan proposal would provide assistance with their monthly \npremiums on a sliding scale. In addition, these individuals would pay \nno more than 50 percent of their drug costs once the $250 deductible \nhas been reached.\n  When we talk about dollars being spent, we should also point out to \nseniors that they will receive more bang for their buck under the \ntripartisan proposal. Seniors will not just receive direct assistance \nfrom the government to cover their prescription drug bills. Rather, \nunder the tripartisan plan, competing pharmaceutical delivery plans \nwill be forced to provide the best value on prescription drug prices in \norder to attract beneficiaries to their respective plans. To the \nadvantage of both Medicare beneficiaries and the Federal Government, \nthis competition will decrease the price of prescription drugs and \npermit all parties to stretch their dollars further. For example, the \nsame dollar that today would buy one day's dose of Lipitor, might \npurchase 2 days' worth of the drug when competing plans vie for \nconsumers as they would under the tripartisan plan.\n  This body has been playing this political posturing game for too \nlong. I am tired of explaining partisanship as the excuse for why this \nbody has not passed a prescription drug benefit and has forced the \nleast of our brothers and sisters to choose between food and \nprescription drugs. I am pleased that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to show the American people, especially our Nation's \nseniors and disabled, whether we are serious about enacting legislation \nto provide a prescription drug benefit this year.\n  The tripartisan bill has support from both sides of the aisle. The \nHouse has passed their measure. The President is ready and willing to \nsign a bill into law this year. The burden is squarely on the Senate's \nshoulders. All eyes are on us. I am confident that we will have more \nthan 50 votes in favor of the tripartisan plan. I hope that those that \nare considering voting against this proposal have a very good reason \nfor not supporting it, because the people in their State will be asking \nthem the question: Why didn't you support a plan that gets the job done \nin a fiscally responsible way.\n  So while seniors wait for a prescription drug benefit, I will \ncontinue to work to educate seniors about generic drugs. I have been \nworking on this issue for some time, providing funds at the Food and \nDrug Administration for consumer education and working with other non-\nprofits to educate our seniors about the availability and efficacy of \ngenerics.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to waive the budget point of \norder on the tripartisan amendment so that Medicare can move forward \ninto the 21st century and so that seniors and the disabled are able to \nhave access to affordable prescription drugs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the \ntripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act, I rise in support of this \namendment to make affordable prescription drug coverage available to \nall of our Nation's seniors.\n  Prescription drugs are as important to a Medicare beneficiaries' \nhealth today as a hospital bed was in 1965, when the program was \ncreated, and I have long been a supporter of providing a prescription \ndrug benefit as part of our efforts to strengthen Medicare. With recent \nadvances in research, prescription drugs can literally be a life-line \nfor patients whose drug regimen protects them from becoming sicker and \nreduces the need to treat serious illness through hospitalization and \nsurgery. Soaring prescription drug costs, however, have placed a \ntremendous financial burden on the millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho must pay for these drugs out of their pockets.\n  More and more, I am hearing disturbing accounts of older Americans \nwho are running up huge, high-interest credit card bills to buy \nmedicine they otherwise couldn't afford. Even more alarming are the \naccounts of patients who are either skipping doses to stretch out their \npill supplies or being forced to choose between paying the bills or \nbuying the prescription drugs that keep them healthy. It is therefore \ncritical that we bring Medicare into line with most private sector \ninsurance plans and expand the program to include prescription drugs.\n  The tripartisan plan that is before us today will provide an \naffordable and sustainable prescription drug benefit that will be \navailable to all seniors. Moreover, unlike the alternative bill, our \nplan will make the drug benefit a permanent part of Medicare and is \nfully funded at $370 billion over 10 years.\n  Under the tripartisan bill, all seniors will have the choice of at \nleast two prescription drug plans, regardless of where they live. This \nwill enable them to select the kind of prescription drug coverage that \nthey need. Moreover, the coverage under these plans will be \ncomprehensive. Seniors will have access to every drug, from the \nsimplest generic to the most advanced, innovative therapy.\n  Our plan is also affordable and has the lowest monthly premium--$24--\nof any of the comprehensive prescription drug proposals that are on the \ntable. Not only does our plan offer a lower premium, but it also offers \nlower copays for most drugs than the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Florida. As the senior Senator from Maine pointed out on the floor \nthe other day, seniors will pay more for most of the top 50 drugs under \nthe Democrats' bill than they will under the tripartisan plan. For \nexample, the copayment for Glucophage, which is used in the treatment \nof Type 2 diabetes, would be $40 under the Graham-Kennedy bill, and \nonly $31 under the tripartisan plan.\n\n  In fact, our plan is such a good deal that the Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us that just about everyone will take it. According to the \nCBO, 93 percent of seniors will enroll in our program, while 6 percent \nwill elect to retain their current prescription drug coverage. This \nmeans that 99 percent of all seniors will have prescription drug \ncoverage once our plan is implemented.\n  No one should have to choose between paying their bills and buying \ntheir pills. That is why our bill provides additional subsidies to low-\nincome seniors. For example, the 10 million seniors nationwide, \nincluding 65,000 Mainers, with incomes below 135 percent of poverty \nwill have 98 percent of their prescription drug costs covered by \nMedicare with no monthly premiums and no gap in coverage.\n  In addition, these low-income seniors will not be subject to any \ndeductible, and they will pay an average copayment of just $1 and $2 \nfor each prescription. This is comparable to the copays required under \nMaine's Medicaid Program, which requires beneficiaries to pay $2 for \neach generic drug and $3 for each brand name drug.\n  The 10,000 Maine seniors with incomes between 135 percent and 150 \npercent of poverty will also receive generous subsidies under our plan. \nAll seniors with incomes below 150 percent of poverty will be exempt \nfrom the benefit limit. As a consequence, 80 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will never experience any gap in coverage under our plan. \nSeniors with incomes below 150 percent of poverty will also receive a \nsubsidy that lowers their monthly premiums to anywhere between zero and \n$24 a month, based on a sliding scale according to income.\n  My biggest concern about the amendment offered by my colleague from \nFlorida is the cost. My understanding is that this plan will cost \nanywhere between $600 billion and $1 trillion over the next ten years. \nThis is simply too heavy a financial burden for both current and future \ngenerations to shoulder, particularly given our mounting Federal \ndeficit.\n  Moreover, despite its tremendous cost, the alternative plan promises \nonly temporary help, not a permanent solution. Their plan sunsets after \n6 years, and makes no provision for a drug benefit after 2010. In other \nwords, their plan ends just as the tidal wave of baby boomers is \npreparing to retire.\n  The tripartisan plan also includes other improvements to the Medicare \nProgram that are not included in the Graham-Kennedy proposal. The \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\nMedicare benefit package, which was established in 1965, now differs \ndramatically from the benefits offered under most private health plans. \nOur bill would provide a new, enhanced fee-for-service option for \nMedicare beneficiaries that more closely mirrors private health plans. \nFor example, it would cover more preventive services than traditional \nMedicare at little or no cost. It would also provide protection against \ncatastrophic medical costs for those seniors with serious health \nproblems. The traditional Medicare Program provides no such \ncatastrophic protection.\n  No one would be forced to enter this new plan. It is simply another \noption. If seniors want to stay in the traditional Medicare Program, \nthat is fine, and they will still be eligible for the new prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  Access to affordable prescription drugs is perhaps the most important \nissue facing our Nation's seniors today. It is therefore my hope that \nthe Senate will stop playing politics so that we can pass a meaningful \nMedicare prescription drug bill this year. The 21st Century Medicare \nAct is the only legislation before the Senate that has not just \nbipartisan, but tripartisan support. Moreover, it has the support of 12 \nof the 21 members of the Senate Finance Committee, which has \njurisdiction over Medicare. That is not to say that I think the \ntripartisan plan is perfect. I do not, for example, like the copayments \nimposed on home health care in the new fee-for-service option, and I \nwould, of course, prefer a plan that had no gaps in coverage.\n  The tripartisan plan does, however, provide a major improvement in \ncoverage, and I believe that it is the only proposal that gives our \nseniors any real hope of getting an affordable Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit this year.\n  Since the cost of providing a meaningful drug benefit will only \nincrease as time passes, it is all the more important that we act now. \nI therefore urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \ntripartisan amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes before we \nvote later today on the Graham amendment and the Grassley amendment to \ndescribe some of the grave concerns I have with the tripartisan \namendment sponsored by Senators Grassley, Jeffords and Breaux.\n  The tripartisan Senate bill offers the following ``benefits'' to \nseniors: an expected monthly premium of $24; a beneficiary must cover \nthe first $250 in drug costs; then half of his or her drug costs are \ncovered between $251 and $3,450; at that point the beneficiary is then \nresponsible for all drug expenses between $3,451-$5,300;\n  Moreover, the plan claims to offer assistance for low-income \nbeneficiaries. What is not mentioned is that a strict asset test would \nprevent 40 percent of low-income seniors from even qualifying for this \nsubsidy. A car, a wedding ring, or a burial plot over a certain value \nwould render a beneficiary completely ineligible.\n  The purpose of insurance is to provide protection against certain \ncosts. The kind of insurance some of my colleagues in the Senate have \nproposed would leave those seniors and persons with disabilities \nholding the bag when their drug expenditures are highest. Under the \ntripartisan plan, beneficiaries could still be required to pay \nthousands of dollars in drug expenditures.\n  This proposal would create a serious lapse in what is supposed to be \na safety net for our most vulnerable citizens, only paying a quarter of \nan average Rhode Islander's prescription drug costs.\n  When a person breaks an arm, Medicare pays for the whole cast, not \nhalf. A prescription drug benefit should pay for all of your benefits.\n  There are other nonprescription-drug-related provisions contained in \nthe tripartisan bill that are also of great concern, particularly Title \nII, the ``Option for Enhanced Medicare Benefits'' section. To me, the \nprovisions outlined in this section of the bill are a direct affront on \nthe Medicare Program as we know it. It seeks to create a new Medicare \noption that combines both Part A and Part B with a combined premium.\n  Under this option, a beneficiary would pay more upfront, out-of-\npocket costs, such as a $10 co-payment for the first five home health \nvisits and $60 per day for the first 100 days in a skilled nursing \nfacility. In return, the beneficiary would pay nothing for preventive \nhealth services such as mammography and cancer screening and would \nreceive protection against catastrophic health care costs.\n  This new Medicare benefit option would reverse the universal nature \nof our current program by creating a new line of services for those who \ncan pay more. During the Balanced Budget Act debate of 1997, I fought \nagainst the addition of copayments for home health and other essential \nservices because they threaten the access of low-income beneficiaries \nto those services.\n  This new enhanced benefit option would create a two-tiered system of \nthe haves and the have-nots. Since there is no premium assistance for \nlow-income beneficiaries who may wish to enroll in the enhanced benefit \noption, only more wealthy beneficiaries would be able to afford it. And \nsince it requires beneficiaries to pay a greater share of their upfront \ncosts, it would divert healthier, younger beneficiaries from the \ntraditional program. This adverse selection would ultimately result in \nhigher costs for those who remain in the traditional Part A and Part B \nprogram.\n  The sponsors and supporters of the tripartisan Senate bill have \nargued that even though our Nation's most vulnerable citizens deserve a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit they can depend on, the proposal \noffered by Senators Graham, Miller, and Kennedy is simply too \nexpensive. I would like to take a moment to highlight for my colleagues \na recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that I \nbelieve adds an important perspective to that point of debate.\n  The report compared the cost of last year's tax cuts with the costs \nof two prescription drug proposals for the Medicare population. The \nestimated 10-year cost of the first plan being roughly $350 billion and \nthe second $700 billion for the same period. The report found that when \nthe tax cut is fully in effect, the cost of the tax cut for just the \ntop 1 percent of the population would exceed the entire difference in \ncost between the two prescription drug proposals.\n  I voted against the President's tax cut because I felt that it failed \nto leave room for critical immediate needs such as a prescription drug \nbenefit, nor did it allow us to adequately address the long-term \nsolvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  Once Congress enacts a Medicare prescription benefit, it will be \ndifficult to modify or significantly alter it. If we are going to enact \na benefit, we must pass a solid, reliable benefit that will continue to \nmeet the needs of Medicare beneficiaries in years to come. And if \nresources are the issue, many Members have already stated clearly that \nthere is a way to address that issue, either through the reserve fund \nset aside in last year's budget or by other means.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes, after I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Dayton be added as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to respond to criticisms raised \nabout the availability and cost of drugs under the Democratic proposal. \nThe minority leader has distributed a memo in which he cites selected \nprovisions of our bill to come to a false conclusion about the access \nseniors would have to prescription drugs. I want to set the record \nstraight.\n  Under the Democratic proposal, all medically necessary drugs would be \navailable to our seniors at a rate of no more than $40 per prescription \nfor the year 2005--all medically necessary drugs, not just the drugs \nthat are on the preferred list.\n  The sections of the amendment Senator Lott chose to omit make clear \nthat every senior would have access to any drug that is medically \nnecessary for that senior. Seniors are further protected because the \nMedicare Program would assure that the definition of a class of drugs \nis clinically appropriate. To the contrary, the Republican bill allows \nthe drug HMOs to define the classes of drugs and, further, on page 32 \nof their amendment, clarifies that not all drugs within a class would \nhave to be covered.\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\n  Senator Lott may want to take a closer look at the Republican \nlanguage given his concerns in this area.\n  Under the Democratic proposal, seniors will know in advance exactly \nhow much they will pay for any drug. In 2005, they will never pay more \nthan $10 for a generic and $40 for a medically necessary brand name \ndrug.\n  Under the Republican plan, there is no way of knowing how much a \nsenior would pay for a specific drug because there is no defined \nbenefit in the Republican plan. Who makes the decisions? The drug HMOs \nmake the decision. They choose how much the beneficiaries will pay, \nwhat the deductibles will be, and how much they will pay for each \nprescription in coinsurance. It could be 50 percent, which is what \ntheir charts say. It could be 80 percent. It will be determined not by \nthe seniors, not by Medicare, but by the drug HMO.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider carefully the differences between \nthe Democratic and Republican bills. Our bill uses the Medicare \nProgram, a tried and true delivery system, to provide prescription \ndrugs to our seniors. The Republican bill privatizes Medicare and \nrequires seniors to get their drugs from a drug HMO--if they can find \none in their State.\n  Our bill assures that seniors in rural America are guaranteed the \nsame benefits provided to senior Americans elsewhere in this country. \nThe Republican bill abandons rural Americans. Our bill gives seniors an \naffordable drug benefit and guaranteed prices. The Republican bill lets \nprivate insurers decide what drugs are covered and how much seniors \nwill pay for each prescription.\n  Our bill uses every taxpayer dollar, every dollar paid by the \nbeneficiary in monthly premiums to lower the cost of prescription drugs \nfor seniors. The Republican bill uses taxpayer dollars and premium \ndollars to lure uneager private insurers into a market for which today \nthere is no private insurance being offered.\n  Our bill is a bill for seniors. The Republican bill is a bill for \ndrug companies and private insurers. The differences between the bills \nwill make a very real difference in the ability of our seniors to \nafford the prescription drugs they need, and enjoy the improved health \nthat those drugs will bring.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Graham-Miller-Kennedy Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. In the event that none of the proposals that \nwill be voted on this afternoon garner the necessary votes to move \nforward, I urge my colleagues to roll up their sleeves and begin work \nimmediately on a proposal that can be adopted this year.\n  The outcomes of the votes today should not be viewed as a trumpet of \ndefeat, but as an even more urgent call to find a proposal this year, \nin 2002, that will bring our seniors the drugs they need, the drugs \nthat we have promised, the drugs a compassionate America will provide \nto this, our greatest generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and say \nhow much I have enjoyed working with him on the tripartisan group.\n  The Senate will be faced, in a few moments, with an interesting \nproposition. We will have Graham legislation that will not get the \nrequisite number of votes to proceed. And we will be faced with the \ntripartisan proposal to see if we have an opportunity to proceed with \nthat legislation. That will be the second and final vote, I take it, \ntoday on this issue. At least, I think it will be.\n  I don't think the Senate and this Congress can go back this year and \ntell our constituents that we didn't do prescription drugs because it \nis the other party's fault. I don't think the Republicans can say they \ndidn't bring back prescription drugs because it is the Democratic \nParty's fault, and I don't think we will get very far saying we didn't \nhave a prescription drug plan because the Republicans would not support \nours. I think the seniors are wising up and know that this blame game \nis no longer going to help them one bit. You cannot take an excuse to \nthe drugstore and buy prescription drugs. What the seniors need is both \nsides to come together and create a program that would work. Our \ntripartisan bill is somewhere between the two versions that I have \ndescribed--the Hagel bill at $150 billion, and the Graham bill at about \n$594 billion. All of that comes out of the Social Security trust fund \nmoney. We have tried to be responsible in how much we can spend to make \nsure we have a sufficient number of votes to actually pass something \nand also create a delivery system that can work.\n\n  What we have suggested is that for people in the Medicare Program, \njust like those of us in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan--\nthe program that we have drug coverage under and all of our insurance--\nthat private companies compete for the right to sell us that coverage. \nThey compete for the right to sell us prescription drugs. The company \nthat can do it the cheapest is the one, in most cases, from which we \npurchase the plan. That is what we are suggesting.\n  We are also suggesting that these companies are big people, big \nplayers. There are PBMs like Merck-Medco or Aetna or Blue Cross. These \ncompanies are used to assuming risk. That is their business. Why should \nwe say we are going to get companies to deliver the product, but if \nthey underestimate how much it is going to cost, the taxpayers are \ngoing to cover their loss? Our bill says if these companies bid $100 to \nprovide prescription drugs for seniors, and it costs them $102, then \nthat is their responsibility. That is the risk they have to assume. Why \nshould the taxpayers say: Look, we don't care how much it actually \ncosts, the taxpayer will pick up the difference no matter what.\n  Regarding rural areas, our legislation says there will be at least \ntwo competing plans in every area of the United States. The Government \nwill ensure that there are at least two competing plans. It is not like \nan HMO. Here you had to have a hospital and doctors and emergency \nrooms. The only thing you need to deliver drugs in a rural area is a \ndrugstore to have the prescription filled and a doctor to write the \nprescription. We guarantee that every part of the country will have at \nleast two competing plans.\n  What do we do if neither side has 60 votes? Do we give up? I suggest \nwe try to find common ground. I think we can do that and we will \ncontinue to work in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 5 minutes 45 seconds. The \nmajority has 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just a few years ago, when President \nClinton was President, he was asking for a drug benefit program of $168 \nbillion. Last year, the Democrats wanted a $311 billion program. This \nyear it is $600 billion. Frankly, I think it is a lot more than that \nbecause they have written in a sunset provision that actually helps to \nreduce the cost of that program, but also makes the program temporary.\n  I have to say that some of the things I find objectionable about the \nGraham approach is that the bill sets up a Government formulary that \nallows only two drugs for each illness. Because of that, it means that \nliterally dozens of drugs that may be prescribed by doctors will have \nto be purchased by the patients themselves.\n  I might also add that it means a situation of price controls without \nquestion. Countries that set price controls on prescription drugs have \nbeen unable to duplicate the success of the United States in developing \nnew pharmaceuticals.\n  Our tripartisan plan provides a permanent benefit, not a temporary \none like Graham-Miller does. It gives beneficiaries choice in Medicare \ncoverage, drug coverage, and options to select any prescription they \nwant. It is affordable. Our plan costs $370 billion over 10 years. The \nGraham plan costs $600 billion over 10 years. Our plan, in addition, \nincludes Medicare reforms. The Graham-Miller plan does not. Our plan is \nnot run by the Government, but by the private sector, and it depends on \nprivate competition. It trusts seniors to make their own decisions and \nchoices. The Graham-Miller bill does not. Ours is affordable, it \ncreates competition, and there are no price controls on drugs. We take \ncare of the\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\npoorest of the poor and we do it within reasonable budgetary limits.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, first I want to quickly make a point about \na matter that has been raised on the provision in the Graham-Miller-\nKennedy bill that says we take a second look at this legislation after \na few years. That is not a weakness. It is one of its strengths, and it \nis nothing new. That is what we did with welfare reform, and that is \nwhat we did with the farm bill.\n  I submit to the Chair, if we had that provision in the original \nMedicare bill, we probably would have had a prescription drug benefit \nyears ago.\n  Back in April, right after the Easter recess, I came to the Senate \nfloor and talked about the urgency of passing a prescription drug bill. \nI spoke then of my 88-year-old Uncle Hoyle who lives next door to me in \nthe mountains of North Georgia. He has been like a father to me in many \nways. Once a very strong mountain man, Uncle Hoyle now suffers from \ndiabetes, prostate cancer, recently had angioplasty, and also suffers \nfrom a kidney infection. Although he still makes a great garden--and I \nhad tomatoes and corn out of it this last week--that once strong body \nis growing frail. I cannot get Uncle Hoyle, or millions like him, off \nmy mind.\n  Many--too many--refuse to see these elderly waiting, waiting for \nsomeone, anyone, to knock on that screen door and say, as John Prine \nsings: ``Hello in there.''\n  The elderly are waiting for something else, too. They are waiting for \nus to do something about their health needs. So far, they have waited \nin vain, each day growing older, growing weaker. Now it comes down to \nus on this July afternoon 2002.\n  If we do not do something, you know who we are going to be like? If \nwe do not do something, we are going to be like those who pass by that \nman in the ditch on the side of the road in that Biblical story of the \nGood Samaritan: Passed him by, tried not to look at him, refused to \nhelp him. We will be no better than they were and should be remembered \nin the same negative way.\n  We must come to the aid of our seniors by adding a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill \nwould do just that. I believe and, more importantly, the AARP believes \nthat our bill offers the best value for seniors. We deliver our \nprescription drug benefit through the tried and tested Medicare system. \nWe provide extra help for our neediest seniors. We guarantee coverage \n24 hours a day in every corner of this country, including that tiny \nrural town that the Presiding Officer knows, where I and my Uncle Hoyle \nlive.\n  Remember what FDR once said: Try something; if it doesn't work, try \nsomething else. But for God's sake, try something. That is what I am \ntrying to say. I want Uncle Hoyle and all those millions like him in \nthis land of plenty who played by the rules, raised their families, and \nworked hard to have some hope and dignity in their twilight years.\n  Is that really too much to ask? Mr. President, I do not think so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be granted 3 additional minutes and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the manager of the bill, be given 3 additional minutes \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon we will cast what could be our \nfinal votes on a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. I am deeply \ndisappointed with the process that brought us to this point, a process \nthat ignored the good bipartisan will on the Finance Committee in favor \nof politics and partisanship that has seemed to dominate the debate on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  However, I continue to believe that our bill, the Tripartisan 21st \nCentury Medicare Act, represents the broadest and best approach to \nproviding prescription drug coverage.\n  Our work on this bill over the course of a full year involved fine \nSenators from every party. I have never been prouder to work in a \nbipartisan manner than with my colleagues Senator Hatch, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Snowe, and Senator Jeffords on probably the most \nimportant change in Medicare in the 37-year history of that \nlegislation.\n  Together the five of us, bipartisan or tripartisan, whatever one \nwishes to call it, consulted stakeholders of all political persuasions \nand the Congressional Budget Office as we developed our policies over \nthe last year. At every step of the way, we faced tradeoffs and made \ncompromises, all in the spirit of cooperation, with the common goal of \ngetting something done that could actually work without breaking the \nMedicare bank.\n  Our bill reflects the best of what good bipartisan cooperation can \ndo. It offers seniors affordable coverage on a permanent basis. It does \nnot sunset, and it does not take brand name drugs away from our \nseniors. It improves and enhances other unfair aspects of the Medicare \nProgram, and it does it all on a voluntary basis. It does so at a total \ncost that reasonable people from both parties should be able to \nsupport--$370 billion over 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that anything that comes to the \nfloor on a purely partisan basis, such as the Graham-Kennedy bill \nbefore us right now, is destined to failure, and I remind everyone \nagain that nothing ever passes this body on a partisan basis alone. \nAround here, it takes bipartisanship to make things happen, and \napparently the Democrat leadership is not interested in making things \nhappen for our senior citizens.\n  Our bill is built on a bipartisan foundation. Had it been given a \nchance to be debated in the Senate Finance Committee, it could no doubt \nhave been improved further still, but we were denied that chance all \nbecause the other side did not want real debate. They wanted a real \nissue instead.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those on the other side of the \naisle, to listen closely when Senators claim to care about \nbipartisanship. Our bill is the only bipartisan prescription bill in \nall of Washington, DC, this year. It deserves consideration of the full \nFinance Committee, but since we have been denied that right by the \nDemocratic leadership, it deserves your vote today.\n  The bill, other than the tripartisan bill before us, is without a \ndoubt a program for big Government. Rather than allow prescription drug \nplans to design cost savings and innovative benefits that best suit \nseniors' needs, the Graham-Kennedy bill requires Federal bureaucrats to \nset up 10 regional drug formularies, basically deciding which \nprescription drugs seniors can and cannot access.\n  Under Graham-Kennedy, plans would not compete with one another. It \nwould not be allowed to deviate from a regional drug formula, thus \nrestricting seniors' choices. Plans would be further restricted from \noffering more than two brand name drugs in a therapeutic class.\n\n  This approach puts control squarely in the hands of bureaucrats in \nGovernment, and we know from experience that exclusive Government \ncontrol over medicine has not worked well. The Government has lagged \nmany years behind the private sector in covering immunizations, \nphysicals, mammograms, and other preventive care in Medicare.\n  By contrast, the Tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act approach puts \ncontrol in the hands of our senior citizens. The bill guarantees \nmultiple plans will compete in each region of the country, giving \nseniors a choice to pick the plan that best suits their needs and the \nright to get out of plans that do not meet their needs.\n  The tripartisan bill also does not restrict plans from offering more \ndrug choices and better overall drug coverage. Under the tripartisan \nbill, private plans compete for seniors, not Government bureaucrats. \nWhat if the specific drug a senior relies on is not on the regional \nGovernment formulary? The Graham-Kennedy bill forces seniors to go \nthrough multiple layers of bureaucratic red tape to convince the \nGovernment to give them the drugs that their doctors think they need.\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n  The tripartisan bill lets seniors and their doctors decide what drugs \nthey should receive.\n  Take your choice. We have it within the next 5 minutes. I hope you \nwill vote for the tripartisan plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair let me know when there are 15 seconds \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote is one of the most important \nany of us will ever cast. It is a vote about our national character and \nnational priorities.\n  It is a vote about the quality of our society. But most of all it is \na vote about senior citizens and disabled Americans and their right to \nlive in dignity.\n  Medicare is a solemn promise between Government and the individual. \nIt says, ``Play by the rules, contribute to the system during your \nworking years, and you will be guaranteed health security in your \nretirement years.'' Because of Medicare, the elderly have long had \ninsurance for their hospital bills and doctors bills. But the promise \nof health security at the core of Medicare is broken every day because \nMedicare does not cover the soaring price of prescription drugs.\n  Today, we have the opportunity and the duty to mend the broken \npromise of Medicare. It is time to pass a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. It is time for Congress to listen to the American people \ninstead of the powerful special interests.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was privileged to participate in \nthe debates that led to Medicare's passage. Then, as now, there were \ntwo plans before us. One plan was the solid, dependable, comprehensive \nMedicare program that became law. The other was little more than a \npolitical fig leaf for the elections. One plan was supported by all the \norganizations representing senior citizens and working families. The \nother plan was supported only by the powerful special interests. That \nis the same situation we face today.\n  Senators Graham, Miller, and I have offered a solid, affordable \nMedicare prescription drug benefit that offers senior citizens and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries the protection they need at a price \nthey can afford. There is no deductible, there are no gaps, there are \nno loopholes. The benefit and the premium are both guaranteed in the \nlaw itself. Low income senior citizens get special assistance.\n  But the other side has taken a different approach. Their plan is not \naffordable, not adequate, and not Medicare.\n  Under their plan, benefits are so inadequate that senior citizens \nwill still be forced to choose between food on the table and the \nmedicines they need to survive. There is a high deductible and a large \ncoverage gap. Whether the senior citizen has large drug needs or more \nmodest ones, the program only pays a small fraction of the cost of \nneeded medicine--leaving the elderly to shoulder the rest or go \nwithout.\n  Special help for the low income elderly is conditioned on a cruel and \nintrusive assets test.\n  Instead of guaranteeing benefits for senior citizens, their program \nprovides subsidies for insurance companies--and allows them to set the \npremium and determine the benefits that the elderly can receive.\n  And to reduce the cost of their plan, they have set it up in such a \nway that it actually encourages employers to drop the good retirement \ncoverage that more than ten million senior citizens now enjoy.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, under the Republican \nplan one-third of these retirees--three and one-half million--would \nactually lose the good coverage they have today and be forced into the \ninferior Republican plan.\n  From the AARP to the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations to the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, virtually \nevery organization representing senior citizens and the disabled \nsupports our amendment. Not a single legitimate organization of senior \ncitizens or the disabled supports their proposal.\n  We are proud that our Democratic leader brought this matter to the \nfloor of the Senate. This is the time for us to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senior citizens and their children and their \ngrandchildren understand that affordable, comprehensive prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare should be a priority. Let's listen to \ntheir voices instead of those of the powerful special interests. Let's \npass a Medicare prescription drug benefit worthy of the name.\n  Every single member of this body has a good prescription drug \nbenefit. Let's do the same for the American citizens. That is what our \nprogram does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Graham amendment, No. \n4309, violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, before Senator Hagel begins the debate, we \nhope to get from the House today the supplemental appropriations bill. \nAfter Senator Hagel and Senator Kennedy finish debate time today, we \nwill begin the debate on the supplemental appropriation.\n  Based on the unanimous consent agreement just entered, I have the \nauthority of the majority leader to announce there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight.\n  I have been asked we have a consent request on the supplemental. The \ntime, of course, is not running against the Senator's amendment.\n  Senator Hagel has been his usual courteous self. He has been very \npatient in waiting for us to write this agreement.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4315, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself, Mr. \n     Ensign, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Gregg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4315 to amendment No. 4299.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we have spent 4 days debating and voting on \ntwo Medicare prescription drug proposals, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \nbill and the so-called tripartisan bill. I have worked with Senators \nEnsign, Lugar, Phil Gramm, Inhofe, Santorum, and Gregg to introduce \nrelevant, straightforward, realistic legislation to add a prescription \ndrug benefit to our Medicare Program.\n  Our legislation would create a permanent Medicare prescription drug \nprogram that would be available to all Medicare beneficiaries beginning \nJanuary 1, 2004. We keep it affordable to both beneficiaries and \ntaxpayers. We do it without creating a new Federal Government \nbureaucracy. The program is not perfect. None of the Medicare \nprescription drug bills we have considered have been perfect.\n  This bill accomplishes a very important goal. This bill gives seniors \nthe peace of mind that comes with knowing they have security from \nextremely high drug costs, catastrophic costs that ruin families.\n  Why are we engaged in this debate?\n  Medicare was created, as we all know, in 1965--and it is a 1965 \nmodel. Preventive health care, like diet, lifestyle, and exercise, was \nnot emphasized in 1965. Prescription drugs were not as widely \nprescribed or used. Research had not developed the kind of lifestyles \nand life expectancies and quality of life we now enjoy--prescription \ndrugs, pharmaceutical research, being the core of that development.\n  Seniors needed protection, in 1965, from high hospital costs for \ninpatient services, and we gave them that protection. It came through \nMedicare Part A hospital insurance.\n  In 2000, the average American spent $435 a year on prescription \ndrugs. Today, Medicare beneficiaries need protection from unlimited \nout-of-pocket prescription drug costs.\n  John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, was quoted today in the New \nYork Times as saying:\n\n       Another possibility is for Medicare to provide catastrophic \n     coverage for prescription drug expenses over a certain \n     threshold, perhaps $4,000 to $6,000 a year, with no premium. \n     This could be combined with additional help for low-income \n     beneficiaries and a government-authorized drug discount card.\n\n  So reported the New York Times today as a quote from Mr. Rother, the \npolicy director of AARP. What Mr. Rother states is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  How would this program work? There are two major components to our \nbill. First, all participating beneficiaries\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nwould be protected from unlimited out-of-pocket drug expenses through a \ncap on their private expenditures. The annual out-of-pocket limit would \ndepend on their income. That would go as follows: For annual income \nlevels below 200 percent of poverty, the annual expense would be no \nmore than $1,500. That is a little more than a $100-a-month cap on out-\nof-pocket expenses. For those with annual income levels 200 percent to \n400 percent of poverty, it would be capped at $3,500--no more, \nregardless of the need. For those incomes between 400 percent and 600 \npercent of poverty, out-of-pocket expenses would be capped at $5,500--\nno more. And for those who wanted to subscribe--this is a voluntary \nprogram, open to all Medicare beneficiaries--with incomes above 600 \npercent of poverty, their out-of-pocket expenses would be capped at 20 \npercent of their income.\n  Again, to give some relevancy to help understand those numbers, the \n2002 Federal poverty level is $8,860 for an individual and $11,940 per \ncouple. Beneficiaries with the lowest incomes would have their out-of-\npocket expenses on prescription drugs limited, as I said, to about $100 \na month. And almost half of all Medicare beneficiaries live on incomes \nlower than 200 percent of poverty.\n  The second part of our program would be that every beneficiary would \nbe able to choose to enroll or not to enroll in a discount drug card \nprogram, giving them access to privately negotiated discounts on \nprescription drugs.\n  Who would administer this program? The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would administer the program through the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMMS. The Secretary would negotiate with private \ncompanies to deliver the benefits. What that means is no new Federal \nbureaucracy, no new Government program to administer these benefits.\n  I would like to point out that two-thirds of all seniors already have \nsome type of private prescription drug coverage that they like and want \nto keep. Seniors would not be forced to drop supplemental coverage, and \nemployers would be encouraged to retain and even improve existing \ncoverage under our plan.\n\n  Our bill would allow employer-sponsored plans--all employer-sponsored \nplans: Medicare supplemental plans, Medicare+Choice plans--\npharmaceutical benefit managers--PBMs--pharmacists, and even States \nworking with private companies to deliver the benefits.\n  By structuring our program this way, we do not create an expensive \nand new, expansive Government bureaucracy or the subsequent redtape \nthat follows. We would use the market system in place.\n  These private market tools, such as consumer choice and competition \nto control costs without limiting innovation, are critical to the \nfuture development and innovation of prescription drugs.\n  How would seniors participate? Seniors would enroll with an approved \nprovider and pay an annual fee of $25, which would be waived for \nbeneficiaries with incomes less than 200 percent of poverty, \nindividuals with incomes of less than $17,720. Once beneficiaries had \nmet their out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug expenses, they would \npay a small copayment of no more than 10 percent of the cost of each \nprescription drug. Seniors would not have to pay monthly premiums for \ndeductibles.\n  When would the program start? Our program would take effect January \n1, 2004. Other bills that were considered would not have taken effect \nuntil 2005 or even later. And our benefit is permanent; we do not \nsunset the program.\n  Why do we structure the program this way? Any realistic Medicare \nprescription drug proposal must not only be affordable for seniors, but \nit must also be affordable to the taxpayers, future generations of \nAmericans who are going to have to pay for this program. Why is that \nimportant? It is very important because if we begin a program and \nobligate and commit the next generations of Americans to this program, \nthen we owe them. We have a responsibility of giving them all the facts \nand structuring a program that is accountable and responsible.\n  Let's examine something carefully. Projected Federal deficits now are \nseen for at least the next 2 years and probably longer. So as opposed \nto a couple of years ago when we looked out onto the horizon and saw \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see, we are now in a different \ndynamic, a different environment. No one really knows how long we will \nbe in deficit, so any new Federal program and entitlement that is \nadded, someone must pay for that.\n  We are not operating under a new budget resolution, so, as of October \n1, we will no longer be subject to budget caps. The two previous \nprescription drug bills we debated did not attain the 60 votes needed \ntoday in order to overcome a point of order raised because both \nviolated the budget resolution cap of spending no more than $300 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That was an important point. Both of \nthe bills we debated that did not attain those 60 votes needed were in \nexcess of the $300 billion cap that the Budget Committee of the Senate, \nthis Senate, this body, voted for last year. But after October 1, there \nare no caps because we are not operating under a budget.\n  Finally, the underlying Medicare Program is still in danger of \nbecoming insolvent. Let me pass on an interesting number. When Medicare \nwas passed in 1965, Part A hospital costs for 1990 were projected to be \n$9 billion. In 1990, Medicare Part A actually spent $67 billion.\n  So from the projection, in 1965, out 25 years, as to how much \nMedicare Part A would cost, all the actuaries said then--all the smart \npeople, all the medical care people--we would be spending, including \ninflation, and the rates of increase in costs--all the dynamics that \nare part of health care--$9 billion in 1990 when, in fact, we spent $67 \nbillion in 1990.\n  We should pay attention to this number. I do not know of a Federal \nprogram--especially entitlement programs--that did not go far beyond \nany projections, partly because we always, for the political benefit, \nunderstate the numbers. But the numbers I have just recited are real \nnumbers.\n  We ask, why should we be concerned about costs? I see a lot of young \npeople sitting in the galleries. You better be concerned about some \ncosts. You better be very concerned about what we do on prescription \ndrugs because if we do not pay attention, and we are not concerned and \nenact an accountable, responsible, affordable program, I do not know \nhow you are going to afford it--because you are going to pay for it. \nYou will be paying for my prescription drug costs.\n  So we must act in a responsible, accountable way. Each of us who has \nthe high privilege of serving in this body is but a passing, fleeting \nsteward of your interests and the interests of this country. That is \nour highest responsibility.\n  According to a preliminary actuarial analysis--we are getting CBO \nscores on our amendment--our proposal would cost less than $200 billion \nover the next 10 years. In fact, the numbers are coming in at around \n$160 billion. That stays within the $300 billion budget resolution that \nthis body, this Senate, voted for last year. The Congressional Budget \nOffice will give us those exact numbers by the end of the day.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to pass a responsible bill, to \nprovide all Medicare beneficiaries with a permanent prescription drug \nbenefit that would start January 1, 2004. We have that now within our \ngrasp.\n  The debate we have had over the last 4 days has been good debate, \nrelevant debate, important debate. All sides, all perspectives have had \nan opportunity to lay this out, as we should, as we are embarking upon \nthis great new entitlement program. And we need this program. Make no \nmistake, this program is necessary. We need to deal with this issue.\n  This amendment that we offer today is not perfect. However, what we \noffer today is a real-world solution to a real-world problem.\n  Our amendment will give beneficiaries the protection they need most. \nAnd we focus on those who need it most, those who are without \nprescription drug insurance, those who are at the bottom of the social-\neconomic ladder, those who have to make hard choices about their lives.\n  We can do this. We must do this. But it must be in a way that is \naccountable and responsible.\n  As the New York Times editorial phrased it this morning:\n\n       The most important short-term priority should be the needs \n     of the fairly narrow, and politically uninfluential, band of \n     Americans\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\n     who have very low incomes and very high drug prices.\n\n  They have said it accurately. They have stated it correctly. They \nhave focused on those who need it most. This amendment does that.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for an opportunity to propose this \namendment and debate it. We will have a vote on it tomorrow. I know a \nnumber of my colleagues wish to speak on this amendment.\n  So I yield the floor to my cosponsor on this amendment, who has \nworked long, hard, diligently, and understands the issue as well as \nanyone in the Senate. I am very proud we have teamed up, along with a \nnumber of our other colleagues, to present something we think is \nimportant for our country that is workable, doable, and responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the co-author of this amendment, \nthe Senator from Nebraska, for the great work he has done; and, by the \nway, that both of our staffs have done in coming up with an amendment \nthat we think is fiscally responsible and that meets the needs of those \nseniors who need it the most.\n  We have heard a lot of examples during the House debate, and during \nthe Senate debate, about those seniors who are having to choose between \npaying rent and paying for prescription drugs, or paying their food \nbills and being able to pay their drug bills. We have heard about a lot \nof heartbreaking stories. Those are real stories that are out there. We \nhave those stories in my home State of Nevada. We get letters from \nthose people all the time.\n  I got an e-mail a few weeks ago from a lady who sent this e-mail at \n11:20 p.m. West Coast Time. She was up thinking--and probably looking \nthrough her medical bills--and just crying out for help, asking if I \nwould be willing to take a moral stand to help seniors who need the \nhelp the most? Our amendment does exactly that. It helps those seniors \nwho need help the most.\n  But this morning, I was also thinking about our responsibility to our \nchildren and the next generation of young people coming up who are \ngoing to be working for a living and paying taxes.\n  Will Medicare and Social Security be there for them? Will this \ncountry be there for them? Somebody has to pay for all of these \nprograms that we are talking about.\n  People have not wanted to means test Medicare and Social Security \nbecause they believed that they have earned this benefit, that they \nhave paid in for this benefit.\n  Realistically speaking, this new prescription drug benefit would not \nbeen earned by anybody that is going to get it, at least early on. \nFrankly, it is a straight giveaway to seniors. It is taking it out of \nthe pocket of younger people who are paying into the system now and \nputting it into the pocket of older people who, while they were working \nand paying taxes, paid for a Medicare program that did not have a \nprescription drug benefit\n  All of us feel a great responsibility to our parents and our \ngrandparents, to take care of them in their golden years. But we must \ndo this in a way that does not put such a burden on young people in our \nsociety that they cannot prosper.\n  Why should their tax rates have to be so high just because we in the \nSenate wanted to get reelected, so we voted for things that just kept \nspending these young people's money? Ultimately, they will have no \nchoice but to pay high taxes because politicians pay attention to the \nsenior citizens because senior citizens vote. We need to pay strict \nattention to what we are doing here and whose money we are doing it \nwith.\n  Once we add a benefit to Medicare, we will not be cutting that \nbenefit in the future. So whatever we do, we better do in a fiscally \nresponsible fashion.\n  Senator Hagel and the rest of the team that has put this amendment \ntogether believes that we have done exactly that: We have provided help \nto those seniors who need it, but we have done it in a fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the amendment and how it works. \nSenator Hagel has covered some of this, but I want to reemphasize a \ncouple points and to use a chart for those who need to see it. I am \nkind of a visual learner and need a chart to understand things \nsometimes, to actually be able to see the numbers on a piece of paper \nso I can put them in my head.\n  The way our bill works, first of all, is that we cap--this is \ncatastrophic coverage--we cap the amount of out-of-pocket, expenses a \nsenior citizen is going to have to pay. We do that based on income. The \npeople who are have the lowest income get the most help. It goes up \nfrom there based on your income level. That seems to make sense if you \nthink about it. Should a person like Ross Perot, who would qualify for \nthis benefit, get the same help as somebody who makes $15, $16, $17,000 \na year--a senior citizen? Should they get the same level of help? I \nthink most people would say they should not get the same level of help.\n  Our bill says that if you are lower income, you are going to get more \nhelp. It also says that the sicker you are, the more help you get \nbecause those seniors who are very sick or who have a chronic condition \nsuch as heart disease, diabetes--and we will talk about a few examples \nlater--pay much more per year in prescription drug costs and our plan \nlimits their out-of-pocket spending. Those are the people our bill \nactually helps more than the leading Democrat proposal or the so-called \ntripartisan proposal.\n  For people who make $17,720 or less a year, up to 200 percent of \npoverty and below, we cap their out-of-pocket expenses at $1,500. This \nis a little over half of the seniors in this country. If you make \nbetween $17,721 and $35,440 per year, your out-of-pocket expenses are \ncapped at $3,500, and it scales up from there.\n  Once again, our program is completely voluntary. I have heard that in \n1987 the Senate passed, and actually enacted into law in 1988, a \ncatastrophic drug benefit plan. We hear people--and I am not sure if \nthey were referring to our plan or not--saying seniors opposed the 1988 \nplan so much, that they repealed it the next year. They were not \nopposed to it because of the catastrophic coverage, they were opposed \nto it because one, they were forced to join; and, two, their Medicare \npremiums went up. Ours is a voluntary program, and it only has an \nannual enrollment fee of $25 per year. That is strictly to take care of \nadministrative costs. We figure about $25 per year is what is necessary \nto handle these costs per enrollee.\n  When you pay that fee and sign up for the program, you will get a \ndrug discount card. You will be able to sign up for various plans in \nthe area, and pharmaceutical benefit managers will have a list of \npharmacies that are participating. They will have a formulary or a list \nof drugs that are offered. You will go through those, and you will say: \nI have this disease, or, I like that particular formulary; maybe I will \nget together with some of my fellow seniors or I will get together with \nmy doctor and say, Which one of these plans do you recommend? Then you \nwill sign up for that plan that best meets your needs. It is the \ncompetition between the plans and the volume buying that will allow the \naverage senior to save somewhere between 25 and 40 percent on the drugs \nthey buy with this drug discount card.\n  Right upfront, they save 25 to 40 percent. Then, we cap their out-of-\npocket expenses. So it is a two-pronged approach. We believe that \nbecause the senior pays initially out of pocket--about $100, $120 a \nmonth for the low-income seniors--that they will shop for their drugs \nand take advantage of the lower prices that are being offered as a \nresult of competition between the participating entities.\n  I want to give a couple of real-life examples of those cases we \nalways hear about--those cases that tug at our heartstrings.\n  James is a 68-year-old man who has an income of about $16,000 per \nyear. He is being treated for diabetes. These are the various \nmedications he is taking: Glucophage, Glyburide, Neurontin, Protonix, \nLescol, and Zoloft. He has monthly prescription drug costs of $478.04, \nand a yearly cost of $5,736.48--so James is paying out of his own \npocket over $5,700 right now. Medicare doesn't cover anything.\n\n  To compare the various plans, first of all, under the Graham-Miller \nplan, James' out-of-pocket expenses would\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\nbe $2,940.00. Under the tripartisan plan, he would pay $2,341.65. Under \nthe Hagel-Ensign plan, he would pay $1,923.65. So for the low- to \nmoderate-income person who has a serious disease, the Hagel-Ensign plan \ngives that person more help than any of the other bills. And example \nafter example has been heard on this floor about has been this type of \na case.\n  If you don't like this one, we will give you the next one. Doris is a \n75-year-old and has an income of around $17,000 a year. She suffers \nfrom diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol, which is not unusual \nfor a senior. Her medications are Lipitor, Glucophage, Insulin, \nCoumadin, and Monopril, for a total cost of $304.03 a month, and \n$4,648.36 a year.\n  Once again, here is how Doris would fare under the various plans \nUnder the Graham-Miller plan, the leading Democrat plan, she would pay \n$2,220.00 a year out of pocket; under the tripartisan plan, she would \npay $2,086.36 a year; and, under our plan, she would pay $1,714.84 a \nyear. Once again, this person does better under the Hagel-Ensign plan \nmore so than either of the other two plans which were voted on and \nfailed to get the 60-vote point of order.\n  To reemphasize, the plan we have all worked on together, including \nSenator Gramm of Texas, provides a Medicare prescription drug benefit \nin a much more fiscally responsible way and takes into account future \ngenerations.\n  There is a third example I want to talk about. Betty, who is a 66-\nyear-old, has an income of $15,500 per year. She is being treated for \nbreast cancer. She is still receiving low-dose radiation therapy with \nNolvadex. Her medication profile is as follows: Morphine, Paxil, \nDexamethasone, Aciphex, Trimethobenzamide, and Nolvadex--monthly total \nof $668.33 and $8,019.96 per year.\n  These are three real-life cases from Nevada. The names have been \nchanged to protect their privacy.\n  Betty's medications, under the three different proposals, once again: \nUnder the Graham-Miller plan, the leading Democrat plan, she would pay \n$3,180.00 out-of-pocket expense; under the tripartisan plan, $2,570.00; \nand under the Hagel-Ensign plan, $2,152.00 out-of-pocket expense.\n  The person who is the sickest, who is moderate to low income, is the \nperson our plan benefits more than any of the other plans. That is why \nwe think our plan is superior, because when we hear about people, when \nthey go on the talk shows, when they talk in front of seniors groups, \nwhen we are hearing all these horror stories, these last three examples \nare the type of people about whom they are talking.\n  So if my colleagues really want to help those seniors who need it the \nmost, they should support our plan. The other thing is--and I will \nconclude with this--that we have had two other plans voted down today. \nThe two plans that were voted down, because they did not get the 60-\nvote point of order, are pretty much dispensed with at this point. \nSenators should ask themselves if they want to get a bill done this \nyear. If they do, this is your best chance of doing it.\n  If we pass this plan in a bipartisan fashion, lay aside the \npolitics--and we said we are going to put seniors ahead of politics, \nand ahead of being a Republican, or ahead of being a Democrat--we can \npass a plan now. We should put seniors ahead of a political issue in \nthis November's election. This Hagel-Ensign bill is the bill that \noffers that opportunity for people.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to support our bill. It will be voted on \ntomorrow. We have a great chance and a great opportunity for the \nAmerican people, and especially for those seniors and disabled people \nwho are on Medicare, to really get the help that they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Allard as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 4315.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am not going to speak very long, but I \nknow my colleagues, the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from \nNevada, put forward their plan. I thought I would make a few points in \nregard to it. I commend them for their effort. They are trying to do \nsomething that is extremely difficult. They are trying to be both \nresponsible in a plan in terms of how much they will provide, in terms \nof helping people who need help, but at the same time, they are trying \nto be as fiscally, I guess they would say responsible--I would say as \nminimal as possible. I would say, yes, if you just look at the plan and \nsay which one should cost the least, the Hagel-Ensign plan is there.\n  If you look at all the other things we do in the budget and then say \nwe don't have any money for this, repeal of the estate tax comes to \nmind, which I believe both of my colleagues have supported--and most \nhave supported--and ask if it is an either/or proposition if you want \nto be fiscally responsible, which would people choose? A more generous \nplan. I think that cost us $600 billion in the President's budget to \nmake that permanent. Putting together a generous plan and not repealing \nthe estate tax, or repealing the estate tax and having this minimal \nplan, my guess is that 80 or 90 percent of the American people would \nreject the plan put forward by my colleagues from Nebraska and Nevada.\n  I guess if I had to think of the rubric of the plan, they are trying \nto be compassionate conservatives. It is a hard thing to do, a \ndifficult thing to do. I respect their real effort to do it.\n  If my colleagues think this is a generous or adequate plan, it \nclearly is not. In fact, some have argued that this would be a step \nbackward. That is not Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, but it is \nAARP. I will read some excerpts from the AARP letter on this plan sent \nto Senator Hagel on July 23. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Hagel: Enacting a comprehensive prescription \n     drug benefit in Medicare this year remains the top priority \n     for AARP. Our members are counting on the Senate to pass a \n     meaningful drug benefit that is available and affordable to \n     all beneficiaries. Our members were promised in the last \n     election that a comprehensive drug benefit would be a \n     priority, and we are counting on you to make good on that \n     promise this year.\n       We appreciate the intent of your bill, S. 2736, the \n     ``Medicare Rx Drug Discount and Security Act of 2002,'' to \n     provide a prescription drug discount card and stop-loss \n     protection to Medicare beneficiaries. However, in addition to \n     our substantive objections, we are concerned that by offering \n     this scaled-back proposal today, you would effectively derail \n     bipartisan discussion and compromise on more meaningful \n     comprehensive approaches. We believe Congress should focus \n     its efforts on enactment of a more comprehensive drug benefit \n     this year.\n       In addition to the timing of your proposal, AARP has \n     concerns about the approach taken in your bill, including:\n       Catastrophic coverage--While AARP has not opposed income-\n     relating premiums, income-relating the Medicare benefit \n     changes the nature of the program. This would set an \n     extremely dangerous precedent in Medicare. Further, the stop-\n     loss levels set in the bill do not provide enough protection \n     for lower income beneficiaries. A low-income couple could \n     spend 25 percent of their income just for drugs before this \n     plan offered assistance. Thirdly, there are a number of \n     issues involved in using tax returns to determine program \n     eligibility levels, and we believe other options should be \n     explored.\n       Discount card--While AARP supports the use of a discount \n     card program as a building block for a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit, your proposal lacks the necessary \n     specifications to guaranty the level of discount, what level \n     of discount would be passed to beneficiaries, and the degree \n     of consumer protections required of plans.\n       Given these concerns, AARP opposes your amendment. We \n     remain fully committed to developing a comprehensive drug \n     benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries and we look forward to \n     working with you on legislation that our members can support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli,\n                                       Executive Director and CEO.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me quote from the letter to Senator Hagel:\n\n       Our members are counting on the Senate to pass a meaningful \n     drug benefit that is available and affordable to all \n     beneficiaries.\n\n  AARP goes on to say that while they appreciate the intent of S. \n2736--this is their quote--they are\n\n       . . . concerned that by offering this scaled-back proposal \n     today, you would effectively derail bipartisan discussion and \n     compromise on more meaningful, comprehensive approaches.\n\n  That is exactly the problem. I think when seniors from one end of \nthis country to the other hear the exact specifics of the Hagel plan, \nthey are going\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nto be shocked. I think they even probably think that the most generous \nof the plans--the Graham-Miller-Kennedy plan--doesn't go far enough in \nterms of help that they need. To hear this one--and I will get into \nsome of the details--I think they would say: Gee whiz, what the heck \ndid they do? If we went home and said we passed a prescription drug \nbenefit and passed the Hagel-Ensign bill, most of our constituents \nwould say--correctly--no, you didn't, and don't you claim that you did \nbecause you are not helping the vast majority of people who desperately \nneed the help.\n  I will go on with the AARP letter. They are worried about the \ncatastrophic nature of the Hagel-Ensign bill. Quoting them:\n\n       While AARP has not opposed income-relating premiums, \n     income-relating the Medicare benefit changes the nature of \n     the problem. This would set up an extremely dangerous \n     precedent in Medicare.\n\n  That is exactly right. Anybody who thinks this bill is helping \nmiddle-class people hasn't read it. The vast majority of our \nconstituents who struggle with the cost of drugs, who may be making \n$20,000 or $25,000 and paying a couple thousand dollars--not $6,000, \nbut $2,000--are left out in the cold by this bill. They are far more \ntypical than the examples my good colleague from Nevada has brought up \nin his chart.\n  So to think that this is comprehensive, to think that it covers most, \nis wrong. We do have a choice. It is a value choice. How much are we \nwilling to spend to help people? You cannot have it both ways. You \ncannot say we are passing a comprehensive prescription drug benefit and \nnot spend the money for it. These drugs are wonderful, but they are \nexpensive, and you cannot avoid that conundrum. You have to decide \nwhich side of the fence you are on.\n  With some regret, and I say it in admiration for their bold essay, \nthe Hagel-Ensign amendment says we are on the side not of providing \nbroad, comprehensive coverage but, rather, doing a little bit. And, \nagain, as I said, put into the context of all the other things we spend \nmoney on, put in the context of the desire on the other side to \ncontinue with tax cuts, which takes their budget and puts it in a \nwarped and pretzel-like way, it is not what the American people want.\n  So I am going to conclude with this quote:\n\n       Given these concerns, AARP opposes your amendment. We \n     remain fully committed to developing a comprehensive drug \n     benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries, and we look forward \n     to working with you on legislation that our members can \n     support.\n\n  What AARP said to my colleagues I say as well. Let me just go over \nsome of these things. This is the Hagel bill. Senior citizens with an \nincome of $9,000--in parts of my State, that is not enough to pay rent, \nwe would make that senior citizen with a $9,000 income pay $1,500 \nbefore the benefit outlined in the Hagel-Ensign bill--before they got \nany help at all. Now, is that fair? Is that right? Even taking the \nbasic philosophy of Hagel-Ensign--and I disagree with it, but I respect \nit, helping the very poor who need the help--when you have a $9,000 \nincome in most parts of America, you cannot afford to pay $1,500 in \nprescription drugs. You will never get there. That will be 17 percent \nof somebody's income. That is wrong.\n  Now, my friend from Nevada took one side of the line. I am going to \ntake the other side of the line. He used a $17,000 example. Let's say \nyou go to $18,000 in income. Nobody is rich on $18,000, whether you \nlive in Nebraska, Nevada, or in Manhattan. It is harder in Manhattan \nthan anywhere else. Your standard of living is different with the same \nincome level there.\n  Listen to this: A senior making $18,000 would have to pay $3,500 \nbefore they receive any help. That is not the kind of benefit the \nAmerican people are asking for whether they be senior citizens or \nyounger people with parents. That is 20 percent of their income. If \nyour income is $18,000, you pay $3,500 first? What they would say in \nNew York is: Forget about it. What they would say to the rest of the \ncountry is: Please go back and try to do a little better.\n\n  Even a senior citizen with an income of $35,000--once you are at \n$35,000 and you are a senior citizen, hopefully your kids are out of \nthe house and you are not doing that badly, although, again, in parts \nof New York, $35,000 does not stretch too far when you have an average \nrental payment of $1,000 a month or $800 a month. That eats a lot of \nit, and then you take taxes and other expenses. That person would have \nto pay $5,500, 16 percent of their income, before they got any help.\n  My guess is that 98 percent of all senior citizens at that level of \nincome--hardly a very high level--would not qualify for this program at \nall. The number who pay that huge amount for prescription drugs--and \nthat is the amount they would need before the program begins--is small.\n  I would not call this insurance. I would not call it Medicare. If it \nwould become law, poor senior citizens would still be choosing between \nfood on the table and the medicines they need to survive. That senior \ncitizen who is making $9,000 and paying $1,500 for their much-needed \nprescription drugs is still choosing between food on the table and \nmedicine.\n  Middle-class senior citizens who are willing to pay a little more in \ncopayments and monthly payments would not get a benefit that they would \nfind worthwhile at all. It would not affect most of them.\n  To all of my colleagues, this bill is more fiscally tight, stingier, \nif you will, than the House Republican bill. It is more inadequate than \neither of the two bills voted for in the Senate. I do not know a single \norganization of the elderly or the disabled that supports it, and I do \nnot believe it deserves the support of the Senate.\n  The fight for a real Medicare prescription drug benefit does not end \ntoday. In fact, I argue that we made some progress today. Fifty-two \nvotes for the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill is a lot of progress, and, in \nfact, should we adjust the Budget Act next year, that 52 votes might be \nadequate to actually pass the bill. Once we forget these notions of \nspending money on things that virtually nobody wants, except a small \nrarefied few, we will be able to do it.\n  We made progress today. I am not despairing. I compliment the Senator \nfrom Georgia, as well as the Senator from Florida and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who will be here shortly, for putting together a \nproposal that I think does much more of both: It is still fiscally \nwithin our means but really is broad and comprehensive and deals with \npeople's needs.\n  To vote for Hagel-Ensign I think would be a cop-out. In fact, the \nargument was made by my friends--again, I salute the sincerity of their \neffort; I really do. This is an honest proposal and I thank them for \nthat, but they admitted themselves: We will not do much after this.\n  I would rather go back to the drawing board and try to pass something \nthat far better meets the American people's needs, such as the bill \nproffered by the Senators from Florida, Georgia, and Massachusetts. I \nurge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, and let's keep working on \nthis issue until we get it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to get into an argument with \nour dear friend from New York. I will say, I think in New York if you \nmake $9,000 a year, you qualify for Medicaid. So you are completely \ncovered.\n  I also have to say, if we are going to take the approach the Senator \nfrom New York takes, and that is ``how much are they willing to spend \nto help you,'' then we get into a debate not about what works, not \nabout what is feasible, not about what we can afford, but who is \nwilling to spend more money?\n  In truth, we have already been in that debate. I want to show my \ncolleagues this, because this is frightening to me.\n  In 1999, just before he left office, President Clinton proposed a \ncomprehensive drug benefit--let me start earlier. We had, through a \nlegislative act of Congress, a bipartisan commission appointed with \nSenator Breaux as chairman. I was on that commission. Part of what we \ndid is we put together a proposal to modernize Medicare through the use \nof competitive marketplace forces.\n  For example, if you have a cane with four little legs on it and you \nbuy it\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\nthrough Medicare, the average Medicare cost is $40. The VA, which has \nnever been thought of as the world's most efficient buyer, buys it for \n$15. The Breaux commission put together a proposal to modernize \nMedicare and to use some of those savings to help people get coverage \nfor pharmaceuticals, and the way they got it was opting into a more \ncost-effective system.\n  That proposal actually saved money because reforms in Medicare save \nmore money than providing the pharmaceuticals cost within this more \ncompetitive environment.\n  President Clinton, who had us all down to the White House, looked us \nin the eye and said: Don't let this process fail because of you. I was \none of the members of this commission. President Clinton looked us \nright in the eye and said: Don't let it fail because of you. And then \nall four of his appointees voted no at the last minute. We needed 11 \nout of the 17 to make a recommendation to Congress, and we only got 10.\n  At that point, incredibly, providing pharmaceuticals not only did not \ncost money, it was part of a reform program where the savings we would \nhave gotten with Medicare reform would have paid for the pharmaceutical \nbenefit.\n  That is where the debate started, and we failed to act because of one \nvote on the bipartisan commission, when all four of the President's \nappointees voted no. In fact, they had a press conference at the White \nHouse denouncing the plan before we had the vote.\n  At that point, at the end of his administration, President Clinton \nsaid: We can have a comprehensive benefit for $168 billion. That was in \n1999 just as President Clinton was ending his term.\n  Then Congress in 2000 had a proposal. Former Senator Robb from \nVirginia was the author of that proposal, and it cost $242 billion. If \nyou went back and looked at that debate, everybody who was for that \nplan said: We can solve this problem. If you will just give us $242 \nbillion, we can solve the problem.\n  Then you will remember the budget debate we had last year, the Baucus \namendment. I could quote 20 Democrat Senators who said: We can provide \nall the benefits we need for $311 billion.\n  I could quote Senator Baucus, I could quote the distinguished \nmajority leader, but it is never fair using people's words against \nthem. I do not do it, but I could.\n  In the budget debate last year, $311 billion would have done \neverything we wanted to do. This year in the budget we said: No, that \nis not enough. That is being tight fisted with the elderly. We do not \nwant $311 billion. In the budget we said $500 billion. The budget did \nnot pass, but that is what the budget had.\n  Now we come to the floor with a proposal that says: We cannot spend \n$500 billion; that is being tight fisted with our seniors. How dare we \nto have thought of $311 billion? What was wrong with Senator Robb's \ntightness at $242 billion? Was Bill Clinton a person who did not love \nthe elderly at $168 billion? What a heartless man he was. Today, we \nsaid: No, it is going to take $600 billion--not $311 billion but $600 \nbillion.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish this point, and I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The $600 billion would not pay for a real program. It \nstarts in 2005. It ends in 2010. So if one does not live until 2005, \nthey get no benefits; if they live past 2010, they get no benefits--and \nit still cost $600 billion.\n  Now, where do we think we are going? Where does all of this end? We \nare asking people to look and see who cares the most. And you can \nmeasure that by how much money they are willing to spend.\n  Where does this end? Will it not go on forever? I am going to yield \nto the Senator, but let me make this point to sort of bring it \ntogether.\n  Forget this red in the chart. That was about this bill that I was \ntalking about when I made the chart. Just look at the yellow on this \nchart. I want to try to impress this one figure on people's minds. \nToday, Medicare, which has an unfunded liability in present value terms \nof $17 trillion--when you discount it above the present value of the \nrevenues we are going to collect, today it is taking 2 percent of the \neconomy. If we do not pass any drug benefit and we just leave Medicare \nas it is, by 2030 it is going to take 4 percent of the economy. Today \nthe payroll tax for Medicare and Social Security is 15.3 percent. If \nleft unchanged, meaning we do not cut it and we do not increase it, the \npayroll tax will have to more than double by 2030 to over 30 cents out \nof every dollar earned by every worker to pay for Social Security and \nMedicare. That is without a prescription drug benefit.\n  Some people estimate that if the bill had been adopted that we \nsustained a point of order against today, this would go not from 2 \npercent of the economy to 4 percent but from 2 percent to 6 percent. We \nwould literally be looking at over 40 cents out of every dollar earned \nby every worker to pay for Social Security and Medicare.\n  I understand all of these people who want these benefits are writing \nthese letters saying we do not love them enough--that $170 billion is \nnot enough. They say these people who want to spend $600 billion love \nus more. Of course, they are going to love us even more next year with \n$900 billion. There will be lots of love next year.\n  The point is, does anybody care if young workers 28 years from today \nare paying 40 cents out of every dollar they earn on Medicare and \nSocial Security? How much love can we afford? That, I think, is a \ncritical point.\n  So I beg my colleagues, let us not get in the business where we \nmeasure a program simply by how much it costs.\n  Others I am sure want to speak, but I am going to talk about how this \nprogram gets you a lot for every dollar you spend. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  First, our colleague from Texas has been on the floor a whole lot \nlately on all of the various issues which we have been debating. He has \nalways been a great warrior and a great debater, but since he announced \nhis retirement, he is a happier warrior. Every argument he makes, he \nhas a twinkle in his eye. I compliment him for that. It is a pleasure \nto listen to him, as much as I disagree with him. I do not know if this \nwould happen to the rest of us if we also announced we would not be \nhere, we would be much happier in our arguments, but I want to make \nthree points and ask them to form the question.\n  First, I ask my colleague from Texas if he knew that the Medicare \nlevel in New York is $599, which is $7,200 a year. I ask him if he knew \nthat.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I were from New York, I would be trying to change that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, we will, maybe with the help of the Senator from \nTexas. In any case, that person in the example does not qualify.\n  The second question I ask my colleague is this. I like his chart. It \nsort of fits my argument because that last number is $600 billion. As I \nunderstand it, if we did not make the estate tax repeal permanent, \nsomething my colleague from Texas has fought very long and hard over, \nthat would be about $670 billion, as I understand it. That is how much \nit would cost over the same 10-year period. So we are not talking about \nthe ability of the Government to pay this; we are talking about size of \ngovernment. That is one of the great debates we have. But it is not \nthat my colleague says we cannot afford it; rather, he is using it for \ndifferent purposes.\n  At least to me, when I go from one end of my State to the other, the \nnumber of people who ask for estate tax repeal is much smaller than the \nnumber who ask for a comprehensive prescription drug plan for Medicare.\n  So I ask my colleague, aside from the ideological and philosophical \nargument about size of government and all of that--on which we have had \nnice debates on both the floor and in our various committees that we \nshare--but certainly within the contemplation of my good friend from \nTexas, if we did not take that money for estate tax reduction, we could \nput it into this program; am I right about that? This is a simple value \nchoice.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am going to answer that point. Was there a third point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. The third point is this: When we compared the \nprograms, the $168 billion, the $242 billion, and the $311 billion, \nthat was apples and oranges, as I understand it. The benefit I remember \nfrom the Robb program that my friend from Texas pointed out did not \nhave the same level of benefit, the same generosity of benefit, as the \nplan proffered by the Senators\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nfrom Florida, Georgia, and Massachusetts. So we are really comparing \napples and oranges.\n  It is not that anybody thought the original plans did everything, it \nwas just the amount of money they were willing to spend, and in fact, \nas I recall it, the Robb plan was sort of objective because people \nthought for the amount of money it cost compared to the amount of \nbenefit, it was not quite worth it, at least in political terms, using \npolitics in the finer sense in terms of people's value choices.\n\n  Those are my three questions to my colleague, and I welcome the \nanswers he will give with the same twinkle in his eye.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me begin with No. 3 first. We are comparing apples and \napples. In 2001, in the political bidding war we were in then, $311 \nbillion represented a sufficient number of apples to engage \nsuccessfully in the bidding contest. Today, it is $600 billion and \nheading up. My point is that, beginning with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the majority leader, we had Members saying last \nyear that $311 billion would provide a wonderful program. The problem \nis, this year it is $600 billion, and that is a wonderful program. And \nit is not apples and oranges, it is a lot more apples.\n  Secondly, I think where my colleague is leading on the death tax \nthing is kind of a circular argument. If you are willing to take away \npeople's money, the only limit you get as to how much you can spend on \nMedicare or anything else is the amount of money that can be extracted \nwithout destroying the productivity of society.\n  The point I had made earlier was that you are already committed under \nthe existing program to take 30 cents out of every dollar everybody \nearns to pay for Social Security and Medicare. If you adopted your \nprogram, by some estimates you would be paying 40 cents out of every \ndollar that people earn, and the question is: Is that something that \nthe economy can bear, and is that fair to young people?\n  In terms of the death tax, we have a very different view of the death \ntax. Nobody in my family ever paid any death tax, and nobody ever \nbequeathed anybody anything because they did not have anything. But \nwhen somebody works a lifetime to build up a farm or a family business, \nthe view of the Senator is that that belongs to the Government and my \nview is it belongs to the people who build it up. They build it up for \ntheir family, and it is not right for us to force their family to sell \noff their business or sell off their farm or sell off their life's work \nto give the Government 55 cents out of every dollar they earn.\n  It is a perfectly legitimate position to say they ought to have to do \nthat, but it is not something of which I am supportive. I think it is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  There are other people who want to speak.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am not yielding but thanking him for the answers.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me also say one thing that has happened about which I \nam worried. Many of my Democrat colleagues, knowing that this tax cut \nthat we adopted is temporary--because of this quirk in the budget, \nunless something changes it goes away in 10 years--almost seem \ndetermined to spend and spend and spend until we have to take the tax \ncut away.\n  I remind my colleagues, throughout American history the highest \nsustainable tax rate that we have been able to sustain over long \nperiods of time was taking 19 cents, on average, of every dollar \ncreated in the economy. When we adopted the tax cut last year, the \nGovernment was taking 22 cents out of every dollar produced in the \neconomy. That was a record high that only had one year higher. That was \n1944 at the peek of the war effort. I hope people do not believe we \nshould go back to a 22-percent tax burden.\n  The final point I make, the Senator acts as if death taxes would pay \nfor Medicare. We all know Medicare is funded by payroll taxes. If you \nare working in some factory somewhere--I don't imagine you are watching \nthis debate, but if you are and say you are taking a coffee break and \nthis is the only thing they have on in the factory--don't think that \nsome rich guy is going to be forced to sell off his farm to pay for \nyour Medicare. You are going to have to pay for it with higher payroll \ntaxes. Don't be confused.\n  Now, I have talked longer than I had intended. Let me make a couple \nof points. First, I read a quote, from John C. Rother, policy director \nof AARP. In recognizing that the two big plans would be defeated, he \nsaid: Another possibility is for Medicare to provide catastrophic \ncoverage for prescription drug expenses over a certain threshold.\n  And he notes also that we could have a Government-authorized discount \ncard.\n  Now, let me make my points about this bill and stop. First, I had \nvirtually nothing to do with writing this bill. Two Senators have been \nprincipal authors of it. I recognized, in simply looking at it, that it \nwas the best plan around. They came up with it.\n  Why is it the best plan around? First, it is within budget. Now, it \nis hardly some insignificant amount of money. Somewhere between $140 \nand $170 billion is what this costs. That is a lot of money.\n  What it does is provides the most help to people who fall into two \ncategories: A, you don't have very much income; and B, you have high \ndrug bills. I submit those are the people who need the help the most.\n  The problem with the other two proposals--let me make my criticism \nbipartisan--the problem with the other two proposals is that they spend \n80 percent of their money helping people who don't need help. When you \ntake the view that the Government ought to have a program that pays at \nleast 25 percent of the drug bill for Bill Gates and Ross Perot--that \nit is not a universal program unless they are covered--you are going to \nend up spending huge amounts of money paying for people who don't need \nthe help. You end up paying for the roughly two-thirds of people who \nalready have health insurance for pharmaceuticals, because you \nsubstitute the taxpayer for the private insurance policy they already \nhave as part of their retirement program.\n  The point I am trying to make is you are spending 80 cents on people \nwho either almost have the benefit or don't need it to get 20 cents on \nthe target to people who do need it.\n  The advantage of the Hagel-Ensign bill is that it puts every dollar \non the target. This is what it says. Again, you can spend more money; \nGod knows you can spend more money. But just listen to what it does. \nLet me take a retired couple. If their income is $23,000, they would \nhave to pay roughly $100 a month in drug bills themselves, but at \nslightly above $100 a month this program kicks in and they get full \npayment except, possibly, a very small, little copayment per \nprescription.\n  Now, our colleague from New York said a huge number of seniors, 80 \npercent I think he said, would reject this program. I don't believe it. \nMy mama's drug bill is $400 a month. She does not want help in 2005. \nShe does not know if she will be alive in 2005. She wants help now.\n  The advantage of this program is that it provides help right now. \nWhat it would mean in her case is she would have to pay a little over \n$100 a month and now she is paying $400 a month.\n  Now, if your income goes up, then the deductible goes up. For \nexample, if you are making $46,000 a year, your deductible is $3,500. \nIf you are retired, most retirees who make $46,000 a year own their own \nhome. What this bill says is, if your expenses on pharmaceuticals get \nup really high, the Government is going to come in and help you. If you \nmake $69,000, you have to spend $5,500 to get the payment by the \nGovernment. So it is tied to your income.\n\n  And for Bill Gates and people who are very wealthy, they have to \nspend 20 percent of their income on pharmaceuticals. Bill Gates will \nnever get a benefit and he shouldn't. He doesn't need it, and he \ndoesn't want it. He might not even take it.\n  That is not the only help you get, by the way, because immediately \nthis program would let private companies contract through Medicare to \nrepresent Medicare beneficiaries in negotiating for their \npharmaceuticals. So each of these companies would compete in buying the \ndrugs you buy. You would buy from whoever could sell them to you the \ncheapest, and it is estimated that they would save you somewhere \nbetween 25 percent and 40 percent of the cost of your drug bill.\n  In my mama's case, this would mean spending much less than $400 a \nmonth--\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nit is estimated that these companies, because they have more buying \npower, would get the best price. She goes to the same pharmacy because \nit is the one convenient to her house. These companies could go all \nover the country to find her drugs and buy them the cheapest. They \ncould save her $100 on average just simply by being competitive.\n  Remember I told you about the cane with four legs on it--Dr. Frist, \nyou have seen them--lots of people have them in hospitals. Medicare \npays $40 for that cane on average. The VA buys that cane for $15 \nbecause they go out and engage in competitive bidding. These companies \nwould do the same thing. Then, anything above $100 per month, the \nFederal Government would pay.\n  If you said to my mother and anybody else's mother: Would you rather \nhave the Government pay the whole thing? The answer would be yes. She \nwould rather the Government pay the whole thing. But the point is, this \nis a reasonable, responsible program that would help real people.\n  Finally, Senator Ensign has presented three or four times--you can \nnever do it enough--cases of people who have real high drug bills, and \nremarkably he has shown that his program is cheaper for them than these \nvery expensive programs. Before somebody runs down here to the floor to \nanswer me and says: How is it possible? We spend $600 billion and \nSenator Ensign spends $170 billion and you are saying it is cheaper? \nYou are saying it is cheaper under Senator Ensign's program. How can \nthat be when he doesn't spend as much money?\n  The answer is very simple. He doesn't cover everybody. If you do not \nhave high pharmaceutical bills--and in any given year a substantial \nnumber of seniors do not--and if you do not have moderate income, he \nhelps you get competitive purchase of your drugs, which saves you \nbetween 25 percent and 40 percent. But the Government does not pay if \nyou do not fall in this category of people. You don't get help under \nthose circumstances.\n  Now you say everybody should get help. The point is, this bill helps \nthe people who need the help the most. This is a good proposal.\n  I remind my colleagues, we are at an impasse here. There are some \npeople already talking about spending more money to break the logjam. \nThe logical thing to do now, if we want to act this year, is to take \nthis proposal and adopt it. That will help people who need the help \nmost and help them now. Then we can come back next year. We can look at \nthe budget situation, we can see where we are, and in the process we \ncan supplement this if we want to.\n  Let me give you one example because Senator Ensign has done it better \nthan I could possibly do it. This is somebody who lives in Nevada. He \ncalls her Betty Smith. She is 66 years old. She has an income of \n$15,000 per year. She is being treated for a whole bunch of things.\n\n  Her drug bill is $8,000 a year. My mother's drug bill is $4,600 a \nyear and, thank God, she doesn't have these kinds of problems. So it is \neasy to believe an $8,000 bill.\n  Here is the point. Look at the Hagel-Ensign bill under exactly this \nsituation. Your income is $15,500 and you are being treated for breast \ncancer and you are taking all these drugs and you have a $8,000 bill, \nso you are spending over half of your income on drugs. This is \nliterally somebody. We all talk about this cliche of people being \nforced to choose between medicine and food. I hope her children are \nhelping her. If they aren't, they ought to be. But she would \nliterally--if she didn't have any children, didn't have anybody helping \nher--she would literally be choosing between eating and drugs.\n  Now, here are the three bills. Two of them we voted on, and one we \nare about to vote on. The point that Senator Ensign has made is that \nunder the bill that costs $600 billion and covers everybody, this lady \nwould have to pay $3,180 a year. Under the tripartisan bill, she would \nhave to pay $2,570 a year. But under the Hagel-Ensign bill, she would \npay $2,152. In other words, for a lady who is very sick and who has a \nvery moderate income, she would be better off under this plan.\n  But for people who say how is that possible when it only spends $170 \nbillion, the way it is possible is it is focused to help exactly people \nlike this lady. It does not take the view that we have to provide the \nGovernment program for everybody. It just helps people who need the \nhelp. And it provides this system of competitive purchase for \neverybody.\n  So, I urge my colleagues, do not get into this business about saying \nthis cannot be as good as that because that costs so much more money. \nSome of the best things in life are not necessarily the most expensive. \nRemember, we are going to have to pay for it. Not ``we'' being Members \nof the Senate. We are not going to pay for it. We don't pay for \nanything. We are going to be covered by the Government insurance \nprogram when we get out of here. But that blue collar worker on that \nassembly line is going to have to pay for it.\n  I congratulate my colleagues. This bill ought to be adopted. There is \na budget point of order against it but not because it is over budget. \nIt is because we wrote in the budget that the bill had to come out of \nthe Finance Committee. The Finance Committee refused to report a bill, \nso no bill could come out of the Finance Committee. So every bill had a \nbudget point of order. If it had gone through the Finance Committee, no \npoint of order would have lied against this bill. However, if the \nGraham-Kennedy bill had gone through the Finance Committee, two points \nof order would still have lied against the it, a section 302 and a \nsection 311 point of order, as well as the tripartisan bill.\n  But this bill is not subject to a point of order because it spends \ntoo much money. It is subject to a point of order because the Finance \nCommittee was not allowed to do its job.\n  So I hope people will look at this and decide we can help a lot of \npeople, and we can do it right now. The purchasing discounts would \nstart immediately. We do not have to wait until 2005. And this is \nsomething we can afford. We could come back and do more next year if we \nhad the money.\n  I appreciate my colleagues listening, and I commend this program to \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask the sponsor of the amendment to \nyield to me 10 minutes to debate the issue.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield to the Senator from Kansas 10 minutes off our \ntime, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Might I inquire of the Chair how much time is \nremaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized \nat the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for \nallowing me the time and for his proposal. I think it is an outstanding \nproposal and one that we can do and one that we can afford and one that \ncan provide benefits to some people who really need this help and need \nit now. It is something I think we could build on in the future.\n  Remember now, we are talking about a group of people who do not have \npharmaceutical benefits and need them, people with low income but above \nMedicaid; low income, and this is taking a big portion of their income. \nThey have to have these pharmaceutical drug benefits. They need it. \nHere is a proposal where we can do it.\n  If I can just make an observation at the outset: This process cries \nto go back to the Finance Committee and come out of the Finance \nCommittee. This has not been taken through the Finance Committee. It \nclearly should have been. This is the largest--this will be the largest \nnew entitlement program that I will have voted on since I have been in \nthe Congress, either the House or the Senate, by far. I think at the \nend of the day, when the dollars are tallied up, you are looking at a \nmultitrillion-dollar program because once we start a benefit, we do not \nstop it. This is something that we will start, and will do, and it is \ngoing to continue for a number of years. It is something we need to do.\n\n  But if you are going to start, at the end of the day, a trillion-\ndollar program in all probability, you need to take it through the \nright process. It needs to come through the committee that looks at the \nnumbers and figures out how to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  To just pass a benefit and say we are going to do it, and we will \nfigure out how to pay for it after the bills come due, is the height of \nirresponsibility on our part.\n  I have two charts. I do not want to overburden everyone with lines on \na chart, but I want to point out, this is where we are today with these \nvarious proposals. This black line represents the total income for \nMedicare. I call this chart ``The Great Medicare Accounting Scandal'' \nbecause I do not think we are accounting for the real cost of these \nprograms.\n  We are being critical of people--and rightfully so--in corporate \nAmerica for not accounting for real costs and for sliding things around \nsaying: Well, OK, we will capitalize this, but it should have been a \ndirect expenditure and expense. We are criticizing them--and rightfully \nso--for doing that.\n  What are we doing here? What are we doing here on our accounting? The \nblack line is the amount of money we have coming into Medicare. The red \nline is the Graham-Kennedy benefit proposal. You can see, in year 1 of \nthe benefit, in the year 2005, the expenditures are more than the \nincome we have coming in from Medicare. In the first year out of the \nbox, you are spending more money than you have coming in in Medicare. \nThat does not count the accumulation that you are going to have up \nuntil 2010, when the program, theoretically, ends. But, of course, it \ndoes not.\n  We do not terminate benefit programs. It is going to continue past \n2010, into 2011, which is the first year the baby boomers start \nretiring. So you have this group of soon-to-be seniors--72 million baby \nboomers--in America. Count myself amongst them. That is kind of the big \nlump in the python coming through, the pig in the python, in the \ndemographic charts in the United States, starting in 2011, where the \nprogram is supposed to end in 2010. Of course, it isn't going to \nhappen.\n  On this chart, where would this red line be in the year 2011, when \nyou start getting this large group of retirees coming into the system? \nIt is going to be much higher and be an accounting scandal for us.\n\n  So how are you going to pay for this? You are either going to cut \nbenefits, which I do not think we are going to do, you are going to \nraise payroll taxes, which I would think would be the wrong thing to \ndo--we already load so much on people working in the system--or are you \ngoing to try to take this from somewhere else in the system, or raise \nthe deficit? Probably you are going to do all of those things, other \nthan cutting benefits. But we are not talking about that in this system \nright now.\n  Look here, on this chart, at the various other proposals that we \nhave.\n  The purple line shows the total expenditures today, without a \nbenefit. The Hagel-Ensign proposal is shown by the green line.\n  Of the proposals that are coming forward--and I think we need to have \na prescription drug benefit--this is the most responsible one that we \ncan handle and that we can do. And we, clearly, should do something.\n  The process cries out for us, right now, to do something now and not \njust to have something for campaigns. Here is the Democrat proposal. \nHere is the Republican proposal. But you cannot take those as \nprescription drugs. That is not income to you. You cannot eat promises. \nThat is what we have sitting out there now. And that is where it seems \nthe debate is heading, unless we can take it back to the Finance \nCommittee and have a legitimate process, one where we would come out \nwith a benefit that people can afford and need to have today.\n  This one has been a very disappointing discussion, to me, in the \nsense that there is a clear compromise that sits out there that is \navailable to do, and we could cobble together different proposals of \nany of these bills and figure out how to make it work, and get a \nbipartisan proposal that we would all support, that would include a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  That sits out there to be had. That can take place. Instead, we are \njust saying, no, we are going to take it through this different \nprocess. We are going to bypass the Finance Committee on the most \nexpensive entitlement program that I will have voted on as a Member of \nthis body. We are going to bypass the normal process. We will just have \na political debate on it that I do not think is edifying for the body \nand is not the right way to go.\n  On the particular proposal, the Hagel-Ensign proposal, of which I am \npleased to support, I also note that it is supported by AARP. Unlike my \ncolleague from New York, who said the AARP does not support it, in \ntoday's New York Times, John Rother, policy director of AARP, said \nthis:\n\n       Another possibility is for Medicare to provide catastrophic \n     coverage for prescription drug expenses over a certain \n     threshold, perhaps $4,000 to $6,000 a year, with no premium. \n     This could be combined with additional help for low-income \n     beneficiaries and a government-authorized drug discount card.\n\n  That is not my speech supporting Hagel-Ensign. That is from the \npolicy director of AARP in the New York Times today. He is saying: \nLook, you have the parties. Each have a proposal. They are at a \nstandoff on this proposal. What could we get done so we can move this \nforward for the benefit of seniors in America? And he describes the \nHagel-Ensign proposal. That is what we should do.\n  That is the type of proposal we need to move forward. It would be an \nappropriate proposal for us to move forward, so we can provide a \nbenefit, we can get it done now, and provide it to people who need it \nnow. They do not need promises. They need action by us. And they could \nhave the action. This is something we need to do, and we need to do it \nthis way today.\n  This chart shows the various lines depicting where the assets in the \nproposals go. You can see the current projected Medicare trust fund \nassets, and also the projected Medicare trust fund assets under Graham-\nKennedy. You can see where we are taking this proposal. This line is \ngoing south, fast, if you get a benefit that you cannot afford.\n  I ask a rhetorical question of all my colleagues: Would we rather \nencounter the first wave of baby boomer retirees with $660 billion in \nthe Medicare trust fund or would we rather encounter retirees having \nspent all but $250 billion? That is what these lines point out.\n  We know we have the baby boomer generation hitting in 2011. They \nstart jumping into the retirement pool in 2011. We want to face them \nwith some money built up at that point in time and still have a \nprescription drug benefit like what is in Hagel-Ensign, or even the \ntripartisan bill. We can get there with more assets in the bank and \nstill provide today a prescription drug benefit for those who need it \ntoday. And they need it today.\n  I really think we should set our Republican and Democrat caps aside \nand say we can provide this to people who need it today. For the 27 \npercent of the public who do not have a prescription drug benefit of \nsome type, who are in a low-income category, who need this, we provide \na discount drug card or discount card, such as in the Hagel-Ensign \nproposal. We do that today and still save some money for when the baby \nboomers start retiring in 2011.\n  I hope we will all look at that and say that is the right thing to \ndo, to provide that benefit. It is the responsible thing to do. And as \nwe look to our future, it is the right thing for workers coming up in \nthis system so that they are not stuck with this huge lug on their \nshoulders when the baby boomers retire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President, very much. And I thank my \ncolleague from Nebraska for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition \nto the amendment. I want the Senator from Nebraska to know of my \npersonal affection and respect for him. There are certain people in a \nbody to whom you just naturally gravitate and you naturally like, and \nhe is certainly one of them.\n  I rise in opposition, not because he does not have an excellent, \nsubstantive proposal, but I would offer my objection as has been \narticulated by the AARP today in a letter to Senator Hagel in which \nthey state:\n  In addition to our substantive objections, we are concerned that by \noffering this scaled-back proposal today, you would effectively derail \nbipartisan discussion and compromise on more meaningful comprehensive \napproaches.\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\n  That is what I want to discuss today. What this Nation is begging for \nis a comprehensive approach, not a piecemeal approach. What the senior \ncitizens of this Nation are yearning for is that we modernize Medicare \nto provide a prescription drug benefit.\n  If any of us were designing a Medicare system, which is a health \ninsurance system for senior citizens, funded by the Federal Government, \nif we were devising it today in the year 2002 instead of the year 1965, \nwhen it was enacted, would we include prescription drug benefits? The \nanswer to that is, obviously, yes.\n  Medicare was set up in 1965 when the condition of health care was \ncentered around acute care in hospitals. But with the miracles of \nmodern medicine, with the advent of prescription drugs that can \nincrease the quality of our lives, that can take care of chronic \nailments and that, indeed, add to what we would say, in the street \nvernacular, is preventive maintenance, then, clearly, if we were \ndesigning a health insurance system funded by the Federal Government \nfor senior citizens today it would clearly include prescription drugs.\n  That is the question that is before this body. But because of the \nrules of the Senate, we have to get 60 votes in order to pass anything \nhere which, with competing plans, makes it very difficult.\n  Although I think the Senator from Nebraska has some excellent ideas, \nit is injected in this debate at the wrong time because in the words of \nthe AARP, as articulated in their letter today:\n\n       We are concerned that by offering this scaled-back proposal \n     today, you would effectively derail bipartisan discussion and \n     compromise on more meaningful, comprehensive approaches.\n\n  We have to keep trying. We have just been unable to get the 60 votes \non two different substantive approaches to prescription drugs in the \nvotes that occurred earlier today. We have to keep trying to forge a \ncompromise. The compromise is not this scaled-down version.\n  I wish to speak about the substantive alternatives that are here. One \nof the alternatives, as suggested by what has been voted out of the \nother body, the House of Representatives, utilizes the private sector \nand private sector insurance companies in which they offer the \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I had a little bit of experience as the elected insurance \ncommissioner of Florida for 6 years before coming here. I point out \nthat you can get some glimpse of the enthusiasm of insurance companies \nto offer this prescription drug benefit if you look to the States.\n  For example, 4 years ago, the State of Nevada passed a prescription \ndrug benefit. It was to be offered by private insurance companies. \nWithin 2 years after the passage of that law, not one insurance company \nhad come forth to offer that prescription drug benefit.\n  On the basis of that experience, that is certainly not what we want \nto be offering to senior citizens of our country on something that is \nso important to them, a benefit that would be illusory, that would not \nbe there. That is why we ought, in whatever compromise we strike, to \ncome closer to the Graham-Miller approach, which is a substantial \nreworking of Medicare, and the prescription drug benefit becomes a part \nof Medicare. Then it is my hope, once we can find that illusive \nconsensus, we can go on and add additional improvements.\n  The health care providers of this country are hurting because they \nare not getting reimbursed for their Medicare procedures at a rate that \nis commensurate with what they should be reimbursed. One of the items \nwe are going to discuss--and hopefully we would be able to take this \nbase bill and amend it--is an increase of those Medicare reimbursements \nso that we are taking care of the Medicare beneficiaries, the senior \ncitizens, and we are also helping those who are providing the services, \nthe health care providers, by increasing their Medicare reimbursement.\n\n  When we do that, I hope we will also look at some of the practices \nthat because doctors are getting squeezed, in large part squeezed by \ninsurance companies, sometimes regular insurance companies, some called \nHMOs, which are insurance companies, and because doctors are getting \nsqueezed, they are trying to find ways to keep their income up.\n  Lo and behold, down in my State of Florida, there is a group of \ndoctors now saying to all of their patients: We are not going to see \nyou anymore unless you pay us an entrance fee of $1,500 per patient per \nyear. But by the way, we still want to take your Medicare \nreimbursement.\n  That is simply the beginning of the end for Medicare, because the \nlogical extension of that is that only those who are wealthy enough to \nafford that entrance fee--in the case of Florida, $3,000 per year per \ncouple--are going to get the access to the doctor they want, that \ndoctor who is being reimbursed by the Federal Government for the \nservices performed for those senior citizens.\n  That is wrong. It should be changed. It ought to be illegal and yet \nthe Department of HHS has said it is not illegal. So we are going to \nhave to change the law so that a doctor cannot receive reimbursement \nfrom Medicare if they are saying to those patients: I will not see you \nunless you pay me $1,500 a year as an entrance fee into concierge care.\n  I hope we strike the major compromise, that it is closer to the \nGraham-Miller bill, that we address Medicare reimbursements because the \ndoctors and other health care providers need it, and that we add the \namendment I just talked about which would prevent doctors from limiting \npatients to seeing them unless they pay an entrance fee while at the \nsame time getting their Medicare reimbursement.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, could the Chair tell me how much time this \nside has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. And how much time does the other side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes fifty-seven seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I allocate 5 minutes of our remaining time to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know time is now precious and we are \ndown to a few minutes. I will skip a lot of things I was going to say \nsince there has been a lot of redundancy.\n  My good friend from New York was on the floor and was talking about \nthe relative significance of the inheritance tax and how it wasn't \nreally all that meaningful. I am sure the occupant of the chair would \nagree because he was one of the rare Democrats who stood up and said we \nshould repeal that unfair tax on money that has already been spent. \nAlso, with the farm crisis we have had out West in my State, I have yet \nto find one person out there who wasn't more concerned about losing his \nfarm because of the very unfair death tax than even the farm bill. But \nthat is not what we are here to talk about.\n  I think something the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, said has to be \nrepeated over and over; that is, this Hagel-Ensign bill is a lot less \nexpensive and does a better job, but there is one major reason. We have \na saying out in Oklahoma that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' That \nis exactly what the situation is.\n  We have a lot of people who don't need additional coverage now. If \nthey don't need it, why provide it? Why get into some very large \nprogram?\n  Now, we have had two programs that have been rejected today. The \nfirst would not do for seniors what it said it would do, and it would \nhave cost a lot more than we can afford, and it would not have included \na lot of the drugs the seniors need. That program, as well as costing \ntoo much and not covering enough medications, would sunset in 2010. \nThat means in 2010, people who have been relying on the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit would have had their coverage taken away. We \nknow better than that.\n  I remember one of the best speeches that should be required reading \nfor all young people, called ``A Rendezvous With Destiny,'' by Ronald \nReagan. He said:\n\n       The closest thing to immortality on the face of this earth \n     is a Government benefit or program once started.\n\n  We all know that is the way it would work out and we would end up \nwith some very large, spiraling cost program that we could not get rid \nof. It is not responsible, reasonable, and it is\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\nnot the best we can do for seniors. I am glad it did not pass.\n  Then we were given a chance to consider a second option, the \ntripartisan plan. I thought it was too expensive, but I supported it. \nIt is very much like what the House passed. It is something we can go \nto conference on and have something effective come out of it. Once a \nperson's drug costs reach a higher fixed limit, the Government would \nhave paid 90 percent of the additional cost. Many colleagues supported \nit, as I did; but it was defeated.\n  Now we have a chance to give seniors a real prescription drug \nbenefit. This legislation is a responsible, long-term, comprehensive \nplan which truly takes into account the needs and the situation of \nindividual seniors. Several fellow cosponsors have already spoken to \nthe specifics of the plan, such as low premiums, low overall costs on \ncatastrophic coverage. I will tell you what it means to the people who \nsent us here.\n  Senator Gramm talked about some individuals without identifying them. \nI will identify the people. The Hendersons are from Okmulgee County, a \nshort distance from where I live in Oklahoma. I told them I was going \nto use their case. They wrote me to tell me about their struggle with \nprescription drugs. They had a unique problem--one was a heart problem \nand one was a cancer problem. The Hendersons have a yearly household \nincome of $24,000 and they spend $9,000 of that on prescription drugs \nin a single year. The Hendersons' income falls between the 200 percent \nand 400 percent above the national poverty level. That national poverty \nlevel for couples is $11,940 a year.\n\n  Under our bill, an out-of-pocket limit on the cost of prescription \ndrugs for people with a similar income to the Hendersons is set at \n$3,500. If they were between 100 and 200 percent of poverty, that would \ncome down to $1,500. But in the case of the Hendersons, they would have \nto pay that maximum, and then a copay of 10 percent of the cost of \nthese drugs. Calculate that out. While the remaining cost of the \nHendersons' drugs is $5,500, their copays would be no more than $550, \nand under this bill the Hendersons would pay a total of $4,050 a year \nfor prescription drugs, when they are now paying $9,000 a year. This \nbill cuts their drug costs by more than half.\n  The Hendersons, under the Democrat plan, would have faced uncertainty \non three fronts: First of all, uncertainty about which drugs were \ncovered, since only two drugs in each therapeutic class would be \ncovered; secondly, uncertainty about how much the prescriptions would \ncost since the $10, $40, and $60 copayments in the plan were virtually \ndone away with through amendments; and, three, uncertainty about how \nlong their benefits would last even if it didn't sunset. They would not \nknow this. Uncertainty is there.\n  I believe the Hagel plan is real assistance, and I strongly support \nit. I believe this is the alternative that is left and the most \nresponsible one.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Madam President, first of all, I want to speak to my colleague from \nOklahoma. My mother grew up in Oklahoma, and I have a great affinity \nfor that State. I have a lot of relatives there.\n  But I was quite surprised to hear the comment that ``if it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it,'' when we are referring to Medicare. When we look \nat the Medicare system and the inability to cover prescription drugs \nfor our seniors, when we look at the explosion in the price of the \nprescription drugs, I would say it is very tough to find a system that \nis more broken than our inability today to provide low-cost \nprescription drugs, whether it be through Medicare or whether it be a \nsmall business or a farmer trying to get coverage for their family. \nThis system is broken. That is why we are here. It needs to be fixed.\n  I rise in opposition to the Hagel amendment. I appreciate the desire \nof my colleagues to find an alternative, but I certainly am concerned \nthat this does not begin to address what it is that seniors in this \ncountry are needing or asking them to do. There seems to have been a \nlot of confusion about where AARP is regarding this issue. So I will \nread a letter sent to the author of the amendment on July 23--today--\nwhich says:\n\n       Dear Senator Hagel: Enacting a comprehensive prescription \n     drug benefit in Medicare this year remains the top priority \n     for AARP. Our members are counting on the Senate to pass a \n     meaningful drug benefit that is available and affordable to \n     all beneficiaries. Our members were promised in the last \n     election that a comprehensive drug benefit would be a \n     priority, and we are counting on you to make good on that \n     promise this year.\n       We appreciate the intent of your bill, S. 2736, the \n     ``Medicare Rx Drug Discount and Security Act of 2002,'' to \n     provide a prescription drug discount card and stop-loss \n     protection to Medicare beneficiaries. However, in addition to \n     our substantive objections, we are concerned that by offering \n     this scaled-back proposal today, you would effectively derail \n     bipartisan discussion and compromise on more meaningful \n     comprehensive approaches. We believe Congress should focus \n     its efforts on enactment of a more comprehensive drug benefit \n     this year.\n       In addition to the timing of your proposal, AARP has \n     concerns about the approach taken in your bill, including:\n       Catastrophic coverage--While AARP has not opposed income-\n     relating premiums, income-relating the Medicare benefit \n     changes the nature of the program. This would set an \n     extremely dangerous precedent in Medicare. Further, the stop-\n     loss levels set in the bill do not provide enough protection \n     for lower income beneficiaries. A low-income couple could \n     spend 25 percent of their income just for drugs before this \n     plan offered assistance. Thirdly, there are a number of \n     issues involved in using tax returns to determine program \n     eligibility levels, and we believe other options should be \n     explored.\n       Discount card--While AARP supports the use of a discount \n     card program as a building block for a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit, your proposal lacks the necessary \n     specifications to guaranty the level of discount, what level \n     of discount would be passed to beneficiaries, and the degree \n     to consumer protections required of plans.\n       Given these concerns, AARP opposes your amendment. We \n     remain fully committed to developing a comprehensive drug \n     benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries and we look forward to \n     working with you on legislation that our members can support.\n\n  This is signed by the executive director and CEO of AARP. I simply \nwanted to enter that into the Record to make it clear that AARP joins \nus in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nFrist and Nickles be added as cosponsors of amendment No. 4315. I yield \nthe remainder of our time to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes twenty-four seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. And the time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, will you notify me when I have 1 minute \nremaining.\n  I rise in support of the Hagel-Ensign Medicare Prescription Drug \nDiscount and Security Act of 2002. I do so after a long day of debate, \ndiscussion, and votes on bills which attempt to reach out with \naffordable prescription drug coverage for our seniors.\n  Over the course of the day's debate, we have touched upon what \nmatters most to seniors. That is what I want to address in the next 3 \nor 4 minutes.\n  What do seniors who are listening today--38 million Medicare \npotential recipients who are seniors today and another 5 or 6 million \nindividuals with disabilities--what do they want regarding prescription \ndrug coverage? I think it is three things. The first issue is that \nseniors want security. They want peace of mind. When you are 65, 70, \n75, 80 years of age, the most frightening thought is that in those \nfinal years of your life you develop something--whether it is heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, emphysema, or lymphoma--and all of a \nsudden you face high prescription drug costs which are skyrocketing. We \nknow this is an issue--we have been talking about that all week long. \nIn essence, paying for prescription drugs bankrupts you in terms of \nwhat you can afford and, even worse than that, what your children may \nbe able to afford. The beauty of this particular bill is that it \naddresses that peace of mind, that security.\n  The second issue I hear as I talk to seniors as I travel around \nTennessee,\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nand it has been discussed a lot on the floor today, is that, with \nregard to prescription drugs, seniors want help now. They listen to the \ndebate, and both of the bills discussed earlier today have some very \ngood, substantive issues to them, are comprehensive, and each have \npluses and minuses. But the defect that both bills have that the Hagel-\nEnsign bill does not have is this bill takes effect, in essence, right \nnow. That is what seniors want.\n  Seniors who are listening may think: Why talk about a bill taking \nplace in 2006 or 2005? I do not even know if I am going to be around 3 \nor 2 years from now. What they really want is help now. Those who need \nit want it now. The message they tell me is to do it now. Again, the \nHagel-Ensign bill takes effect next year, not 2 years and not 3 years \nfrom now.\n  The third factor this bill does is it addresses prescription drugs in \na responsible way. We are not in a world today or in a country today \nwhere you can just throw unlimited money and say it will be taken care \nof by the next generation or by my family 5 years from now. This is \nespecially true when we have a doubling of the number of seniors, the \ndemographic change, the move of the baby boomers coming online in 2008 \nand 2010. Seniors tell me, whatever you do, do it responsibly. Do it in \na way that is just not over a 3-year period, 4-year period and it \ndisappears, you take the benefit away or raise taxes exorbitantly. Do \nit in a way that can be sustained over time. Do it responsibly.\n\n  That is what the Hagel-Ensign bill does. One of the most beautiful \naspects of this bill is that we can do it now, and we can do it \nresponsibly. We talk big figures. The dollar figure was $160 billion. \nIt is a lot of money, but it is not the $800 billion or the $1 trillion \nor even the $370 billion of the tripartisan plan. It takes effect now, \ngiving peace of mind in capping how much money a senior is going to \nhave to pay out of pocket if there is a catastrophe or if a senior \ndevelops a disease which requires the miracle medications that are out \nthere today, and it does it in a responsible way.\n  How does the bill work? We have been through the details. The first \nissue I mentioned was peace of mind, security, and savings. Instead of \nwhat seniors are doing now--going to a pharmacy, placing a prescription \non the table, and paying a retail price that nobody in this body, most \nemployer-sponsored plans do not have to--they will be able to go in to \na pharmacy with a card that they put on the table and take advantage of \nmass negotiations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, seniors can take this card in and get discounts, \nresulting in savings to seniors right now.\n  Catastrophic coverage gives security, peace of mind. Using \nmarketplace tools is important as we look ahead because it takes \nadvantage of the marketplace in negotiating discounts that are not \navailable today.\n  Madam President, I close with the statement that I believe the Hagel-\nEnsign bill brings to a head much of the discussion today in that it \nreaches out and gives seniors the security they want. It does it now. \nIt does it in a way that is responsible. It is affordable for seniors, \naffordable for taxpayers, and is permanent.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, can you give us an indication of the \ntime remaining to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 1 minute. \nThe Senator from Nebraska controls 5 seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Does the Senator from Nebraska wish to take his 5 \nseconds?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I want the Senator from Michigan to have my 5 seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I was looking forward to what the Senator might say in \n5 seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, the Senator from Michigan has a more \ndifficult case to make. She needs more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I will simply say in closing that \nAARP, representing seniors, and other senior organizations across this \ncountry do not believe this, in fact, is a good deal. There is no \nquestion they want action now, but it has to be real and meaningful.\n  Discount cards are available now. In many cases, they do not work at \nall or they are very limited. It is important we be responsible.\n  I would argue there is a broader responsibility in the Senate. When \nwe debate whether or not the tax cut geared to the wealthiest \nindividuals in the country will be extended another 10 years, we are \ndebating an amount of money that is more than four times any \ncomprehensive Medicare plan that we will have before us.\n  This is a question of priorities. It is a question of what we \nbelieve, as Americans, should be our values and how we act on those in \nterms of our priorities, and I argue that doing the right thing with \nthe real Medicare benefit is what our seniors are asking for and it is \nwhat they deserve. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Hagel \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7218-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7218-S7221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A TRUE COMMITMENT TO HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Senate will soon have before it the \nfiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriations conference report. This \nlegislation provides for the defense of this Nation, both at home and \nabroad.\n  Specifically, the bill provides $14.4 billion for the Department of \nDefense. It allocates $5.5 billion to New York to complete the promise \nmade to provide $20 billion to help recover from the terrorist attacks \non September 11. Another $1 billion is for Pell grants, $417 million \nfor veterans' medical care, $400 million for election reform grants, \nand $2.1 billion for foreign affairs.\n  The bill also provides $205 million for Amtrak. Amtrak is an integral \npiece of the Nation's transportation network. For many rural \ncommunities, Amtrak represents the only public transportation \nconnection to the rest of the Nation. But without the funding contained \nin this bill, that connection is in danger of being severed. Because of \ngrowing financial pressures, Amtrak needs an infusion of funding soon \nor else it faces bankruptcy. The $205 million included in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill will stave off bankruptcy and give the \npassenger railroad, which is under new management, time to craft sound \nplans for the future.\n  Most importantly, this bill provides $6.7 billion for homeland \nsecurity, including $3.85 billion for the Transportation Security \nAdministration. That is why this funding bill is so important. This \nfunding will take steps now--without delay--to plug the holes in our \nNation's defenses here at home. Congress has not hesitated when it \ncomes to funding homeland security efforts. In two supplemental bills--\nthe one approved shortly after the attacks and the one before the \nSenate today--Congress has invested $15 billion to protect Americans \nfrom another terrorist attack and to better respond should, God forbid, \nanother attack occur.\n  The funding initiatives shaped by Congress have helped to hire more \nborder patrol agents, increase the scrutiny of cargo shipments at our \nseaports, and accelerate the purchase of vaccines against smallpox. We \nhave funded critical training and equipment purchases for local police, \nfire, and medical personnel. We have helped to train doctors and local \nhealth departments to detect and treat a biological or chemical weapons \nattack.\n  The money allocated in December has helped to hire more than 2,200 \nINS border agents and Customs inspectors on the northern and southern \nborders. The INS is now implementing a system for tracking foreign \nstudents in this country--a system funded in the first supplemental \nbill. The Nation's police, fire and medical personnel are getting \nbetter training and equipment for detecting and responding to potential \nbiological, chemical or nuclear attacks. The FBI is hiring hundreds of \nnew agents. 750 more food inspectors and investigators are being hired. \nThe number of ports with Food and Drug Administration investigators is \nbeing doubled. 324 additional protective personnel are being hired to \nprotect our\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\nnuclear weapons complex, and additional resources are being spent on \nefforts to destroy or secure nuclear materials overseas.\n  The legislation that will soon be before the Senate today will \naccomplish even more. It will accelerate the purchase of bomb-detecting \nmachines at airports and provide much-needed resources at the local \nlevel. The funding will strengthen port and border security; tighten \nprotections at our nuclear facilities; and better ensure the safety of \nfood and drinking water supplies.\n  The legislation provides $701 million for first responder programs, \n$343 million above the President's request. This conference report, \nwhich will be voted on tomorrow morning, includes $150 million for \nfirefighters, with the funds going directly to the local fire \ndepartments. In the spring, when the firefighter grants that Congress \nallocated in the $40 billion supplemental where made available, more \nthan 18,000 fire departments across the country applied for assistance \ntotaling more than $3 billion. Yet only $360 million was available to \nmeet the demand. The administration did not request any additional \nfunding for this program. However, the need is clear. Our first \nresponders want to be prepared to respond to attack; Congress and the \nPresident need to provide the necessary resources so those first \nresponders will be ready.\n  And in this supplemental bill, State and local governments will \nreceive $100 million to improve interoperability of communications \nequipment for fire, police, and emergency medical technicians. The \ninability of local police and dire departments to communicate with each \nother when responding to the World Trade Center attack has been \nidentified as a major Achilles' heel in a defense of our homeland. The \nfunding in this legislation will help to eliminate that inability and \nto develop uniform standards for interoperable State and local law \nenforcement, firefighting and emergency medical communications \nequipment. The administration requested no funding for this important \nneed.\n  Another $54 million, $22 million above the President's request, will \nstrengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency's search and rescue \nteams. Currently, there are 28 FEMA search and rescue teams around the \ncountry that can be deployed to major disasters to assist local first \nresponders in search and rescue operations. This funding will be used \nto upgrade equipment and training for responding to events involving a \nbiological, chemical, radiation or nuclear attack.\n  One of the major weaknesses in our homeland security is the virtually \nnon-existent protections at the Nation's ports. Cargo containers are \npiled up by the thousands at ports, depots, and huge outdoor \nwarehouses. American ports are home to oil refiners, chemical plants, \nand nuclear facilities. A hijacked vessel that crashes into a port \ncould be used to ignite volatile fuels or gases and produce an \nexplosion that equals one caused by hundreds, maybe thousands of tons \nof dynamite. American ports receive 16,000 cargo containers per day and \n6 million containers each year, but less than five percent of those \ncontainers are inspected. That means a terrorist has at least a 95 \npercent chance of sneaking weapons of mass destruction into the United \nStates. That is not acceptable.\n  Congress, through this supplemental legislation, provides $739 \nmillion for port security programs, $465 million above the President's \nrequest. This conference report includes $125 million for port security \ngrants through the Transportation Security Administration. Last fall, \nCongress approved $93 million of unrequested funds for port security \ngrants. DOT received $692 million of applications for the $93 million \nwe provided. The administration did not request additional funding for \nthis purpose.\n  Another $528 million in this bill is for the Coast Guard for port and \nmaritime security, $273 million above the President's request. \nIncreased funds would be used to expedite vulnerability assessments at \nour Nation's ports, rather than follow the administration's slower plan \nto do the assessments over the next 5 years. The money would add two \nnew maritime safety and security teams; purchase a total of 6 homeland \nsecurity response boats; and expand aviation assets as well as the \nshore facilities to support them. Another $39 million would help the \nCustoms Service to target and inspect suspect shipping containers \nat overseas ports before they reach American ports. The administration \nrequested no funds for these activities.\n\n  Another major concern is the security of the Nation's nuclear \nfacilities. The U.S. Department of Energy needs funds for this effort, \nbut the Office of Management and Budget chose not to forward the \nDepartment's request to Congress. This legislation recognizes the need, \nheeds the warnings, and provides $235 million to improve security of \nthe nuclear weapons stockpile, national nuclear labs, and nuclear \nweapons plants. Funds are included to establish a ``911'' system for \nlocal first responders to call when confronted with nuclear hazards, \nenhanced funding for the National Center for Combating Terrorism, \nexpansion of radiological search teams, and establishment of a National \nCapital Area Response Team at Andrews Air Force Base.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the White House warned of a possible terrorist \nattack on the Nation's banking system. It was a vague threat, but the \npotential for a terrorist organization to use computers and technology \nto short-circuit our financial system is clear. That is why this \nconference report includes $147 million--$128 million above the \nadministration's request--for cyber security to help deal with the \nthreat to Federal and private information systems.\n  Our long and porous land borders represent a daunting challenge in \nterms of homeland security. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nand the Customs Service are already hiring more than 2,200 agents and \ninspectors with the funding Congress allocated in December. This \nlegislation on which we will vote tomorrow, takes the next step, \nproviding $120 million for border security, including $32 million for \nImmigration and Naturalization Service construction to improve \nfacilities on our Nation's borders and $25 million for better \nequipment.\n  When it comes to security at the Nation's airports, no one should \ndoubt Congress' commitment. I note that, earlier today, the U.S. \nSecretary of Transportation testified at a hearing and charged that \nCongress is hamstringing his new Transportation Security \nAdministration. Secretary Mineta has complained about a lack of \nflexibility in Congressional funding. Before the Transportation \nSecretary takes shots at Congress, I wish he would consider the facts. \nI hope that he will. This legislation provides $3.85 billion for the \nTransportation's Security Administration. The conference report \nprovides $471 million for unrequested airport security efforts, \nincluding $150 million to ensure that all small and medium airports \nhave funds to implement the FAA's new airport security guidelines and \nthat large airports have some additional funding to meet those \nrequirements. $225 million is provided above the President's request \nfor explosives detection equipment and $42 million is provided to \nimprove the security of the FAA air traffic control system. In light of \nthe recent tragedies at the Los Angeles International Airport, when a \nman walked to an airline ticket counter and started shooting, Congress \nprovides $17 million to improve airport terminal security. In addition, \n$15 million is provided for improved air to ground communications for \nthe air marshals. If there is a problem on a plane, the security \npersonnel on the ground need to know about it.\n  The Transportation Secretary has charged that less flexibility \ntranslates into less security at our airports. Well, last fall, when \nCongress approved the $40 billion emergency supplemental, we gave the \nadministration flexibility. The President had the authority to allocate \n$20 billion and he gave $1.3 billion to the Transportation Security \nAdministration. But did that flexibility lead to efficient government? \nNot necessarily. The Transportation Secretary, while pointing a finger \nat Congress, ignores the fact that his hand-picked Under Secretary of \nTransportation Security promptly spent $418,000 to refurbish his \npersonal office in what I am told is a beautiful mahogany. That must be \none of the most stunning offices in the entire Department of \nTransportation. I would suggest that the Secretary's finger pointing be \nflexible, and that he turn his finger to his own department. Try that,\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\nMr. Secretary. He cannot in good conscience charge Congress with the \ninefficient operations of the Transportation Security Administration \nwhen is own personnel have wasted money and opportunity, missed their \nown internal deadlines for improving airport security, and failed to \nprovide adequate budget information to Congress. Instead of looking for \nsomeone to blame for failures, the Transportation Secretary should be \nworking internally to fashion a much more efficient and responsive \nTransportation Security Administration.\n\n  Another area of focus for this Congress is nuclear non-proliferation. \nWe have heard a great deal of discussion about the potential for a \n``dirty bomb''--a small nuclear device no larger than a briefcase that, \nif exploded, can contaminate a broad area with radiation for many \nyears. The best way to stop a dirty bomb is to minimize the opportunity \nfor terrorists to get their hands on nuclear material. This \nsupplemental bill includes $100 million to protect fissile material \nabroad, purchase radiation detectors, and establish international \nstandards for securing fissile material.\n  The Department of Defense will receive, through this legislation, \n$14.4 billion for its activities around the world. There can be no \ndoubt as to the commitment of Congress to the men and women in the \nArmed Forces. We will always ensure that they have the resources and \nequipment necessary to fulfill their mission to protect American \ninterests throughout the world.\n  However, the Secretary of Defense, in the Administration's \nsupplemental request, asked for authorities that are currently invested \nin other Cabinet secretaries and in the Congress. The Defense Secretary \nasked for the authority to spend $100 million in foreign countries as \nhe sees fit. Congress said no. The Defense Secretary asked for the \nauthority to pay bounties for the death of those he deems to be \nterrorists. Congress said no. The Defense Secretary asked for the \nauthority to spend $30 million to indigenous groups around the world \nwho arguably are assisting in the war on terrorism. Congress said no.\n  The Framers of the Constitution crafted a delicate balance between \nthe legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Federal \nGovernment. These new authorities for the Secretary of Defense would \njeopardize that balance. Congress should not give this Secretary--or \nany other Secretary--extraordinary authority for the sole purpose of \nmaking the Secretary's job easier.\n  If the President signs this bill, he will have 30 days to decide \nwhether to designate over $5.1 billion as an emergency. If he does not \nmake the emergency designations, the funds cannot be spent. Within the \n$5.1 billion, there is nearly $2.5 billion for homeland security. If \nthe President does not make the emergency designation, he will block \nnearly $2.5 billion in homeland security investments, many of which I \nhave just outlined. Firefighters. Police officers. Port security. \nBorder security. Airport security. Search and rescue teams. Food \nsafety. Drinking water safety. All these and more are involved. I hope \nthat the President will join with Congress in this bipartisan approach \nto homeland security. I hope that he will declare these items to be an \nemergency, and make these important investments immediately to protect \nthe American people from terrorist attacks.\n  In addition, if the President decides not to make the emergency \ndesignation, he also will block funding for the National Guard and \nReserves. He will block funding for election reform. He will block \nfunding for combating AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria overseas. He will \nblock flood prevention and mitigation; embassy security; aid to Israel \nand disaster assistance to Palestinians; wildfire suppression; \nemergency highway repairs; and veterans health care.\n  These critical appropriations for the American people have been \ndelayed for months, sometimes as a result of administration \nintervention. The time has come for its speedy passage and the \nPresident's signature.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee held 5 days of hearings on this \nbill and benefited greatly by hearing testimony from our Nation's \nfirst-responders, terrorism experts, mayors, Governors and Cabinet \nofficials--from seven departments and from the Director of FEMA. We \nhave produced a fair and balanced bill that fills many of the gaps in \nour homeland defense that were identified in our hearings.\n  I want to thank, once again, my friend and the Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Ted \nStevens, for his cooperation, for his leadership along the way in the \nconduct of the hearings, the markup of the bill, in the debate on the \nfloor. I also want to thank our House counterparts, Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young and Ranking Member David Obey \nfor their cooperation and commitment to completing action on the \nlegislation. I would be recreant if I did not thank the staffs who have \nworked so hard to finish this bill. On the Republican side, I thank \nSteve Cortese and Andy Givens and all of the professional and \nsubcommittee staffs. On the Democratic side, I thank the Committee \nStaff Director, Terry Sauvain, my Deputy Staff Director Charles \nKieffer, Edie Stanley, and Nancy Olkewicz, and all of the professional \nand subcommittee staffs for their long, long, long hours and days and \nweekends. Their tireless efforts have resulted in legislation, this \nlegislation that we will vote on tomorrow, legislation that will help \nto protect American lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the President pro tempore of the \nSenate leaves the floor, I would like to say on behalf of the people of \nNevada and the country how much we appreciate the work he did on \nhomeland security.\n  Knowing the Congress has gone to the effort--and the Senator from \nWest Virginia held hearings and called in Cabinet members to find out \nwhat was needed by each entity--and then the disappointment was, as far \nas I am concerned, when we got the supplemental request from the \nPresident, these matters were not found.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, based on information \nobtained about how this should be obtained, by having congressional \noversight hearings to determine what was needed, and then move forward \ntogether so people in West Virginia, Washington, and around the rest of \nthe country are going to receive as a result of the action that will be \ntaken by the Senate tomorrow, I hope there are no games played.\n  When the bill goes to the President, I hope he doesn't play around \nand try to send us a message about vetoing the bill.\n  This is so important for the country. We would not have this \nlegislation but for the Senator from West Virginia. Of course, I have \nto include Senator Stevens, who was very deliberate and sat through \nthose hearings, as did the Senator from West Virginia. This is a \nbipartisan bill. A large chunk of it is based on the needs of this \ncountry for homeland security.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the very distinguished Democratic \nwhip for his observations.\n  Senator Reid is a member of the Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate. So he partook of the action on this bill all along the way. He \nwas present in the hearings that this Appropriations Committee held \nearly in the year on this bill. I believe it was April.\n  This bill is not the first occasion in which the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has taken the lead in acting to strengthen our \nhomeland security. This committee led the way last year.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee in the Senate appropriated $4 billion \nabove the President's request last year. Of course, I know we are \naccused of spending money, but that is the money we are spending for \nthe security of the American people for their homeland, their homes, \ntheir schools, their churches, and their children. That is the money we \nare spending. Last year we exceeded the President's request for \nhomeland security by $4 billion. That was done in a bipartisan fashion. \nIt wasn't done just by Democrats on the committee. But the Republican \nmembers of that committee joined all the way. The President threatened \nlast year to veto that bill.\n  Does the Senator remember that? The President said last year he would \nveto that bill because it contained $4 billion more than he requested \nlast year.\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\n  This year that bill came to the floor with the solid support of the \nRepublicans and Democrats on that committee. It was unanimously \nsupported. It increased the homeland security part above the \nPresident's request by $3 billion.\n  As we have gone through the process--it was a long, dragged-out \neffort when it came to working with the other body on the conference. \nWe finally had to yield and come down from the $3 billion to $1.4 \nbillion in additional money over the President's request for homeland \nsecurity.\n  Again, all the way, I am proud to say, we have a bipartisan group in \nthat committee that walks step by step and shoulder to shoulder to my \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, and I. We don't have any quarrels. We don't \nhave any differences. We don't have any partisan discussions. We don't \nhave any partisan bickering, nor do the members on the committee.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, is a member of that \ncommittee. I served with his father. I believe his father sat right \nhere. I believe his father sat right there in that chair when the son, \nin whom his father was well pleased, was around these premises and knew \na great deal about the Congress and worked in the Congress. He worked \nin his precincts.\n  We don't have any middle aisle in our committee. It was a joint \neffort on the part of Republicans and Democrats in close ranks and \nvoting to support moneys for the security of the American people. These \nare moneys that are in this conference report.\n  When it comes to homeland defense, this Appropriations Committee has \nbeen right out front. I am very proud of the way we have been able to \ndo our work and work together. It has been a long time since this \ncommittee started on this bill. I guess the budget was sent up here \nlast February. It has been all that long time.\n  Here we are in July with the conference report that we will be voting \non tomorrow morning.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7221-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHANGES TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS AND THE \n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Madam President, when I today read Congress Daily, as I \noften do, I was stunned. I was stunned as a result of what the \nPresident said in his radio address.\n  I have to acknowledge that I didn't wait around and listen to it \nSaturday. But I read about it here.\n  Let me read what the President said on Saturday. I say this with \ntotal sincerity. I am so disappointed in the President. I am sure \nothers think that what he has done is hypocrisy. I will not use that \nword.\n  I am just terribly disappointed in the President.\n  This is what he said. The headline is:\n\n      Bush Urges Congress To Send Him Terrorist Reinsurance Bill.\n\n       President Bush made another plug for enactment of a \n     terrorism reinsurance bill, noting in his radio address over \n     the weekend, ``Until Congress sends a bill to my desk, some \n     buildings will not be able to get coverage against terrorist \n     attacks, and many new buildings will not be built at all. \n     Commercial development is stalling, and workers are missing \n     out on those jobs. This year alone, the lack of terrorism \n     insurance has killed or delayed more than $8 billion in \n     commercial property financing. Congress should pass a \n     terrorism insurance bill without unnecessary measures.''\n\n  Can you imagine giving an address to the American people about \nCongress needing to do something on terrorism insurance?\n  Rather than wasting time on the radio address, why doesn't he call \nthe Republican leadership in the Senate and ask: Why don't you let us \ngo to conference?\n  Almost everything we have done with this terrorism insurance, we have \nhad to fight the minority every step of the way. We fought to get it on \nthe floor. We tried to do it even last year, right after the events of \nSeptember 11, and we were stopped from doing so.\n\n  I have been on this floor maybe 10 or 12 times offering a unanimous \nconsent request that we be allowed to go forward with the conference.\n  Just to remind everybody, we were told by the leadership that all we \nneeded to do is change the ratio. Senator Daschle--and he has that \nright--decided the ratio should be 3 to 2. We were told: Make it 4 to \n3, and we will go right to conference. That was weeks ago. We changed: \nOK, if that is what you want, then we will be happy to do that. We \nchanged it to 4 to 3.\n  Then we are told: Well, there are two people in the minority who want \nthat third spot, and they can't work that out.\n  So, as a result of that, as the President has indicated, there is no \nquestion about it, there is work being held up in Nevada and all over \nthe country because they cannot get terrorism insurance. We cannot go \nto conference because you will not let us.\n  Last week, we were told: Give us 24 hours to resolve this. I have \nsaid here, for this unanimous consent agreement that I have been \nseeking for several days: I will put it in my desk and do it again. No \nmore. No more. This is the last. As far as I am concerned, terrorism \ninsurance is dead.\n  The industry, obviously, does not care enough to put enough pressure \non the minority so that we can go to conference. If the role were \nreversed, and we, the Democrats, were holding up the appointing of \nconferees on a terrorism insurance bill, our phones would be ringing. \nWe would have petitions. We would have demonstrations. But because it \nis the insurance industry, which is a little closer to the minority \nthan we are, nothing happens. Day after day after day goes on, and I \nguess they expect me and Senator Daschle to come and offer this \nunanimous consent request.\n  No more. They can do it. In the meantime, terrorism insurance is \ndead. Nothing is going to happen. The House is going out Thursday.\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\n  So, as far as I am concerned, this bill is dead. I am not putting the \nunanimous consent request in my desk anymore; I am putting it in the \ngarbage can. And we will wait and see what happens.\n  I think it is too bad. But maybe there has been something that has \nhappened in the last few hours that will change their minds. Maybe my \nstatement now will change their minds.\n  So I ask unanimous consent--I better take it out of the garbage so I \ncan read it; and then I will put it right back, as soon as I finish--\nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. \n252, H.R. 3210, the House-passed terrorism insurance bill; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 2600, as \npassed in the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill, as thus \namended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, with the ratio of 4 to 3, all without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nto my friend from Nevada that his words are well-taken. His passion is \nunderstood. At least as far as I am concerned, his determination to get \nthis bill through is fully shared.\n\n  However, on behalf of the ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Gramm, and reserving his rights, as I am sure the Senator from \nNevada has from time to time reserved the rights of some of his \ncolleagues, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7222-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3694\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. He is \nabsolutely correct. I, on an occasion or two, have represented Senators \nhere, doing things that sometimes I did not personally agree with. But \nI do hope that we can move forward on both matters.\n  I was serious about everything that I said on the terrorism insurance \nbill. On the matter dealing with highway funding, it is very important \nwe get this done for a lot of different reasons. One reason is to \nprepare for the bill that is coming up next year, of which everyone has \nan interest. It is the bill we do every 5 or 6 years to fund highway \nprojects around the country. It is money that collected during the 5-\nyear period from the gas taxes. We need to make sure we have the \nability to meet as many of the demands of the country as we can.\n  So I appreciate the Senator working on his side to get that cleared.\n  I have another unanimous consent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7222-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4775\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November \n2000 in Bloomington, MN. Cecil John Reiners, 57, attacked a Hispanic \nman for speaking Spanish at work. Witnesses told police that Reiners, \nthe business owner, was upset when a 23 year-old employee was speaking \nSpanish with two others at a break table. Reiners went to the warehouse \nwith a wood post and severely beat the victim, who was treated for \nsevere skull fractures and clots at the hospital. ``All I wanted was \nfor that Mexican to leave my property,'' Reiners said. Mr. Reiners was \nlater convicted of felony first-degree assault in connection with the \nincident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7222-5", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7222-S7224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CIVILIZATION NEED NOT DIE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the more than 10 months since the \nattacks of September 11, 2001, all of us have been trying to bring \ncontext and understanding to the new world challenges we are \nconfronting. It is at times such as this that the Senate needs wisdom \nand clarity to bring such context to our times.\n  Often in the past, the Senate turned to one of its most distinguished \ncolleagues for vision and wisdom. That person, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \nunderstood history and the actors and actions that make history.\n  Recently, I came across the Harvard University commencement speech \nthat our former colleague, Senator Moynihan, gave this year, on the \n58th anniversary of D-Day. I think all of my colleagues will benefit \nfrom reading Pat's remarkable speech, for it gives historical context \nto the times in which we are living.\n  I, for one, miss hearing Pat's insights into life. All of us who \nserved with Pat\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\nare better Senators because of the wisdom he imparted to all of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that former Senator Pat Moynihan's Harvard \ncommencement speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Commencement Address, June 6th, 2002\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       A while back it came as something of a start to find in The \n     New Yorker a reference to an article I had written, and I \n     quote, ``In the middle of the last century.'' Yet persons my \n     age have been thinking back to those times and how, in the \n     end, things turned out so well and so badly. Millions of us \n     returned from the assorted services to find the economic \n     growth that had come with the Second World War had not ended \n     with the peace. The Depression had not resumed. It is not \n     perhaps remembered, but it was widely thought it would.\n       It would be difficult indeed to summon up the optimism that \n     came with this great surprise. My beloved colleague Nathan \n     Glazer and the revered David Riesman wrote that America was \n     ``the land of the second chance'' and so indeed it seemed. We \n     had surmounted the depression; the war. We could \n     realistically think of a world of stability, peace--above \n     all, a world of law.\n       Looking back, it is clear we were not nearly so fortunate. \n     Great leaders preserved--and in measure extended--democracy. \n     But totalitarianism had not been defeated. To the contrary, \n     by 1948 totalitarians controlled most of Eurasia. As we now \n     learn, 11 days after Nagasaki the Soviets established a \n     special committee to create an equivalent weapon. Their first \n     atomic bomb was acquired through espionage, but their \n     hydrogen bomb was their own doing. Now the Cold War was on. \n     From the summer of 1914, the world had been at war, with \n     interludes no more. It finally seemed to end with the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union and the changes in China. But \n     now . . .\n       But now we have to ask if it is once again the summer of \n     1914.\n       Small acts of terror in the Middle East, in South Asia, \n     could lead to cataclysm, as they did in Sarajevo. And for \n     which great powers, mindful or not, have been preparing.\n       The eras are overlapping.\n       As the United States reacts to the mass murder of 9/11 and \n     prepares for more, it would do well to consider how much \n     terror India endured in the second half of the last century. \n     And its response. It happens I was our man in New Delhi in \n     1974 when India detonated its first nuclear device. I was \n     sent in to see Prime Minister Indira Gandhi with a statement \n     as much as anything of regret. For there was nothing to be \n     done; it was going to happen. The second most populous nation \n     on earth was not going to leave itself disarmed and \n     disregarded, as non-nuclear powers appeared to be. But \n     leaving, I asked to speak as a friend of India and not as an \n     official. In twenty years time, I opined, there would be a \n     Moghul general in command in Islamabad, and he would have \n     nuclear weapons and would demand Kashmir back, perhaps the \n     Punjab.\n       The Prime Minister said nothing; I dare to think she half \n     agreed. In time, she would be murdered in her own garden; \n     next, her son and successor was murdered by a suicide bomber. \n     This, while nuclear weapons accumulated which are now poised.\n       Standing at Trinity Site at Los Alamos, J. Robert \n     Oppenheimer pondered an ancient Sanskrit text in which Lord \n     Shiva declares, ``I am become Death, the shatterer of \n     worlds.'' Was he right?\n       At the very least we can come to terms with the limits of \n     our capacity to foresee events.\n       It happens I had been a Senate observer to the START \n     negotiations in Geneva, and was on the Foreign Relations \n     Committee when the treaty, having been signed, was sent to us \n     for ratification. In a moment of mischief I remarked to our \n     superb negotiators that we had sent them to Geneva to \n     negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union, but the document \n     before us was a treaty with four countries, only two of which \n     I could confidently locate on a map. I was told they had \n     exchanged letters in Lisbon [the Lisbon Protocol, May 23, \n     1992]. I said that sounded like a Humphrey Bogart movie.\n       The hard fact is that American intelligence had not the \n     least anticipated the implosion of the Soviet Union. I cite \n     Stansfield Turner, former director of the CIA in Foreign \n     Affairs, 1991. ``We should not gloss over the enormity of \n     this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis . \n     . . The corporate view missed by a mile.''\n       Russia now faces a near-permanent crisis. By mid-century \n     its population could well decline to as few as 80 million \n     persons. Immigrants will press in; one dares not think what \n     will have happened to the nuclear materials scattered across \n     11 time zones.\n       Admiral Turner's 1991 article was entitled ``Intelligence \n     for a New World Order.'' Two years later Samuel Huntington \n     outlined what that new world order--or disorder--would be in \n     an article in the same journal entitled ``The Clash of \n     Civilizations.'' His subsequent book of that title is a \n     defining text of our time.\n       Huntington perceives a world of seven or eight major \n     conflicting cultures, the West, Russia, China, India, and \n     Islam. Add Japan, South America, Africa. Most incorporate a \n     major nation-state which typically leads its fellows.\n       The Cold War on balance suppressed conflict. But the end of \n     the Cold War has brought not universal peace but widespread \n     violence. Some of this has been merely residual proxy \n     conflicts dating back to the earlier era. Some plain ethnic \n     conflict. But the new horrors occur on the fault lines, as \n     Huntington has it, between the different cultures.\n       For argument's sake one could propose that Marxism was the \n     last nearly successful effort to Westernize the rest of the \n     world. In 1975, I stood in Tiananmen Square, the center of \n     the Middle Kingdom. In an otherwise empty space, there were \n     two towering masts. At the top of one were giant portraits of \n     two hirsute 19th century German gentlemen, Messrs. Marx and \n     Engels. The other displayed a somewhat Mongol-looking Stalin \n     and Mao. That wasn't going to last, and of course, it didn't.\n       Hence Huntington: ``The central problem in the relations \n     between the West and the rest is . . . the discordance \n     between the West's--particularly America's--efforts to \n     promote universal Western culture and its declining ability \n     to do so.''\n       Again there seems to be no end of ethnic conflict within \n     civilizations. But it is to the clash of civilizations we \n     must look with a measure of dread. The Bulletin of the Atomic \n     Scientists recently noted that ``The crisis between India and \n     Pakistan, touched off by a December 13th terrorist attack on \n     the Indian Parliament marks the closest two states have come \n     to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis.'' By 1991, the \n     minute-hand on their doomsday clock had dropped back to 17 \n     minutes to midnight. It has since been moved forward three \n     times and is again seven minutes to midnight, just where it \n     started in 1947.\n       The terrorist attacks on the United States of last \n     September 11 were not nuclear, but they will be. Again to \n     cite Huntington, ``At some point . . . a few terrorists will \n     be able to produce massive violence and massive destruction. \n     Separately, terrorism and nuclear weapons are the weapons of \n     the non-Western weak. If and when they are combined, the non-\n     Western weak will be strong.''\n       This was written in 1996. The first mass murder by \n     terrorists came last September. Just last month the vice \n     president informed Tim Russert that ``the prospects of a \n     future attack . . . are almost certain. Not a matter of if, \n     but when.'' Secretary Rumsfeld has added that the attack will \n     be nuclear.\n       We are indeed at war and we must act accordingly, with \n     equal measures of audacity and precaution.\n       As regards precaution, note how readily the clash of \n     civilizations could spread to our own homeland. The Bureau of \n     the Census lists some 68 separate ancestries in the American \n     population. (Military gravestones provide for emblems of 36 \n     religions.) All the major civilizations. Not since 1910 have \n     we had so high a proportion of immigrants. As of 2000, one in \n     five school-age children have at least one foreign-born \n     parent.\n       This, as ever, has had bounteous rewards. The problem comes \n     when immigrants and their descendants bring with them--and \n     even intensify--the clashes they left behind. Nothing new, \n     but newly ominous. Last month in Washington an enormous march \n     filled Pennsylvania Avenue on the way to the Capitol grounds. \n     The marchers, in the main, were there to support the \n     Palestinian cause. Fair enough. But every five feet or so \n     there would be a sign proclaiming ``Zionism equals Racism'' \n     or a placard with a swastika alongside a Star of David. Which \n     is anything but fair, which is poisonous ad has no place in \n     our discourse.\n       This hateful equation first appeared in a two-part series \n     in Pravda in Moscow in 1971. Part of Cold War ``agit prop.'' \n     It has since spread into a murderous attack on the right of \n     the State of Israel to exist--the right of Jews to exist!--a \n     world in which a hateful Soviet lies has mutated into a new \n     and vicious anti-Semitism. Again, that is the world we live \n     in, but it is all the more chilling when it fills \n     Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       It is a testament to our First Amendment freedoms that we \n     permit such displays, however obnoxious to our fundamental \n     ideals. But in the wake of 9/11, we confront the fear that \n     such heinous speech can be a precursor to violence, not least \n     here at home, that threatens our existence.\n       To be sure, we must do what is necessary to meet the \n     threat. We need to better understand what the dangers are. We \n     need to explore how better to organize the agencies of \n     government to detect and prevent calamitous action.\n       But at the same time, we need take care that whatever we do \n     is consistent with our basic constitutional design. What we \n     do must be commensurate with the threat in ways that do not \n     needlessly undermine the very liberties we seek to protect.\n       The concern is suspicion and fear within. Does the Park \n     Service really need to photograph every visitor to the \n     Lincoln Memorial? They don't, but they will. It is already \n     done at the Statue of Liberty. In Washington, agencies \n     compete in techniques of intrusion and exclusion. Identity \n     cards and X-ray machines and all the clutter, plus a new life \n     for secrecy. Some necessary; some discouraging. Mary Graham \n     warns of the stultifying effects of secrecy on inquiry. \n     Secrecy, as George Will writes, ``renders societies \n     susceptible to epidemics of suspicion.''\n       We are witnessing such an outbreak in Washington just now. \n     Great clamor as to what the different agencies knew in \n     advance of the 9/11 attack; when the President was\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\n     briefed; what was he told. These are legitimate questions, \n     but there is a prior issue, which is the disposition of \n     closed systems not to share information. By the late 1940s \n     the Army Signal Corps had decoded enough KGB traffic to have \n     a firm grip on the Soviet espionage in the United States and \n     their American agents. No one needed to know about this more \n     than the President of the United States. But Truman was not \n     told. By order, mind, of Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff. Now as then there is police work to be done. \n     But so many forms of secrecy are self-defeating. In 1988, the \n     CIA formally estimated the Gross Domestic Product of East \n     Germany to be higher than West Germany. We should calculate \n     such risks.\n       The ``What-ifs'' are intriguing. What if the United States \n     had recognized Soviet weakness earlier and, accordingly, kept \n     its own budget in order, so that upon the breakup of the \n     Soviet Union a momentous economic aid program could have been \n     commenced? What is we had better calculated the forces of the \n     future so that we could have avoided going directly from the \n     ``end'' of the cold War to a new Balkan war--a classic clash \n     of civilizations--leaving little attention and far fewer \n     resources for the shattered Soviet empire?\n       Because we have that second chance Riesman and Glazer wrote \n     about. A chance to define our principles and stay true to \n     them. The more then, to keep our system open as much as \n     possible, without purposes plain and accessible, so long as \n     we continue to understand what the 20th century has surely \n     taught, which is that open societies have enemies, too. \n     Indeed, they are the greatest threat to closed societies, \n     and, accordingly, the first object of their enmity.\n       We are committed, as the Constitution states, to ``the Law \n     of Nations,'' but that law as properly understood. Many have \n     come to think that international law prohibits the use of \n     force. To the contrary, like domestic law, it legitimates the \n     use of force to uphold law in a manner that is itself \n     proportional and lawful.\n       Democracy may not prove to be a universal norm. But decency \n     would do. Our present conflict, as the President says over \n     and again, is not with Islam, but with a malignant growth \n     within Islam defying the teaching of the Q'uran that the \n     struggle to the path of God forbids the deliberate killing of \n     noncombatants. Just how and when Islam will rid itself of \n     current heresies is something no one cay say. But not soon. \n     Christianity has been through such hersey--and more than \n     once. Other clashes will follow.\n       Certainly we must not let ourselves be seen as rushing \n     about the world looking for arguments. There are now American \n     armed forces in some 40 countries overseas. Some would say \n     too many. Nor should we let ourselves be seen as ignoring \n     allies, disillusioning friends, thinking only of ourselves in \n     the most narrow terms. That is not how we survived the 20th \n     century.\n       Nor will it serve in the 21st.\n       Last February, some 60 academics of the widest range of \n     political persuasion and religious belief, a number from here \n     at Harvard, including Huntington, published a manifesto: \n     ``What We're Fighting For: A Letter from America.''\n       It has attracted some attention here; perhaps more abroad, \n     which was our purpose. Our references are wide, Socrates, St. \n     Augustine, Franciscus de Victoria, John Paul II, Martin \n     Luther King, Jr., Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights.\n       We affirmed ``five fundamental truths that pertain to all \n     people without distinction,'' beginning ``all human beings \n     are born free and equal in dignity and rights.''\n       We allow for our own shortcomings as a nation, sins, \n     arrogance, failings. But we assert we are no less bound by \n     moral obligation. And finally, . . . reason and careful moral \n     reflection . . . teach us that there are times when the first \n     and most important reply to evil is to stop it.\n       But there is more. Forty-seven year ago, on this occasion, \n     General George C. Marshall summoned our nation to restore the \n     countries whose mad regimes had brought the world such \n     horror. It was an act of statesmanship and vision without \n     equal in history. History summons us once more in different \n     ways, but with even greater urgency. Civilization need not \n     die. At this moment, only the United States can save it. As \n     we fight the war against evil, we must also wage peace, \n     guided by the lesson of the Marshall Plan--vision and \n     generosity can help make the world a safer place.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SUSAN G. KOMEN BREAST CANCER FOUNDATION\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to \nthe Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, which is celebrating its \n20th anniversary. The organization literally grew from a shoebox full \nof names in Dallas, TX, to the Nation's largest private source of \nfunding for breast cancer research and community-based outreach \nprograms.\n  Our current U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Hungary, the Hon. \nNancy Brinker, is the founder of the Komen Foundation. As a founding \nmember of the organization, I can recall the very first meeting we held \nin Nancy's living room. She is a woman of conviction, with talent and \nenergy to match. While it is too soon to tell, I believe the \nestablishment and launching of the Komen Foundation will be Nancy \nBrinker's most remarkable legacy to humankind.\n  When her older sister Suzy died of breast cancer at the age of 36, \nNancy set out to keep the promise she had made to Suzy: to do \neverything in her power to eradicate breast cancer as a life-\nthreatening disease. Today, 20 years after the Komen Foundation's \ninception, we recognize the ``Power of Promise'' Nancy made that day.\n  I am proud to have worked for the Komen Foundation in the Senate, and \nmark today's celebration by noting the truly great things people can do \nwhen they answer a call, see a need, and set out to make things \ndifferent.\n  Twenty years ago, breast cancer was a term rarely spoken in public, \nand a subject that almost never appeared in newspapers or magazines. \nThere were no self-help books and those who survived the disease did \nnot readily share their stories. What is worse, breast cancer was \nviewed as a certain death sentence. Few treatment options existed at \nthe time, and those that did were drastic and disfiguring.\n  At its inception, the Komen Foundation began to educate people and \nhelp them recognize the seriousness of breast cancer in our society. \nPeople began giving of themselves as volunteers and as financial donors \nso that research into new breast cancer treatments, screening, and \neducational outreach efforts could be funded.\n  The Komen Foundation boasts over 100 affiliate groups in cities \nacross the U.S., three European affiliates and a cadre of 75,000 \ndedicated volunteers, many of whom are survivors. In the past two \ndecades, the Foundation has raised more than $450 million for research, \neducation, screening and treatment programs--many of which reach into \ntraditionally medically underserved areas. The Komen Race for the Cure \nhad over 112 races this year with 1.2 million runners and walkers \nparticipating. Each race event is an occasion of hope and survivor \npride for participants and their supporters.\n  On the 20th Anniversary of the Komen Foundation, let us all renew our \npromise in the fight against breast cancer so that one day we will have \nsomething miraculous to celebrate: the end of breast cancer as a life-\nthreatening disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7224-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7224-S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING MONTANA WRESTLERS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate the \noutstanding wrestlers from my home State of Montana who won the Amateur \nAthletic Union Grand Nationals Wrestling Championships in Shreveport, \nLA, this past June. This was the first year in which Montana has sent \nan organized team to the competition, and on behalf of all Montanans, I \nwant to say how proud we are of these athletes and their historic \nsuccess.\n  In order to win the title, Team Montana, competed in Greco-Roman, \nFreestyle and Sombo disciplines, which are the three international \ndisciplines of wrestling. Led by Stan Moran of Wolf Point, MT, the team \nwas composed of athletes 5-35 years old, including World Champion Josh \nCharette; World Silver medalist Rob Charette; and World Bronze medalist \nStan Moran, Jr. This is Josh Charette's third consecutive World Open \nChampionship. Josh is currently representing Montana at the Olympic \nTraining Center in the Judo discipline, where he is preparing for the \n2004 Olympic Games in Athens.\n  Athough these outstanding athletes are in the spotlight, I also want \nto take a moment to comment on the strength of the wrestling community \nin Montana. Whether it is this recent success at the AUU Grand \nNationals Wrestling Championships or the success of Montana State \nUniversity--Northern's wrestling program, Montana's entire wrestling \ncommunity has a record that it can be very proud of. I know that such \nsuccess comes only with focus and determination, and I want to commend \nthe families, coaches, and wrestlers who have fostered an environment \nof excellence.\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n  Again, I applaud these Montana wrestlers for their hard work and \ndedication to their respective disciplines.

Mr. President, I am proud to congratulate the Great \nLakes Science Center on 75 years of service to Michigan and the Great \nLakes region. This center provides the scientific information needed \nfor restoring, enhancing, managing, and protecting wildlife and their \nhabitat in the Great Lakes, Despite the importance of the Great Lakes, \ntoo few resources are devoted to researching and monitoring the \necosystem health. However, the Great Lakes Science Center has been at \nwork for nearly eight decades--through the rise and fall of numerous \nspecies like lake trout, alewife, white fish, and sturgeon.\n  After the collapse of the cisco fishery in Lake Erie in 1925, the \nGreat Lakes Science Center, which was then called the Great Lakes \nBiological Laboratory, was created to study the causes of this \ncollapse. Though the fisheries in the Great Lakes continued to suffer, \nit was not until 1950 that biological research was truly supported. At \nthat time the Great Lakes were experiencing one of the worst disasters \npossible--the invasion of sea lamprey. The sea lamprey, which moved \ninto the Great Lakes through the Welland Canal and spread throughout \nthe Great Lakes, destroyed the lake trout and lake whitefish commercial \nfisheries. After testing over 4,000 chemicals, the Great Lakes Science \nCenter found the compound that is still being used today to destroy the \nlamprey.\n  In 1965, the center moved to its newly constructed headquarters on \nthe North Campus of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The center \nhas been active in all areas of Great Lakes research including algal \nblooms, invasive species, near-shore habitat, fishery genetics and DDT \nlevels in fish. The work of the dedicated staff has helped bring back \nthe sturgeon and lake trout.\n  Today, the Great Lakes Science Center has 107 staff members, 5 field \nstations, 1 vessel base, and 3 vessel base-field station combinations \nthroughout the Great Lakes. I am proud of the long and distinguished \nhistory of the Great Lakes Science Center, and I wish all of the \nresearchers at the Science Center great success for the next 75 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7225-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2990.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \ncooperate with the High Plains Aquifer States in conducting a \nhydrogeologic characterization, mapping, modeling and monitoring \nprogram for the High Plains Aquifer and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nhas significance for the entire Great Plains region of our Nation. The \nHigh Plains Aquifer, which is comprised in large part by the Ogallala \nAquifer, extends under eight states: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New \nMexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. It is experiencing \nalarming declines in its water levels. This aquifer is the source of \nwater for farmers and communities throughout the Great Plains region. \nThe legislation I am introducing today is intended to ensure that sound \nand objective science is available with respect to the hydrology and \ngeology of the High Plains Aquifer.\n  This bill, the ``High Plains Aquifer Hydrogeologic Characterization, \nMapping, Modeling and Monitoring Act,'' would direct the Secretary of \nthe Interior to develop and carry out a comprehensive hydrogeologic \ncharacterization, mapping, modeling and monitoring program for the High \nPlains Aquifer. The Secretary is directed to work in conjunction with \nthe eight High Plains Aquifer States in carrying out this program. The \nU.S. Geological Survey and the States will work in cooperation to \nfurther the goals of this program, with half of the available funds \ndirected to the State component of the program.\n  I have appreciated the input and assistance of many in the High \nPlains Aquifer States in putting this legislation together. Last \nsession, I introduced two bills relating to the High Plains Aquifer. \nOne of these bills, S. 1537 would have established a mapping and \nmonitoring program for the High Plains Aquifer. The bill I am \nintroducing today revises and refines that program based on input from \nseveral of the State geologists and water management agency officials \nwho would be involved in implementing the program. Their assistance has \nbeen invaluable. As we conduct hearings on this legislation, I hope to \nreceive further comment from them on the legislation, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with them as we proceed with this \nimportant legislation.\n\n  The second bill that I introduced last session, S. 1538, proposed \nthat the Secretary of Agriculture provide incentive payments through \nthe Farm Program to producers who were willing to conserve water by \nconverting to less water-intensive crops or to dryland farming. In \naddition, the bill would have provided assistance to producers to make \ntheir irrigation systems more water efficient. I am pleased that the \nrecently-enacted Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \nestablishes a ground and surface water conservation program which \nincorporates several of the concepts contained in S. 1538. It is to be \nfunded in the amount of $25 million for fiscal year 2002, $45 million \nfor fiscal year 2003, and $60 million for each of fiscal years 2004 \nthrough 2007.\n  The Conference Report for the 2002 Farm Bill makes clear that \n``highest priority'' is to be accorded the High Plains region in the \nfunding and implementation of this program. I expect that the new \nprogram will yield substantial benefits to the High Plains region in \naddressing ground water depletion by providing cost-share payments, \nincentive payments, and loans to producers to improve irrigation \nsystems, enhance irrigation efficiencies, convert to the production of \nless water-intensive crops or dryland farming, improve water storage \nthrough measures such as water banking and groundwater recharge, \nmitigate the effects of drought, and institute other measures as \ndetermined by the Secretary.\n  A reliable source of groundwater is essential to the well-being and \nlivelihoods of people in the Great Plains region. Local towns and rural \nareas are dependent on the use of groundwater for drinking water, \nranching, farming, and other commercial uses. Yet many areas overlaying \nthe Ogallala Aquifer have experienced a dramatic depletion of this \ngroundwater resource. The problem we are confronting is that the \naquifer is not sustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly. This \nthreatens the way of life of all who live on the High Plains. The bill \nI am introducing today would help ensure that the relevant science \nneeded to address this problem is available so that we will have a \nbetter understanding of the resources of the High Plains Aquifer. I ask \nthat my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-\nsection be printed in the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the State Geologist \nof Kansas, written on behalf of the State geological surveys of the \neight High Plains Aquifer States, endorsing the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing on behalf of the \n     geological surveys of the eight High Plains states to endorse \n     your proposed legislation. ``High Plains Aquifer \n     Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, Modeling, and \n     Monitoring Act.''\n       This act will authorize scientific and technical analyses \n     critical to extending and conserving the life of the nation's \n     single largest groundwater resource. It is particularly \n     noteworthy that the act is written to facilitate and ensure \n     cooperation and collaboration among all of the affected \n     geological surveys, state water agencies, and the local water \n     user communities.\n       The High Plains aquifer is a complex system of geologic \n     materials that vary vertically and across the region in its \n     thickness, water storage and transport capacity, and ability \n     to be recharged. Eight state geological surveys and the U.S. \n     Geological Survey formed the High Plains Aquifer Coalition \n     two years ago to advance the understanding of the subsurface \n     distribution, character, and nature of the High Plains \n     Aquifer that comprises the geologic deposits in the eight-\n     state Mid-continent region. The distribution, withdrawal, and \n     recharge of groundwater, and the interaction with surface \n     waters are profoundly affected by the geology and the natural \n     environment of the High Plains Aquifer in all eight states--\n     New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, \n     South Dakota, and Wyoming. The geological surveys, in \n     consultation with the state and local water agencies and \n     groups, have agreed on the need for comprehensive \n     understanding of the subsurface configuration and \n     hydrogeology of the High Plains Aquifer. This information is \n     needed to provide state, regional, and national policymakers \n     with the earth-science information required to make informed \n     decisions regarding urban and agricultural land use, the \n     protection of aquifers and surface waters, and the \n     environmental well being of the citizens of this geologically \n     unique region.\n       Water contained in the High Plains Aquifer must be \n     considered a finite resource and thus warrants a different \n     management approach than that used for more robust or readily \n     recharged aquifers. Your proposed legislation addresses this \n     issue in an effective and logical manner, and we believe it \n     will receive broad support.\n       The ``High Plains Aquifer Characterization, Mapping, \n     Modeling, and Monitoring Act'' is a necessary first step in a \n     comprehensive program to adequately address issues of \n     conservation, education, and agricultural economics in the \n     High Plains Aquifer. We applaud your vision and leadership in \n     introducing this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               M. Lee Allison,\n\n                                     State Geologist and Director,\n        Kansas Geological Survey Coordinator, High Plains Aquifer \n                                                        Coalition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2776. A bill to provide for the protection of archaeological sites \nin the Galisteo Basin in New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to protect several important archaeological sites in the \nGalisteo Basin in New Mexico. This bill identifies approximately two \ndozen sites in northern New Mexico which contain the ruins of pueblos \ndating back almost 900 years. When Coronado and other Spanish \nconquistadores first entered what is now New Mexico in 1541, they \nencountered a thriving Pueblo culture with its own unique tradition of \nreligion, architecture and art, which was influenced through an \nextensive trade system. We know that these sites remain occupied up \nthrough the Pueblo revolt in 1680. After that, the sites were deserted, \nalthough we still don't know why they were abandoned, after over 700 \nyears of continuous use.\n  Through these sites, we now have the opportunity to learn more not \nonly about the history and culture of these Pueblos, but also about the \nfirst interaction between European and Native American cultures. The \nCochiti Pueblo, in particular, is culturally and historically tied to \nthese sites, which have tremendous historical and religious \nsignificance to the Pueblo. I am grateful for the continued support of \nthe Pueblo de Cochiti for this legislation. This bill has strong local \nsupport, including the Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners, the City \nof Santa Fe, and the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. I would also like to \nthank the Archaeological Conservancy for its efforts over the past \nseveral years to identify and protect many of these sites, and in \nhelping with this legislation.\n  Many of these archaeological sites are on Federal land administered \nby the Bureau of Land Management. BLM archaeologists have already \nprovided extensive background research on many of these sites, and I \nwas pleased that the agency supported a similar bill I introduced in \nthe previous Congress.\n  Many of the archaeological sites identified in the bill are on non-\nFederal land. I would like to emphasize that the bill only authorizes \nvoluntary participation, and there is no restriction or other \nlimitation imposed on these lands. Because this is a sensitive issue, I \nhave added language to this year's bill to explicitly state that the \nSecretary of the Interior has no authority to administer sites on non-\nFederal lands except to the extent provided for in a cooperative \nagreement entered into between the Secretary and the landowner. \nSimilarly, the Secretary's authority to acquire lands is limited to \nwilling sellers only.\n  In the three years since I first introduced this proposal, many \nirreplaceable archaeological resources have been lost, whether by \nvandalism, erosion, or other means. Enactment of the Galisteo Basin \nArchaeological Sites Protection Act will allow us to take the first \nsteps necessary to protect these resources and to allow for improved \npublic understanding and interpretation of these sites.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2776\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       Tis Act may be cited as the ``Galisteo Basin Archaeological \n     Sites Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Galisteo Basin and surrounding area of New Mexico \n     is the location of many well preserved prehistoric and \n     historic archaeological resources of Native American and \n     Spanish colonial cultures;\n       (2) these resources include the largest ruins of Pueblo \n     Indian settlements in the United States, spectacular examples \n     of Native American rock art, and ruins of Spanish colonial \n     settlements; and\n       (3) these resources are being threatened by natural causes, \n     urban development, vandalism, and uncontrolled excavations.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     preservation, protection, and interpretation of the \n     nationally significant archaeological resources in the \n     Galisteo Basin in New Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Con Res. 130\n\n       Whereas major league baseball is a national institution and \n     is commonly referred to as ``the national pastime'';\n       Whereas major league baseball and its players played a \n     critical role in restoring America's spirit following the \n     tragic events of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas major league baseball players are role models to \n     millions of young Americans; and\n       Whereas while the financial issues involved in this current \n     labor negotiation are significant, they pale in comparison to \n     the damage that will be caused by a strike or work stoppage: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, on its own motion \n     and in accordance with section 203(b) of the Labor Management \n     Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 173(b)), should immediately--\n       (1) proffer its services to the Major League Baseball \n     Players Association and the owners of the teams of Major \n     League Baseball to resolve labor contract disputes relating \n     to entering into a collective bargaining agreement; and\n       (2) use its best efforts to bring the parties to agree to \n     such contract without engaging in a strike, a lockout, or any \n     other coercion that interferes with the playing of scheduled \n     professional baseball games.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues a \nresolution that calls on the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service \nto exert its best efforts to cause the Major League Baseball Players \nAssociation and the owners of the teams of Major League Baseball to \nenter into a contract to continue to play professional baseball games \nwithout engaging in any coercive conduct that interferes with the \nplaying of scheduled professional baseball games.\n  Folks don't agree on much around this place. But, I think we can all \nagree that baseball as we've known it, is in deep trouble.\n  Billion dollar owners and multi-million dollar players refusing to \ncome together and do what's right for the game.\n  Steroid use rampant, according to an article in Sports Illustrated.\n  And the best Senator Dorgan could get out of a June hearing from the \nPlayers Association Executive Director was for him to say ``We'll have \na frank and open discussion'' on the topic.\n  But the big problem is that the player's labor contract expired last \nyear and the negotiations on a new deal are going nowhere.\n  There have been eight different labor agreements and each time there \nwas a work stoppage.\n  The last time the owners and players tried to renew their contract \nback in 1994, it took a 232-day shutdown of the game, including \ncanceling the World Series for the first time in 90 years, to finally \nget an agreement.\n  Hall of Famer and U.S. Senator Jim Bunning has an op-ed piece in this \nmorning's New York Times. He writes, ``The last strike nearly killed \nthe game. I am afraid the next one will.''\n  There are many problems. Only five out of thirty teams made a profit \nlast season. That means 25 ended up in the red. The extreme ran from \nthe Yankees collecting $217.8 million and the Montreal Expos $9.8 \nmillion.\n  The average player today, the average player, makes more than $2 \nmillion a year.\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n  Ever since Abner Doubleday invented the game, a game is played until \none team wins. That was part of the enchantment of the game: \ntheoretically it could go on forever. Unless, that is, a commissioner \ncalls it off and goes to dinner.\n  Ever since baseball was declared as entertainment instead of a \nbusiness in a 1922 Supreme Court decision that gave the owners \nexemptions from laws against collusion and other monopolistic \nactivities, we have probably been headed to this day. These anti-trust \nexemptions give owners tremendous power and any proposals to change it, \nlike Rep. John Conyers tried to do not too long ago, have gone nowhere.\n  And, we're not proposing that today, I'm not even sure I'm for that. \nI happen to think that it would kill the minor leagues.\n  And right now, these 160 teams are playing some of the purest \nbaseball being played today.\n  So what do we do? Here's how I see it.\n  What would any of us do if we saw a loved one, someone you grew up \nwith and loved like a member of your family, with a pistol in his hand, \nloaded with the safety off and aimed at their temple?\n  What if you had only a few seconds before that close personal friend \nblew his brains out? I'd try to stop him. And I think you would too. \nI'd lurch for the pistol and try to take it away from him by whatever \nforce necessary. I'd do just about anything to save his life.\n  I could go on with this analogy, but I think you get the picture.\n  For sixty summers I've followed the game of baseball. I live for the \nearly days of February when the catchers and pitchers report for spring \ntraining.\n  And when the World Series ends in the late fall, I might as well be \nhibernating in a cave during the winter, or serving in the Senate, \nbecause my life is so empty.\n  But, I digress. Back to saving the life of that good friend about to \nblow his brains out.\n  That's what this resolution attempts to do.\n  Its purpose is to inject the Federal Government, with all its \npersuasive powers, into this dispute. Hopefully, with the end result of \npreventing the baseball players from striking and shutting down major \nleague baseball.\n  I want to save this game for those who love it as I do and for those \nwho will come after us. I do not want to see our national pastime \nbecome our national once-upon-a-time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7232-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4313.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 242) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 242\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces have a long and honorable history as units of \n     adventuresome, hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the \n     national security of the United States and the defense of \n     freedom and peace, project effective ground combat power of \n     the United States by Air Force air transport to the far \n     reaches of the battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of \n     the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2002, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind battle lines by \n     means of parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack was begun on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute \n     Test Platoon was first authorized by the United States \n     Department of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began \n     training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that, since then, have served with \n     distinction and repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and \n     17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Infantry (Ranger) \n     regiment, the 173rd, 187th, 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, \n     541st, and 542nd airborne infantry regiments, the 88th Glider \n     Infantry Battalion, and the 509th, 550th, 551st, and 555th \n     airborne infantry battalions;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis for evolution into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Infantry (Ranger) regiment which, together with other \n     units, comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's \n     XVIIIth Airborne Corps when not operating separately under \n     the command of a Commander in Chief of one of the regional \n     unified combatant commands;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance, Navy SEALs, Air Force \n     Combat Control Teams, Air Sea Rescue, and Airborne Engineer \n     Aviation Battalions, all or most of which comprise the forces \n     of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Infantry \n     (Ranger) regiment, Special Forces units, and units of the \n     101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), together with other \n     units of the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war \n     against terrorism, carrying out combat operations in \n     Afghanistan, training operations in the Philippines, and \n     other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas, of the members and former members of the Nation's \n     combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas, the members and former members of the Nation's \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operations forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2002, as the 62nd anniversary of the first \n     official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate requests and urges the President \n     to issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating August 16, 2002, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe ``National \n     Airborne Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7241-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7241-S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE BUFFALO SOLDIERS AND COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 97\n\n       Whereas the 9th and 10th Horse Cavalry Units, (in this \n     resolution referred to as the `Buffalo Soldiers') have made \n     key contributions to the history of the United States by \n     fighting to defend and protect our Nation;\n       Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers maintained the trails and \n     protected the settler communities during the period of \n     westward expansion;\n       Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers were among Theodore \n     Roosevelt's Rough Riders in Cuba during the Spanish-American \n     War, and crossed into Mexico in 1916 under General John J. \n     Pershing;\n       Whereas African-American men were drafted into the Buffalo \n     Soldiers to serve on harsh terrain and protect the Mexican \n     Border;\n       Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers went to North Africa, Iran, \n     and Italy during World War II and served in many positions, \n     including as paratroopers and combat engineers;\n       Whereas in the face of fear of a Japanese invasion, the \n     Buffalo Soldiers were placed along the rugged border terrain \n     of the Baja Peninsula and protected dams, power stations, and \n     rail lines that were crucial to San Diego's war industries;\n       Whereas among these American heroes, Colonel Charles Young, \n     of Ripley, Ohio, stands out as a shining example of the \n     dedication, service, and commitment of the Buffalo Soldiers;\n       Whereas Colonel Charles Young, the third African-American \n     to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West \n     Point, served his distinguished career as a\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\n     member of the Buffalo Soldiers throughout the world, \n     traveling to the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, \n     Haiti as the first African-American military attache for the \n     United States, Liberia and Mexico as a military attache, \n     Monrovia as advisor to the Liberian government, and several \n     other stations within the borders of the United States, \n     holding commands during most of these tours;\n       Whereas Colonel Charles Young took a vested interest in the \n     development of African-American youth by serving as an \n     educator, teaching in local high schools and at Wilberforce \n     University in Ohio, and developing a military training ground \n     for African-American enlisted men to help them achieve \n     officer status for World War I at Fort Huachucha;\n       Whereas Colonel Charles Young achieved so much in the face \n     of race-based adversity and while he fought a fatal disease, \n     Bright's Disease, which eventually took his life; and\n       Whereas there are currently 21 existing chapters of the 9th \n     and 10th Cavalry Association, with 20 domestic chapters and 1 \n     in Germany: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the bravery and dedication of the Buffalo \n     Soldiers throughout United States and world history;\n       (2) honors 1 of the Buffalo Soldiers' most distinguished \n     heroes, Colonel Charles Young, for his lifetime achievements; \n     and\n       (3) recognizes the continuing legacy of the Buffalo \n     Soldiers throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/23/senate-section/article/S7242-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
