Under the previous order, the clerk \nwill report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John Robert Bolton of \nMaryland to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the time until 10:15 \nis reserved for proponents and opponents of this nomination; is that \ntrue?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time am I allowed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate will vote this morning on the \nnomination by President Bush of Mr. John Bolton to be Under Secretary \nof State for Arms Control.\n  This is a terrible nomination. I indicated yesterday that I don't \nknow Mr. John Bolton. I have not met him. But I have read a great deal \nabout what he said about a number of issues. To nominate Mr. John \nBolton to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control defies logic.\n  Arms control is a very important subject. The question of whether \nthis country is going to assume the responsibility to lead \ninternationally in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is a very \nimportant question.\n  Are we going to be a world leader in stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons or not? Are we going to be a leader in trying to make this a \nsafer world? Are we going to be a leader in trying to reduce the number \nof nuclear weapons that exist in this world?\n  The answer from the President, it seems to me, in sending this \nnomination to the Senate is no; we don't intend to lead on anything. We \nintend to do our own thing notwithstanding what\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nanybody else thinks about it, and notwithstanding the consequences with \nrespect to the reduction of additional nuclear weapons and delivery \nsystems.\n  Mr. Bolton has virtually no experience in the field of arms control. \nHe has never served in an arms control position in any form. He is \nqualified perhaps for the dismantling of the systems of arms control as \nwe know it. But he is not the person we would want consulting on arms \ncontrol with our allies, and he is not the person we want negotiating \ntreaties.\n  Mr. Bolton has expressed disdain for arms control and those who \npromote it. Let me give you some examples.\n  We had a debate on the floor of the Senate a year and a half ago on \nthe subject of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. Our country has \nalready decided to stop testing nuclear weapons. We decided that in the \nearly 1990s. So the question wasn't for us. We had already decided to \nstop testing nuclear weapons. The question was whether we would join in \na treaty with many other countries around the world--a treaty that has \nsomething like 150 different signatories. Would we join in that treaty \nto try to stop others from testing nuclear weapons? Regrettably, the \nanswer by this Senate was no; we don't want to do that.\n  I think it was a terrible mistake. What an awful day for the Senate \nto say no. We stopped nuclear testing, but we don't want to join in a \ntreaty to try to promote others to stop nuclear testing. What an awful \nthing for the Senate to do. The Senate has a right to do that. Of \ncourse, I think it was an awful mistake.\n  What happened when we turned down the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty? Mr. John Bolton says the supporters of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty are timid and neopacifists. That is the way he \ndescribed those who support efforts to have an international treaty to \nstop nuclear testing.\n  Then he states on the issue of treaties and arms control and so on \nthat international law is not really law at all.\n  Quoting him, ``While treaties may be politically or even morally \nbinding, they are not legally obligatory. They are just not law as we \napprehend the term.''\n  That is a statement by Mr. Bolton.\n  He says with respect to our allies who try to put pressure on us to \npass the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, that the Canadian \nPremier is ``moral posturing.'' The Sun calls Mr. Bolton one of ``Tony \nBlair's strongest critics.'' He says, ``The Europeans can be sure that \nAmerica's days as a well-bred doormat for EU political and military \nprotections are coming to an end.''\n  Then he gloated at the end of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty and its defeat, and said the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty is dead.\n  He has been highly critical of the agreed-upon framework under which \nNorth Korea pledged to free its nuclear weapons program, and he says \nthe United States suffers no downside if we never normalize relations \nwith North Korea. Certainly South Korea and Japan, our friends, don't \nagree with him.\n  He thinks the United States should not give Taiwan diplomatic \nrecognition as an independent country, in contradiction of several \ndecades of official American policy. He says we have no vital interest \nin Kosovo or the rest of the Balkans. Tell that to the Europeans and \nthe U.S. troops whose presence there stopped the genocide and stopped \nthe killing of thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of people.\n  I think the world is going to see, if the Senate confirms this \nnomination, that Mr. Bolton's appointment is another sign of the \nPresident's hard line on these issues, as a unilateral policy to \nabandon ABM, or to get rid of the ABM Treaty, or ignore it, build a \ndestabilizing national missile defense system, ignore the Kyoto treaty, \nabandon talks with North Korea, and oppose the international criminal \ncourt and the international landmine convention.\n  I think the signal is going to be quite clear if this Senate agrees \nwith this President and puts John Bolton in as Under Secretary for Arms \nControl.\n  He comes to this position with very little experience, and with an \nattitude about these issues that is antithetical to the progress that \nwe are making in these areas.\n  I mentioned that we have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in this \nworld. Russia has somewhere perhaps between 20,000 and 30,000 strategic \nand theater nuclear weapons. We have tens of thousand of nuclear \nweapons. There are a handful of other countries that have joined the \nnuclear club and have access to nuclear weapons. Many other countries \nwant to possess nuclear weapons and are achieving and aspiring to try \nto get nuclear weapons. Some terrorists want nuclear weapons.\n  The question is, Will our country for our security and the security \nof the world provide a leadership role in trying to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons? Will we be aggressive and vigilant? Will we be world \nleaders on this issue? Not if we decide to confirm the nomination of \nJohn Bolton. He is not someone who believes in arms control. He is not \nsomeone who believes in arms reduction.\n  The fact is, we have reduced the number of nuclear weapons not nearly \nfar enough, but we have reduced the number of nuclear weapons in this \nworld through the arms control agreements we have had with the old \nSoviet Union and now Russia.\n  The fact is, we have sawed the wings off Soviet bombers and long-\nrange bombers. We have dismantled them. We have dismantled their \nsubmarines. We have dismantled their nuclear warheads? Why? Because we \nand the Russians have agreed upon a regimen of reducing nuclear \nweapons. Are we going to stop all of that? Are we going to make more \nand more determined efforts to continue it and do even more?\n\n  In my judgment, we should continue this approach. In my judgment, \nthis leads to a safer world.\n  But we have now this nomination that comes to us today that is very \ndistressful--having an administration put someone in a position whose \njob it is to deal with the issue of arms control who doesn't believe in \narms control, who doesn't believe in treaties, who doesn't believe in a \nregimen of trying to stop nuclear testing, and believes that treaties \nand agreements have no legal impact at all and no effect.\n  He believes that we should just go it alone, apparently, \nnotwithstanding what others want or say.\n  We are going to move into a very delicate and very difficult \ncircumstance very soon. In addition to their being tens of thousands of \nnuclear weapons that now exist in this world and precious little effort \nto try to reduce them, and turning away from basic arms control \nagreements, including the ABM Treaty which has been the centerfold in \nattempts that have resulted in arms reduction--in addition to all of \nthat--apparently we are deciding to build a national missile defense \nsystem to protect against a less likely threat: a rogue nation or a \nterrorist acquiring an ICBM, loading it with a nuclear tip and sending \nit to this country.\n  They are much more likely to load a pick-up truck with a nuclear bomb \nand threaten this country.\n  If we build a national missile defense and say it doesn't matter what \nothers do, ignore nuclear arms treaties resulting in larger buildups \nand more weapons and delivery vehicles by the Russians, the Chinese and \nothers, will we be safer, and will the world be safer with a national \nmissile defense system to protect us against a Russian threat, or \nagainst a Chinese threat? The answer is clearly no.\n  My feeling is that we are at a moment in time in this country that is \nvery important. We have reached the moment in this world that is very \nimportant. We have seen an explosion of nuclear weapons by Pakistan and \nIndia--two countries that don't like each other. They are building \nnuclear weapons.\n  We have seen circumstances with the Chinese and the Russians and the \nEuropeans, and the others, who are concerned about us going it alone. \nAs a columnist for the Washington Post said: Built to suit our \ninterests and damn the other interests. It doesn't matter what the \nothers think.\n  That, in my judgment, is very troubling, to try to find a way to have \nworld leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to provide \nworld leadership to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 \nminute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know others wish to speak today, and I \nspoke at some length yesterday about this issue. But I want to end by \nsaying the following: All I know about this nominee is what he has \nsaid, what he has established as a public record. It is, in my \njudgment, antithetical to what we ought to aspire to be and what we \nought to aspire to see from someone in the position we expect to \nprovide leadership on arms control.\n  He, in fact, in my judgment, will not and cannot because he does not \nbelieve in arms control. He does not believe in doing this on the basis \nof reaching out with others to try to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons with treaties and arms control agreements. He does not believe \nin trying to stop the testing through treaties of nuclear weapons, the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  In my judgment, if this Senate sees fit today to vote positively on \nthis nomination, we will have taken a significant step backwards. We \nwill have impeded the efforts of this country to be a world leader in \nareas that really matter.\n  I hope the Senate will think long and hard about this and decide to \ntell the President this nomination is not appropriate for the position \nof Under Secretary of State for Arms Control.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote on \nthe President's nomination of John Bolton for Undersecretary of State \nfor Arms Control and International Security. I am under no illusions \nabout the fact that Mr. Bolton will be confirmed for this position. But \nI will vote against him, because I believe his views on the issues for \nwhich he will have responsibility are inconsistent with the best \ninterests of the United States.\n  President Bush has promised to work with our friends and allies to \nbuild a new framework for U.S. policies on arms control and \ninternational security. But his nomination of John Bolton to be the \nprincipal advisor to the Secretary of State on these issues is just one \nof many steps that have sent a decidedly mixed message about his \ncommitment to pursuing a thoughtful, cooperative approach.\n  In the last several weeks, President Bush has withdrawn the United \nStates from the Kyoto Protocol, sent the South Korean President home \nwith no commitment that we will continue to work on reducing the \ndangers from North Korea's ballistic missile program, reversed a more \nthan 20-year-old United States policy that has kept the peace in the \nTaiwan Strait, and announced that the United States will no longer \nconcern itself with negotiations to control and reduce the strategic \nnuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Last week, in what will \nassuredly not be the last evidence of growing concern and impatience \nwith U.S. unilateralism, we were voted off the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission, to the delight of human rights abusers everywhere. This \ngrowing unilateralism is very troubling to those of us who understand \nthat the interests of the American people are best protected when we \nwork in concert with others on common interests and problems.\n  Senate confirmation of John Bolton to be Undersecretary of State for \nArms Control and International Security will be another serious blow to \nU.S. leadership on these important issues. Over the last 8 years, John \nBolton has expressed extreme views on a wide range of U.S. foreign \npolicy issues. He has belittled the United Nations, referred to \nsupporters of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as neo-pacifists, \nlabeled our closest allies ``appeasers'' for opposing sanctions policy \nalso opposed by Vice President Cheney, and questioned whether the \nUnited States is ever legally bound by its treaty obligations.\n  I find John Bolton's views most troubling on the arms control issues \nover which he will exercise a great deal of influence in this position. \nHe is a staunch opponent of important treaties--including the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the ABM Treaty, and the Ottawa \nConvention banning antipersonnel land mines which he has criticized as \nunenforceable, while at the same time opposing the development of \ninternational enforcement mechanisms. His antagonism to arms control \nthreatens the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), a cooperative, \nverifiable agreement that has effectively kept the nuclear weapons club \nto very low numbers for more than three decades span. But future \ninternational participation in the NPT is inextricably tied to the \nstability of treaties that Mr. Bolton has condemned. So too is the \nsuccess of our cooperative nuclear threat-reduction measures with \nRussia.\n  Mr. Bolton has also consistently advocated that the United States \ngive diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, a position at odds with decades \nof U.S. policy and with President Bush's declared One China stance. \nFrom 1994-1996, the Taiwanese government paid $30,000 to Mr. Bolton for \nseveral papers on Taiwan and the U.N. It is troubling that during this \ntime Mr. Bolton testified about this same issue before two House \nsubcommittees. Should he be confirmed, Mr. Bolton will play a major \nrole in overseeing United States arms sales to Taiwan, one of the most \nimportant--and most potentially volatile--issues in United States \npolicy toward Asia. While the State Department has signed off on \nethical questions surrounding this possible conflict of interest, I \nbelieve United States arms sales policy toward Taiwan can not help but \nbe affected--least in perception, if not in fact--by Mr. Bolton's past \nrelationship with the Government of Taiwan.\n\n  On another issue of great importance to stability in Asia, Mr. Bolton \nhas criticized the Clinton administration's efforts to freeze North \nKorea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs as ``egregiously \nwrong.'' This despite the undisputed facts that the 1994 Agreed \nFramework has successfully stopped Pyongyang's nuclear program and more \nrecent talks have convined North Korea to unilaterally suspend its \nmissile tests until 2003.\n  President Bush is now reviewing United States policy toward North \nKorea, which I hope will conclude with a decision to continue talks \nwith Pyongyang about the future of its missile program. While I am \nsympathetic to the President's desire to review past policy, I believe \nit would be mistake to walk away from a dialogue that holds out the \npossibility of a verifiable agreement to freeze North Korea's missile \nprogram and halt their missile sales. John Bolton has taken a \ndismissive view of the value of dialogue with Pyongyang, and I am \ndeeply concerned that adding his voice to the administration's debate \non this issue will further undermine the United States interest in \nadvancing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n  Finally, while Mr. Bolton's testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee seemed to suggest that his current views are more moderate \nthan his writings indicate, I remain perplexed by the question of what \nviews he will take with him into this administration. This is not an \nacademic or inappropriate issue to raise. While, ultimately, Mr. \nBolton's personal opinions will be subsumed by the decisions of the \nSecretary of State and the President, he will have an enormous amount \nof influence in the policy debates that shape those decisions. I find \nit difficult to imagine that a man who has dedicated his life to public \nservice on behalf of a set of values that he has taken the time to \narticulate in public writings will suddenly cease to advocate on behalf \nof those values at exactly the moment when his ability to influence \npublic debate is at its zenith.\n  Mr. President, the United States has a strong interest in maintaining \nand advancing transparent, verifiable arms control regimes and stopping \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These issues are far \ntoo important to be left in the hands of a man who has denied their \nvery legitimacy. I urge my colleagues to vote against this nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Constitution gives the Senate the power \nto advise and consent on the President's nominations. This is a \nresponsibility that I take very seriously. While I believe the \nPresident is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when selecting the \nsenior members of his team, the Senate is not a rubber stamp, and there \nare times where a careful review leads one to the conclusion that a \nnomination must be opposed.\n  President Bush has made some excellent choices for several of the top \nforeign policy positions in his administration--from Colin Powell for \nSecretary\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\nof State to Howard Baker for Ambassador to Japan. But the nomination of \nMr. Bolton is not one of those choices. I will oppose the nomination of \nJohn Bolton for the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl and International Security, because I have serious concerns \nabout Mr. Bolton's experience, his diplomatic temperament, and his \nrecord.\n  Before proceeding further, it should be stated that it is becoming \nincreasingly clear that there is a double standard in the Senate's \ntreatment of President Bush's nominees and those of President Clinton. \nDuring the Clinton administration, nominations often languished for \nmonths--and in some cases years--before the Senate, without ever coming \nto the floor for a vote. However, when Democrats object to a Bush \nadministration nomination, Republicans cry foul and accuse Democrats of \nnot playing by the rules.\n  This double standard is evident with this nomination. President \nClinton's choice for Under Secretary for Arms Control and International \nSecurity was John Holum. After being confirmed by the Senate by voice \nvote, Mr. Holum served as Director for the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency, ACDA, for 6 years. When ACDA was going to be folded into the \nState Department, President Clinton made a sound decision to nominate \nMr. Holum to be the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. Despite his qualifications, a few Republicans \nblocked John Holum's nomination for nearly 2 years, successfully \npreventing a vote. This stands in stark contrast to President Bush's \nselection for the very same position. The nomination of Mr. Bolton--who \nunlike Mr. Holum is not well qualified for this position--is being \nvoted on by the full Senate after just 2 months.\n  The first reason that I oppose this nomination is because Mr. Bolton \ndoes not have the requisite experience for the job. I am aware that he \nhas some solid foreign policy credentials, previously serving on the \nCommission on International Religious Freedom, as Assistant Secretary \nof State for International Organization Affairs, and as Assistant \nAdministrator of USAID for Program and Policy Coordination. But John \nBolton has been nominated for the senior position at the State \nDepartment responsible for supervising and managing complicated \nnegotiations for arms control and nonproliferation issues. In these \nareas, his experience is seriously deficient.\n  This is no time to learn on the job. We are confronted by a complex \nand rapidly changing security environment, which will require sensitive \ndiplomatic negotiations and consultations on a wide range of \ninternational security matters with our friends, allies, and \nadversaries. We need someone in this position with long experience and \na proven track record on these issues--which Mr. Bolton does not have.\n  Second, as Senator Biden appropriately pointed out at Mr. Bolton's \nconfirmation hearing, Mr. Bolton lacks the diplomatic temperament for \nthis job.\n  He is prone to making confusing statements and using inflammatory \nrhetoric against those with whom he does not agree. He once stated that \n``Republicans are adults on foreign policy questions, and we define \nwhat we're willing to do militarily and politically by what is in the \nbest interests of the United States.'' What does this mean? Do \nDemocrats not act in the best interests of the United States? Are \nDemocrats like Lee Hamilton, Sam Nunn, and James Sasser not adults on \nforeign policy? It is a ludicrous and offensive statement.\n  On another occasion, Mr. Bolton attacked those who were concerned \nabout the defeat of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, CTBT. \nSome were worried that the Senate's decision to vote down a major \ninternational security pact for the first time since the Treaty of \nVersailles could signal a turn toward isolationism. Mr. Bolton's \nresponse was that these reactions were ``indications of a profoundly \nmisguided and potentially dangerous philosophy in American foreign \npolicy'' and that people who held this view were ``timid and neo-\npacifist.'' Again, is being vigilant about the possibility of American \nisolationism, something that contributed to the Second World War, timid \nor neo-pacifist? What is a neo-pacifist, anyway?\n  And with respect to the International Criminal Court, ICC, Mr. Bolton \nsaid that ``[s]upport for the International Criminal Court concept is \nbased largely on emotional appeals to an abstract ideal of an \ninternational judicial system unsupported by any meaningful evidence \nand running contrary to sound principles of international crisis \nresolution.'' Why was the decision to sign the Treaty, and join 139 \nother nations including 17 of our NATO allies, emotional? Is it not \nrational to conclude that signing the Treaty enables us to maintain the \nmaximum influence over the ongoing negotiations and obtain additional \nconcessions in the process?\n  These are representative of statements from Mr. Bolton that are \nconfusing, inaccurate and inflammatory. While those of us in politics \nare used to this sort of thing, effective international diplomacy is \nnot conducted in this manner. It is not the kind of temperament that we \nneed from our most senior arms control official at the State \nDepartment.\n  I am also deeply concerned about Mr. Bolton's record on arms control \nand nonproliferation agreements and his views on international law. \nAlthough he has supported some security treaties in the past, he is \nphilosophically opposed to most of the treaties that comprise the \nfoundation of the international nonproliferation regime. He once said \nthat the CTBT and other treaties are ``unenforceable'' and provide \n``illusionary protections.'' Moreover, he argued that \n``[w]hile treaties may well be politically or even morally binding, \nthey are not legally obligatory. They are just not `law' as we \napprehend them.'' In fact, the principle that treaties and other forms \nof international law are binding is widely accepted. Whether trading \nwith other nations or insisting on the right to traverse international \nwater or airspace, we rely on treaties and international agreements to \nprotect our interests.\n\n  It is true that treaties and other agreements are just one part of \ninternational security. Nevertheless, they are an extremely important \npart. Mr. Bolton's statements make me seriously question his commitment \nto this aspect of our security, and I do not want to confirm an \nindividual with this record to a position that is responsible, in part, \nfor advancing U.S. interests by upholding and promoting international \nnonproliferation agreements.\n  Finally, I would note that the timing of the vote on Mr. Bolton's \nnomination could not be worse. From Kyoto to missile defense, the Bush \nadministration has made a number of unilateral decisions that have \ncaused great concern among our allies in Europe and Asia. And, there \nare reports that more could be on the way--such as ``unsigning'' the \nICC Treaty. I firmly believe that confirming someone to this important \nposition who has limited experience on these issues, lacks the \ndiplomatic temperament for the job, and has, at best, a mixed record of \nsupporting international arms control agreements, sends yet another \nnegative signal to our friends and allies.\n  We need a person in this important position who will help craft a \nbipartisan foreign policy and work with our friends and allies to make \nAmerica more secure. Mr. Bolton is not that person, and I will vote \n``no'' on his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that Mr. Bolton will receive sufficient \nvotes to become our next Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. I hope that the fact that he was only reported \nout of the Foreign Relations Committee by a margin of one vote, and \nthat several senior Senators with expertise and many years of \nexperience in arms control opposed his nomination, will cause him to \nreflect on the way he has approached these issues in the past. This is \na position of great responsibility. He should use it to demonstrate \nthat he can work constructively and respectfully with people, whether \nthey agree or disagree with him, to help advance the interests of this \nnation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination \nof John R. Bolton as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. In many ways, Mr. Bolton's record, writing, and \nviews lead me to believe that he is the wrong man at the wrong time for \nthis position.\n  In considering this nomination I am most troubled by the fact that \nMr.\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nBolton's views appear to be antithetical to both arms control and \ninternational law.\n  Although he has supported some security treaties, on the whole he has \nbeen highly critical of most of the treaties that comprise the \nfoundations for nuclear arms control and nonproliferation.\n  When the Senate voted down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, \nfor example, it is my understanding that Mr. Bolton applauded the \ndefeat of ``the illusionary protection of unenforceable treaties''.\n  Arms control treaties and international efforts to control the spread \nof weapons of mass destruction are not the only way to address these \nthreats, the United States must have other means and capabilities as \nwell, but they have a place in U.S. foreign policy, and can play a \nuseful role in safeguarding American interests.\n  The CTBT, START, the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, alongside many other treaties negotiated by \nPresidents of both parties, can and do play an important role in \nreducing the risk to the United States posed by the proliferation of \nWeapons of Mass Destruction.\n  Likewise, Mr. Bolton has made comments that suggest that \ninternational treaties do not have the force of law, and raising \nquestions about the commitment that states should have to their treaty \nobligations.\n  He has written that ``while treaties may well be politically or even \nmorally binding, they are not legally obligatory. They are just not \n`law' as we apprehend the term.''\n  In arguing that the U.S. has no obligation to pay our share of the \nUnited Nations dues Mr. Bolton argued that ``Treaties are `law' only \nfor U.S. domestic purposes. In their international operation, treaties \nare simply `political' obligations.''\n  This approach suggests that international treaties are unenforceable; \nthat signatories may pick and choose the sections they will adhere to; \nand that the United States, by virtue of our superpower status, may \ninsist on other countries fulfilling their treaty obligations while \nreserving the right to ignore our own.\n  But how can the United States hope to compel other countries, \nespecially states like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea to respect \ninternational law and norms on non-proliferation if the top State \nDepartment official for arms control does not?\n  Mr. Bolton has also suggested that ``There is no such thing as the \nUnited Nations . . .''.\n  How effective can United States leadership be in the international \ncommunity if these views guide U.S. policy? In some ways, Mr. \nPresident, I think the recent loss of the U.S. seat on the Human Rights \nCommission provides us an early indication of what answer we can expect \nfrom the rest of the international community to that question.\n  There are also questions about Mr. Bolton's approach to a range of \nother issues on the international agenda which, as Under Secretary and \na senior member of the State Department decision-making apparatus, he \nwill play a role.\n  Mr. Bolton's views on Taiwan appear to be out of step with thirty \nyears of bipartisan U.S. policy as well as the views of the Bush \nAdministration.\n  He has stated that he believes Taiwan to be a state, and argued for \nfull diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and an end to the ``One China'' \npolicy.\n  Over the past thirty years the Taiwan Relations Act, the ``One \nChina'' policy, the three Joint Communiques, and a policy of purposeful \nambiguity with regards to U.S. defense commitments to Taiwan have \nserved U.S. interests, and those of Taiwan, extremely well. It is an \napproach that has provided the United States with both leverage and \nmaneuvering room in our relations with both China and Taiwan, and has \nhad the support of six Presidents from both parties as well as broad \nbipartisan backing in Congress.\n  These are but a few examples of the sort of worrisome issues which \nlead me to believe that Mr. Bolton is not the right person to serve as \nUnder Secretary.\n  The questions that have been raised about Mr. Bolton's views on a \nrange of arms control, international law, and other national security \nissues strongly suggests that Mr. Bolton does not meet the necessary \nthreshold for confirmation by the Senate as Under Secretary of State. I \ndo not make this statement lightly, but I do so with the recognition \nthat the Senate has the right, the obligation, to provide advice and \nconsent to the President's appointments.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the confirmation of Mr. \nBolton.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe nomination of Mr. John Bolton to become the Under Secretary of \nState for Arms Control and International Security. Many in the Senate \ndisagree with the substantive views of Mr. Bolton on particular policy \nissues and will oppose his nomination on the basis of those \ndisagreements. I too disagree with Mr. Bolton on a range of important \nforeign policy issues, but my opposition to his nomination comes from \nbroader and deeper concerns. First among them, I believe that whoever \nserves in this position should be experienced, knowledgeable, and \nphilosophically compatible with the use of arms control as a legitimate \ntool of the national security objectives of the United States. Arms \ncontrol treaties have served our national security interests well \nduring past decades, including important major treaties signed and \nratified by Republican administrations. Notable among the many \nimportant and effective arms control contributions by Republican \nadministrations are the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the ABM Treaty and \nProtocol, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, and the Intermediate Nuclear \nForces Treaty. I would hope that Mr. Bolton would uphold this tradition \nwithin his party, but I am skeptical that will be the case. If so, our \nnation stands to become more insecure rather than less in the volatile \nworld of today's international system.\n  Recent testimony by Mr. Bolton suggests that he may not be as \nknowledgeable about the significant contributions of prior arms control \ntreaties as he should be, and, more importantly, may not be inclined to \nsupport arms control as a useful mechanism to achieving national \nsecurity goals. In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, for example, when asked about his views regarding \nwhether the ABM Treaty is in force, he withheld his own views on this \nvery important matter which now lies at the center of the most \nsignificant national security debate in our country as well as within \nthe international community. It seems to me that if the Senate is to \nconfirm a nominee for this important position as Under Secretary of \nState for Arms Control, it would not be unreasonable to expect that \nnominee, even if we are in disagreement, to have a well-developed, \narticulate view of this critical question. I believe that the Senate \nand the American people have a right to expect that someone who would \nassume this key advisory position would be able to answer that question \nin an informed, straightforward way. I'm concerned that we still don't \nknow if Mr. Bolton is well-educated on the validity and utility of the \nABM Treaty. I for one am reticent to hand over the keys to a car when I \ndon't know where the driver is going to take me. The ABM Treaty is so \nvitally important, I believe the American people have a right to know \nwhere Mr. Bolton wants to go.\n  In his writings and testimony, Mr. Bolton referred generically to \ntreaties that are unenforceable and that provide only illusory \nprotections. He would include the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in that \ncategory, a belief that suggests to me a lack of understanding about \nour verification capabilities with respect to countries which might \nseek to initiate a nuclear weapons program as well as nuclear weapons \nstates which might seek to advance their own capabilities in any \nmilitarily significant way. Though the Senate has not thoroughly \ndebated this question, the experts I have spoken with assure me that \nthe CTBT is verifiable consistent with our highest priority \nnonproliferation national security concerns. Before voting to confirm \nMr. Bolton, the Senate should know more about the specifics of his \nviews on this and similar matters in order to determine whether his \nviews are well-grounded or simply an expression of a visceral distrust \nof arms control as a national security tool.\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\n  I am equally concerned that his views rejecting the binding nature of \ninternational treaties is incompatible with the internationally \naccepted position on this fundamental legal question. In his writings, \nMr. Bolton has indicated that although treaties may be politically or \nmorally binding, they are not legally binding. I suspect that while he \nwould demand compliance of other nations to an international treaty as \na matter of law, he would defend instances of U.S. non-compliance as \nour legal right. At a time when the President of the United States has \nspoken repeatedly of the need for our nation to approach other \ncountries with humility, Mr. Bolton's view on this matter strikes me as \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  Perhaps, it comes down to this. Every time the Senate debates an arms \ncontrol agreement the question is asked, ``Will our nation be more \nsecure with or without this Treaty?'' For those who answer ``without'', \nthey conclude that the nation is more secure without making \ninternational commitments. Their crystal ball suggests that without \ninternational agreements, national self interest will be sufficient to \nensure national security. Given Mr. Bolton's position in opposition to \nkey arms control agreements of our time, I'm very concerned that he \nbelieves that U.S. unilateralism is the only reliable means to assure \nour national security. I strongly reject that view. Unilateralism is \nreversible and unpredictable, and in my view, portends greater \ninstability among nations. Before I'd vote to confirm Mr. Bolton, Mr. \nPresident, I'd like very much to know what Mr. Bolton's view of what a \nunilateralist world looks like to him without the ABM Treaty, the CTBT \nTreaty, or any other arms control treaty to which he is opposed. Until \nhe can convince me that it would be a safer world, I'll withhold my \nvote. I urge my colleagues of the Senate to do the same.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as you know, I generally believe that any \nPresident, Democratic or Republican, has the right to appoint the \nmembers of his administration. That is why, over the years, I have \ngenerally voted in support of the vast majority of presidential \nnominees that have come before the Senate. However, I am also mindful \nof the fact that the Founding Fathers gave the U.S. Senate a role in \nthe nomination process, namely that of advice and consent. This \nresponsibility was given to the Senate in order to ensure that the \nPresident did not misuse his authority in selecting individuals to \nserve in positions of public trust or ones with significant \nimplications for the national security of this country. I have always \nought to balance these two principles, that the President has been \nelected by the American people to do a job and he should be able to \ndecide how best to do it, and that the Constitution of the United \nStates charges the United States Senate with reviewing the Presidential \nappointments to ensure that our national interests are being served. \nAnd, in juggling these two sometimes conflicting concepts, I have \ngenerally given the benefit of the doubt to the individual selected by \nthe President.\n  Very rarely over the years have I voted against nominees. On those \noccasions in which I have chosen to do so, it has been because I have \nhad serious doubts about the ability of the individual to carry out the \nresponsibilities of the office to which he or she has been nominated. \nRegrettably, I hold such doubts about the nomination before us today--\nJohn Bolton to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl. Based upon Mr. Bolton's own statements and writings over the \nyears, as well as his testimony during his confirmation hearing, I have \nserious reservations about his ability to discharge his duties in the \narea of arms control. My reservations are of such a magnitude that they \nrise to a level so as to outweigh my general practice of deferring to \nthe President on nominations.\n  There is no question that Mr. Bolton is an individual of integrity \nand intelligence. He has demonstrated those qualities throughout his \ncareer--most recently at the American Enterprise Institute, and the \nCommission on International Religious Freedom. However, there is \nglaringly absent from his otherwise distinguished record, any \nsubstantial background in the area of arms control--the principle area \nof responsibility for the position to which he has been nominated. It \nis not only that Mr. Bolton has limited experience in the arms control \narena, but also that in his few dealings with this subject matter he \nhas expressed doubts as to the relevancy of arms control itself. I find \nit troubling that the individual that the President and the Secretary \nof State will look to in the areas of non- proliferation, arms control \nand security assistance holds that view. Arms control issues loom large \non the President's agenda as he demonstrated last week when he spoke at \nthe National Defense University on the topic of National Missile \nDefense, NMD --an extremely controversial subject with huge \nimplications for United States arms control policy. NMD, The \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and the future of the 1972 ABM \ntreaty are all subjects in which the President and the Congress will \nhave to come to some meeting of the minds on during the coming months. \nThe Under Secretary of State for Arms Control will have to play a \npivotal role in facilitating that process. Mr. Bolton's having a \ndismissive attitude toward arms reduction and arms control right from \nthe start gives him very little credibility with those of us who care \ndeeply about arms controls issues and are concerned about the direction \nthe Administration appears to be heading in this area.\n  With respect to CTBT and other international treaties, Mr. Bolton has \nstated that he does not believe that these agreements are legally \nbinding on the United States, but rather are ``political obligations.'' \nThis stance is contrary to United States interests of promoting respect \nfor international law and upholding the good faith agreements entered \ninto among our allies to honor these treaties. In addition, such \nstatements in the area of arms control, by the person who will occupy \nthe very post charged with upholding our treaty obligations, not only \ndiminishes our credibility in the eyes of our allies, but also \ncompromises the best interests of our national security. Arms control \nis a global issue, not an American one, and while we must forge \npolicies consistent with America's interests, we cannot create policy \nin a vacuum, and to act unilaterally on an issue of such import would \nbe foolish.\n  In terms of the ABM treaty, I believe that President Bush is correct \nwhen he says that the world is quite different today than it was in \n1972 when the treaty was first entered into with the then Soviet Union. \nClearly every word of that treaty should not be cast in stone. There \nmay be changes to the treaty that would benefit United States interests \nwithout undermining the principle purpose of the treaty--to prevent a \ncostly and dangerous international arms race. It is certainly \nappropriate that the President undertake a review of this treaty. But \nthis can be accomplished while still honoring our current treaty \nobligations and without a rush to judgement. The ABM treaty may need \nupdating, but unilaterally abrogating this treaty or any other treaty \nthat the United States has entered into is a major step not to be taken \nlightly or without consultations. While Mr. Bolton has stopped short of \ncalling for the unilateral abrogation of the treaty, his cavalier \nattitude toward our participation in the ABM treaty and to the \nresponsibilities that we bind ourselves to when we enter into these \ninternational agreements is disturbing.\n  I am further troubled by Mr. Bolton's views on such sensitive foreign \npolicy issues as the so called ``One China Policy,'' and on the nature \nand extent of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. I am particularly concerned at \na time when Chinese-American relations have taken a turn toward the \nadversarial. When the characterization of the U.S.-China relationship \nas ``strategic competition'' provokes indignation in Beijing, one can \nonly imagine the ramifications of Mr. Bolton's public support for the \nofficial recognition of Taiwan as an independent state, a position \nwhich contradicts over three decades of U.S. diplomacy that has \nsuccessfully balanced our interests in Asia. Although Mr. Bolton has \nstressed that the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control does not \nhave responsibility for directly shaping diplomatic relations between \nthe U.S. and China, separating arms control issues from U.S./China \npolicy is neither feasible nor advisable at a time when China sees \nitself, rightly or wrongly, as a target of the Bush\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nadministration's decisions to move forward with National Missile \nDefense and to sell arms to Taiwan.\n  Mr. Bolton has also expressed worrisome views on U.S. involvement in \nthe Balkan wars, stating that he saw `` no tangible national interest'' \nin those conflicts. And while it is true that American territory or \ninterests were not directly threatened by the bloodshed in the Balkans, \ncertainly instability in Europe must always be a matter of concern to \nthe United States as should human rights abuses that rise to the level \nof near genocide. I am concerned at Mr. Bolton's seemingly insular view \nof American interests and responsibilities.\n  Finally, Mr. Bolton has at times been outspoken and provocative in \nhis public remarks about international affairs. He has been known to \nstray from a simple statement of opinion to more controversial \npronouncements about subjects which are approached with tremendous \nsensitivity by most foreign policy experts. As Undersecretary of State \nfor Arms Control Mr. Bolton will be responsible for high level \nnegotiations with allies and other governments concerning the gravest \nmatters of national and international security. Regrettably, I am \nuncomfortable with the idea of Mr. Bolton in such delicate situations.\n  The world we live in today is dangerous. For better or worse, the \nUnited States must play a major role in ensuring that there are \nsafeguards to protect our national security and foreign policy \ninterests. Without doubt these dangers include the possibility of the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It may be true that no \nlonger is our main concern a purposeful attack by another superpower, \nbut rather the accidental or capricious bombing by a rogue nation. It \nmay also be true, as Mr. Bolton asserts, that it is time to re-examine \nour international arms framework, but it is not a time for isolation or \nbravado. Given the the critical negotiations and challenges that await \nthe new administration, there is no room for inexperience. We need a \nskilled and steady hand shaping a disarmament policy that is right for \nthe 21st Century. In my view Mr. Bolton does not possess such \nqualities, and that is why I have reluctantly decided to vote against \nhis nomination for this critical position.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of John Bolton for \nthe position of Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Affairs. Mr. Bolton is the President's choice, \nand I have generally supported the tradition of respect by the Senate \nfor confirming the President's nominees except in rare instances. I \ndisagree with some of the positions Mr. Bolton holds, particularly his \nopposition to some of the arms control treaties that were negotiated \nover many years by his predecessors at the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency. But I also agree with other positions Mr. Bolton has taken \nregarding America's foreign policy. He explained his positions during \nhis confirmation hearing and gave assurances that he accepts and will \nrespect America's obligations under international law. He is especially \nintent on working to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction \nto rogue states. I therefore conclude that Mr. Bolton falls within the \ncriteria of acceptability for confirmation to the job for which he has \nbeen nominated by the President.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about confirming \nJohn Bolton to be the next Under Secretary of State for Arms Control. \nThe person who serves in this position is expected to supervise and \nmanage international arms control negotiations and non-proliferation \nagreements and to uphold key arms control treaty obligations. Yet, John \nBolton has said he believes that the very agreements he would be \nrequired to uphold and negotiate are not even legally binding.\n  International arms control agreements are the linchpin of our \nnational security. They have played a vital role in keeping the peace, \nincreasing our security and halting the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the missiles that deliver them. They made a significant \ncontribution towards reducing nuclear threats during the Cold War, they \nhelped us reduce the presence of conventional forces in Europe in the \npost-Cold War era, and they have been an important tool in the response \nto the growing non-proliferation threat.\n  Not only does John Bolton have limited experience in the arms control \narena, but he has dismissed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and some \nother treaties as ``illusionary protections.'' He has been disdainful \nof supporters of the CTBT and, he has been intentionally evasive about \nhis views on the ABM Treaty. I question whether Mr. Bolton could serve \neffectively in this position given his views and the inflammatory \nmanner in which he has communicated these views in his years out of \npublic service.\n  I am not questioning the integrity of this nominee or his fitness for \ngovernment service in general. I also believe we must be careful not to \nreject nominees just because we object to their views. However, when a \nperson like John Bolton is put forward, a person whose views seem to \nundermine the very purpose for which he is being nominated, I believe \nwe have a responsibility to speak out. John Bolton is not an \nappropriate choice for Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and I \nwill be voting against this nomination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of John Bolton to \nbe Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation and \nInternational Security.\n  The Under Secretary must be able to develop and shape arms control \nand disarmament policies in a way that helps the Nation to achieve \nthese all-important goals for our country and our planet. It is this \nspecial responsibility of the Under Secretary to protect the United \nStates by working to control the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  As Senior Adviser to the President, the Under Secretary works with \nthe Secretary of State and members of the National Security Council, \nleads the interagency policy process on nonproliferation, and manages \nglobal U.S. security policy. He is involved in defense cooperation, \narms transfers and security assistance to our allies. He provides \npolicy direction for the nonproliferation of nuclear missiles and \nfissile material. He has a primary role in the negotiation, \nratification, verification, compliance, and implementation of \nagreements on strategic, non-conventional and conventional forces, \nregional security and military cooperation.\n  His role is also to oversee implementation of the Foreign Assistance \nAct, the Arms Export Control Act, and related legislation. The Bureaus \nof Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Political-Military Affairs and \nVerification and Compliance are under the policy oversight of the Under \nSecretary.\n  The position carries enormous responsibilities, and I am not \npersuaded that Mr. Bolton has the vision and commitment to advance \nAmerica's best interests, especially in arms control.\n  Mr. Bolton has said that ``international treaties are `laws' purely \nfor domestic purposes'' and in their ``international operation, they \nare simply political obligations.'' He has described treaties as \nuseless, because they don't stop rogue states from doing what they seek \nand only restrain the U.S. from pursuing its own defense initiatives.\n  Mr. Bolton has also been an outspoken critic of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, referring to the \nlatter as an ``unenforceable treaty with illusory protections.''\n  Mr. Bolton praised the defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in \nthe Senate. He called Americans who worried that nuclear proliferation \nwould threaten international peace and security ``hysterical.'' He \ndescribed the philosophy behind supporting a treaty that bans dangerous \nnuclear testing as ``profoundly misguided and potentially dangerous.''\n  The CTBT is an important part of our global non-proliferation \nefforts, and it has been endorsed by General John Shalikashvili. \nEarlier this year, General Shalikashvili, Special Advisor to the \nPresident on this treaty, stated in a letter to the President that \n``there is no good reason to delay ratification of the CTBT'' and that \n`` the longer the U.S. delays, the more likely it is that other \ncountries will move irrevocably to acquire nuclear weapons or \nsignificantly improve their current nuclear arsenal and the less likely \nit is that we\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\ncould mobilize a strong international coalition against such \nactivities.''\n  Yet Mr. Bolton has criticized the treaty for not providing ``adequate \nprotections'' and ``hobbling the United States' ability to maintain the \nmost important international guarantee of peace''--which is, in Mr. \nBolton's view, ``a credible U.S. nuclear capability.''\n  I also have serious reservations about Mr. Bolton's views on the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In the years since the United States and \nthe Soviet Union signed the ABM Treaty in 1972, it has been a major \npart of U.S. nuclear arms control policy. By ensuring that our nuclear \narsenal remains an effective deterrent, the ABM Treaty prevented an \nescalating arms race with the Soviet Union and more recently with \nRussia. The treaty continues to bring significant stability to the \nU.S.-Russia nuclear partnership in the post-Cold War world.\n  Mr. Bolton has contended that National Missile Defense should be one \nof the our primary considerations in dealing with proliferation and \ninternational security. But this view is in conflict with the Under \nSecretary's responsibility to protect our Nation against threats in a \nway that is consistent with our treaty obligations. Mr. Bolton's view \nthat Russia will take advantage of any U.S. vulnerability could hinder \nessential and continued cooperation with that nation.\n  I am concerned as well by Mr. Bolton's views on our relations with \nNorth Korea and China. Since 1996, the United States has embarked on a \ndelicate negotiation with North Korea. The agreed framework has \nachieved renewed dialogue between North and South Korea, and could be \nthe beginning of a serious effort to achieving an arms control \nagreement with North Korea. It has created an unprecedented opportunity \nfor the U.S. and North Korea to work together. But Mr. Bolton has been \noutspoken in his opposition to the agreement, calling it an ``egregious \nmistake.''\n  Mr. Bolton has stated that normalizing relations with North Korea and \nthe goals it would achieve are ``entirely in North Korea's interests, \nnot ours.'' Clearly, efforts to stop the development of nuclear weapons \nin the Korean Peninsula are in the United States' interest. Yet Mr. \nBolton has also called the agreed framework an ``unjustifiable propping \nup of the North Korean regime.''\n  I am concerned that Mr. Bolton presents himself as a nominee who will \nfundamentally change the objectives of his office from promoting \ntreaties and arms control to urging a national agenda on missile \ndefense. The policies he promotes could unnecessarily alienate our \nallies and undermine arms control and nonproliferation.\n  Mr. Bolton has stated that ``the most important international \nguarantee of peace is a credible U.S. nuclear capability.'' It would be \na mistake to entrust the responsibility of achieving more effective \narms control, non-proliferation and disarmament policies to someone who \nbelieves that international security is best maintained by continuing \nthe nuclear arms race.\n  I am also deeply concerned about Mr. Bolton's views on the United \nNations. As Under Secretary, he would advise the President and the \nSecretary of State on policy decisions on U.S. security commitments \nworldwide and on arms transfers and security assistance policy and \nprograms. He would need to work with the international community and \nthe United Nations to meet these goals. Yet, in 1994, Mr. Bolton wrote \nstarkly that ``there is no such thing as the United Nations.'' He has \nsaid that the majority of Congress and most Americans do not care about \nlosing the U.S. vote in the General Assembly. Virtually every other \nnation in the world supports the United Nations and the United States \nshould be dedicated to strengthening, not weakening, it.\n  The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation and \nInternational Security should work to strengthen our international \ntreaties and our relations with other countries, not dismantle or \ndestroy them. I am not convinced that Mr. Bolton is committed to these \ncritical goals.\n  His views do not represent a positive approach to key arms control \nissues, and I urge the Senate to oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to state my opposition to the \nnomination of John Bolton to be Undersecretary of State for Arms \nControl and International Security. I want to clarify that I respect \nthe right of the President to choose those who will serve him in his \nAdministration. I also recognize that many of the appointees in this \nAdministration will have views which differ from my own--and those \ndifferences are not reason enough to vote against a nomination. \nHowever, in this case, I believe there is ample evidence that Mr. \nBolton has deeply held views which run so contrary to stated U.S. \npolicy that he will not be able to effectively perform his duties.\n  If confirmed, statute dictates that John Bolton would be the senior \nassistant to the Secretary of State in matters ``related to \ninternational security policy, arms control and non-proliferation.'' He \nwould oversee a number of issues including the fate of the ABM Treaty, \nnegotiation with North Korea on the Agreed Framework and aid to \ndismantle Russian nuclear stockpiles. At a time when the danger from \nnuclear weapons is at least as great as during the Cold War, it is \nessential that this Undersecretary be committed to using every possible \ndiplomatic option for reducing the weapons stockpile and diffusing \ntensions. Unfortunately, because of his previous statements, I cannot \nbe confident of Mr. Bolton's commitment to this goal. As Joseph \nCirincione, the director of the Carnegie Non Proliferation Project, \nstated: ``John Bolton is philosophically opposed to most of the \ninternational treaties that comprise the nonproliferation regime.''\n  Mr. Bolton was a vocal opponent of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nHe said that supporters of the CTBT were ``misguided individuals \nfollowing a timed and neo-pacifist line of thought.'' He also stated \nthat ``Mere promises by adversaries and rogue regimes, unverifiable in \ncritical respects, simply do not provide adequate protections and may \nactually hobble our ability to maintain the most important \ninternational guarantee of peace--a credible U.S. nuclear capability.'' \nI would like to note that history would indicate Mr. Bolton is \nincorrect, since the United States has been able to maintain an awesome \nnuclear stockpile while complying with arms control treaties that have \nbeen the cornerstone of the prevention of nuclear war for the past \nfifty years. Furthermore, while Mr. Bolton is certainly entitled to his \nopinions on arms control treaties, his opinions indicate that he may \nnot be best suited for a position which requires upholding and \nnegotiating treaties on a daily basis.\n  Mr. Bolton also does not seem to have a very high opinion of the \nUnited Nations, the organization with which he would have to work \nclosely in developing and maintaining U.S. international security \npolicy. At different points in the past few years, Mr. Bolton has \nstated that ``If the UN secretary building in NY lost 10 stories, it \nwouldn't make a bit of difference.'' He also stated that the U.S. has \nno obligation to pay its UN dues because ``The UN Charter is \nfundamentally a political, not a legal document. On finances it amounts \nto little more than an `agreement to agree.' '' Despite the fact that \nthe UN may seem bureaucratic and slow to act at times, it is the \nprimary instrument for international cooperation, and I believe U.S. \nparticipation is vital to ensure U.S. national security.\n  In addition, Mr. Bolton does not appear to believe that the tenets of \ninternational law are binding. In 1999, Mr. Bolton asserted that, ``In \nreality, international law, especially customary international law, \nmeets none of the tests we normally impose on `law', while treaties may \nbe politically or even morally binding, they are not legally \nobligatory. They are just not `law' as we apprehend the term.'' Since \nthe founding of this nation, Administrations have put faith in \ninternational law and treaties created under international law and \nentered into by the United States have been regarded, as the \nConstitution dictates, ``as the supreme law of the land.''\n  Mr. Bolton is clearly an intelligent and capable individual. However, \nhis publicly stated views and past actions indicate that he believes \nthat it is in the best interests of United States security to act \nunilaterally, with little regard for the views and agreements of the \ninternational community. We live\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\nin an increasingly interdependent world. Today, it is more important \nthan ever before to use such tools as the United Nations, international \nlaw and treaties to promote and ensure international security and arms \ncontrol. I believe the Undersecretary of State for International and \nArms Control should be willing to pursue these avenues, and I think the \nevidence indicates that Mr. Bolton would not be the best person for \nthis job. Therefore, I will oppose his nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, has there been time allotted for me to \nspeak on this nomination?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of John \nBolton to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. I do so for several reasons. I say at the \noutset--and I have said to my friend and colleague, Senator Helms, the \nchairman of the committee--that my opposition to John Bolton is not \nbased on a personal concern about John Bolton's overall qualifications. \nHe is an intelligent, bright, decent, and honest man. Notwithstanding \nan editorial in one of the major newspapers in this country, there is \nnothing inconsistent about that in my opposing the nomination of him \nrelating to this specific position.\n  I want my colleague from North Carolina to know that my opposition is \nbased--and which he will soon hear, and he knows because we have talked \nabout it--on Mr. Bolton's views on arms control primarily. This is a \ndecent and an honorable man, but I think he is the wrong man for this \njob.\n  I add at the outset, I think his views on some of the major issues in \nthe area of foreign policy are at odds with the stated views of the \nSecretary of State, although I am certain the Secretary of State \nsupports Mr. Bolton. I am not implying that there is opposition within \nthe State Department to Mr. Bolton.\n  Let me give you the reasons, as briefly as I can, that I am concerned \nabout Mr. Bolton's views on arms control.\n  He comes to the Senate with an extensive record of Government service \nbut a very limited record in arms control and nonproliferation matters, \nwhich, as the Presiding Officer knows, is an extremely complicated \narea--extremely complicated area.\n  What we do know about Mr. Bolton's views on arms control and \nnonproliferation matters suggests an individual who questions the \nrelevance of arms control agreements.\n  My friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the committee, \nquestions the relevance of the arms control agreements, and I find him \nto be an extremely qualified Senator. We just disagree on the issue. I \nwould vote for him for just about anything. I would probably vote for \nhim even for this position, but maybe I would not. This is the one \nposition I could consider I would not want him to have in the \nadministration.\n  In praising the defeat of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, \nMr. Bolton referred to the CTBT, and other unnamed treaties, as \n``unenforceable treaties'' which provide ``illusionary protections.'' I \nrealize some hold that view. They are not, however, people I think \nshould be in charge of promoting arms control, disarmament, and \nnonproliferation matters.\n  The death of the CTBT, he wrote, is a ``useful opportunity to re-\nexamine in a hard-headed and realistic way how international peace and \nsecurity are really guaranteed.''\n  Treaties are not the only means of ensuring arms control reductions, \nbut in the last 50 years treaties and agreements have provided the \nfoundation for advancing U.S. arms control and nonproliferation \nobjectives. From the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to the START \ntreaties, from the Chemical Weapons Convention to the Biological \nWeapons Convention, such agreements have been essential in \ncontaining the threat of dangerous weapons.\n\n  Mr. Bolton has supported some arms control treaties, I might add, \nincluding the Chemical Weapons Convention, where he and I were on one \nside, and the chairman was on the other side. But his sweeping \nstatements deriding the importance of arms control leave me uneasy \nabout his commitment to the task.\n  My discomfort level is increased by Mr. Bolton's questioning of \nwhether treaties are even binding. He wrote:\n\n       [W]hile treaties may well be politically or even morally \n     binding, they are not legally obligatory. They are just not \n     ``law'' as we apprehend the term.\n\n  Similarly, Mr. Bolton once testified to Congress--recently; as a \nmatter of fact, in the last several years--that treaties are \n``political'' and ``not legally binding, to the extent that they \npurport to affect relations among national governments.''\n  In response to a written question, he stated the matter a bit \ndifferently, saying, ``I believe that treaties bind the United \nStates,'' which I have difficulty, quite frankly, squaring with his \nprevious writings.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Bolton would supervise some of the most important \ntreaty obligations. I find Mr. Bolton's views on those issues relating \nto treaty obligations very troubling--very troubling.\n  I am also concerned about Mr. Bolton's limited experience in arms \ncontrol. By law, the Under Secretary is the senior assistant to the \nSecretary of State in matters ``related to international security \npolicy, arms control, and non-proliferation.''\n  As a matter of fact, in the reorganization effort spurred and led by \nmy friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the committee, we moved \nthis position into the State Department. It used to sit outside the \nState Department. This was supposed to be--and is supposed to be--the \nprimary person promoting arms control.\n  I note, parenthetically, I have always had difficulty voting for \nnominees who hold views that are antithetical to or at odds with the \nresponsibilities they have. I voted against, for example, fine men who \nwere nominated to be Secretary of the Interior during the Reagan \nadministration when they were insufficiently committed to the \nenvironment. So I didn't want to be a party to putting someone in a \nposition whose avowed purpose was the President's, which was \nantithetical to the purpose of the organization.\n  I am also concerned about his limited experience, as I said. Mr. \nBolton does have foreign policy experience, though--I do not think we \nshould underestimate that--at the Agency for International Development \nand as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations. He \nhas held those posts.\n  In the State Department, he did gain some experience in arms control, \nworking on issues related to the International Atomic Energy Agency and \nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, but these \nactivities were hardly a major part of his duties.\n  In the last 8 years, Mr. Bolton has written extensively on foreign \npolicy, but he wrote very little about arms control. That is not a bad \nthing, but it still leaves us with a person with little experience in \nthe arms control field, to which many of our senior people devote their \nentire careers.\n  Chairman Helms has cited a letter from former Directors of the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency in support of Mr. Bolton. The signatory \nof that letter most recently in the arms control job is a man named Ron \nLehman. I wish we had someone of Mr. Lehman's experience before us.\n  I might add, Mr. Bolton is just as bright. This is a fellow who is a \nYale undergraduate, went to Yale Law School, and is an extremely bright \nfellow. But he does not have Mr. Lehman's experience.\n  When Mr. Lehman was nominated in 1989, he had already held three jobs \nwith firsthand arms control experience before he was nominated. He was \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, where \nhe dealt with U.S. nuclear policy, arms control, space policy, and \ntechnology transfer controls. He was the chief U.S. negotiator on \nstrategic nuclear arms; that is, the START talks. And he was the Senior \nDirector at the National Security Council for Defense Programs and Arms \nControl. This man came with an incredible amount of experience. In \nshort, Mr. Lehman was literally steeped in arms control.\n  On other foreign policy issues, Mr. Bolton has been outside the \nmainstream. He has called for diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, a \nposition at odds with three decades of American diplomacy--and contrary \nto the position of this administration.\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\n  Mr. Bolton once wrote that the wars in Kosovo and Chechnya involved \n``no tangible national interest.'' In the committee hearing, he changed \nhis tune a bit, saying that there was no vital national interest in the \nBalkans.\n  Nonetheless, I am concerned that Mr. Bolton's consistent criticism of \nthe NATO action in Kosovo indicates a lack of commitment to the \nstability of Southeastern Europe--a position I find unacceptable for \nthe person who would supervise security assistance programs to the \nregion.\n  I am concerned, finally, about Mr. Bolton's diplomatic temperament \nfor this position, which involves the management of complex \nnegotiations in a wide range of arms control and non-proliferation \nissues. Stated another way: It takes the patience of Job. I am not sure \nhow good I would be in the position. These are sensitive and difficult \nnegotiations. Mr. Bolton's penchant for inflammatory rhetoric gives me \npause about his ability to handle this task.\n  Following defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Mr. Bolton \nheaped scorn on proponents of the Treaty--I don't take that \npersonally--who expressed concerns that its defeat marked an \nisolationist turn for the United States and might lead to accelerated \nnuclear proliferation.\n  He wrote that such fears are ``indications of a profoundly misguided \nand potentially dangerous philosophy in American foreign policy,'' and \nsaid that such analysis is ``timid and neo-pacifist.'' He has a right \nto say that, but it is not the language of or temperament of people who \nhave been in that position. Well, this senator expressed those fears, \nas did some of my colleagues.\n  Mr. Bolton once said that ``Republicans are adults on foreign policy \nquestions, and we define what we're willing to do militarily and \npolitically by what is in the best interests of the United States.'' Is \nhe seriously implying that Democrats are not adults on foreign policy \nquestions and do not worry about the best interests of the United \nStates?\n  What does that suggest about his ability to work with Democratic \nSenators?\n  This kind of inflamed rhetoric is what we might expect on talk radio, \nbut we do not expect to hear it in diplomatic rooms of the Department \nof State.\n  I believe Mr. Bolton is a capable person. I respect his intellect and \nhis willingness to serve. But I think he is the wrong person for this \njob.\n  The job of Under Secretary for Arms Control and International \nSecurity is a critical one--its incumbent has the lead responsibility \nin the State Department on arms control and non-proliferation. I do not \nbelieve Mr. Bolton has the vision or the experience necessary for this \nposition.\n  One final thing that concerns me about Mr. Bolton is his lack of \nenthusiasm for the proposal put forward by former Senator Baker, the \nmajority leader, Mr. Cutler, a top lawyer in Democratic \nadministrations, a bipartisan group, saying the most dangerous threat \nwe face is loose nukes in the Soviet Union. They predicted that there \nis an incredibly greater likelihood there would be a nuclear, chemical, \nor biological weapon used in the United States as a consequence of the \ninadequacy of the Russian system protecting those systems than there \nwas from anything else that could happen and suggested a robust \ninvestment in our policy to deal with nonproliferation issues, \nparticularly as they stem from the disorganization combined with the \nincredible array of weaponry lying around Russia.\n  In the questioning, particularly by our colleague from Florida, it \nbecame pretty clear that Mr. Bolton does not share that sense of \nurgency at all. He is in charge of the nonproliferation side, the man \nwho will be advising the Secretary of State.\n  For all those reasons, I reluctantly cast my vote against Mr. Bolton. \nAs I said, we have been on opposite sides of issues, he and I, for a \nlong time. When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he was the \nmain man pushing nominations for the Administration. We were butting \nheads all the time. I learned to respect his intelligence, I learned to \nrespect his drive, and I learned to respect how tough he was. It is not \nthat I don't know Mr. Bolton. I know him in that capacity. This is a \ndifferent capacity. It requires a different temperament and a different \nattitude in order to promote what I believe to be the single most \nimportant job for someone carrying this portfolio within the State \nDepartment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no, although I must tell the Senate, I \nhave done no whipping. I have not checked in terms of who is where on \nany of these votes. I want to make it clear why I am voting no on this \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I see my friend and chairman is prepared to speak. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank my distinguished friend, Joe Biden, for the depth \nof his explanation.\n  Mr. President, I feel obliged to say at the outset that of all the \ntalented and well-qualified nominees whom President Bush has selected \nfor senior foreign policy positions in his administration, John Bolton, \nin my judgment, emerges as one of the best and the wisest. He is a \npatriot, a brilliant thinker, and a talented writer. But most \nimportant, John Bolton has the courage of his convictions. He says what \nhe means he means what he says, and he says it well, which is precisely \nwhat is needed at the State Department.\n  Mr. Bolton comes to this position at a crucial time because he will \nconfront many security issues, not the least of which is President \nBush's pledge to build and deploy a missile defense system. Proceeding \nwith that plan will require close consultation with our allies and much \nhand holding with Russia. John Bolton's extensive experience in \nbuilding international support for U.S. positions--remember his service \nas Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations--will \nserve him and the country well.\n  John Bolton comes with high recommendations and endorsements of some \nof the Nation's most distinguished foreign policy experts. Four former \nDirectors of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency have written to \nendorse John Bolton. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I also have at hand a letter written and signed by former \nSecretaries of State Henry Kissinger, Jim Baker, and Larry Eagleburger, \namong others, urging John Bolton's confirmation by the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We support the nomination of John Bolton \n     to serve as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \n     International Security, and hope that the Senate will move \n     rapidly to confirm him for that position. John is \n     knowledgeable, intelligent, experienced, and is clearly well \n     qualified. In prior government positions as Assistant \n     Secretary of State and Assistant Attorney General, he has \n     acquitted himself well and served our country admirably. He \n     will do no less as Under Secretary for Arms Control.\n       We are strong supporters of the proposition that a \n     President should have the right to choose his senior advisors \n     and is entitled to surround himself with those who share his \n     beliefs. We well understand that some may not agree with the \n     President's position on various matters or with certain views \n     that John has expressed over the years. But we must observe \n     that all Administration appointees are expected to advocate \n     the policies of the President, regardless of their own \n     personal views.\n       John has been a thoughtful scholar and also a prolific \n     writer, and contributed significantly to our national-\n     security policy debate. We, ourselves, are periodic \n     contributors to newspapers and journals. Such writing affords \n     authors a precious opportunity to take strong positions on \n     issues, and to promote an open and free discussion with other \n     scholars and practitioners. If anything we need more such \n     debate, and more original analysts in government, not fewer. \n     Neither this President nor future Presidents should be \n     deprived of the services of men and\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\n     women of conviction, who are prepared to test their views in \n     the marketplace of ideas.\n       We believe it essential for the Senate to conform rapidly \n     the President's national security team. There is much \n     important work to be done, and we believe that the nation is \n     best served by an Administration that is fully staffed as \n     soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         David Abshire, James A. Baker III, Richard Allen, Frank \n           Carlucci, Lawrence Eagleburger, Henry A. Kissinger, \n           Caspar Weinberger, Max M. Kampelman, Helmut \n           Sonnenfeldt, James Woolsey.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, isn't it significant that so many of our \nNation's leading and senior foreign policy experts declare in writing \nand otherwise that John Bolton is eminently qualified for the \nresponsibilities for which the President has nominated him? Of course, \nthe issue is not Mr. Bolton's arms control expertise. The issue here is \nthat some Senators oppose President Bush's policy on various matters \nand particularly the one involving missile defense. I also suspect that \nthere are some Senators who just don't like the fact that the \nadministration has put forward the nomination of a fine American who \nwill very capably implement President George Bush's policy.\n  The distinguished ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, who is my friend and with whom I work closely \nand pleasantly, put it honestly and forthrightly when he said to John \nBolton during John's nomination hearing:\n\n       This is not about your competence. My problem with you over \n     the years has been that you are too competent. I would rather \n     that you be stupid and not very effective.\n\n  Neither of which, I say to my distinguished colleague, John Bolton \nwill ever, ever be.\n  I respectfully suggest that Senators should not be in the business of \nrejecting nominees because they are too competent for the job, but I \ncommend Senator Biden for his clarity and honesty, as always.\n  I understand the opposition of some Senators to various \nadministration policies, but I do hope my colleagues will give careful \nconsideration to the views of the Anti-Defamation League and other \nnonprofit organizations which have written their support for John \nBolton's nomination.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that letters, such as the letter from \nthe Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, which can \nhardly be regarded as conservative organizations, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Anti-Defamation League\n\n\n                                              of B'nai B'rith,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We are writing in support of the \n     nomination of John Bolton as Undersecretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security.\n       During his tenure as Assistant Secretary of state for \n     International Organizations, Mr. Bolton played a leading role \n     in the successful 1991 US effort to repeal the infamous \n     ``Zionism-is-racism'' resolution.\n       While there may be some policy areas where we will differ, \n     John Bolton has demonstrated both the commitment and \n     integrity to advance United States interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Abraham H. Foxman,\n     National Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The Cuban American\n\n\n                                          National Foundation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 450 Dirksen \n         SOB, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I would like to offer my strongest \n     possible endorsement on behalf of John Bolton for \n     Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International \n     Security Affairs.\n       Over the years, Mr. Bolton has been a champion of freedom \n     worldwide and a passionate defender of U.S. interests around \n     the globe. His past experience in senior-level positions at \n     the State and Justice Departments, AID, and the International \n     Religious Freedom Commission make him uniquely qualified for \n     such an important position.\n       In the case of Cuba, Mr. Bolton has consistently revealed a \n     keen understanding of the true nature of the Castro regime \n     and has forcefully rejected the current siren song that U.S. \n     trade will magically moderate the Cuban dictator's behavior.\n       His nomination is of particular interest to us in several \n     other ways as well. Sober analysts talk of the continuing \n     international security threat Castro's Cuba poses to U.S. \n     interests, specifically in the non-conventional \n     ``asymmetrical'' sphere. For many years, we have been \n     concerned with Castro's involvement in the development of \n     chemical and biological weapons. This is of particular \n     interest to us as residents of South Florida, where we are \n     within easy reach of Castro's capabilities to cause great \n     harm.\n       We are also increasingly troubled by the growing presence \n     of Communist China in Cuba. It is quite obvious that China is \n     developing that presence to use as leverage against the U.S. \n     in its support for democratic Taiwan, as well as to serve as \n     a strategic base to make diplomatic and intelligence inroads \n     all over this hemisphere.\n       These troubling developments demand a man like John Bolton, \n     a man who sees the world as it really is rather than the way \n     he wishes it to be. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reiterate \n     our strongest support for John Bolton, not only for the \n     benefit of the freedom-seeking people of Cuba and their \n     supporters but also for the benefit for the United States of \n     America as a whole.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        Jorge Mas,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   April 13, 2001.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, S-230, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I'm writing in support of the nomination \n     of John Bolton as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control \n     and International Security.\n       As Executive Vice President of B'nai B'rith, my \n     organization and I remain grateful to Mr. Bolton, for his \n     tireless efforts to seek repeal of the infamous Zionism-\n     Racism resolution at the United Nations, during his tenure as \n     Assistant Secretary for International Organization Affairs.\n       Supporters of Israel often look at the U.N. with a \n     jaundiced eye, given the harsh, discriminatory treatment that \n     country has been subject to over a period of more than five \n     decades. Nevertheless, many of us understand the important \n     role that organization can play, once reformed and freed from \n     the hypocrisy that the Zionism-Racism resolution represented.\n       We speak as an organization that was invited to San \n     Francisco to participate in the founding of the U.N. in 1945, \n     and which, since the late fifties, has maintained a full time \n     U.N./NGO office in New York, and which is represented at U.N. \n     bodies in Paris, Geneva, Vienna and Santiago.\n       I urge the Senate's expeditious support for Mr. Bolton's \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel S. Mariaschin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Jewish Institute for\n\n\n                                    National Security Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: It is my pleasure to write you in \n     support of the confirmation of John Bolton as Under Secretary \n     of Arms Control and International Security. Mr. Bolton is \n     greatly admired and respected for his outspoken advocacy of \n     American interests in foreign affairs. As Assistant Secretary \n     for International Organizations, John was respected and well \n     regarded. His resume, as I know you are aware, is highly \n     impressive, but not as impressive as the man it represents.\n       We believe that Mr. Bolton will be a tremendous asset to \n     the Bush administration. He is dedicated and talented, and \n     his confirmation will enhance American diplomacy.\n       JINSA is a non-profit non-partisan organization with over \n     20,000 members throughout the United States who are committed \n     to a strong National U.S. Security. We have representatives \n     from all sectors of the community including over 200 American \n     Admirals and Generals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Neumann.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The American Jewish Committee,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my support for the \n     Honorable John R. Bolton, who has been nominated to serve our \n     country as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \n     International Security Affairs.\n       It was my privilege to have worked closely with Mr. Bolton \n     from 1989 to 1993, when he served in the Bush Administration \n     as Assistant Secretary of State for International \n     Organization Affairs.\n       We shared a strong interest in the United Nations and a \n     profound concern that, as a result of the actions of some \n     member states, the world body was being diverted from its \n     central mission.\n       In the same spirit, Mr. Bolton believed that the adoption, \n     in 1975, by the United Nations General Assembly of Resolution \n     3379, the odious resolution equating Zionism with racism, was \n     a stain on the institution itself that could not be left \n     standing, even though the repeal of resolutions was \n     essentially unheard of in the annals of the U.N.\n       To the everlasting credit of Mr. Bolton, he spearheaded a \n     successful American-led effort to repeal Resolution 3379. It \n     took years of patient planning, extraordinary persistence, \n     and remarkable diplomatic savoir-faire, and it was finally \n     accomplished in 1991. The lion's share of the credit for this \n     political\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\n     and moral triumph goes to Mr. Bolton. As a result of his \n     efforts, to many of us who care deeply about the integrity of \n     the United Nations he has achieved legendary status.\n       I have stayed in touch with Mr. Bolton since he left \n     government service. Indeed, we have worked collaboratively \n     under the auspices of United Nations Watch, a non-profit \n     watchdog agency established by the late Ambassador Morris B. \n     Abram, who served the United States with distinction under \n     five American presidents. At UN Watch, Mr. Bolton, who has \n     been an active board member, has once again demonstrated his \n     passionate commitment to a fair and just United Nations and \n     to a strong and effective American leadership role in \n     international affairs.\n       From my experience, I can say without hesitation that Mr. \n     Bolton is an individual of keen intellect with a profound \n     understanding of foreign policy, strong principles, and deep \n     commitment to advancement of democracy and human rights.\n       I wish to thank you for your consideration of these views. \n     Should you require any additional information, please do not \n     hesitate to be in touch.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  David A. Harris.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, these groups support John Bolton because of \nhis political views, because of his political expertise, and because \nof, yes, his personal moral principles.\n  John Bolton is precisely the kind of citizen the United States \ndesperately needs in this difficult time to have an important role in \nthe protection of the American people from the threat of missile \nattack. This man is a thoughtful scholar and an accomplished diplomat \nand an honest and decent man. I urge that the Senate confirm his \nnomination without further delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, SD-450, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are pleased that you have scheduled a \n     hearing date on President Bush's nomination of John Bolton to \n     serve as Under Secretary for Arms Control and International \n     Security. We strongly support the President's selection of \n     John Bolton for this important position.\n       As former Directors of the Arms Control and Disarmament \n     Agency, we believe John Bolton is eminently qualified to \n     serve as Under Secretary. He brings a wealth of knowledge to \n     the position as an expert in international law and a great \n     deal of relevant practical experience as a former Assistant \n     Secretary of State for International Organizations.\n       He has acquired a great deal of experience with \n     multinational organizations which have gained in importance \n     for arms control and disarmament, relative to the bilateral \n     forums that dominated the evolution of arms control during \n     the Cold War. Also, he is well suited to work with regional \n     organizations that are pursuing arms control agendas, such as \n     the Organization of American States (which deals with the \n     convention on illicit weapons trafficking). His prior \n     services as Assistant Secretary of State also acquainted him \n     with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the then \n     emerging structure of the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons.\n       As an experienced international lawyer, John Bolton is \n     superbly qualified to guide the US participation in the \n     negotiations of complex international treaties and in making \n     best use of these treaties for the intended arms control \n     purposes. This is of key importance for the continuing \n     struggle to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and to deal with the current proliferation \n     problems regarding Iraq, North Korea, Iran, and other \n     nations.\n       Iraq may well be the most difficult case at this time. It \n     is a fortunate coincidence that John Bolton was deeply \n     involved in the formation of UNSCOM and the adoption of UN \n     Security Council Resolutions designed to reveres Saddam's \n     weapons programs. This expertise is greatly needed now as the \n     Bush Administration seeks to restore the badly eroded \n     international support for maintaining sanctions.\n       Mr. Chairman, we can recommend John Bolton to the Committee \n     without reservation. He has a thorough knowledge of the most \n     pressing arms control and nonproliferation issues of the day, \n     and we hope that the Foreign Relations Committee will \n     unanimously support his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kennth L. Adelman,\n     Fred C. Ikle,\n       Distinguished Scholar, Center for Strategic & International \n     Studies.\n     Ronald F. Lehman,\n       Center for Global Security Research, Lawrence Livermore \n     Laboratory.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                John D. Holum,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, April 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms, Chairman,\n     Hon. Joe Biden, Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Helms and Biden: I know that the Committee is \n     considering President Bush's nomination of John R. Bolton to \n     be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \n     International Security, the position I held during the latter \n     days of the Clinton Administration. I congratulate you for \n     having conducted timely hearings on his nomination. I hope \n     the Committee will also move expeditiously to a vote, and not \n     allow the confirmation to be delayed over matters unrelated \n     to Mr. Bolton's fitness for office and qualifications for \n     this assignment.\n       No doubt Mr. Bolton and I will find many areas of \n     substantive disagreement. However, the most relevant point \n     bearing on his confirmation is that he has the confidence of \n     the President of the United States and the Secretary of \n     State. Moreover, he has been nominated for a position with \n     vital responsibilities bearing on our national security, \n     including advancing our efforts against the spread of weapons \n     of mass destruction, leadership in formulating and \n     articulating U.S. arms control policy, assessing compliance \n     with arms control agreements, and overseeing security \n     assistance and munitions exports controls. He also faces the \n     task of fulfilling the potential of our reorganization of the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the Department of \n     State, and keeping arms control and nonproliferation central \n     to the Department's mission.\n       So long as the Under Secretary position is not filled, the \n     Department's capacity in these areas will be diminished, and \n     the Administration's ability to advance U.S. interests in the \n     world, including in the vast majority of matters on which we \n     can all agree, will be lessened. Therefore, I strongly \n     encourage the Committee and the full Senate to act without \n     delay on John Bolton's nomination.\n       With thanks for your consideration, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Holum.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Bolton nomination.\n  Mr. HELMS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they have not.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  All time has expired. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of John Robert Bolton, of Maryland, to be \nUnder Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security? \nOn this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 92 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is a joke to agree to 10-\nminute votes, and then forget about them, and go on and have 20 \nminutes, or 25 minutes, or 37 minutes, as was the case in the previous \nvote.\n  Now, I am not going to object in this case.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to extend programs and activities under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Jeffords amendment No. 358, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Craig amendment No. 372 (to amendment No. 358), to tie \n     funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 to improved student performance.\n       Kennedy modified amendment No. 375 (to amendment No. 358), \n     to express the sense of the Senate regarding, and to \n     authorize appropriations for title II, part A, of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, with respect \n     to the development of high-qualified teachers.\n       Kennedy (for Murray) amendment No. 378 (to amendment No. \n     358), to provide for class size reduction programs.\n       Kennedy (for Mikulski/Kennedy) amendment No. 379 (to \n     amendment No. 358), to provide for the establishment of \n     community technology centers.\n       Allen/Warner amendment No. 380 (to amendment No. 358), to \n     provide for a sense of the Senate regarding education \n     opportunity tax relief to enable the purchase of technology \n     and tutorial services for K-12 education purposes.\n       Kennedy (for Dodd) amendment No. 382 (to amendment No. \n     358), to remove the 21st century community learning center \n     program from the list of programs covered by performance \n     agreements.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 372\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nCraig amendment.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I assume we are now proceeding on the Craig \namendment, with 1 minute for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support the \namendment I have put before the Chamber. It does not cut a program. It \ndoes not even take out the cost of living or an annualized increase \nbased on that. What it says is that the Federal Government and the \nDepartment of Education and educational programs will no longer reward \nmediocrity.\n  In title I, over the last 30 years, we have put in $120 billion and \npoor kids are still lower in achievement than middle-income kids who \nare outside the program. It failed. In this education bill before us, \nwe are trying to change that.\n  All I am saying is, if you do not measure up, and if the States do \nnot improve the environment in which kids are learning--in other words, \nif kids do not improve--and it is measured by the tests and the \nstandards within this bill--then no more Federal money goes out. In \nother words, we will not continue to fund mediocrity. We will set a \nstandard and a precedence where improvement in our young people means \nwe will reward that improvement with the use of the Federal tax \ndollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope the Craig amendment will be \ndefeated. This is really putting the cart before the horse. If you \nadopt the Craig amendment, you are effectively saying there will not be \nany funding at all for the development of quality testing and \naccountability systems.\n  President Bush has proposed a three-fold increase in three times the \namount of reading funding. That will not be available for children if \nthe Craig amendment is adopted. Effectively, this amendment undermines \nwhat President Bush has stated are his goals in terms of trying to get \nincreased accountability, better testing, and increased support for \neducation. That will all be prohibited under the Craig amendment.\n  What we are trying to do is match resources to responsibility. That \nis the change in this whole bill. We are matching those two concepts. \nAnd that makes sense. But under the Craig amendment, you will be \ndenying the President's program in increased reading and the \nPresident's program in terms of accountability. It puts the cart before \nthe horse and makes no sense. I hope it will be defeated.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support what the distinguished Senator is \ntrying to accomplish. I think it is about time we let the States know \nthey are going to have to do better; that they are going to have to \nmeasure up. I cannot, however, coming from a poor State, summarily cut \nthis off. When I use the word ``summarily,'' I realize we have had 35, \n36 years in which to accomplish these things. But I do think they ought \nto be warned ahead of time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. This Senator's amendment would not cut any program. It \nwould allow continued funding at that level. It does not reward by \nallowing the increases in the spending. That is what is important. The \nSenator from Massachusetts mentioned that nothing would go forward. He \nis wrong. Everything goes forward, and the measurements are in place.\n  What we are saying is, we are strong and definitive in saying that if \nyou do not improve, you do not get the additional money.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at some future time, I may support what this \namendment is trying to accomplish. I think that we should have more \naccountability by the states. I also believe that we may need to \nreevaluate how Title I funds are used in the states. That being said, I \ndo not think that this amendment is the proper way to tie funding to \nachievement. I represent a low-income state where Title I funds make up \n$76.5 million of the money spent on education. By threatening to freeze \nfunding until the schools improve, I fear we may be taking away the \nvery tools necessary to achieve the improvement that we all seek both \nin our schools and our students. I like what the Senator is saying, but \nI am going to vote against his amendment at this time. Basically, I \nhave not heard enough of this debate. And this is one thing that is \nwrong. Let me underline that. This is one thing that is wrong with the \nstacking of the amendments.\n  I have already stated my opposition to the stacking of the \namendments.\n  Sometimes there is justification for stacking votes, and sometimes I \nwill not object to it. But in the future, I am going to object more \nthan I have in the past. It is demeaning to the Senator who offers the \namendment. It is demeaning to the amendment itself to be limited to 2 \nminutes before we vote on it. And it is demeaning to the Senate.\n  When it comes to stacking votes so as to allow Senators to be away on \na Monday or be away on Fridays, I am going to be hard to get along with \nin that regard. I hope that what I am saying will let every Senator \nknow that in the future I will frequently object to the stacking of \nvotes. This is a bad way to legislate.\n  This particular amendment ought to have more debate than it is \ngetting. It may have had some debate--I don't know--on Friday. I am not \nsure. I had to take my wife on Friday to a pulmonary expert. I couldn't \nbe here. But other Senators weren't here either. It is demeaning to \ncome out here and offer an amendment on Friday with a shirttailful of \nSenators present, maybe two, maybe three, and few press people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the very important features of \nthis legislation is upgrading the skills of unqualified teachers who \nare teaching poor children and also making sure that new recruits are \ngoing to be qualified teachers.\n  This legislation guarantees schools that have 50 percent poor \nchildren will have a qualified teacher in every classroom in 4 years.\n  This amendment says that we should fully fund the $3 billion which is \nin the authorization to make sure all the teachers who are going to be \nteaching poor children are qualified. It says we ought to add $500 \nmillion each additional year, so that in the last year there will be a \ntotal of $6 billion a year in funding, necessary to provide continued \nprofessional development to every techer, every year in a high poverty \nclassroom.\n  There are 1,500,000 teachers who teach poor children; 750,000 are \nunqualified today. This amendment will ensure that we continually \nupgrade the skills of every one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask for the regular order on this \npending Allen amendment No. 380.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want the Senate to know that I voted twice \non the previous vote. I was standing here by Mr. Kennedy when I raised \nmy hand, which I usually do. I was not behind my desk, as I usually am.\n  I am not complaining about anything. I am not criticizing anybody. I \njust want the Senate to know that I voted. Normally, I do not hold up \nthe Senate.\n  I thank the Senate. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the pending \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 380) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank all of our Members for their presence and for \ntheir cooperation.\n  We now have the Senator from Washington on an extremely important\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\namendment. We hope the Senate will give careful attention to this \namendment. This is one of the most important amendments we will have to \nthis legislation. I am enormously grateful to the Senator from \nWashington for her leadership on smaller class size. I am sure she was \nreassured again today when we read the front page of the Washington \nPost and saw what was happening in Prince George's County. The test \nscores show the best gains.\n  When the local Superintendent of schools was asked about the factors \nthat were most important in making progress, she quickly indicated that \nsmaller class size in the early grades was one of the most important \naspects leading to the children's progress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record after Senator Murray's remarks.\n  Senator Warner spoke to me and would like to join me in that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 378\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 378.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now the regular order.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his work on \nclass size, too. I saw the article in the Washington Post today. It \nshows that the debate we are about to have on the class size amendment \nis extremely critical. We know it makes a difference in our children's \nclassrooms. We have had tremendous progress.\n  I hope that our colleagues will listen carefully to the debate as we \nbring it forward because it is an important part of education. It is \nwhat parents are looking for. It is what we are demanding of our \nstudents--achievement.\n  I appreciate the words of the Senator from Massachusetts, and I look \nforward to the debate we are about to have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors to my amendment: Senators Baucus, Biden, Bingaman, \nClinton, Corzine, Dodd, Feingold, Harkin, Kennedy, Reed of Rhode \nIsland, and Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, right now in classrooms across our \ncountry students are gathering. Right now teachers are beginning his or \nher lesson, and those students in that classroom probably do not know \nthe specifics of the debate that we are about to have. They probably \nare not familiar with the amendment I am about to offer. But I will \npromise you one thing. Those students will realize the impact of how \nthe Senate votes on this class size amendment.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment to continue the progress we have \nmade over the last 3 years in making classrooms across the country less \ncrowded and more productive. My amendment will ensure that we keep our \ncommitment to help local school districts hire 100,000 new teachers so \nthat students can get the time and the attention they need and deserve \nin our classrooms.\n  We know that smaller classes help kids learn the basics with fewer \ndiscipline problems.\n  Just this year we also learned that smaller classes resulted in \nbetter scores on standardized tests and a higher likelihood of taking \ncollege entrance exams and a lower teen pregnancy rate.\n  As managers of the taxpayer dollars, we should invest in ideas that \nwork. We know that smaller classes help our students learn.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill combines funding for class size \nreduction and teacher quality into one pool. As a result, local school \ndistricts would have to choose, under this bill, between providing \nsmaller classes or funding teacher quality. They shouldn't have to \nchoose one or the other. We should fund both. It has always been \nimportant to invest in the things that work in the classroom. This year \nit is even more important as I look at the rest of the underlying bill.\n\n  Since President Bush plans to punish schools that do not improve, we \nhave to make sure that schools have the proven tools they need, such as \nsmaller classes, to help our children learn.\n  Before I continue, I want to share a personal reflection about what \nwe are doing on education this month. As we update the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we are creating a blueprint of how we are \ngoing to support excellence in schools across the country.\n  As a parent and as a former educator, I cannot imagine smaller \nclasses not being a part of that blueprint. It just does not make \nsense. Right now, this bill leaves behind targeted funding for smaller \nclasses. My amendment corrects that failure and tells students, \nteachers, and parents across the country that we know they are \nconcerned about overcrowded classrooms, we know they want help in \nhiring new teachers, and we are going to honor our responsibility to \npay for them.\n  I want to talk this morning about the difference that smaller classes \ncan make according to research and according to parents and teachers. \nWe know that too many classes are overcrowded with growing enrollment \nand limited space. Too many students are trying to learn in classrooms \nthat are packed to capacity, where they have to fight just to get a \nteacher's attention. And too many teachers are spending time on crowd \ncontrol instead of spending time on curriculum.\n  Over the years, major studies have found that smaller classes boost \nstudent achievement. The STAR study found that students in small \nclasses--those with 13 to 17 students--significantly outperform other \nstudents in math and reading. It also found that students in small \nclasses have better high school graduation rates, higher grade point \naverages, and they are more inclined to pursue higher education. \nCertainly those are goals. Every one of us in the Senate Chamber has \nstated that we want that for our children in our school systems in this \ncountry.\n  Another critical study, the Wisconsin SAGE study, consistently proved \nthat smaller classes result in significantly greater student \nachievement.\n  Just two months ago, in March, we got more good news. Dr. Alan \nKrueger of Princeton University found there are long-term social \nbenefits of being in a smaller classroom, including better scores on \nstandardized tests, a higher propensity to take college entrance exams, \na lower teen pregnancy rate, and possibly a lower crime rate for teens.\n  Those are the types of benefits we want for every one of our \nstudents. But you do not need research to know that smaller classes \nhelp. Just talk to parents or teachers or talk to the students \nthemselves.\n  I have been in classrooms where this funding has reduced \novercrowding. It makes a difference. I recently received an e-mail from \nKristi Rennebohm Franz. Kristi teaches at Sunnyside Elementary School. \nI also should mention that Kristi is one of our best educators. She \nreceived a Milken National Teacher's Award. She received the \nPresidential Award for Excellence in Teaching Elementary Science, and \nthe Peace Corps World Wise Schools Paul D. Coverdell Award for \nExcellence in Education. Those are some of Kristi's credentials.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her entire letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 10 years ago, when Kristi started as a \nteacher, she promised herself that she would take time each day to \nlisten to her students and to understand their needs. Kristi writes to \nme now:\n\n       It is a promise that can only come true if we have small \n     enough classes with enough qualified teachers in place to \n     meet the individual learning needs of each child. . . .\n\n  She continues:\n\n       . . . because of the sheer numbers of children in our \n     classroom, it is not humanly possible to have the educational \n     conversations I need and want to have with each child to best \n     assess their understandings, struggles, challenges, and \n     progress that can inform where the next day's learning needs \n     to go.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I can't tell you how frustrating it is to know how to teach \n     and not be able to do the very best teaching every moment \n     because it is difficult with too large a class and without \n     enough teachers on board as a team to meet the learning needs \n     of the children.\n\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, let's show Kristi and thousands of hard-working \nteachers that we do support them and want them to be able to do their \nbest in uncrowded classrooms.\n  I have talked about the research, and I have shared a teacher's \nperspective, but I have one more example of the importance of small \nclass sizes. It comes from the Houston Independent School District \nwhere our Education Secretary, Rod Paige, served as their \nsuperintendent.\n  I show my colleagues this chart. It is actually from a presentation \nby the former Chief of Staff for Educational Services in the Houston \ndistrict, Susan Sclafani. By the way, she currently serves as Counselor \nto Secretary Paige at the Education Department.\n  Part of her presentation that I am showing on this chart shows how \nHouston helped turn around low-performing schools. I know we are basing \na lot of this education bill on what happened in Houston at the \ndirective of the President and Dr. Paige. They talk about test scores, \nbut they also are very clear about what made a difference in making \nsure those test scores turned around and that those schools improved.\n  On the chart, you can see that among the seven things they have done \nin the Houston school district was to make classrooms less crowded. \nThey made making classrooms less crowded one of the seven things to be \ndone to improve education. They know it works.\n  In fact, Houston hired 177 new teachers through the Class Size \nReduction Program that we funded at the Federal level. Houston also \nused the funding to provide professional development for more than 600 \nteachers. That is the type of support we want all communities to have.\n  We know that making classes smaller works. The research shows it. \nParents know it. Teachers know it. Even Secretary Paige used smaller \nclasses to make improvements in the Houston school district. There was \nnot a miracle in Houston. There was hard work. And there was investment \nin what works. Class size reduction was one of those investments.\n  We should invest in the things that we know work in the classroom. \nParents want to know that their Federal education dollars are making a \ndifference for students.\n  I served on a local school board. I can tell you that hiring new \nteachers is difficult because you have to commit today for a new \nteacher when you don't know what is going to happen 3 months down the \nroad.\n  That is one of the reasons why many school districts have had a hard \ntime hiring new teachers on their own. Fortunately, they are not all on \ntheir own. Local educators have partners at the State and Federal level \nwho are working together to help all students succeed.\n  That is why in 1998, Congress began the Class Size Reduction \nInitiative. This program sends Federal dollars to school districts \nacross the country so they can hire new, fully qualified teachers in \ngrades K-3.\n  And let me remind my colleagues that this is a voluntary program. No \nschool is forced to use this money. If a district wants help hiring \nteachers to make classrooms less crowded, they simply apply. And there \nis very little paperwork or administration. In fact, in my own State of \nWashington you can apply for this class size reduction money over the \nInternet on a simple, one-page form.\n  Many educators have told me that they have never seen dollars get so \nquickly from Congress to the classroom. Local schools, under this, make \nall the decisions about who to hire based on their unique needs. The \nmoney is also flexible. If schools have already reduced classroom \novercrowding, they can use the money for teacher recruitment or for \nprofessional development. Finally, and critically, these dollars are \ntargeted to disadvantaged students--who can make the most progress when \nthey are in a productive classroom.\n  This program has been a success story for the Congress. Since 1998, \nwe have helped school districts across the country hire 34,000 new \nteachers. Over the past 3 years, we have made classrooms less crowded \nin K-3 and more productive for almost 2 million students. It is a \nprogram that works, and we should not abandon it now. This underlying \nbill does not ensure that this overcrowding will be reduced because it \neliminates the targeted funding for class size reduction.\n  Some say that we should combined funding for teacher quality and \nclass size reduction and just let folks choose. Unfortunately, that is \na false choice, and our kids will pay the price. This bill--the \nunderlying bill--pits effective programs against each other and makes \neducators choose. In the end, our kids will lose if they can't have \nboth smaller classes and qualified teachers. We should be the ones \nmaking sure that happens.\n  Let me repeat that. Smaller classes and qualified teachers go hand in \nhand. Educators should not have to choose between either making classes \nsmaller or improving teacher quality. They need both. We should fund \nboth. That is what this amendment would ensure.\n  Finally, I remind my colleagues that there are real consequences to \nnot providing dedicated class size funding. Without my amendment, this \nbill could put schools in an unwinnable situation with very high \nstakes. The underlying bill will punish schools that do not improve. At \nthe same time, it takes away the very tools they need to improve, and \nthat is just wrong.\n  On the one hand, we are telling students to meet high standards, and \non the other hand this bill takes away the support they need to get \nthere. We can do better than that. If we want our students to succeed \nand we are going to punish those who don't, now is the time to increase \nour investment in smaller class sizes. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  This week we are talking about many different education issues from \naccountability to testing to funding. Right now there is only one \nquestion being asked by each of us as Senators: Do you favor targeted \nfunding to make classrooms less crowded or will you take that targeted \nfunding away from your schools? How you vote on this amendment will \naffect millions of students who are trying to get a good education.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment by voting yes.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 8, 2001]\n\n            Prince George's Test Scores Show Best Gains Ever\n\n\n               34% of County Schools Meet U.S. Benchmark\n\n                         (By Tracey A. Reeves)\n\n       Prince George's County students posted their highest gains \n     ever on a key standardized test used to gauge how local \n     children measure up to their peers nationally, according to \n     results released yesterday.\n       Prince George's has often been criticized for its abysmal \n     test scores and spotty leadership, but its gains on the \n     Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills are the first significant \n     academic increases the county has registered since Iris T. \n     Metts took over as superintendent in 1999.\n       According to the results, 34 percent of county schools had \n     median test scores at or above the national average this \n     school year, compared with 21 percent last year.\n       Of the schools tested, 82, or 63 percent, registered \n     significant gains. Results also show a slight narrowing of \n     the achievement gap between black and white students and \n     between Hispanic and white students, an added boon for school \n     officials who have been struggling for years to close the \n     gap.\n       The improved scores brought a huge sigh of relief for \n     Metts, who acknowledged yesterday that she felt vindicated by \n     the results and empowered to continue her changes.\n       Metts said she hoped that county and state leaders would \n     see the test scores as proof that the county is serious about \n     improving academic achievement and that they would reward it \n     with more funding to reduce class size and repair \n     deteriorating buildings.\n       ``We're not just achieving,'' an elated Metts said at a \n     celebratory news conference announcing the test results. \n     ``We're achieving miraculously.''\n       The mood was indeed upbeat as school officials asembled in \n     Upper Marlboro to learn more about the results and to coax \n     each other on in the effort to improve the school system's \n     rank as the second-worst in the state, behind Baltimore. In \n     the hallways, school system employees flashed wide grins as \n     they toasted the gains with punch. Teachers and their staffs, \n     who had been summoned to county school headquarters for the \n     news conference could hardly contain their applause.\n       Principals hugged their teachers. High-fives were \n     everywhere\n       ``This didn't happen by chance,'' said Leroy Tompkins, head \n     of instruction for county schools. ``We achieved this by \n     focusing on what we needed to do, and it's paid off.''\n       School Board Chairman Kenneth E. Johnson (Mitchellville), \n     who with the rest of the board has accused of not putting the \n     needs of students first, praised the superintendent for\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n     the results and said the board never doubted her ability.\n       ``The board always thought she could bring the system \n     along,'' Johnson said. ``All we need to do now is stay the \n     course.''\n       Even Maryland Schools Superintendent Nancy S. Grasmick said \n     she was encouraged by the results, though she hesitated to \n     classify the scores an all-out success. She is eager to see \n     the results of Maryland School Performance Assessment Program \n     exams, which students are taking this month.\n       ``I expect to see improvements there, too,'' Grasmick said. \n     ``But all of these results will have to be sustained over a \n     two-year period for us to really know what's happening \n     here.''\n       Maryland requires all public school sec-\n     ond-, fourth-, and sixth-graders to take the basic skills \n     exam, which tests ability in math, reading and language arts.\n       Prince George's is the first Maryland county to release its \n     results, in part because it is using the scores to determine \n     whom to recommend for a new summer program established to \n     bring along struggling students.\n       Other school systems are expected to release their test \n     scores in coming weeks.\n       The test is given annually to gauge trends in ability among \n     students. Unlike the MSPAP, which generally measures how well \n     schools are teaching children, the Comprehensive Test of \n     Basic Skills is viewed as more useful to parents because it \n     looks at how students did individually.\n       The basic skills test is also considered useful to teachers \n     because it lets them know what areas to concentrate on and \n     which students need more help.\n       Until this year, Prince George's scores have been low, flat \n     and far from the national norm. School officials attributed \n     the gains to the reforms that Metts has demanded.\n       For example, she has required all schools to give students \n     in the early grades 120 minutes of uninterrupted reading time \n     and 90 minutes of math a day. She has also reduced class \n     sizes in the lower grades, and efforts are underway to remove \n     disruptive students from classrooms. Metts and principals \n     have also put more emphasis on training teachers.\n       Systemwide, Prince George's scores increased at each of the \n     three grade levels and in every content area in the March \n     test. For example, the rate of students scoring above the \n     national average in reading rose from 24 percent last year to \n     36 percent. In math, it more than doubled, from 16.7 percent \n     to 42.4 percent.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                   April 30, 2001.\n       Dear Senator Murray: As the U.S. Congress has its focus on \n     educational programs, I want to take time to thank you for \n     your tireless efforts on behalf of quality education funding \n     for our public schools! As a primary classroom teacher in \n     Washington State, I know first hand the challenges we face in \n     making sure no child is left behind. While the challenges are \n     tremendous, it is a challenge which public school teachers \n     take on day after day, unwilling to give up and unwilling to \n     do anything less that the very best we can and know how to do \n     in each moment we have in the classroom. When I interviewed \n     for my current teaching position ten years ago, one of the \n     comments I made about my goals as a teacher was that it was \n     very, very important that I hear each child's voice at school \n     each day so that each child would know he/she: (1) had \n     multiple opportunities to be listened to and heard; (2) had \n     the opportunity to tell me what he/she understood and what \n     he/she needed help with; and (3) had multiple opportunities \n     to know he/she was greatly valued as a learner and person. \n     That is a promise that needs to be reality in order for no \n     child to be left behind. It is a promise that can only come \n     true if we have small enough classes with enough qualified \n     teachers in place to meet the individual learning needs of \n     each child and to mentor children in meeting the expectations \n     we share for them as teachers, parents, community, state, and \n     country.\n       Each school day, I try to live to that promise . . . and as \n     I come to the end of each day, I know I have come up short . \n     . . because of the sheer numbers of children in our \n     classroom, it is not humanly possible to have the educational \n     conversations I need and want to have with each child to best \n     assess their understandings, struggles, challenges, and \n     progress that can inform where the next day's learning needs \n     to go. In order to best and most effectively and efficiently \n     teach primary children, I need time each day to interact with \n     them as individuals, in small groups and as a cohesive whole \n     class without distractions and interruptions. I need time to \n     build the math, literacy, science and social studies \n     concepts, problem solving and critical thinking skills they \n     need for today's complex and ever dynamically changing world. \n     When I have a large class of primary children with very \n     diverse academic, social and emotional needs and with no \n     additional adult in the classroom to assist children, the \n     importantly needed and valued time to work on learning with \n     children individually and even in small groups or as a \n     cohesive whole class can be lost.\n       Presently, every classroom teacher in my building is well \n     qualified for his/her assignment and has special outstanding \n     abilities. But we can not do the job we know how to do and \n     keep learning new and better ways to teach in response to \n     changing needs and in today's schools, when: (1) the numbers \n     of students in each class makes it impossible to meet the \n     challenges each student faces; (2) the number of adults \n     needed to help provide education is too low; and (3) the \n     energy toll of the teaching day (which requires planning, \n     preparation, reflection, collaboration with colleagues and \n     parents far beyond the time our 8:00 to 3:30 contract time) \n     leaves teachers unable to engage in much needed professional \n     development beyond the needs of the daily classroom \n     instruction. We hear people say that throwing money at the \n     challenges in education won't help, but I don't know how \n     we can provide the number of qualified teachers needed to \n     provide the best education possible for each child without \n     funding those positions, without providing the funding for \n     teaching materials and for safe, healthy learning \n     environments that are needed, and without funding support \n     for teachers to keep learning and growing professionally!\n       During this school year, I received a Milken National \n     Teacher's Award as well as the Presidential Award for \n     Excellence in Teaching Elementary Science, the Peace Corps \n     World Wise Schools Paul D. Coverdell Award for Excellence in \n     Education (which was presented at the U.S. Senate building \n     with comments from Sen. Edward Kennedy and Sen. Christopher \n     Dodd), a national Blue Ribbon Classroom Website Award, and \n     just recently a grant for funding a co-teacher in our \n     classroom for the remaining weeks of the school year to \n     sustain and document our innovative primary curricular \n     program where children are developing the literacy, science, \n     social studies and math skills they need to meet state \n     learning goals through local to global collaborative \n     telecommunications service learning projects. I am \n     continually learning how to teach. I often work 12 hours per \n     school day developing and sustaining our curricular program \n     as well as usually a full weekend day. I often spend recess \n     time with children as well as after school time building team \n     support for a child and communicating with parents. I spend \n     summers reviewing the past school year and preparing for the \n     next. I spend time taking the course work I need to improve \n     my teaching skills and keep my certification updated. That is \n     what it takes to even come close to a goal of leaving no \n     child behind. Yet, even with developing a classroom which is \n     being recognized as outstanding, I feel that I come up short \n     at the end of each day in providing each of the children in \n     my class the full measure of what they need, deserve, and are \n     capable of doing. If only we had been able to have two \n     teachers for this many children all school year, the sky \n     would not even be the limit for what these children could be \n     accomplishing!!! There is no substitute for educational \n     success for all children than critically needed time with an \n     adult to teach them and enable them to soar! And I don't know \n     anyway to insure that those adults are in place each day with \n     needed qualifications without funding!!! There is no \n     substitute for having the funds to prepare qualified teachers \n     and have them in classrooms in great enough numbers so we can \n     do the job of teaching that is needed for today's schools.\n       Almost every public school class today faces challenges of \n     helping children with behavior. Some days, the biggest \n     challenge comes down to making sure each child is safe from \n     harmful physical and verbal hurt by other peers. Large class \n     sizes greatly, exponentially exacerbate these challenges of \n     classroom management to the point of taking away from \n     valuable teaching and learning time. Additionally problems \n     are compounded by not having enough school personnel to \n     assist children facing emotional behavior needs often caused \n     by circumstances not of their fault. Primary grades are the \n     school years with the first opportunities for helpful \n     interventions for children and their families on issues of \n     academic successes and for meeting the emotional needs that \n     affect that success. We know what to do to help. We know how \n     to design learning programs to help children succeed but we \n     simply can't do it unless we have the people we need to \n     implement those programs. I can't tell you how frustrating it \n     is to know how to teach and not be able to do the very best \n     teaching every moment because it is difficult with too large \n     a class and without enough teachers on board as a team to \n     meet the learning needs of the children. People will say \n     to me, ``You are trying to do too much, Kristi, . . . your \n     expectations for what we can do in school are too high'' . \n     . . but, to me, lowering the expectations of what's \n     possible means some children will be left behind and I'm \n     not willing to accept that option. How can we ever \n     possibly be doing too much until we know every child is \n     succeeding to the best of his/her abilities? And wouldn't \n     it be wonderful to be at that place where we say, we have \n     enough of what we need to meet the challenges of educating \n     our children and we are indeed leaving no child behind? I \n     dream of someday hearing that conversation nationally . . \n     . and, until that conversation is truly there, we must do \n     all we can and more just to insure we meet our educational \n     vision and goals for all the children in our country!!!\n       And how can we assess if children are meeting those \n     educational goals and we as teachers are meeting our teaching \n     vision . . .\n       We can administer standardized test to a whole class to \n     measure how students are doing according to a norm and \n     against the skills a particular test identifies as \n     priorities. But, those measurements provide only one form of \n     reference on student learning and, depending on the integrity \n     and quality of a standardized assessment, the test data may \n     or may not be an accurate assessment\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\n     of what students understand. I can't tell you how many times, \n     in working with primary children, I have seen a child's \n     standardized test results communicate an assessment profile \n     that does not provide the full measure of what I have seen \n     that child demonstrate in the classroom learning environment \n     lessons. Performance on an isolated skill assessment with \n     primary children simply cannot document the whole of who they \n     are as learners.\n       Primary children are growing along a developmental \n     continuum where many of the skills and understandings that we \n     need to see in place in these years as indicators of ongoing \n     successful learning are best demonstrated within the context \n     of active learning with the teacher rather than being only \n     demonstrated in individual performance by themselves. Rather \n     than just being able to demonstrate mastery of individual, \n     isolated skill tasks that are assessed in a standardized test \n     without support of a teacher and outside the context of \n     lesson learning . . . many, many of the skills and \n     understandings that we need to have in place in the primary \n     years for ongoing school success are in the category of: \n     Being able to engage in lessons with the teacher; being able \n     to learn when being taught during a lesson; being able to \n     actively think and talk within a teachable moment; and being \n     able to generate a product or comment when asked to \n     contribute and work with the teacher and peers on ideas and \n     work directly with curricular learning materials . . .\n       While I am successfully using the standardized tests that \n     are required in our district and state to provide data on \n     student progress, if I were to rely only on those \n     standardized skills assessments to measure the success of our \n     children in our public schools, I would miss important \n     documentation of learning that is taking place but simply is \n     best revealed in the interactive teaching and learning \n     between the student with his/her teacher and peers. A \n     standardized test, while providing specifically focused \n     insights on a child's progress, is just a moment of time \n     in a child's school learning. This is especially true when \n     assessing primary children. Sometimes, a standardized \n     assessment presents a profile of student learning that \n     shows a child not succeeding when in actuality, he/she has \n     been demonstrating some successes. I have seen a \n     standardized assessment provide data that looks like the \n     child and the teaching is failing when in actuality \n     neither is true. Often, the observation of a child's \n     behaviors when responding to the challenges of an \n     individual standardized test tell me as much about that \n     child's learning strategies and performance as the actual \n     numerical score that child receives. I often make \n     documentation notes on a child's behavior during the \n     process of administering a standardized test. This takes \n     time for individual observations and writing on my part \n     while also devoting energy and focus on the rest of the \n     class . . . which is no easy task but an important one to \n     fully understand and interpret the results of a \n     standardized score.\n       Many of the standardized assessments we are required to do \n     with our primary students require extended, individual, \n     uninterrupted time with each student. After we give the \n     initial instructions, we must time and record their \n     performance. This is especially true of reading assessments \n     as those are done while listening to, recording, timing and \n     notating each child's reading aloud performance (while also \n     keeping track of the rest of the class). Often these \n     assessments can take ten to fifteen minutes per child to \n     implement and additional time to score. While the information \n     from these assessments can be very valuable, you can well \n     imagine the time involved in a school day to do this \n     accurately and reliably with each child when you have a large \n     class of primary children without any other adult assistance \n     in the classroom. In order to do the best possible job on all \n     assessments of student progress, we need to have smaller \n     class sizes.\n       Often, the best insights I have had on children's learning \n     progress have emerged in the process of having a cohesive \n     whole class, small group or individual conversation about \n     important basic skills and concepts we have been working on \n     together and sometimes it comes from listening in on \n     conversations a child is having with a peer as they work on \n     their learning with one another. Those avenues of assessment \n     tell us so much about the successes in children's learning as \n     well as direction for ongoing learning. Those conversations \n     will not happen unless we have small enough classes with \n     enough teachers to hear the voices of what children are \n     learning each school day.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Kristi Rennebohm Franz.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray \namendment and to put a little different focus on the debate.\n  The issue, as I see it, on this amendment is not classroom reduction. \nThe issue is not the virtue of having smaller classrooms. The issue is \nnot whether that is valuable or whether that is desirable. Most would \nsay, of course, a smaller class is better than a bigger class. The \nissue is whether or not those choices and those decisions ought to be \nmade at the local level.\n  The Senator from Washington, who is always very passionate on this \nissue, used Houston as an example. I will use Houston as an example. \nYes, classroom reduction was part of the program. It was part of seven \npoints, a package of seven reforms they emphasized as local reform that \nhelped turn around the Houston school district. I emphasize that \nclassroom reduction was only one part of the whole package. The \ndecisions were made locally, and in addition to class size reduction \nyou also had tutors, planning assistance, and staff development. Those \ndecisions were made locally.\n  The issue is not, do we want smaller classes? Of course, we do. The \nissue is, do we want to continue the Washington-knows-best, top-down \napproach to education, when the whole thrust of this bill is to move \nthe other direction?\n  The thrust of this legislation, supported on both sides of the aisle, \nnegotiated by leaders on both sides of the aisle, is that the plethora \nof Federal programs has not been a productive approach and that we \nshould consolidate those Federal streams of funding. And now along \ncomes an amendment that says: Let's go back to the old way. Let's go \nback in the old direction. Instead of consolidation, let's pull this \nout and let's have this program prescriptive from the Federal level \nwhere we know best, where we are going to tell local educators what \nthey should do.\n  The Senator from Washington said they should not be forced to choose \nand that we should fund both. In fact, in this legislation we do fund \nboth. The Teacher Quality Program is authorized at $3 billion, which is \nan increase over at what the programs are currently funded.\n  So many people argue that when we create larger, more flexible \ngrants, we are trying to decrease funding for these programs. That is \njust not true. The Professional Development Program received $485 \nmillion last year, and the Class Size Reduction Program received $1.6 \nbillion. If my addition is correct, that is $2.05 billion in these two \nprograms. We consolidate them. We combine them and increase the funding \nto $3 billion.\n  Furthermore, the Kennedy amendment, which just passed and which I \nsupported, reaffirmed not only the $3 billion number but then increases \n$1/2 billion a year each year. So it is not a matter of only giving \nlimited resources and you must choose: Do you want class size reduction \nor do you want professional development? We are saying: Here is both, \nbut you decide your priorities locally. Here is the funding for both, \nan increase by 30 percent over what the previous administration put \ninto class size reduction and professional development. The President \nand this Congress have increased that authorized level by 30 percent to \n$3 billion, ensuring an additional $\\1/2\\ billion each year in the \nfuture.\n  We said: Let the local schools, let the States decide the priority. \nIt is not always going to be class size reduction as the highest \npriority. Sometimes it will be professional development. Sometimes it \nwill be mentoring. Sometimes it will be merit pay. Sometimes it will be \ntenure reform. Many times it will be class size reduction. We ensure \nthey will always have the option of spending that money as they see \nbest.\n\n  The issue is not do you want class size reduction. The issue is, do \nyou want real local control? Do you really want them to have the choice \nor do you think we know best?\n  There has been a growing consensus that what we have done for the \nlast 35 years, with Washington creating more programs and making more \nprescriptions, has not been the right approach. There has been a \ngrowing consensus on both sides of the aisle that we need to \nconsolidate. This is a move in the wrong direction, the opposite \ndirection, to pull this out and say: In this area, we know best; you \nmust do class size reduction if you want these funds.\n  Studies by Eric Hanushek, a professor at the University of Rochester, \nshow that teacher quality is the most important factor in a child's \ninstruction. So while class size is very important, even more important \nthan class size is the quality of the teacher in that classroom.\n  Oftentimes professional development is going to be even more valuable \nthan ensuring there are fewer children in the classroom, and we should \nnot make the determination of what is needed locally. This new flexible \ngrant, the\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nTeacher Quality Program, allows States and school districts to continue \nclass size reduction if they choose. They are not mandated to do so.\n  The National Commission on Teaching & America's Future found that \nclass size reduction has the least impact on increasing student \nachievement and that teacher education and teacher quality had the most \nimpact on increasing achievement.\n  One other point: For rural States such as Arkansas, we have many \nschool districts, many times very small school districts. This kind of \nFederal program simply doesn't work. If you calculate what local \nschools in Arkansas get, it is about a third of a teacher per school \ndistrict. For many small school districts, this kind of a program just \ndoesn't work. It is far better to put additional funding in a program \nwith greater flexibility so local school districts will have enough \nresources so they can actually make a difference.\n  While I agree many school districts and many States are going to put \nas priority No. 1 cutting the size of classes, in some areas that is \nnot going to be priority No. 1. We should not make that decision for \nthem and say: The only way you can access these funds is if you spend \nit in this way.\n  I reluctantly oppose the Murray amendment. We are putting \nconsiderable new resources, a 30-percent increase, into this Teacher \nQuality Program, and that will ensure that schools are going to be able \nto make the right kind of choice and the right kind of investment to \nget the best return in academic achievement. The Teacher Quality \nProgram in this bill recognizes that mandates from Washington aren't \nthe way to improve teacher quality. This legislation gives more \nflexibility to States and school districts but holds them accountable \nfor teacher quality and, most importantly, student achievement.\n  I underscore again that this amendment is counter to the entire \nthrust of this education reform legislation. We should not make the \nmistake of returning to the past and reducing again the very important \nflexibility and decisionmaking authority that should reside at the \nlocal level.\n  So while I know this amendment is well intended, it is really counter \nto the kind of reform that will result in greater student achievement \nand improved education across this country, and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in opposing the Murray amendment and staying consistent \nwith a desire to consolidate and provide greater flexibility, with \nmeaningful accountability, and thus keep our focus upon the children \nand their educational future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I associate myself with a number of the \npoints made by my friend from Arkansas. Clearly, what we are attempting \nto do is to put the emphasis on what works and to provide to our \nchildren the opportunity to have the best possible education.\n  I have been very privileged over the last 20 years to know quite a \nbit about education in Arkansas, which my good friend has the privilege \nof representing, and now I know a lot about education in New York. I \nhave no doubt that my friend, were he still here, would agree with me \nthat our goals are the same for the children in both States. We want to \nprovide the best possible educational opportunities, but we face very \ndifferent challenges.\n  What I saw and worked on for many years in improving education in \nArkansas, which was one of the great honors of my life, is very \ndifferent from what I now see day in and day out in New York City, \nwhere we have more than a million children in our school system.\n  I agree with my friend that what we are crafting is an approach that \nwill give to local school districts, parents, and teachers the tools to \nmake the right decisions for the children whose futures they hold in \ntheir hands. That is why I wish my friend were still here--and I will \nseek him out later to talk with him privately about this.\n  That is why I am such a strong supporter of Senator Murray's \namendment because what Senator Murray has done is point out very \nclearly that one size does not fit all; that what we need to do is \nprovide the tools that will enable each school district in each State \nto deal with the problems they face.\n\n  So I want to be part of passing legislation, in a bipartisan way, \nthat will be the best for Arkansas, the best for Washington, the best \nfor Vermont, and the best for New York because we will have honestly \nlooked at all the different tools we need to provide our local \neducational authorities with in order that they can do the job we are \nnow asking them to do their very best in achieving.\n  So I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment and to stand \nwith my colleague in stating my commitment to supporting the Class Size \nReduction Initiative, both because it is voluntary and provides \nadditional funding to schools that are in desperate need of such \nfunding and, maybe most important, because we know it works.\n  I went back and reread President Bush's blueprint for education \ncalled ``No Child Left Behind.'' In it, he expresses dismay that over \nthe years Congress has developed programs without asking whether or not \nprograms produce results or even knowing the impact on local needs. \nLater on, the President goes on to suggest that under his education \nplan, which is really the core of what we are debating in this \neducation debate, he will focus on what works and ensure that Federal \ndollars will be spent on effective, research-based programs and \npractices and that the funds will be targeted to improve schools and \nenhance teacher quality. That is certainly what the committee on which \nI am proud to serve, under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont, \nattempted to do in reporting out such a bill--to focus on what works \nand to target funds to improve our schools and enhance teacher quality. \nPresident Bush and I absolutely agree on this point.\n  I have often said that I sometimes fear Washington is an evidence-\nfree zone where, despite whatever evidence we have, we don't follow it, \nwe don't put it to work, and we spin our wheels too much. Well, I \nbelieve we should look at what works, what has had a positive impact in \nraising student achievement, what has helped at the local level give \nvery necessary resources; there is no better example of what works than \nreducing class sizes so that teachers can teach and children can learn.\n  Allow me just a moment to review the research demonstrating that \nreducing class size has proven results. Teachers who teach in classes \nof 18 students or fewer in the early grades are helping to raise \nstudent achievement for our most educationally disadvantaged students \nwho are attending schools in high-poverty neighborhoods, where we all \nknow it is harder to teach.\n  Senator Murray was a teacher. She was on a school board. I don't \nthink any of us should kid ourselves; there are some school districts \nand some schools where it is just hard to teach, where children come to \nschool with all kinds of challenges and difficulties. We know, as we \nlook at the research done, that if we focus on getting that class size \ndown with a qualified teacher--this should not be an either/or; it \nshould be a qualified teacher and a small enough class size--then we \ncan have very positive results.\n  I particularly point to the work Senator Murray and I highlighted in \na press conference a few weeks ago that was done at Princeton \nUniversity by an economist named Dr. Alan Krueger, who tracked the \nperformance of well over 11,000 elementary school students at 79 \nschools in a Tennessee pilot program known as Project STAR. This was \ndone randomly. The results are scientifically provable. What he found, \nand what everyone who has studied it has found, is that smaller class \nsizes have a tremendously positive impact on student performance and, \nparticularly, on African American students.\n\n  We want to be supporting both excellence and equity. That is why I \nsupport accountability. I think we should know what our children know \nand what they don't know. I also believe everyone in this Chamber \nunderstands that we have to do more to increase the opportunity for \nexcellence by focusing on the students who are most likely to be left \nbehind. To me, the fact that African American students have such \npositive results from lower class size is a very strong argument for us \nrenewing this commitment.\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n  There are other studies which have found exactly the same thing. A \nRand study--and Rand usually studies issues such as the military and \ndefense and national security--focused on cost-effectiveness of \neducational resources in raising scores on the NAEP, the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress. It is a test that is given to a \nrandomly selected group of our students across the country. We use it \nto track how well we are doing as a nation.\n  What Rand found in looking behind these test scores was that the \nhigher scores could be traced to investments in lower class sizes in \nthe early grades--plus, higher prekindergarten participation, lower \nteacher turnover, and higher levels of teacher resources. So it is that \ncomplement of cost-effective strategies that I think we should be \nsupporting in this legislation.\n  Later in the debate, I will focus on the importance of supporting \nearly learning opportunities and trying to retain our teachers because \nwe are losing our teachers at an alarming rate. I brought this photo of \nP.S. 19 in Jackson Heights, Queens, which is one of the magnets for \nimmigration into our country. People come to Kennedy or LaGuardia \nAirports and they end up in Queens. I wish I could take every Member of \nthis body to the schools I visit in Queens where bathrooms are classes, \nhallways are classes, and where children speak 40 to 100 different \nlanguages, where they are packed in there and where a teacher, despite \nher best efforts, can't possibly connect with all these children.\n  Yesterday, I was in a school that works in Manhattan, the New \nManhattan School. It is a wonderful school. I met for a long time with \nthe teachers, the principal, and the superintendent of the district. It \nis an old building, built in 1904. It is packed to the rafters. They \nare adding teachers into classrooms so if they do not have the \nadditional classrooms, at least they have more qualified teachers in \nthose classes so the children get the attention of the adult \nresponsible for their learning.\n\n  It is important we understand there have to be opportunities for \nlocal communities to make choices. I believe having this tool is \nessential for providing good opportunities for choices to be made.\n  With the funds appropriated in 2001, it is expected the Federal \nGovernment's Class Size Reduction Initiative will bring nearly 40,000 \nqualified teachers into classrooms. Any one of us who goes into a large \ncity in our country knows that if we do not have qualified teachers and \nwe do not have low class sizes, we can test until the cows come home \nand we are not going to find anything other than what we already know: \nthat children from high-poverty areas, from dysfunctional backgrounds \nwithout adequate training for academic work are not going to do well, \nbut that a qualified teacher working with a small enough group of \nchildren, as Senator Murray knows so well, can make all the difference \nin that child's future.\n  When we looked at this issue in New York City, we saw the results \nclearly. Two years ago, the program was initiated and class sizes in \nNew York City were 25 percent larger than statewide. With both Federal \nand State initiatives, we were able to reduce class size for \napproximately 90,000 students in the early grades, almost 30 percent of \nthe city's K-3 population.\n  I want people to keep in mind, I am talking about a million children \nand 90,000 children. I know it is hard for some people who represent \nStates without that many people in the State or maybe only half that \nmany to understand we are dealing with huge numbers in a lot of the \nlarge cities. It is not just the numbers; it is the real lives behind \nthose numbers.\n  When we looked at the results, after 2 years of efforts, we were very \npleased because achievement went up in those classrooms where, with \nFederal help, we were able to add a teacher.\n  That does not mean the local communities do not have to continue \ndoing their part, and it does not mean the State does not have to do \nits part, but we have gotten behind in what we need to do for our \nchildren. We need all hands on deck. We need everybody pulling \ntogether. Education is a local responsibility in our country, but we \nall know it has to be a national priority.\n  Let us make sure we focus on both teacher quality and lower class \nsize. That is why this amendment, which Senator Murray has championed \nand has been successful in persuading a bipartisan group of Senators to \nsupport in the past, is a critical component of this legislation.\n  If we can make it possible for class sizes to remain small in the \nearly grades, we improve the chances dramatically of producing a \nproductive, functioning citizen who can find his or her way in this \ncomplicated society and global economy that awaits them in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Yesterday, when I was in this wonderful school that was filled to the \nbrim, they took me into a bathroom that had been turned into a guidance \ncounselor's office. They did not have any other space. We went into the \ngym and children were doing their physical activity which I believe in \nstrongly. We have to keep children's bodies active as well as their \nminds.\n  There was a partitioned area in which there were more offices. They \nwere making the best of a very difficult situation. They had just been \ntold a school down the block, a little elementary school, had been \ncondemned. We will get to that later in this debate, too. This school \nhad been condemned. It is unsafe for our children and teachers.\n\n  There is a school in Mechanicsville, NY, where a piece of concrete \nfell on a teacher's head while teaching in the classroom.\n  There is a condemned school a few blocks from where I was yesterday. \nThey are already packed. The school I visited will be taking in the \nchildren from that condemned school.\n  This is a critical component of the commitment to excellence and \nequity, accountability, and resources that the President has called for \nwhich so many in this Chamber have championed for many years. We have \nthe money to do this. We just have to determine whether we have the \nwill.\n  I call on my colleagues, and echo the very eloquent call of the \nSenator from Washington, that we recognize that continuing this \ninitiative does help local communities meet the needs they see right in \nfront of them and let us make sure we do everything possible to make \nevery child believe he or she is important so that at the end of this \ndebate the bill we pass truly will leave no child behind.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nThe role that teachers play in the efforts to improve educational \nopportunities for young people is perhaps the most important next to \nthe role of parents.\n  The bill before us includes significant changes related to the \ncritical job of providing teachers the quality professional development \nactivities they deserve. Supporting our Nation's teachers is a key \nelement of education reform. A 1999 survey by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, pertaining to the preparation and qualifications of public \nschool teachers, reported that continued learning in the teaching \nprofession is essential to ``building educators' capacity for effective \nteaching, particularly in a profession where the demands are changing \nand expanding.'' Over the last decade, States have been developing \nstandards that are directly tied to academic achievement and \nperformance. S. 1 builds on that movement.\n  Having a highly qualified teaching force is a major factor in getting \nstudents to meet and exceed the standards. While there is near total \nagreement that strong, capable teachers are very important to a \nsuccessful educational system, we have done little to help our teachers \nbe at the top of their profession. There are still too many educators \nteaching outside their field of their expertise. Too often, teachers \nare offered one-shot, one-day workshops for professional development \nthat do little to improve teaching and learning in the classroom. \nProfessional development activities often lack the connection to the \neveryday challenges that teachers face in their classrooms. A recent \nevaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development program notes \nthat ``the need for high quality professional development that focuses \non subject matter content and how students learn that content is all \nthe more\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\npressing in light of the many teachers who teach outside their areas of \nspecialization.''\n  Title II of this bill addresses these serious professional \ndevelopment deficiencies. S. 1 draws on the strongest elements of the \nEisenhower program while including authority for other initiatives that \nhave an impact on teacher quality. The bill provides flexibility to \nschool districts to address the specific needs of individual schools \nthrough activities such as recruitment and hiring initiatives; teacher \nmentoring; retention; and other long-term professional development \nefforts. S. 1 prohibits Federal dollars from being used for ``one-\nshot'' workshops that have been criticized for being relatively \nineffective because they are usually short term and lack continuity. In \naddition, these one-day workshops are often isolated from classrooms \nand schools which serve as the professional development laboratories.\n  S. 1 authorizes a major investment of funds, $3 billion, which will \nbe used by school districts to improve the quality of teaching in the \nclassroom. The funding level of the teacher quality section of this \nbill represents the combining of funds and authorities from the current \nEisenhower program and the class size reduction program. The purpose of \ncombining the funding streams is to give school districts the \nflexibility they need to make the investments that will lead to having \na highly qualified teacher in every classroom--ether by using the funds \nto hire teachers or providing first rate professional development or \nboth. This bill clearly states that Federal funds must be used for \nactivities that will improve teaching and learning in the classroom, \nincluding the hiring of highly qualified teachers if that hiring will \nimprove student performance. The decision as to how the Federal funds \nwill be used will be made by the local school district.\n  My home State of Vermont serves as a good example of success through \nlocal decisionmaking. Vermont strongly supports funding for class size \nreduction. Yet, since the first dollar was appropriated for class size \nreduction, Vermont sought greater flexibility to use most of the money \nfor professional development activities that would improve the quality \nof the teacher in the classroom. Because Vermont already had small \nclasses that met the Federal mandated level of 18, a large portion of \nVermont's share of the class size reduction monies has been used for \nprofessional development.\n  I want other States to do what Vermont has done if that is what is in \nthe best interest of its students. Reducing class size is important. \nHaving a dynamic, highly qualified teacher at the head of the classroom \nis of equal or perhaps, even greater importance. Title II of this bill \nsupports both efforts and does so in a manner that allows school \ndistricts to come up with their own recipe for improving student \nachievement and performance. I am opposed to the class size reduction \namendment because I believe that local schools are in a better position \nthan we are to determine how best to distrbute funds in regard to \nprofessional development and teacher hiring. S. 1 as passed by the \ncommittee gives local school districts the opportunity to make the \ndecision about the expenditure of dollars for the purpose of improving \ntheir teaching force which will, in turn, lead to overall student \nimprovement.\n  I see the hour of 12:30 p.m. has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will stand in recess----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the recess be \ndeferred for about 6 minutes so I can address the Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just make a 1-minute wrapup \nbefore we turn to the Senator from Virginia, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me state we will have more time, \nobviously, this afternoon to debate the class size amendment. I \nappreciate the comments from the chair of the HELP Committee in this \nregard.\n  I agree with him. Professional development is extremely critical. \nThat is why my amendment to separate the professional development funds \nfrom class size funds is extremely important. We want our schools to \nhave professional development but not at the expense of reducing class \nsize, which we know works. That makes sure Federal tax dollars are \nspent wisely at the local level--and which is a local decision, I say \nto the Senator from Arkansas, who spoke earlier.\n  If a school district doesn't want to participate, they certainly do \nnot have to do so. But for the many schools out there, for 2 million \nstudents who have benefited, let's not take it away now. Let's make \nsure they are in a class size in K-3 that allows them to learn math, \nscience, basic reading, and they are able to succeed in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues for \ntheir indulgence.\n  I was greatly taken by the distinguished manager of the bill, \nChairman Jeffords, and his recognition of teachers. I have here the \nPresident's really wonderful message on education entitled ``No Child \nLeft Behind.'' I am sure the chairman agrees with me, if we do not \naccord equal assistance to teachers, we cannot hope to achieve the goal \nthat no child will be left behind.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I certainly agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of our Nation's teachers and \nto say thank you to the over 3,000,000 teachers in this Nation for all \nof the hard work and personal sacrifices they make to educate our \nyouth.\n  This week is ``Teacher Appreciation Week'' and today, May 8, 2001, is \n``National Teacher Day.'' Today, I will be introducing a resolution in \nthe Senate where the Senate will make the appropriate designations to \nhonor our teachers with this appreciation week and day.\n  This resolution already has as original cosponsors Senators Allen, \nBrownback, Cochran, Jeffords, Craig, Thurmond, Crapo, and Enzi. Mr. \nCoverdell, who unfortunately was taken from us some time ago, \nintroduced a similar resolution in 1999.\n  How appropriate it is that Teacher Appreciation Week and National \nTeacher day are upon us as we in the Senate are considering legislation \nto reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The legislation that is before us today, the Better Education for \nStudents and Teachers Act--the ``BEST'' Act--is based on a principle \nput forth by President Bush entitled, ``No Child Left Behind.''\n  As we move towards education reforms to achieve the goal of ``Leaving \nNo Child Behind,'' we must keep in mind the other component in our \neducation system--the teachers. If we fail to accord equal recognition \nto our teachers in this debate, our children will be left behind.\n  All of us know that individuals do not pursue a career in the \nteaching profession for the salary. People go into the teaching \nprofession for different personal commitments--to educate the next \ngeneration, to strengthen America.\n  While many people spend their lives building careers, our teachers \nspend their careers building lives.\n  Simply put, to teach is to touch a life forever.\n  How true that is. I venture to say that every one of us can remember \nat least one teacher and the special influence he or she had on our \nlives.\n  Even though we are all well aware of the important role our teachers \nplay, it goes without saying that our teachers are underpaid, \noverworked, and all too often, under-appreciated.\n  In addition to these factors, our teachers also expend significant \nmoney out of their own pocket to better the education of our children. \nMost typically, our teachers are spending money out of their own pocket \non three types of expenses:\n  1. Education expenses brought into the classroom--such as books, \nsupplies, pens, paper, and computer equipment;\n  2. Professional development expenses--such as tuition, fees, books, \nand supplies associated with courses that help our teachers become even \nbetter instructors; and\n  3. Interest paid by the teacher for previously incurred higher \neducation loans.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  These out of pocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our \nteachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving the profession. \nLittle wonder that our country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Estimates are that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed by 2009 \nbecause of teacher attrition, teacher retirement and increased student \nenrollment.\n  While the primary responsibility rests with the states, I believe the \nfederal government can and should play a role in helping to alleviate \nthe nation's teaching shortage.\n  Here is an example of such help. On a federal level, we can encourage \nindividuals to enter the teaching profession and remain in the teaching \nprofession by reimbursing them for the costs that teachers voluntarily \nincur as part of the profession. This incentive will help financially \nstrapped urban and rural school systems as they recruit new teachers \nand struggle to keep those teachers that are currently in the system.\n  With these premises in mind, I introduced, ``The Teacher Tax \nCredit.'' This legislation creates a $1,000 tax credit for eligible \nteachers for qualified education expenses, qualified professional \ndevelopment expenses and interest paid by the teacher during the \ntaxable year on any qualified education loan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of my tax bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this legislation, S. 225, is cosponsored \nby Senators Mikulski, Allen, DeWine, Cochran, Harkin, and Ensign. The \nNational Education Association also has endorsed this legislation.\n  I am not introducing The Teacher Tax Credit Act as an amendment to \nthe education bill before the Senate because, procedurally, it would \nstop this bill because of the ``blue slip'' taxation procedures in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I do propose today a Sense of the Senate amendment on the importance \nof providing additional tax relief for our Nation's teachers.\n  This amendment simply states that it is the Sense of the Senate that \nduring the 107th Congress, the Senate should pass legislation providing \nelementary and secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses they incur \nto improve the education of our Nation's students.\n  I note that President Bush agrees that teachers should receive tax \nrelief to help defray the costs associated with classroom expense and \nprofessional development costs.\n  The President's education blueprint to the Congress contained a \nspecific reference on page 13. I will read it:\n\n       Provide tax deductions for teachers: Teachers will be able \n     to make tax deductions up to $400 to help defray the costs \n     associated with out-of-pocket classroom expenses such as \n     books, supplies, professional enrichment programs and other \n     training.\n\n  The concept is in the President's blueprint. Frankly, with all due \nrespect to President Bush, I want to go a step further and make it \nstronger, not just a deduction you have to work with and hope you get \nthe money back, but an absolute tax credit on that tax return to take \nright away off the bottom line. Frankly, I think the $400 falls a \nlittle short and I would like to see more.\n  I also note that Senators Collins, Kyl, and Hatch have worked \ndiligently on legislation providing tax relief to teachers.\n  On National Teachers Day, and during Teacher Appreciation Week, I \nurge all my colleagues to support this important amendment that will \nput the Senate on record in support of tax relief legislation for our \nNation's teachers.\n  I thank the Chair and my chairman for allowing me to participate at \nthis time in this debate.\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk, a sense of the Senate, and I await \ncomments from the Chair.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe BEST Act which incorporates the provisions of legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year, the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection \nAct. This important legislation extends protections from frivolous \nlawsuits to teachers, principals, administrators, and other education \nprofessionals who take reasonable steps to maintain order in the \nclassroom.\n  The Teacher Liability Protection Act builds upon the good work \nCongress began in 1997 when it enacted the Volunteer Protection Act. As \nSenators may recall, the Volunteer Protection Act provides liability \nprotections to individuals serving their communities as volunteers. \nAfter bringing several volunteer protection amendments to the floor \nthrough the 1990's and introducing the Volunteer Protection Act during \nthe 104th Congress, I was blessed when Senator Paul Coverdell joined me \nin helping to steer this measure through the 105th Congress and have it \nenacted in 1997. Now, we need to extend similar liability protections \nto our nation's teachers, principals, and education professionals who \nare responsible for ensuring the safety of our children at school.\n  Everyone agrees that providing a safe, orderly environment is a \ncritical component of ensuring that every child can reach their full \nacademic potential. Teachers who are unable to maintain order in the \nclassroom cannot reasonably be expected to share their knowledge with \ntheir pupils, whether it be in math, science, or literature. \nDisruptive, rowdy, and sometimes violent students not only threaten the \nimmediate safety of their classmates, they threaten the very future of \nour children by denying them the opportunity to learn. Unfortunately, \nteachers, principals, and other education officials share an impediment \nin their efforts to ensure that students can learn in a safe, orderly \nlearning environment: the fear of lawsuits. All too often, these hard-\nworking professionals find their reasonable actions to instill \ndiscipline and maintain order are questioned and second guessed by \nopportunistic trial lawyers.\n  Today's teachers will tell you that the threat of litigation is in \nthe back of their minds and forces them at times to act in a manner \nwhich might not be in the best interests of their students. A 1999 \nsurvey of secondary school principals found that 25 percent of the \nrespondents were involved in lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in \nthe previous two years--an amazing 270 percent increase from only 10 \nyears earlier. The same survey found that 20 percent of principals \nspent 5 to 10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events in an \neffort to avoid litigation. This is time that our educators should \nspend counseling students, developing curriculum, and maintaining \norder--not fending off frivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, allow me to illustrate my point with several examples.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  In May of 1998, representatives of the Bethlehem Area School District \nlearned that one of their students, Justin Swidler, had created a web \nsite where he solicited money to hire a hit man to kill his math \nteacher, Mrs. Kathleen Fulmer. According to a local newspaper account, \nthe web site contained images of the principal being shot and ``a \npicture of Fulmer which changed, or ``morphed'' in to a portrait of \nAdolf Hitler.'' The site, which bears a name I cannot repeat on the \nSenate floor, also listed reasons ``Why Fulmer Should be Fired'' and \nthen reasons ``Why She Should Die.'' I think that deserves repeating: \nThe list was not limited to the typical juvenile carping about a \nteacher. It listed why she should die.\n  The school district, much to its credit, expelled Justin Swidler. \nHowever, rather than encouraging young Justin to take responsibility \nfor his actions, the response of Justin's parents was all too \npredictable--they hired a lawyer and they sued. First, they sued the \nschool district. Then, they sued the principal. After that, they sued \nthe superintendent. Finally, in the coup de gras of the litigation, the \nSwidlers sued the teacher whom their son had threatened to kill. I \nrepeat, the Parents sued the teacher whom their son had threatened to \nkill.\n\n  What reasons did the Swidlers give for their suit? they claimed, \namong other things, to have suffered ``embarrassment, ridicule, \nhumiliation, isolation and severe emotional distress'' as well as \nfinancial loss and ``inconvenience.'' The Swidlers wanted the school to \npay because they suffered ``embarrassment'' and ``inconvenience'' \nbecause their son threatened the life of his math teacher? That is \nutterly outrageous. The boy's father, Howard Swidler, also claimed his \nson had difficulty enrolling in a new school because ``teachers \nwouldn't provide recommendations.'' I can imagine that. The teachers at \nNitchmann Middle School didn't want to write a letter of recommendation \nfor this kid who had compared a fellow teacher to Hitler and threatened \nto have her killed. What nerve of those teachers not to write a \nrecommendation under those circumstances.\n  These lawsuits and countersuits drug out in the courts for more than \n2\\1/2\\ years. During this time, good reputations were besmirched, \ndistinguished careers were ruined, and each party accumulated what we \ncan only estimate to be thousands of dollars in legal bills.\n  After all of this litigation, who finally won here?\n  The student didn't win. His expulsion was upheld and worse yet, he \nlearned from his parents that the appropriate way to defend \nindefensible behavior is to file a lawsuit. That is what he learned.\n  The teacher didn't win. Upon returning to teaching, she found that \nthe publicity surrounding the case had irreparably damaged her \ncredibility in the classroom, and she was forced to leave her chosen \nprofession.\n  The principal didn't win. He found himself so thoroughly frustrated \nand saddened by the toll the incident had taken on his school, he \ndecided to take early retirement.\n  Justin's classmates didn't win. The school's students were denied \nresources which should have been used for their education that were \ninstead used to defend the school from a lawsuit.\n  After all of this, I think the only possible winners in this case \nwere the lawyers who generated 2\\1/2\\ years worth of billable hours, \nfrom the Swidlers, the Fulmers, the principal, the school district, \nand, yes, the students.\n  Let me give you another example.\n  Three students in Anchorage, AK, were caught accessing pornographic \nmaterial over the Internet during a computer class at school. The \nschool, acting within its discretion, removed the students from that \nclass and gave them an F for the semester. However, one of the students \nhad earned a grade point average which placed him at or near the top of \nhis class. Realizing that the F would prevent the student from being \nhonored at his graduation, the student's family hired a lawyer and sued \nthe school.\n  After a protracted legal battle, the school was forced to withdraw \nthe F in a settlement once the judge warned the school he would likely \nrule against it. Is this what we want? Do we want lawyers and judges \ndeciding what grades a student should receive or aren't we better off \nleaving this to the teachers in the classroom and principals in the \nschools?\n  Another example: Last year, a high school cheerleading coach in \nLabanon, TN, required her squad to run some laps during practice. One \nof the girls objected to this assignment and referred to it as a \n``piece of [blank]''. In response to the girl's insubordinate and \nvulgar language defying her coach in front of her teammates and \nclassmates, the coach suspended her for an upcoming game against \nLebanon's arch rival, Mount Juliet High.\n  Those of you who have been listening closely to my remarks can guess \nwhat the girl's family did next. Why, of course, they hired a lawyer, \nand they sued the coach. What is amazing is that the cheerleader won an \ninjunction against the coach hours before the ball game with the court \nrequiring that she be given the opportunity to cheer. While this case \nmight cause us to chuckle, it points to a real problem. It sends a \nhorrible message to wayward students that school officials don't have \nany real authority and students don't take any responsibility. If you \ndon't like a teacher's decision or a principal's decision, just hire a \nlawyer and sue the teacher. Don't listen to your teacher; listen to \nyour lawyer.\n  These are but a few of the instances in which frivolous lawsuits \nthreaten to undermine discipline in our Nation's classrooms. While each \nof these cases is troubling, what I find more disturbing are the cases \nthat aren't publicized at all. These are the cases where the teacher or \nprincipal looks the other way or decides not to discipline a \nmisbehaving student because of the fear--the fear--of a lawsuit.\n  Many educational organizations recognize frivolous lawsuits as a \nproblem. That is why the Teacher Protection Act has the support of the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals and the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals. I respectfully ask \nunanimous consent that letters from these organizations be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           National School Boards Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, Apr. 27, 2001.\n     Senator McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The National School Boards \n     Association (NSBA) understands that you plan to introduce an \n     amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     (ESEA) regarding liability protection for school officials \n     who take reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, \n     and an appropriate educational environment. NSBA is pleased \n     that the amendment extends liability protection to individual \n     school board members.\n       This provision is necessary because frequently, a student \n     will sue the school district (meaning school board), and then \n     they will sue the teacher, the principal, the superintendent, \n     and the board members in their individual capacities. As a \n     result, the school district expends time and money defending \n     these claims brought against school board members acting in \n     their individual capacity. School district budgets are \n     stretched too far, and unnecessary litigation results in less \n     money being spent on educating our nation's students. \n     Providing individual school board members liability \n     protection will reduce litigation costs in local school \n     districts and will also provide for the swift dismissal of \n     suits against individual school board members.\n       We recognize that this narrow exception may raise concern \n     that professional staff might feel they have a ``free hand'' \n     in the discipline of students. In this regard, it should be \n     emphasized that with respect to school discipline, \n     professional educators are subject to school district \n     policies, court enforceable due process requirements, and in \n     any extreme cases, the criminal code. And when it comes to \n     such areas as criminal conduct and gross negligence, the \n     exemption of this amendment would not apply. In all cases, \n     the school district can still be sued. Accordingly, this \n     amendment retains the limits and deterrence of possible \n     professional error or misconduct through other legal avenues \n     while enabling school officials to do their jobs, without \n     fear of litigation, in rendering their sound judgement in the \n     great majority of situations involving student safety and a \n     sound learning environment.\n       NSBA supports your effort to provide liability protection \n     to individual school board members and looks forward to the \n     measure being adopted when the full Senate considers ESEA. If \n     you have any questions please contact Lori Meyer, director of \n     federal legislation, at 703-838-6208.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael A. Resnick,\n                                     Associate Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                  Secondary School Principals,\n\n                                        Reston, VA, Feb. 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Secondary School Principals--the preeminent \n     organization representing the interests of middle level and \n     high school principals, assistant principals, and aspiring \n     principals--I would like to thank you for introducing S. 316, \n     a bill that provides for teacher and principal liability \n     protection.\n       As a nationwide survey of principals conducted last year \n     indicates, schools across the nation are eliminating or \n     altering basic programs and activities due to the fear of \n     lawsuits. Twenty percent of those responding reported \n     spending 5-10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events \n     in efforts to avoid litigation and six percent put that \n     number at 10-20 hours a week. At a time when society is \n     heaping greater academic expectations on our schools, we \n     cannot afford to lose one minute, or one dollar, or one \n     school program to frivolous litigation.\n       There is a growing shortage of qualified candidates \n     applying to be principals occurring at the same time that \n     roughly 40 percent of practicing principals are expected to \n     retire from their jobs within the next five to ten years. A \n     study conducted last year by the Educational Research Service \n     on behalf of NASSP and the National Association of Elementary \n     Principals reflects that two of the three primary reasons \n     that discourage candidates from applying is because the \n     position is too stressful and there is too much time required \n     for the requisite responsibilities. There is no doubt that \n     frivolous lawsuits and activity related to that litigation \n     contributes to the level of stress experienced by principals.\n       While we applaud your efforts to provide liability \n     protection to teachers and note that the bill's definition of \n     ``teachers'' is inclusive of principals, we believe the title \n     and references contained in the bill should reflect this \n     intent. Principals, as school leaders, are typically named on \n     lawsuits involving teachers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Gerald N. Tirozzi, Ph.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Association of\n\n                                 Elementary School Principals,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), \n     representing more than 28,000 elementary and middle school \n     principals, I am writing to express our support for your \n     bill, the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act \n     of 2001. If enacted, this measure, S. 316, would be helpful \n     to principals, teachers, and other professional school staff. \n     While we welcome accountability, we are very concerned about \n     the proliferation of lawsuites.\n       Recent surveys conducted by NAESP and the American Tort \n     Reform Association indicate that there has been a significant \n     increase in lawsuits against educators. Nearly a third of the \n     suits were dropped, about one-quarter were settled out of \n     court, and the remainder were resolved in the principal's \n     favor. Virtually no judgments were found against principals, \n     a fact that leads one to conclude that many of the suits \n     could be described as frivolous. Each time there is a \n     lawsuit, valuable time must be taken away from the teaching \n     and learning process and devoted to legal matters. A \n     principal in Washington State spent more than 100 hours one \n     year on legal work surrounding one special education case. \n     This principal is responsible for a school with 500 students \n     and a staff of 40. Not only do lawsuits exhaust many hours; \n     even worse is the effect they have had on principal-student \n     and principal-family relationships. Principals are \n     increasingly cautious about the decisions they make, \n     including implementing changes in the way students are taught \n     and disciplined. This is obviously a hindrance to effective \n     school reform efforts. The simple act of comforting a child \n     in distress has also changed; no longer do school staff \n     members feel that they can put a hand on a child's shoulder \n     to calm the child down or provide an encouraging pat on the \n     back.\n       Although your bill's title refers only to teachers, its \n     definition of ``teachers'' clearly includes principals, and \n     we appreciate that. Thank you for your work to turn down the \n     heat, so to speak, and discourage unnecessary lawsuits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Vincent L. Ferrandino,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, frivolous lawsuits are such a concern to \neducators that many teachers unions tout liability insurance as a key \nreason for joining their union. The Missouri NEA advertises on its \nwebsite that:\n\n       A $2 million educators employment liability (EEL) policy is \n     the cornerstone of MNEA's professional protection plan. The \n     coverage, automatic with membership, includes up to $2 \n     million in damages and additional payment for legal fees for \n     most civil and some criminal lawsuits arising out of job-\n     related incidents while members are working.\n\n  In Texas, where the legislature has already adopted a comprehensive \nteacher protection bill, the Texas State Teachers Association, TSTA, \ntouts its insurance program as a strong incentive for joining its \nunion:\n\n       For the times when life goes haywire and people are \n     reacting with emotions rather than reason, rest assured that \n     TSTA is watching out for you. Our $6 million liability policy \n     sets a new standard for professional protection and coverage \n     is automatic with your [union] membership.\n\n  For my Senate colleagues who question whether or not this is indeed a \nserious problem, you ought to know that the Maine NEA disagrees with \nyou. This is what the Maine NEA says:\n\n       If something happens to a student in your class, on your \n     bus, or in your area of supervision, you can be sued and held \n     individually liable. By virtue of your employment, you could \n     place your home and savings at risk due to the claims of an \n     angry parent.\n\n  However, Maine teachers should not fear, the e-mail continues:\n\n       All MEA members are immediately protected by NEA's $1 \n     million professional liability policy from their first day of \n     membership.\n\n  This legislation is structured similarly to the Volunteer Protection \nAct of 1997 and is nearly identical to teacher protection legislation \nintroduced by Paul Coverdell, S. 1721, in the 106th Congress. Simply \nput, this amendment extends a national standard to protect from \nliability those teachers, principals, and education professionals who \nact in a reasonable manner to maintain order in the classroom. It does \nnot preempt those States that have already taken action to address this \nproblem, and it allows any State legislature that disagrees with these \nstrong protections to opt out at any time. Since the legislation builds \non Senator Coverdell's fine work, my colleagues and I thought it would \nbe highly appropriate that it bear his name.\n  At the same time, it is important to note that this amendment is not \na ``carte blanche'' for that minuscule minority of school officials who \nabuse their authority. The amendment does not protect those teachers \nwho engage in ``willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless \nmisconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or \nsafety'' of a student. Nor does the amendment preclude schools or local \nlaw enforcement entities from taking criminal, civil, or administrative \nactions against a teacher who acts improperly. Rather, the amendment is \nsimply designed to protect those teachers, principals, and educational \nprofessionals from frivolous lawsuits.\n  This is not new ground for our colleagues in the Senate. In 1999, the \nSenate agreed to a similar amendment offered by Senator Ashcroft. \nDuring the second session of the 106th Congress, Senator Coverdell \nsuccessfully included a nearly identical amendment in the Senate's \nversion of the ESEA reauthorization bill. It was approved by this body \nby an overwhelming vote of 97 to 0. Unfortunately, as we all know, \nefforts to reauthorize the ESEA stalled on the Senate floor. It is now \nthe appropriate time for the Senate to revisit this issue, and I hope \ngive its full endorsement.\n  I look forward to working with my fellow original co-sponsors and the \nrest of the Senate to see that these important protections are enacted \ninto law on behalf of America's hard working and dedicated teachers.\n  Again, Mr. President, we voted on this in the last Congress. This \namendment was approved 97-0. It is my hope that it will be accepted by \nthe Senate this year. It has widespread support on a bipartisan basis \nand would add greatly to the underlying bill.\n  I have completed my opening observations on the amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the amendment now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the McConnell amendment No. 384.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know what the unanimous consent \nrequest was of the Senator from Kentucky, but I ask unanimous consent \nthat we go back to the Murray amendment that was pending prior to the \nbreak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\n                 Amendment No. 378 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Murray, \nfor highlighting class size and the pupil-to-teacher ratio as a key \ningredient to educational excellence.\n  A dramatic increase in the student population in all grades \nthroughout the country has presented a serious shortage of teachers. \nDuring the past 8 years, as first lady and now as Senator, I have \ntraveled across Missouri visiting schools in every part of the State. I \nhave spoken with many dedicated educators who are frustrated by having \nclasses so large that individualized instruction is impossible. \nTeachers do their best under the circumstances, but they are \nhandicapped when those in our communities and government ignore the \nplight of our classrooms.\n  Missouri's classroom teachers know that smaller classrooms and more \nindividualized attention to students translates into higher achievement \nscores, especially for children of low-income families.\n  Students in smaller classroom settings are more likely to graduate on \ntime and less likely to drop out, and they are more likely to enroll in \nhonors classes and to graduate in the top 10 percent of their class.\n  It is not only the number of kids in the classroom that concerns me \nbut the physical condition of the classroom itself. Far too many school \nbuildings are in need of repair. Two years ago, the U.S. Department of \nEducation reported that about 25,000 of the Nation's existing school \nbuildings had ``extensive repair or replacement needs.'' The Department \nestimated that almost 12 million students were attending schools with \npoor roofing. Another 12 million were in buildings with \noutdated plumbing, and almost 15 million were in buildings with \ninadequate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.\n\n  In Missouri's public schools, they face the daunting prospect of some \n$4 billion in construction needs over the next decade. In addition, \n59,000 children in Missouri study in portable classrooms. In Nixa, MO, \nthe Nation's second fastest growing school district, all fourth graders \nat Matthews Elementary are in trailers behind the school.\n  Too many of our schools have a crisis of infrastructure. Allowing \nthis is a sad commentary on our priorities in the 21st century. Because \nI believe that improved classrooms are essential to the future of our \nNation, I will vote with Senator Harkin later this week to provide a \nFederal investment in school infrastructure.\n  True, we must demand high standards and rigorous accountability in \nour schools, but reform can only come with the resources to do the job. \nIt must come with flexibility for States and local school districts to \nmeet their unique needs. Any nutritionist or mother will tell you that \nit takes good food to grow strong bones and bodies. Likewise, we cannot \nhave strong schools if we starve the educational system.\n  At a time of record budget surplus, it is our moral responsibility to \ndo what is right for our children. We need a major new commitment to \npublic education. To do less is to falter in our stewardship as elected \nleaders and as parents and as citizens.\n  The time is now and the place is here. As the poet, Gabriela Mistral, \nreminded us:\n\n       Many things can wait, the child cannot. Now is the time his \n     bones are being formed, his blood is being made, his mind is \n     being developed. To him, we cannot say tomorrow, his name is \n     today.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, last Congress the Senate debated the \nreauthorization of the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nUnfortunately, that debate ultimately broke down over disagreement on \nthe federal role in education and the course we should pursue to \nimprove America's schools. That debate has now resumed under a new \nPresident and a new Congress. Today there is real bipartisan agreement \non measures we can take that will lead to a better future for America's \npublic schools and the fifty million students who rely on those schools \nto provide them with a quality education.\n  The Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, unanimously \nsupported by the Senate HELP Committee, encompasses President Bush's \nemphasis on literacy and his laudable goals to improve reading skills \nin the early grades and among disadvantaged students. Consensus also \nexists among Republicans and Democrats alike that in order to improve \nstudent achievement, we must also improve teacher quality. What \nteachers know and can do are the single most important influences on \nwhat students learn, according to the National Commission on Teaching \nand America's Future.\n  And yet today in America, nearly one quarter of all newly hired \npublic school teachers lack the qualifications for their jobs, and \napproximately the same percentage of all secondary school teachers--25 \npercent--do not have even a minor in their main teaching field. The \nBEST bill endorses President Bush's emphasis on the importance of \nimproving teacher quality and his proposal for holding States \naccountable for providing all students with ``effective teachers.''\n  This brings us to the core of President Bush's education plan and the \nbipartisan BEST bill: the creation of a new accountability system which \nfor the first time links Federal funding to school performance. This \naccountability system includes support for high standards for schools \nserving disadvantaged students; annual testing in reading and math for \nall students in grades 3 through 8; public dissemination of school-by-\nschool data on achievement; additional assistance for low-performing \nschools; and consequences for schools which fail to make needed \nimprovements. With this emphasis on accountability comes a new emphasis \non flexibility--providing States greater freedom and choice in using \nFederal funds to address their own needs and special situations.\n  Given these important principles of bipartisan agreement, there still \nremain issues which divide this body--issues which have been discussed \nforcefully and effectively by Members on both sides of the aisle: the \nseminal issue of funding, the compelling need to upgrade and repair \nAmerica's public schools, the priority of class size reduction, to name \njust three.\n  Research has repeatedly shown, for example, that class size directly \nrelates to the quality of education. Students in smaller classes \nconsistently outperform students in larger classes on tests, and are \nmore likely to graduate on time, stay in school, enroll in honors \nclasses, and graduate in the top ten percent of their class. I have \nsupported in the past, and will continue to do so, a national effort to \nhire and train 100,000 additional qualified teachers to reduce class \nsizes in the early grades. It is an investment in reducing teacher \nturnover and in improving student performance.\n  As some Members have noted on this floor, the education bill has \nevolved from the BEST bill reported out of committee. It is a work in \nprogress, shaped by negotiations still on-going. During debate on S. 1, \nI intend to offer the provisions of my Immigrants to New Americans Act \nas an amendment. Information from the 2000 census shows that the impact \nfrom a dramatic surge in immigration is transforming the Nation.\n  This surge in immigration is increasingly challenging U.S. schools \nand communities from Florida to Washington State. My amendment would \nprovide resources to these communities to help ensure that children \nwith diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds--and their families--\nare served appropriately. This amendment is based on legislation \nSenator Coverdell and I introduced in the last Congress, and it would \nprovide funding to partnerships of local school districts and \ncommunity-based organizations for the purpose of developing model \nprograms with a two-fold purpose: one, to assist immigrant children \nachieve success in America's schools and, two, to provide their \nfamilies with access to comprehensive community services, including \nhealth care, child care, job training and transportation. It has \nwidespread support, including endorsement by the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the National Association for Bilingual Education, the League of \nUnited Latin\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nAmerican Citizens, and the National Council of La Raza.\n  At the appropriate time I will also offer an amendment that addresses \nthe all-important issue of teacher quality. Each school year more than \n45,000 under-prepared teachers--teachers who have not even been trained \nin the subjects they are teaching--enter the classroom. Astounding. We \nknow, too, that those students most in need of help are those who have \nthe least access to quality teachers and teaching. Just consider: Over \nhalf of title I resources go into teaching assistant salaries. Yet less \nthan one-fifth of teaching assistants have a college degree, and only \n10 percent have college degrees in the nation's poorest title I \nschools. This is a formula for student failure.\n  Fortunately, the education bill we are debating acknowledges the \nwell-researched fact that the training of our Nation's teachers is the \nsingle most important in-school influence on student learning. The \namendment I will offer allows States an additional option of providing \nfunds to innovative collaborations of K-12 schools and institutions of \nhigher learning devoted to professional preparation of teacher \ncandidates, faculty development, the improvement of practice, and \nenhanced student learning.\n  The amendment I will offer now addresses the troubling issue of \nviolence in our Nation's public schools. No other event in recent times \nhas so united Americans--from Savannah to San Antonio to Sacramento--as \nthe student shootings in Littleton and Heritage High, and in other \nschools across the country. There is a consensus in every borough, town \nand city throughout the United States: Bloodshed in our schools cannot \nand will not be tolerated.\n  Therefore, I offer an amendment to the education bill that addresses \nthe critical issue of safety in America's classrooms.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 376 to Amendment No. 358\n\n                (Purpose: To provide for school safety)\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \nMurray amendment we are currently considering in order to send my \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I send to the desk amendment No. 376 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 376 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in the Record of May 4 under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CLELAND. Although data show juvenile violent crime decreased in \nthe late 1990s, appearing to counter the predictions of a teenage crime \nwave, criminologists and policymakers remain concerned about the \ncontinued high level of juvenile violence. The tragic shooting at \nHeritage High School in Conyers coupled with the incident in Littleton, \nColorado and the other recent senseless shootings in our Nation's \nschools serve as terrible indications of the seriousness of the youth \nviolence problem. I have traveled throughout Georgia, speaking and \nexchanging ideas with students, teachers and parents regarding this \ncritical issue. Although there is certainly no one answer to the \nproblem of youth violence, I believe that an open dialogue among \neducators, students, community leaders, and law enforcement officials \nis a crucial first step.\n  In fact, a report issued by the Department of Education in August, \n1998, entitled ``Early Warning, Early Response,'' concluded that the \nreduction and prevention of school violence are best achieved through \nsafety plans which: involve the entire community; emphasize both \nprevention and intervention; train school personnel, parents, students, \nand community members to recognize the early warning signs of potential \nviolent behavior and to share their concerns or observations with \ntrained personnel; establish procedures which allow rapid response and \nintervention when such signs are identified; and provide adequate \nsupport and access to services for troubled students. In addition, the \nDepartment of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Department \nof Education's National Center for Educational Statistics found that in \n1998, ``students aged 12 through 18 were victims of more than 2.7 \nmillion total crimes at school . . . [and they] were victims of about \n253,000 serious violent crimes . . .'' Amazing. While overall \nindicators show declines in school crimes, students still feel unsafe \nat school.\n  Therefore, my amendment, the school safety enhancement amendment, \nwhich is based on legislation developed in the last Congress by Senator \nRobb of Virginia, would establish a National Center for School Youth \nSafety tasked with the mission of providing schools with adequate \nresources to prevent incidents of violence. The National Center for \nSchool Youth Safety would establish an emergency response system, \noperate an anonymous student hotline, and conduct consultation, \ninformation and outreach activities with respect to elementary and \nsecondary school safety. Under my amendment, the center would offer \nemergency assistance to local communities to respond to school safety \ncrises, including counseling for victims, assistance to law enforcement \nto address short-term security concerns, and advice on how to enhance \nschool safety, prevent future incidents, and respond to future \nincidents.\n  My amendment would also establish a toll-free, nationwide hotline for \nstudents to report criminal activity, threats of criminal activity, and \nother high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse, gang or cult \naffiliation, depression, or other warning signs of potentially violent \nbehavior.\n  Finally, the National Center would compile information about the best \npractices in school violence prevention, intervention, and crisis \nmanagement. Specifically, the center would work to ensure that local \ngovernments, school officials, parents, students, and law enforcement \nofficials and agencies are aware of the resources, grants, and \nexpertise available to enhance school safety and prevent school crime, \ngiving special attention to providing outreach to rural and \nimpoverished communities.\n  My school safety enhancement amendment would require coordination \namong three Federal agencies on the all-important issue of safety in \nour schools. Specifically, it would authorize a total of $24 million in \ngrants by the Secretaries of Education and Health and Human Services \nand the Attorney General to help communities develop community-wide \nsafety programs involving students, parents, educators, guidance \ncounselors, psychologists, law enforcement officials or agencies, civic \nleaders, and other organizations serving the community. In order to \nestablish the National Center for School and Youth Safety the amendment \nauthorizes the Secretary of Education to make available $15 million \nfrom amounts appropriated to the agency, and the Attorney General to \nmake available $35 million from amounts appropriated for programs \nadministered by the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of \nJustice, for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2005.\n  Organizations that support this amendment include the National \nEducation Association, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers \nand the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  It is essential that we come together as a Nation to provide the \nnecessary resources to support our children at every level and that \nmeans providing safe learning environments for all of our children. \nTherefore, I urge the Senate to support school safety and our children \nby adopting my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 378\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Murray amendment was set aside temporarily \nfor consideration of the Cleland amendment. Now the Cleland amendment \nhas been set aside.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assume we are on amendment No. 378, class size.\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. We are on the Murray \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we began the discussion this morning \nabout the very important issue of reducing class sizes in first, \nsecond, and third grades. To me, this is one of the most important \nissues facing us as we debate the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct: whether or not we are going to continue our commitment to first, \nsecond, and third grade classrooms across this country to ensure \nstudents are in a class small enough for them to learn the basic skills \nthat all of us want them to learn: reading, writing, and math.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa is on the floor. He has been a very \nstrong supporter of reducing class size in early grades.\n  I yield for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank my friend and my colleague \non the Education Committee, Senator Murray from Washington, for always \nbeing in the forefront of this battle to make sure our class sizes are \nsmall enough so the kids can learn and teachers can teach. Truly, as I \ntraveled around my State and traveled around the country, visiting \ndifferent schools in different areas, Senator Murray's name has become \nsynonymous with the nationwide drive to get smaller class sizes for all \nof our kids in elementary school. So I congratulate her for being our \nchampion on perhaps one of the most important steps we can take to \nensure success in school.\n  To hear tell from the administration and from President Bush, some \nwould have you believe the most important thing we could do is test, \ntest, test, year after year, as the most important way to assure \nsuccess in school. I strongly agree with the need to demand greater \naccountability but if a teacher has 25, 28, 30 or more kids in a \nclassroom, I don't care how many times you test them--you can test them \nevery month, you can take their temperature every month--you are \ncheating those kids and you are cheating the teacher because that \nteacher simply cannot give the kind of hands-on instruction that the \nteacher needs to give to individual students. So the most important \nthing is not testing. I will say more about that later. The most \nimportant thing is to get the kids early in life.\n  I know Senator Murray was a preschool teacher. It is the most \nimportant job she has ever had in her life, I would say. It is more \nimportant than even being a Senator, as a matter of fact. And by \nserving on the school board, she brings the hands-on knowledge about \neducation that so many of us probably lack.\n  I never taught school, and I have never been on a school board, so I \nput great weight and great credence on the positions taken by Senator \nMurray when it comes to issues of elementary and secondary education. I \nthink Senator Murray has eloquently stated--not just eloquently but \nbacked with the data and the facts--that smaller class sizes lead to \nbetter student performance and a healthier atmosphere in our schools. \nIt reduces violence in our schools. When kids are not crowded together, \nwhen they have some space and they have that one-on-one with the \nteacher, their frustration level decreases and they can better learn \nand better associate with their peers.\n  In the debate we are going to have on elementary and secondary \neducation, we are all going to have important amendments. I am going to \nhave one on school construction, to help our schools meet that need. \nBut really, when you think about what we need in the earliest years--\nkindergarten, first, second, third grade--this amendment, I submit, is \nthe single most important. You can have the most modern classrooms in \nthe world; you can have the best buildings; you can be wired for the \nInternet; you can have all this great stuff; but if you have one \nteacher teaching 30 kids, it doesn't mean a thing. So this really is \nthe hub around which the rest of this is all spinning.\n  I have seen with my own eyes what has happened in the last couple of \nyears in my State of Iowa with class size reduction. When you talk with \nteachers who have had 25, 28 students and they now have 18--I talked to \none teacher in Iowa who had 15 students in a first grade class. She \nthought she had died and gone to heaven. She said: This is why I became \na teacher. When I went through college and I got into student teaching, \nI remember I was in classrooms with 28 or 30 kids. I got out of college \nand I remember--the first class she told me about, I forget the exact \nnumber but it was 25, 26, 27, 28 kids. Now she has 15. She says now she \ncan teach as she was taught in college. You could just see it on her \nface, just how she felt about her job. You could see it in the kids' \nfaces, too. I will have more to say about that in a second.\n\n  This is what we are talking about. This is a picture that says it \nall. It is a modern classroom. It is well lit, well structured. There \nis plenty of work space. There are 18 kids. This is the Cleveland \nElementary School in Elkhart, IN. That is the kind of classroom a \nteacher needs, to be able to give the kind of personal attention that a \nstudent needs. That is what we are talking about, that kind of \nclassroom.\n  The Class Size Reduction Program has been a great success. Since 1999 \nwhen Senator Murray first started this effort, more than 29,000 \nteachers have been hired and more than 1.7 million children are \nbenefiting because they are in smaller classes. Yet the bill we have--\nand I might say the budget we are going to be voting on tomorrow--will \nnot allow us to continue this program. This is not the time to abandon \nthe national commitment we have had in the past to reduce class size \nacross America.\n  As I said, we have the data. We have the research. It has confirmed \nwhat we intuitively already knew, what students knew, what teachers \nknew: smaller classes boost student achievement. They get better \ngrades.\n  We also know that minority students especially perform better than \ntheir peers in larger classes. The news release was put out on August 6 \nabout Project STAR, the Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio. It is a \nTennessee study. It tracked the progress of 11,600 elementary school \nstudents and their teachers comparing those who were randomly assigned \nto smaller classes--13 to 17 students for grades K-3--with those \nrandomly assigned to larger class sizes--22 to 25 pupils--or regular \nsize classes with a teacher's aide.\n  All the students were in regular-sized classes from the fourth grade \non. So, again, they compared the students in the smaller class sizes, \n13 to 17 students, with students who were in classes that had 22 to 25 \nstudents. What they found was smaller classes have a greater effect on \nAfrican-American students than white students. While students were in \nsmaller classes, the black-white gap in achievement fell by 38 percent. \nThat is significant, 38 percent. And it remained 15 percent smaller \nafter the students returned to normal-sized classes after the fourth \ngrade.\n  While they were in kindergarten through third grade, the gap between \nthe score achievement results for students between black and white \nincreased by 38 percent. Even when, in fourth grade, they went into \nregular size and bigger classes, it was 15-percent smaller than for \nthose who were never in smaller classes.\n  Again, what we all know is if you get to them early in life and you \ngive them good instruction and good teaching and good support, it \ncarries on. If you cheat them out of that early in life, that also \ncarries on.\n  How many times do we have to learn around here that patching, fixing, \nand mending will get you a little bit, but to do it right in the first \nplace in kindergarten, first, second, third and, I submit, even in \npreschool, means you don't have to patch and fix and mend and repair \nlater on, and you are much further ahead.\n  That is what this study shows. This was not just a small study; this \nwas 11,600 students. The study says that smaller pupil-teacher ratios \ncan account for almost all of the narrowing of the black-white gap \nsince 1971 as measured by the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress exam.\n  The study says smaller classes increased the likelihood that black \nstudents who take the ACT or the SAT college entrance exams grew from \n3l.8 percent to 41.3 percent, a sharper increase than among white \nstudents, which grew from 44.7 percent to 46.4. If all students were \nassigned to a small class, the authors of the study wrote, the black-\nwhite gap in taking a college\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nentrance exam would fall by an estimated 60 percent.\n  Think about that. If all students were assigned--they are \nextrapolating, I know. We have the study of 11,600. If you extrapolated \nthat out, the black-white gap in taking college entrance exams would \nclose by an estimated 60 percent.\n  When we talk about not leaving kids behind, let's face it. What are \nwe talking about? Under the Bush budget that we see coming down the \npike and we will be voting on tomorrow, he says leave no kid in the \nsuburbs behind. Leave no kid behind who has well-heeled parents, or \nparents who are Senators, Congressmen, Presidents, or CEOs of major oil \ncompanies, or law firms. Let's face it. We have good public schools. We \nare talking about the kids who have bad schools and poorly trained \nteachers. Yes, we are talking mostly about minority students.\n  As we talk about trying to leave no kid behind, we should be talking \nabout not leaving behind those who are at the bottom of the economic \nladder. That is really what we are talking about. You don't leave those \nat the top of the ladder behind. They are never left behind. We make a \ngood living here. Our kids are never left behind. The sons and \ndaughters of CEOs, of corporation lawyers and lawyers downtown and \ncollege teachers are never left behind. The sons and daughters of those \nwho are new Americans, many of them immigrants who come to this \ncountry, and the African Americans who have been denied the \nopportunities for education in our country for as long as they have \nbeen here on our shores--and that goes back 400 years--is what we are \nreally talking about, not leaving kids behind who are at the bottom \nrungs of the ladder.\n  If that is what we are talking about, then we need smaller class \nsizes because the study shows they are the ones who benefit the most. \nEveryone benefits for smaller class size. Don't get me wrong. But those \nwho are minority students who come from the low socioeconomic strata of \nAmerica are the ones who benefit the most.\n\n  The teen birth rate for those assigned to smaller classes is one-\nthird less among white females and 40 percent lower for black teenage \nmales.\n  Crime: Conviction rates were 20 percent lower for black males who \nwere in smaller classes than their peers who were in regular size \nclasses.\n  Perhaps these aren't statistically absolute, but statistically they \nshow trends and what happens when you have smaller classes.\n  Again, we are talking about not leaving any student behind. This is \nreally the hub of it. There is the center of the universe. A lot of it \nis spinning around out there in terms of having better schools and \nbetter trained teachers, better equipment, wired to the Internet, \naccountability, and testing. All of that is sort of spinning around out \nthere. But in the center of all of it is how many kids per teacher are \nin these earlier classes. You can have the best trained teacher in the \nworld. If you put him or her in a class of 30 kids and they can't teach \nwell, those kids are going to be cheated.\n  This is really the amendment to say whether or not we really care \nabout leaving any children behind.\n  As I said earlier, I have visited many schools in my State in the \nlast couple of years since we started the class size reduction program. \nThe enthusiasm and the support among the teachers, the principals, and \nparents is incalculable. Time after time they were saying, thank you; \nit is about time we were doing this.\n  Last month I held two appropriations field hearings in Iowa. I heard \nfrom a lot of people about all aspects of elementary and secondary \neducation. But I think the most poignant testimony had to do with class \nsize reduction.\n  Jolene Franken, president of the Iowa State Education Association, \nhas 30 years of teaching experience in Iowa elementary schools. This is \nwhat she told me:\n\n       Try teaching 30 students versus 20 students and see how \n     much individual help you can give to students. . . . In order \n     for teachers to do their best, they must know their students' \n     needs, learning styles, strengths and weaknesses--these \n     things are impossible with large class sizes.\n\n  Sherry Brown, Cedar Falls, testified on behalf of the Iowa PTA. She \nsaid:\n\n       The advantages of small class-sizes in the early grades on \n     overall academic achievement are well documented, but the \n     advantages also include improved parent involvement. When \n     teachers have fewer students, they have fewer parents with \n     which to communicate and are able to confer with them more \n     frequently.\n\n  Maybe that is something some of us haven't thought about. After what \nSherry said, I thought about it. It stands to reason that we want \nparents more involved with their kids' education. A lot of that has to \ndo with the teacher talking to these parents and getting the parents \ninvolved. When you have a huge class and 60 parents, it is very hard to \ncommunicate with all of them. Cut that down by a third or more. Then \nyou can see what Sherry Brown was talking about. They can talk to the \nparents more frequently.\n\n  During a visit to Starry Elementary School in Marion a while back, I \nspoke with Reggie Long, a first grade teacher for 30 years. She told me \nshe really appreciated the smaller classes. She said:\n\n       It's nice because I can give individual attention to the \n     kids. We just give them so much academically now. If you \n     don't give them individual help, they can't succeed and we \n     can't succeed as teachers.\n\n  The superintendent of the school district said:\n\n       The key to effective teaching is getting to know the \n     students and parents.\n\n  William Jacobson said that it is easier when teachers have fewer \nstudents in their classes.\n  Two years ago, Angie Borgmeyer, a teacher in Indianola--my home \ncounty--had 27 students in her second grade class. I visited her last \nyear, and because of class size reduction, she was down to 21 students. \nShe thought it was still too many, but she said 27 was way too many. \nShe said:\n\n       It's very difficult with that many students. When you're \n     trying to teach them to read and give them basic arithmetic, \n     you need to be able to do it in a small group and give them \n     individual attention.\n\n  She pleaded with us to continue the program because her goal was to \nget down to 18 students, where she believes she could really then \nfulfill her obligation and her commitment to being the best teacher \npossible.\n  The Class Size Reduction Program is simple. It is flexible. It is \npopular. So I, for one, cannot understand why we are having a problem. \nIs it budgeted? It can't be the budget. The budget has $400 billion in \nsome contingency fund--$400 billion--for the next 10 years. So it can't \nbe a budgetary matter. We have a surplus out there. We are going to \ngive tax breaks, they tell me, to a lot of people. People who make over \n$1 million a year are going to get tax breaks. So this is not a budget \nitem. It is not that we do not have the money to do this. We do. It is \na matter of priorities. That is all it is, a matter of priorities: what \ndo we want to do?\n  Last week, with the help of Senator Jeffords, Senator Murray, Senator \nHagel, and others on both sides of the aisle, we adopted an amendment \nthat appropriated $181 billion for special education over the next 10 \nyears to help us meet our goal of providing at least 40 percent of the \naverage per pupil expenditure. We did that. And there is money to do \nthat.\n  So it seems to me that, again, in our actions we could ask: Is that a \npriority? Yes, it is. Certainly it is a priority.\n  A few minutes ago I said that perhaps the biggest beneficiaries of \nsmaller class sizes are our minority students. I take it back. I \nmisspoke. The biggest beneficiaries of smaller class sizes are our \nstudents with disabilities--our kids who have special needs, who no \nlonger are warehoused and pushed into institutions but are now living \nwith their families and are going to their neighborhood schools with \ntheir friends and their neighbors, but they have special needs.\n  They may be physically disabled. They may be mentally disabled or a \ncombination of both. But would anyone stand in this Chamber and say it \nis time to turn the clock back? That those kids should not be in the \nclassroom? That we ought to go back to the old days that I know a lot \nof us remember, when kids with disabilities were sent across the State \nto some institution, deprived of the support of their families, \ndeprived of their friends and their neighbors, simply because they had \none disability or another? I bet there isn't one Senator who would \nstand in this Chamber and advocate that. I do not think there are too \nmany\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\npeople in this country who would advocate that.\n\n  We have come too far. We know that both the kids with the \ndisabilities and the kids without the disabilities benefit from this \ninteraction in our classrooms. We have seen it. We know it.\n  The kids without disabilities become more sensitized. They become \nmore understanding. As I have said many times in dealing with this \nissue of education and disability, when you put such kids together \nearly on, then the fact that they are going to later associate in the \nworkplace with someone who has a disability is no big deal.\n  When we first passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, more and \nmore people with disabilities started getting into the workplace. I \nspoke in this Chamber many times and said: I know what people are \nsaying. They are uncomfortable around people with disabilities. They \ndon't know what to do. They don't know how to act. I have always said: \nJust be yourself. You'll be far ahead. But I understand that.\n  To break down that feeling of being uncomfortable or not being able \nto associate with people who have disabilities, put all children in \nschool together. Let them play together. Let them grow up together. \nThey will find that it is no big deal. So it helps kids with \ndisabilities and kids without disabilities. It helps all of society.\n  What am I getting to in talking about this? I guess what I am getting \nto is that we put all this money into special education, to help our \nlocal school districts meet their obligations to educate kids with \ndisabilities, but the biggest beneficiaries of small class size, I \nwould submit, are those kids with disabilities.\n  If you have a big class, how much attention is that student with \nspecial needs going to get? If you have a smaller class, the teacher \ncan pay more attention to both the minority students and the kids with \ndisabilities.\n  So I correct what I said. I think the biggest beneficiaries of \nsmaller class size maybe are not minority students but kids with \ndisabilities. It seems to me, if we want to back up what we did last \nweek, in providing the funds for special education, this is the \namendment with which to do it, to make sure we have smaller class size.\n  Maybe this isn't the time, but I am constrained, nonetheless, to talk \na little about an issue because it is going to come up--I anticipate \nthat it will come up--and that is the whole issue of discipline and \ndiscipline in our schools.\n  It is a major issue. I am not in any way denigrating it nor saying \nthe problem isn't there, that it does not exist. Of course it does. Any \nof us who have put kids through school know that it is an issue. But \ntime and time again, when I have looked at the issue of discipline, \nespecially when it concerns children with disabilities, who are under \nan individual education program, an IEP--which qualifies them under the \nIDEA program--most often, the discipline problem arises out of the \nfrustration that this young person with the disability has because \ntheir special needs are not being attended.\n  I remember a classic case one time where we had a deaf child, a deaf \nstudent, in a classroom and they were using visual aids, television. \nThe kids would watch television as part of their learning program. I \ndon't know whether it was ``Sesame Street'' or whatever. I am not \ncertain what the program was. After a few days of this, the student who \nwas deaf began to act up and throw things, hit other kids, became \ndisruptive. What was the first impulse of the teacher? Get that kid out \nof class. The kid is becoming disruptive; I can't handle him.\n\n  They pointed out that the reason the kid was disruptive was because \nhe didn't understand what was going on on the television--they didn't \nhave closed captioning--because he had been deaf since birth. He had \ntrouble speaking. So he was acting out his frustration by being \ndisruptive in school. But when they fixed the problem, they put in \nclosed captioning, it was amazing; the discipline problem went away.\n  You are going to hear more about this issue of discipline. Keep in \nmind how frustrated and angry some of these kids who have special needs \nand disabilities got, and they are not being supported so that they can \nget an appropriate education.\n  Again, I come back to my point. If we have smaller class size, the \nteacher can pay more attention to the student with special needs. Any \nway you measure it, I believe this amendment before us now is the key \nto having healthier, happier, more productive students, students who \nwill go on to achieve more. The idea that somehow if we are going to \ntest later on--we are going to test from the third to the eighth \ngrade--we are going to test every year now, that somehow this is going \nto make them better students, there is a place for testing--but not \nwithout the support of the funding for it, though--if you don't have \nsmaller class size, this testing isn't going to mean a thing. That is \nwhy we have to adopt this amendment.\n  I don't suppose the camera can pick these up. I had some other items \nhere that were sent to me. Here are some second grade kids in McKinley \nSchool in Des Moines who made some posters for me, talking about how \nthey felt with smaller class size.\n  Here is one that said: ``There are more books and time to spend with \nadults.'' That is a second grader who wrote that.\n  Here is another one. I like this one. These kids are all standing in \nline to go into the library, and this student said: ``It takes less \ntime to do things.''\n  Smaller class size means they don't have to stand in line so long to \nget their books. This is looking at it through the eyes of second \ngraders who have seen what it means to be in smaller classes.\n  I like this one. This is Chelsea. Chelsea says: ``There is more space \nin my classroom.'' The kids aren't crowded together. Think what it \nmeans to a child to have a little bit of space; they are not all \ncrowded together. It means a lot to us, too.\n  Here is another one. This is Miguel Gonzalez. He says: ``We are not \ncrowded.'' And you can see all the kids are happy. They all have \nsmiling faces.\n  This is from Tony. Tony says: ``More books so I can learn easier, \nfrom the library.'' I assume he means he can get more books so he can \nlearn easier because it is not so crowded. He is reading a book about \nspace, he wrote there. That is a second grade kid.\n  Here is one; this is Gentrie. Gentrie says: ``I can spend more time \nwith the teacher.'' Here is the teacher saying, ``Hello, Gentrie.'' And \nhere is Gentrie saying, ``Let's talk.'' A second grade kid, through \nthis picture, says: ``Hello, Gentrie.'' She says, ``Let's talk.'' With \nsmaller class size, Gentrie can talk to her teacher.\n\n  That kind of sums it up in terms of the Murray amendment and what it \nmeans.\n  We are going to have a budget conference report, I guess, tomorrow. \nWe put $320 billion into that budget. Senator Jeffords and others, \nSenator Specter, Senator Chafee, had all voted to put more money into \neducation. We had over $300 billion that we put in for education over \nthe next 10 years. The Bush budget had $21.3 billion for 10 years. We \nsaid that is not enough. So we boosted that to $320 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  The House, interestingly enough, had passed the budget with the \nPresident's figure of $21.3 billion in education over the next 10 \nyears, an increase. Usually when we pass something here and they pass \nsomething different in the House, we go to conference and compromise \nsomewhere between the two. We passed a $320 billion increase in \neducation over 10 years; the House passed a $21.3 billion increase over \n10 years. You would have thought that maybe we would have a compromise \nsomewhere in the middle. The conference report has come back with has a \nzero increase for education. They didn't even take President Bush's \n$21.3 billion, as meager and penny pinching as that was. They zeroed it \nout.\n  So the money we put in for education, the budget conference that we \nwill consider later this week a zero increase, zero. What they did was \nthey took all the money and put it in a contingency fund, $400 billion \nin a contingency fund for 10 years. That pot of money can be used for \nanything, as I understand it. It can be used for anything we spend \nmoney on. So that means education is sort of put down on the level with \neverything else. It is not that important. We will just put it down \nwith everything else. But this Senate, last week, said education was \nmore important; that it deserved to be increased by over $300 billion \nover the next 10 years. Later in the week we will have a budget \nconference report\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nthat says: No, not only will we not even put in the President's $21.3 \nbillion increase; we will put in a zero increase for 10 years.\n  That is why I believe it is so important for us to have a strong vote \non the Murray amendment for class size reduction. Once again, we have \nto tell those budget negotiators that what they did is totally \ninadequate, if we are really going to meet the needs of education over \nthe next 10 years.\n  That is why I am hopeful we can have a good, strong vote on the \nMurray amendment. We know the figures. We know the facts. We have the \nstudies. We know what smaller class size means. If we just stop and \nthink to ourselves, think about our own educations and our backgrounds, \nit is just common sense. We really don't need a lot of study. Sometimes \njust good old-fashioned common sense tells us what we ought to do, that \na smaller class is going to mean more individual attention. As Gentrie \nsaid, she would talk to her teacher more. Teachers can talk to parents \nmore. Common sense says we have to do it. We have to have smaller class \nsize.\n\n  I guess the second question is, Can we afford to do it? Well, when \nyou have $400 billion sitting in a contingency fund, nonallocated, for \n10 years, I say yes, we can. We were talking about $1.6 billion last \nyear. This amendment is $2.4 billion. Let's see, if I am not mistaken, \nthat would be about one-half of 1 percent, roughly, of what is in that \ncontingency fund. Can we say we can't use some of that money to reduce \nclass size? I think we have to follow common sense around here and \nrecognize that, yes, we have the resources; yes, we are a rich enough \ncountry; yes, we have the money to do this; and we ought to do what is \nright.\n  We ought to adopt the Murray amendment and continue what we have done \nfor the last couple of years, which is working. We know it is working. \nThe parents love it, as do students and teachers. We know it is going \nto benefit the kids of America. Why stop now? I think the answer is, \ndon't stop it now; keep it going. Keep reducing class size. Let our \nteachers teach the way they want to teach and our students learn the \nway they want to learn, in close relationships. We will have healthier \nand better schools in the future for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be allowed to proceed as in morning business for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I will simply say the compassionate \nspeeches we have heard are interesting and certainly true. Earlier \ntoday we had Senator Kennedy's amendment, which will give billions of \nadditional dollars to localities for teachers so that children can have \nmore individualized attention, or whether it is paying teachers more, \nor for teacher development, or stipends. That is a very good idea to \nempower local school boards to meet local needs as regards teachers.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allen are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise, first, to support the amendment \nby the Senator from Washington regarding class size reduction. This is \na very important amendment. It is one that will result in $13 million \nof additional funds coming to my State of New Mexico in fiscal year \n2001.\n  It is a very important initiative and one that I hope very much we \ncan adopt as part of this bill.\n  I want to also speak more generally about the legislation that is \nbefore us and begin by complimenting Senator Jeffords, the chairman of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy, as well as our staffs for the fine work that \nhas been done on this bill. It is an honor for me to serve on that \ncommittee with them and to have participated in the development of this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation, the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, \ncontains many provisions that I support and many that I have advocated \nfor some period of time. I am especially pleased with the new \naccountability requirements that are in title I of the bill and \nthroughout.\n  The bill also maintains several of the most important programs that \nare targeted to specific problems that we see in my State of New Mexico \nand many other States.\n  For example, the bill makes a strong commitment to reducing the very \nhigh dropout rates that currently affect many in our schools. The bill \nincludes a measure to ensure that all teachers are well equipped to use \nnew technologies in their classrooms, to incorporate it into their \nteaching to expand opportunities for students in every school.\n  There are also provisions in the bill to encourage more advanced \nplacement instructions to raise the level of academic performance in \nour high schools and middle schools leading into those advanced \nplacement courses at the high school level.\n  Clearly, the centerpiece of the bill is this section related to \naccountability. For the first time, States and school districts and \nindividual schools will be held accountable for improving the academic \nperformance of all students.\n  I am pleased the President adopted many of these accountability \nmeasures. Senator Lugar and I introduced a bipartisan bill earlier this \nyear. Many of those provisions now are contained in S. 1.\n  Implementation of tough and mandatory accountability standards is now \na bipartisan effort. I feel very good about that. What we are \nimplementing in this bill is a rigorous accountability system that \ndemands results from all students, including those whom we have \npreviously classified as disadvantaged students.\n  I want to take a minute to summarize the key components of this new \nperformance-based accountability system.\n  The bill ensures that Federal funds will be directly tied to gains in \nstudent performance and, most importantly, it ties these funds to \nincreased student achievement for all children. The accountability \nsystem incorporated in the bill goes a long way to ensuring that a \nprimary goal of Federal funding is the elimination of the existing \nachievement gaps between disadvantaged and advantaged groups.\n  The components of the accountability system include:\n  First, raising standards for all students and providing an objective \nmeasure for that progress which can be effectively implemented through \na grading system for States, school districts, and schools.\n\n  Second, focusing on the progress of disadvantaged students by setting \nseparate goals for their achievement so schools must either show gains \nfor those groups or be labeled as failing to make adequate progress as \nintended under the grading system.\n  Third, identifying schools that are failing to meet their goals in a \ntimely manner so they can receive the additional resources and support \nto help those schools turn around; also, there are strict consequences \nif that failure turns out to be chronic.\n  Fourth, working to ensure that every class has a qualified teacher \nand that low-income and minority students are not taught by unqualified \nteachers at higher rates than other students.\n  Fifth, providing an expanded role for parents by expanding public \nschool choice, establishing school report cards to inform parents about \nthe quality of their schools, including the right to know their \nteacher's qualifications.\n  I do believe these strong accountability provisions in the bill are \nthe right thing to do. They will improve academic achievement of all \nstudents, and I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, \nand the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and the administration for \njoining in promoting these tough new standards.\n  I also thank and acknowledge Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh for \nthe important role they played in supporting these strong \naccountability standards.\n  I am also glad the committee included three other important measures \nin the bill as it was reported. The first is the dropout prevention \nprogram I mentioned earlier. The second will help train teachers in the \nuse of technology in the classroom. I also mentioned that. And the \nthird expands the opportunities for students to take advanced placement \ncourses while in high school. That I also mentioned.\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\n  All three of these measures have broad bipartisan support. All were \nadopted unanimously in the committee. The dropout program makes \nlowering the school dropout rate a national priority.\n  Parenthetically, lowering the school dropout rate was one of the \noriginal goals former President Bush and the 50 Governors agreed upon \nin Charlottesville in 1989. Including it in this legislation is \nextremely important.\n  It is well known that the failure to acquire a high school diploma is \none of the greatest barriers to future employment, earnings, and \nadvancement. High school completion rates remain distressingly low in \nmany communities across this country and, unfortunately, in many \ncommunities in my State of New Mexico.\n  The problem is disproportionately greatest among the minority and \nlow-income students. Over 3,000 students drop out of school each day. \nHispanic youth are nearly three times more likely to drop out of school \nas their Anglo classmates.\n  It does not need to be this way. There is now strong evidence that \nefforts that are focused on students most likely to drop out, \nespecially at the ninth grade level, can dramatically improve the odds \nthat those students will finish high school.\n  For example, in my State of New Mexico, Cibola High School in \nAlbuquerque is using just such a focused effort and a small Federal \ngrant to reduce its dropout rate from 9 percent to less than 2 percent \nin just 4 years. Last year, 86 percent of their ninth grade students \nearned all of their credits and moved on to the 10th grade.\n  The purpose of these dropout provisions in the bill is to try to \nduplicate Cibola High School's success at schools across the Nation.\n  There are three parts to the dropout program that are included in the \nbill. First is the creation of a national clearinghouse to get out \ninformation on research, best practices, and available resources to \nhelp schools implement effective dropout prevention programs.\n  Second, the bill establishes a national recognition program to \nspotlight schools that do successfully reduce the dropout rate.\n  Third, the bill authorizes a grant program to help schools implement \nproven approaches to reduce dropouts and put in place prevention \nprograms.\n  I do believe that dropout prevention needs to be a national priority. \nThe need for this program is underscored by the President's increased \nemphasis on annual testing which is sure to raise concerns that dropout \nrates will increase as States try to meet their academic performance \ngoals. This is a real danger, that students who are not doing well in \nthe tests will be the ones most likely to drop out. With all the \nemphasis on test scores, States will not have any incentive to focus \nresources on keeping these kids in school. That is why the dropout \nprevention provisions in the bill are so important.\n  In addition, I believe it is critical that States be required to set \ngoals to reduce those dropout rates and report their dropout rates \nalong with their annual test scores.\n  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada has been a long-time champion on this \nissue and has cosponsored this dropout bill provision with me. I thank \nhim for all his good work.\n  The bill also includes provisions from a bipartisan Technology for \nTeachers Act, that I introduced along with Senators Cochran, \nRockefeller, and Roberts. Technology does promise to transform \neducation. Unfortunately, too many of our schools do not take full \nadvantage of this opportunity simply because the teachers have not been \nproperly trained to use the technology.\n  I am pleased this bill includes our measure to continue the \nsuccessful ``Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology'' program. \nThe program provides grants to consortia of schools of education and \nState and local education agencies to develop teacher preparation \nprograms to ensure that new teachers have the tools they need to take \nfull advantage of new teaching technologies in their classrooms.\n  Another important new measure included in the bill is the Advanced \nPlacement Program. This bipartisan program is cosponsored by Senators \nHutchison and Collins. Advanced placement programs provide high school \nstudents with challenging academic content. They raise the bar for \nacademic standards. They allow students to earn valuable college \ncredits. I believe it is very important that the Federal Government \nsupport efforts to expand this program.\n  We have a superb example of what can be done in advanced placement \ninstruction in Hobbs High School in my home State. It increased the \nparticipation rates in advanced placement instruction by 550 percent in \njust 3 years in that school district. A statewide program in New Mexico \nthat helps low-income children pay for the cost of the tests has helped \nboost participation by 74 percent for Hispanic students, 300 percent \nfor African Americans, and a remarkable 950 percent for Native American \nstudents. This is an important provision and one I feel very good about \nseeing in this bill.\n  I also believe S. 1 is a good bill and reflects a strong bipartisan \nbasis for fundamental reform of Federal education programs. I hope we \ncan maintain this spirit of bipartisanship that has been able to \nprevail. I am a cosponsor of Senator Murray's class size amendment. I \nstrongly urge the Senate to vote to include that in the bill.\n  I will also be offering two amendments to deal with an issue I \nbelieve the States are not in a position to properly address. The first \naddresses the issue of school security and basic student and teacher \nsafety. Senator Tim Hutchinson is a cosponsor. The other amendment is \nto expand a successful pilot program to create small learning \ncommunities within larger schools, the so-called schools within \nschools. Both of these have passed the Senate before. I am hopeful the \nSenate will agree to include them in this BEST bill.\n\n  I would like to conclude with one final point. I do think it is \nimportant for all Senators to remember this is an authorization bill. I \nexpect it will pass with bipartisan support. But the real proof of the \nwill and determination of this Congress to improve education will come \nin the appropriations process.\n  On the one hand, President Bush has imposed a variety of new \nrequirements on the States including annual testing, but on the other \nhand the administration's budget, at least so far, does not provide \nsignificant increases for education. I support many of the proposed \nreforms, but so far I have failed to see the commitment of resources \nneeded to make those reforms possible. I, for one, intend to be \nspeaking out. We need appropriate funding levels for education this \nyear and for each of the years covered by this 7-year authorization \nbill.\n  I do believe that much of what we are proposing in this bill will not \nbe successful unless we are willing to make the full investment of \nFederal funding required. What is called for now is an investment in \nour children's future, an investment I believe our children deserve.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nKennedy, and their staffs for their fine work. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them and the other members of the committee as \nthis bill moves from the Senate floor and into conference. I hope we \nwill soon see this important legislation signed into law and \nappropriately funded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Murray's \namendment.\n  I make an observation at the outset. I do think this amendment \nsuffers in one sense. It suffers from the ``not invented here'' \nsyndrome. That is, I have not heard anybody yet--I am hopeful to hear \nit--come forward and say why smaller classes are not better and why the \nUnited States of America and the Federal Government should not help in \naccommodating most States and counties and cities change individual \nclassrooms to smaller sizes.\n  Maybe there is something of which I am unaware. I am anxious to hear \nit. I have been listening back in my office to this nondebate debate \nbecause everybody seems to be for it, based on what is going on, other \nthan an oblique reference that is not good from one quarter. But other \nthan that, I have not heard why smaller classes are not better.\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\n  I am amazed any Senator would come to the floor of the Senate to \nargue that reducing class size is not good for children. Occasionally \nwe run across those things that are so obvious on their face there is \nno debate about it. I do not know anybody--educator, noneducator, able \nto read, not able to read, with a Ph.D., with just a high school \neducation--I do not know anybody who would make the argument that if \nyou are given the same teacher, competent or incompetent, that teacher \nis more likely to get more information in the heads of the children in \nhis or her class if there are 2 students than if there are 5, if there \nare 5 instead of 15, if there are 15 instead of 45. It just is so self-\nevident.\n  Results from both standardized tests and from curriculum-based tests \nshow students in smaller classes continually outperform those same \nstudents in larger classes. These results span urban and rural schools, \namong low-income and wealthy students. In fact, when class sizes were \ndecreased for minority students, their achievement rates doubled--that \nis right, doubled.\n  There are certain things I do not know why we spend so much time \ndebating, they are so self-evident, such as the idea that we would be \nbetter off in this country and more likely to raise the achievement \nlevel of all our children in direct proportion to how many children had \nto compete for the teacher's attention.\n  Children would lose a lot if everyone had Plato as a teacher because \nthey would not learn to interact with other children; they wouldn't be \ninvolved in sports; they wouldn't learn social skills. But, my Lord, \ndoes anybody think they would not learn more information if they had \none brilliant teacher and one brilliant student, no matter how slow and \nhow fast?\n  Everybody knows this. The question is whether or not we are willing \nto put our money, as a priority, on what we say is the single most \nimportant task facing this country--education of our children.\n  I ask anybody within listening distance of this microphone, on \ntelevision or on radio, to ask themselves the following question--by \nthe way, I teach. I taught as a student teacher when I was in law \nschool to make money to get through law school. I now am a professor at \nWyden University Law School, teaching an advanced course in \nconstitutional law for two or three credits, depending on the semester, \nfor the last eight or so semesters.\n  You don't have to know rocket science to figure this out. They tell \nme there are about 190 young people who try to sign up for my class \nevery year. Because it is a seminar, it is limited to no more than 16 \nor 17 students, although I might note parenthetically that the school \nstarted putting 25 and 28 in my class. I finally went to the dean and \nsaid: I think it is too large. He said: Well, I guess you are right. \nAnd they decided to put fewer students in the class. They changed the \nschedule to a Saturday morning, and it became inconvenient at the last \nminute. So for the last two semesters I have only had five to eight \nstudents. I promise you, as bad of a teacher as I am, when I had 5 \nstudents in my class, they learned a lot more than when I had 15, even \nin a targeted seminar.\n  My wife has been a schoolteacher for the last 22 years. She can tell \nyou, as any teacher in a public or a private school--she taught in the \npublic school; now she teaches at a junior college--that everything \nchanges when you have fewer students--everything. Discipline problems \nchange when you have 5 students as opposed to 10; or 15 as opposed to \n45. Everything changes. The student who is self-conscious, or the \nstudent such as I when I was a kid who stutters, is much more likely to \nraise his or her hand with a small class than with a big class. The kid \nwho raises the devil or is shy is likely to engage more in a small \nclass than a big class.\n  I don't get this. I don't understand why this is even a debate. I \nreally truly don't.\n  Some of my conservative friends believe in the devolution of power, \nwhich is the new, as they say, paradigm for Government. It is a fancy \nword of saying the Federal Government has no responsibility.\n  If you conclude that the Federal Government has no responsibility to \ndeal in any way, directly or indirectly, with elementary and secondary \neducation of our students in the States and localities, then I accept \nyour ``no'' vote as being based upon a rational principle. I disagree \nwith your principle, but it is rational. It is rational to say the \nFederal Government should not be involved at all; ergo, I am against \n100,000 teachers. I got that. I figured that out. There are some in \nthis body, many at the Cato Institute, and many at the Heritage \nFoundation who believe that. I think many of the people, including \nPresident Bush, may believe that. I don't know. But I understand that.\n  However, I do not understand anyone making the argument that the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington is wrong--if I am not mistaken, \nshe used to actually teach--when she says that it is easier to \ncommunicate information, build confidence, and encourage involvement \nwhen you have a smaller class than when you have a larger class.\n  Why do you think we pay so much money to send our kids to private \nuniversities as opposed to public universities? I went to a public \nuniversity. I am very proud of my university, the University of \nDelaware. My son went to a large law school. In our State, we don't \nhave a large public law school. My son went to Yale. He had five, six, \nor seven in his class. The fact is, I didn't get into Yale. Thank God I \nhave a smart son.\n  But all kidding aside, why do you think we pay all this extra money? \nMany of these brilliant young people sitting behind us and the ones who \nadvise us went to those schools. They went there because, in part, of \nthe teacher-pupil ratio.\n  Why do you think when you send your kid to a university and you get \nthat little book, which we all learn--there is a book that gives the \nratings of all the colleges--why do you think, in addition to telling \nyou the size of the library, the size of the student body, the \nendowment, and how many Nobel Laureates they have, part of the rating \nof whether they are a good or a bad school is based upon the teacher-\nstudent ratio?\n\n  I get confused here. Maybe I am a little slow. But if, in fact, it \nmatters when you are a 22-year-old doctoral student to have a smaller \nclass, tell me why it doesn't matter when you are a 7-year-old first \ngrader? I don't get this. I think we need a little bit of truth in \npackaging here.\n  This is not my legislation. I am a follower. But I am ready to be a \nsoldier. I hope someone will come to the Chamber and debate with us \nabout why smaller class size is not a good idea.\n  Good. Maybe my friend is about to do that. I would love to have that \ndebate.\n  Simply put, smaller classes can dramatically improve the quality of a \nchild's education, whether they are slow, or fast, or whether or not \nthey are the brightest candle on the table. All of them will benefit \nmarginally more by a smaller class.\n  We began this initiative under the leadership of the Senator from the \nState of Washington 3 years ago in an attempt to reduce class size in \ngrades 1-3 to no more than 18 students. I cosponsored that amendment \nwith Senator Murray in her effort to continue this program in \nsubsequent years.\n  I would like to think that the 100,000 teacher initiative would be as \nsuccessful as the 100,000 cops initiative that I authored in 1994. I \ndon't think it is an accident that overall crime has gone down 7\\1/2\\ \npercent per year because we added 100,000 cops on the streets in \naddition to other initiatives. The Federal Government has no strings \nattached in terms of having any control over the cop any more than \nhaving any control over the teacher. The State, the district, and the \nlocality control that teacher. But as we say, there are certain \nnational priorities.\n  No child should be left behind. One of the ways to make sure no child \nis left behind is to do just what every parent does in the supermarket \nor department store: Don't let go of her hand. Don't let go of his \nhand. And if you have 45 students in the class, you can't hold all \ntheir hands, figuratively speaking.\n  So the degree to which you want to be assured that children are left \nbehind, increase class size. The degree to which you want to diminish \nthe possibility of any child being left behind, reduce class size.\n  Both the cops and teachers programs focus on putting resources where \nthey\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\ncan be most effective. For cops, it was the street. For teachers, it is \nthe classroom.\n  In the first year, more than 29,000 teachers were hired. Now about \n1.7 million children are directly benefiting from smaller classes.\n  In my home State of Delaware, a small State, our schools rely on this \nprogram to fund 115 teachers statewide.\n  While that may not seem to be a lot to some of my colleagues, those \nadditional teachers can, and do, have a great impact in a State as \nsmall as mine. I debated the Senator's legislation on, I believe it \nwas, ``Meet the Press'' about a year ago with the distinguished and \nserious Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, who was making the case \nthat President Bush did not like this program. He pointed out--and I \nwill ask permission to amend this figure in the Record if I am wrong--\nmy recollection is there were a couple thousand teachers in \nPennsylvania or 1,800. It was a big number.\n  I turned to my friend on that show, the Governor of Pennsylvania, and \nsaid: Well, then, I assume the Governor of Pennsylvania would like to \nsend back the money. You don't want the teachers? They don't make a \ndifference?\n  So I suggest that any Senator who is opposed to this program should \nstand up and in good conscience say: By the way, we have 270 federally \nfunded teachers. I would like to send all the money back. I am sending \na petition to my Governor saying: Don't take the money. Fire those \nteachers. Send them home. Or tell us why it isn't working in your State \nto help alleviate the myriad of problems public educators face every \nday. This program is working.\n  Now, in my humble opinion, is not the time to give it up, either by \nfailing to provide the necessary funds for continuation or by block-\ngranting them with other education programs because, do you know what \nhappens when you block-grant? The last people to benefit are the \nteachers. The last folks who get anything in the deal are teachers. \nThis isn't for the teachers. This is for the students.\n  Again, I make an analogy to the police. Before we passed the Biden \ncrime bill in 1994, in the 20 largest cities in America, there was a \nnet increase of less than 1.5 percent in the total number of those who \nwere on police forces because--guess what--they did not want to hire \npolice, not because they did not think they needed them but because \nthey did not want to sign on to the commitment of year in and year out \nhaving to pay them. They did not want to pick up the fringe benefits, \nthe health care, and so on.\n  So when you block-grant it, I promise you, they are not going to put \nit in hiring more teachers. They are not going to go into your local \nschool districts and say: By the way, we block-granted the money. And \nnow we are going to give, for example, Abraham Lincoln School in such \nand such a county, in such and such a State, money to hire three more \nteachers.\n  I hope I am wrong. But I will make a bet, if you block-grant it, a \nyear after the block grant has been distributed, there will not be any \nmore teachers than the day before it was distributed.\n  So, folks, it is a funny thing about education: you need a teacher. \nIt is a strange notion.\n  I know of the incredible work Senator Kennedy has done. And I say to \nmy colleague from Vermont, and all the members of this committee--\nRepublican and Democrat--they have done incredible work. But I cannot \nthink of anything--anything at all--they have done that has the \npotential to have a more immediate impact on the amount of knowledge \nstudents in the United States of America attending public schools will \nacquire than reducing their class size. Maybe there is something out \nthere--I do not purport to be an expert in education--but I am telling \nyou, I can't think of anything in this bill more important.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stand with the Senator from the State of \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, and adopt her amendment and support the Class \nSize Reduction Initiative--unless they have another idea as to how they \nare going to guarantee us that the end result of our legislation will \nbe smaller class size in the States and localities that voluntarily \nchoose to participate in this program.\n  I thank my friend from the State of Washington for allowing me to \nparticipate and cosponsor this amendment. I compliment her and everyone \nelse who supports this concept. I look forward to hearing opposing \narguments on why smaller class size is not a good idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the Murray \namendment. I want to build on the discussion that has gone on in this \nChamber for several hours. I will focus on three particular points.\n  No. 1, very clearly, the goal of the underlying bill is to address \nthe issue of how we can best, first, diminish the achievement gap--\nwhich has gotten worse over the last 30, 35 years, during which time \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been in effect--and, No. \n2, to boost the academic achievement of everyone, to make sure we are, \nindeed, preparing our young people today and those of tomorrow for \ntheir future: To realize that American dream, to make sure they can \ncompete, not just adequately but in a powerful way, with their \ninternational counterparts.\n  I think the amendment of my colleague from Washington focuses, in a \nvery important way, on a very important issue and that is the teacher-\nstudent relationship. For one of the first times in the debate in \ndealing with class size, we are focusing on the face of the child in \nthe classroom and on the teacher at the head of that class.\n  We talk about programs a lot. We talk about money a lot. But this \ndoes take us down to the classroom, how we best accomplish the \neducation of the child sitting in the classroom, with the teacher at \nthe head of that class.\n  I will argue against the amendment, basically using the argument that \nanother Federal program, another Federal approach is not the answer. It \ndoes not mean I believe class size is not important. That is not what I \nam saying. What I am saying is we need to find out how best to achieve \nwhat is needed in the classroom, to make the teacher and the students \nhave a relationship that maximizes student achievement, learning, and \nto minimize and, hopefully, eliminate the achievement gap over time.\n  The second point I wish to address is this whole issue of looking at \nthe teacher and the students in the classroom and figuring out what you \ncan do to best take care of the needs of that class to boost student \nachievement.\n  In my mind, if you look at all the parameters, the most important is \nthe quality of the teacher. We have an impending crisis in that area. \nIn part it is because of demographics, and in part it is because of the \nattractiveness of the profession, and professional development. Much of \nthat is addressed in the underlying bill--something we have not talked \nabout very much.\n  The quality of that relationship--it does not mean quantity is not \nimportant--becomes first and foremost in importance, to my mind.\n  Thirdly, I believe the amendment by my colleague from Washington is \nunnecessary because if class size is an issue at the school level--\nwhether it is in Nashville, TN, or Alamo, TN, or Kingsport, TN--it can \nbe addressed as it is spelled out in the underlying bill itself.\n  I want to refer back to the bill because we have talked very little \nabout how that issue is addressed. A lot of people have not read the \ndetails of the bill itself as it relates to the issue of that teacher-\npupil relationship in the classroom itself.\n  In the bill we allow schools to address their current classroom \nneeds, to give them the flexibility and the freedom, the mechanism, to \naccomplish what the goal is: boosting academic achievement. It means we \ndo have to examine that relationship between a teacher and a student. \nThere are all sorts of variables. And you will hear that one is more \nimportant than another.\n  A big issue is how many students are in the classroom with the \nteacher. It is not quite that simple because it depends on the subject. \nIs it mathematics? Is it science? Is it teaching a child to read? Is it \nin a classroom where there is technology and there is a lot of \ninteraction going on between the teacher and the students that we might \nnot have had in the past?\n  A second issue is, how safe is that teacher-pupil environment where \nthe\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\nteaching is occurring? The goal is to boost student achievement. It is \nan issue that is addressed in the underlying bill. But the point is, in \nthe classroom there are all sorts of environments that have to be \naddressed. How conducive is that environment to learning? Are there \ndisruptive students in that environment? How good is that teacher?\n  Earlier this week, and last week, we talked about failing to invest \nin the quality of our teachers. We are failing to give them the \nprograms to make them more useful. Their intentions are good. They work \nhard. We have to look at their qualifications, their certification, \nand, lastly, what is the relationship of that teacher to technology \ntoday.\n  Again, in this bill, which people are just beginning to really focus \non, there is a whole section to encourage the use of technology, to \nadapt technology to the use of that classroom, again, to reduce that \nachievement gap, to boost learning for everyone, and to maximize the \nuse of the teacher at the head of the classroom and the children.\n  What is important in one school in one part of Nashville may be \ntotally different than what is important in another school, say, in \nMemphis or in Anchorage, AK, or in Manhattan or on an Indian \nreservation. That decision should most appropriately be made by people \nin that community. Whether it is the teacher in the classroom, the \nparents looking in on that classroom, or the principal, they are the \nones who can assess how technology is most appropriately used; what is \nthe size of that classroom; how safe is that environment; how \ndisruptive are the other students; all of which is placed into this \nbowl of how best to boost student achievement and maximize the teacher \ninteraction with that particular student.\n  The point is class size is one of those parameters and, indeed, in \ncertain situations it can be very important. But rather than have \nanother Federal program--because we have tried that; we have had a \nlitany of hundreds of Federal programs over the last 35 years--that \nbasically says, this is the problem and this is the way to fix it, why \ndon't we have a program which--and it is in the underlying bill--says: \nLet's group and consolidate programs, including class size, but allow \nthe decision on how to use those resources to be made by the teachers, \nby the principal, by the school district, the community, under the \ninfluence of parents, under the influence of local decisionmaking and \nlocal input.\n  It comes down to a fundamental difference, what the debate has been \nover the last several years since I have been in the Senate, on which \nwe have disagreed many times in the past: Whom do you trust? Whom do \nyou trust to identify the needs, to respond to those needs? Is it \nanother Federal program or is it the teachers and the principals and \nthe school board members at the local level?\n  Our approach, very clearly--the reason why I urge defeat of the \namendment--is that, yes, we need more resources; yes, we need more \nmoney; we need to shine the spotlight on the issue of local control, \nbut we want to free people up from government regulations, from another \nprogram, to allow them the how-to in boosting the achievement with \ndecisions made locally.\n  The second issue I will discuss is when you look at the classroom \nenvironment which we all want to maximize and make conducive to \nlearning, the teacher is very important. We are having an impending \ncrisis in the quality of teachers at the head of the class. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education estimates that a whole wave of teacher \nretirements as well as the demographics of rising enrollments will \nforce America's public schools to recruit over 2 million new teachers \nin the next decade. It is a matter of demographics and retirement.\n  I argue that instead of thinking about warm bodies, as you see this \nteacher and the student in the classroom, we absolutely must invest--\nand the good news is, the underlying bill does--in improving that \nteacher quality. Teacher quality in the classroom drives academic \nsuccess. It is the single factor most likely to boost student \nachievement. Good teachers clearly make the difference. We can all name \nour teachers. Both sides of the aisle have talked about teachers who \nhave influenced their lives and the importance of that personal \nrelationship in an environment which maximizes learning.\n\n  William Sanders, from Tennessee originally, has been quoted on the \nfloor because he has looked at all sorts of issues and has been \nnationally recognized for studying the environment. Again, his \nconclusions and statistics and data have been used by both sides of \nthis particular issue. He says:\n\n       When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.\n\n  Teacher shortages are going to hit a high in the year 2010. We \nabsolutely must begin thinking right now about how to replace what \nequates to about two-thirds of our teaching population today that \nsimply will not be teaching at that time. The factors are many. In \nlarge part it is demographic. We know that enrollments in public and \nelementary and secondary schools are projected to rise about 4 percent \nin the next decade. That, in and of itself, is going to require more \nteachers to fill the increasing number of classrooms. The average \nteacher today, 44 years old, means that school districts all across the \nNation will have to brace for a whole wave of retirements occurring in \nthe not too distant future.\n  Third, one-fourth of beginning teachers in my own State of Tennessee \nleave the profession within 5 years. More than half are teaching \nsubjects in Tennessee outside their area of expertise or in subjects \nthey were never trained to teach.\n  On the issue of teacher quality, the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation \nreported in a recent study:\n\n       College graduates with high test scores are less likely to \n     become teachers; licensed teachers with high test scores are \n     less likely to take jobs; employed teachers with high test \n     scores are less likely to stay, and former teachers with high \n     test scores are less likely to return.\n\n  When you couple the critical importance of teachers with the fact \nthat today America's students rank lower than their international \ncounterparts in the fields of math and science and in reading, the \nissues we have talked about before, we clearly need to focus on quality \nteachers, on attraction of those teachers, supporting those teachers, \nand retention of those teachers. They are the key to motivating those \nstudents who may fall further and further behind--again, in part \ncontributing to that increase in the achievement gap we all know so \nwell.\n  It is important to understand that--and class size is one of them--\nthe quality of the teacher is critically important to educating our \nchildren. I mentioned a few of the statistics, but if you just go \nthrough several about the qualifications of teachers today--again, \nremember, we have identified a problem; we are making this diagnosis; \nand we want to respond in an appropriate way--only one in five full-\ntime public school teachers feel well qualified to teach in a modern \nclassroom.\n  More than 25 percent of new teachers enter our Nation's schools \npoorly qualified to teach. Twelve percent of teachers enter without any \nprior classroom experience.\n  If we look at inner-city schools, statistics are even worse. Inner-\ncity students have only a 50/50 chance of being taught by a qualified \nmath or science teacher. New teachers in the United States receive less \non-the-job training and mentoring than do their teacher counterparts in \nJapan and in Germany. I have referred to the fact that U.S. teachers \ntoday who are in that classroom actually teaching our children lack \nappropriate training and knowledge of a particular subject.\n  The data is as follows: Many students are taught by a teacher who \nlacks either a major or a minor in the subject they are teaching.\n  Of the following statistics, these are people who do not have a major \nor minor in the field in which they teach: That is, 18 percent of \nsocial study teachers, 40 percent of science teachers, 31 percent of \nEnglish teachers, 34 percent of math teachers.\n  In schools where more than 40 percent of the students are low income, \nnearly half the teachers are what is called ``out of field.''\n  I go into some detail about this issue of quality because the focus \nis very much on what goes on in the classroom. Then the question is: \nYou have identified the problem. Is it being addressed in the bill? \nThis brings me to my last point. Is the Murray amendment necessary? To \nanswer that, I will\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\nargue, no, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against it. But it \ntakes an understanding of what was done in the underlying bill and what \nis actually in the bill to understand why I can say with confidence \nthat it is unnecessary as we focus on the teacher and the student in \nthe classroom.\n  What we do in the first part of this bill is pool the funds and the \nauthorities that are existing in programs which we have had in the \npast. We have talked about that in the last hour. The existing \nEisenhower professional development funds and the class reduction \nfunds, we haven't gotten rid of those. We haven't eliminated the class \nsize reduction effort, but what we have done is put those together, \nconsolidated them.\n  We pool those funds. And we do that with a very simple--this really \ncomes down to the philosophical difference of what we think works and \nwhat will not work. We do that in order to give access to these \nresources to local communities to give them the flexibility to address \ntheir particular needs. In one school, it might be class size and they \ncan use those funds for that. Remember, we have not done away with the \nfunds themselves. We list that as one of the appropriate uses. But it \nmight not be and it might be that school would rather use those funds \nfor an afterschool program or for increasing the use of technology or \nthe inclusion of technology in that program.\n  The point is that we have taken the class size reduction funds and \nthe other funds and we have put them together and basically said, how \nyou accomplish boosting student achievement or reducing that \nachievement gap is up to you at the local level. Why? Because you know \nwhether or not you need another teacher in the classroom, a smaller \nclass size, or better use of technology.\n  Real quickly--and I will be brief--what is in the bill? State \nactivities: States may use these funds for a whole range of \nactivities--certification of teachers, recruitment of teachers, \nprofessional development, or support for teachers. Local activities: \nAgain, local decisions can be made whether or not to use these funds \nfor class size, professional development, recruitment, or for the \nhiring of additional teachers.\n  Local accountability is built into the underlying bill. The \nevaluation plan of a local education agency must include performance \nobjectives related to student achievement, relationships to teachers, \nhow well teachers are performing, participation in professional \nteaching and development activities.\n  Lastly, in the bill, there is a whole series of sections that look at \nactivities that address leadership by teachers, advanced certification \nand credentialing, supporting that activity by teachers, and \ntransitioning to teachers for those people who might be midcareer and \nmight need training to be certified to teach.\n  In closing, if class size is a problem in the school, under the \nKennedy-Jeffords bill it will and can be addressed. There are resources \nthere for that. Our approach is not another Federal program, not \nadmitting a program. We have tried that in the past, and we have a \nlitany of programs today that clearly have not been successful. We want \nthose decisions to be made locally by teachers, by principals, by \nschool boards, rather than Washington, DC. Since it is provided in the \nbill, I believe there is no need to create yet another program. I urge \ndefeat of this amendment when we vote on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Warner amendment No. 383, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I want to \nmove this process along, however I haven't spoken on this amendment. If \nanybody else wants to speak, there might be a few minutes in the \nmorning. Understanding that we might be able to split that between \nSenator Murray and myself, I will not object.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I also say that Senator \nKennedy has indicated that he has someone lined up to do another \namendment tonight--Senator Feinstein--if that is in keeping with what \nthe majority wants. We can debate that for a while tonight. I don't \nknow if the leadership wants a vote tonight or tomorrow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for \nmaking the agreement, and we will move ahead with the vote shortly.\n  We are very hopeful of getting the process moving. There are \ncurrently about 70 amendments. Some are in the process of being worked \nthrough because they are under the jurisdiction of other committees.\n  There are also many outstanding amendments which are related to this \nbill, that need to be called up. We are prepared, as we mentioned last \nFriday, to work toward the continuation of debate on these measures and \nfinal resolution. I know the Senator from Vermont said we are prepared \nto stay in this evening, tomorrow evening, and Thursday evening. We are \ngoing to have time to debate the Budget reconciliation that we will \ntake up sometime this week. However, we are quite prepared to deal with \nthese amendments. We urge colleagues to bring them up. I am absolutely \namazed, quite frankly, that Members are not prepared to bring up their \namendments. We have known this bill is going to be debated on the \nfloor. We are prepared to deal with this legislation.\n  I intend to ask our leaders on our side to request consent to \nestablish a deadline for submitting amendments. We welcome our \ncolleagues to submit amendments, and we want to try to have a full \nopportunity for discussion on these measures. It is about time we had \ngood debate on this legislation. That is what I know my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont is prepared to do. I am prepared to do that.\n  I make the plea to my colleagues on this side of the aisle to address \nthese measures and do it in a timely manner. We understand the priority \nthat the budget has, and we have all been around here long enough to \nknow that unless some deadlines are established, unfortunately, we are \nnot going to complete our business. I will work with our side and with \nthe majority leader to try to establish a process where we can move in \na timely manner. I will be glad to yield for a moment, but I would like \nto address this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I agree with the Senator 100 percent. I suggest that \nall amendments that are filed--only all those filed by 5 p.m. tomorrow \nbe considered to be voted on, or some appropriate language that would \nmake that the law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That certainly is a proposal I could support. I will not \noffer that at this time, though.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 386 be \ncalled up and then set aside, just so I make sure I am in this game.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment for this consideration?\n  Without objection, the pending amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 386 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 386.\n\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To provide resource officers in our schools)\n\n       On page 893, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The pending amendment is the Murray amendment; is that \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to add my strong support for the \nMurray Class Size amendment. I have listened with great interest and \nalways have learned from my friend and colleague from the State of \nWashington when she proposes this amendment. It is a subject that is \nnot new to the Senate. We have voted on this, and we have seen its \nimplementation for a number of years and the success that it is having \nin schools across the country.\n  I am always impressed by the fact that the Senator from Washington, \nwho was a member of a school board and a great teacher, understands \nthis issue and is able to address this issue from her personal \nexperiences. We are so fortunate to have a Senator with that kind of \nexperience proposing an amendment that can make an important difference \nin the education of children. I support this amendment, as I have in \nthe past.\n  We have tried in the legislation to find various programs that \nenhance the educational capabilities of children. It is true, as the \nSenator from Tennessee said, that there can be a local option as to \nwhether schools, under the title II provisions, want to use the funds \nfor smaller class sizes or professional development. It is my strong \nposition we need both and we need a commitment in both areas.\n  That is what this is about. We did enhance the resources for \nrecruitment, enhanced training of teachers, continuing professional \ndevelopment, mentoring, and the development of additional professional \nskills dealing with the important areas of child growth and development \nand child psychology area. These are enormously important.\n  If there is anything we have learned over the years, it is the power \nof well-qualified teachers with a good curriculum teaching in a class \nwith a small number of students.\n  I am not going to take the time of the Senate to go through the \nresearch base supporting reducing class size, but the studies are very \nclear. Both the Star studies that have been done in the State of \nTennessee, and the Sage studies in the State of Wisconsin show that \nreducing class size has positive effects on student achievement and \nclassroom behavior.\n  I have traveled to the State of Wisconsin. I visited the classrooms. \nI heard the teachers. I talked with the parents. There has been \ndramatic and significant progress made in moving toward smaller class \nsizes.\n  That has been true in the State of California as well. I will read \nfrom the California report on the results from the first 2 years of \nclass-size reduction:\n\n       California class-size reduction reports show that reducing \n     class size improves student achievement. A study of the first \n     3 years of class-size reduction efforts in California shows \n     that smaller classes have boosted student achievement in \n     communities across the State for the second year in a row.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The evaluation shows those students in the most \n     disadvantaged schools were most likely to be in larger \n     classes or taught by less qualified teachers. Students in \n     smaller classes outperformed their peers in larger classes \n     even with less qualified teachers. These students could be \n     performing even better if all the children in these schools \n     had fully qualified teachers and smaller classes.\n\n  That is what we want: smaller class size and better trained teachers. \nThat is absolutely essential. The Murray amendment will authorize \ncontinued funding to create smaller classes, hire additional teachers \nand provide those teachers with the professional development that they \nneed to help every child succeed. We will have the continued commitment \nto smaller class size. With a strong bipartisan vote this morning, we \nwill have the resources to make sure the neediest children in this \ncountry have well-qualified teachers in the classrooms, and those \nteachers will be able to give every student the individual attention \nthat they deserve.\n  I am amazed at what the Senator from Washington was able to do with \nher amendment. It requires a simple one-page application. It will be \navailable to any school district in the country. All they fill out is \none page. Under the formula devised in the Senator's amendment, they \nwill either qualify or not qualify. It does not take a lot of grant \nwriting. The school districts will know very quickly the amount that \nthey are entitled to and how many classes they are able to impact. That \nwill help move the process forward.\n\n  There is flexibility in the Murray amendment. If a school district \nreaches the smaller class size goal, it states in the amendment that \nthey can use the resources for professional training for teachers. It \nis enormously important.\n  Senator Murray has built in flexibility. If a school achieves a lower \nclass size in grades one through three, and they have the additional \nresources, they can reduce class sizes in other grades. The flexibility \nis there. If they are able to do all of them and still have resources \nleft, they can use them for teacher professional development.\n  I want to use my last moments to bring a few things to the attention \nof my colleagues. First, we have the recent story on the achievement \ngains by the students of the Prince Georges County Schools reported in \nthis morning's Washington Post. I point out the lead story: ``Pr. \nGeorge's Test Scores Show Best Gains Ever.'' It says:\n\n       Prince George's County students posted their highest gains \n     ever on a key standardized test used to gauge how local \n     children measure up to their peers nationally, according to \n     the results released yesterday.\n\n  It gives the very encouraging results.\n  The superintendent was asked about the factors in ensuring these \nkinds of results. She said:\n\n     . . . as proof that the county is serious about improving \n     academic achievement and that they would reward it with more \n     funding to reduce class size and repair deteriorating \n     buildings.\n\n  This is what they have been able to do.\n  Moving over to the jump page on A14, it talks about the importance of \nreading. That is in the BEST bill. We are in strong support of \nadditional time for reading and math. We are all for that. It is in \nthis bill.\n  The superintendent also commented on the importance of reducing class \nsize in the lower grades and placing more emphasis on training \nteachers. This is exactly what we are debating today.\n  How many times do we have to see the same evidence before we learn \nthis? We have the studies in Tennessee, Wisconsin, and California.\n  I have a report from the Mississippi Department of Education. I will \nmention what a few of the teachers have\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nfound. I will also include other comments.\n  This is from Suzanne Wooley:\n\n       The drop in the student/teacher ratio within the first \n     grade this year has been a really great tool in our ability \n     to help our children. Because of fewer numbers of children, \n     we have had practically no discipline problems. The children \n     are more like a team and they expect the best from each \n     other. This saves a great amount of our instructional time \n     for actual instruction. My teacher's assistant and I are also \n     better able to aid and instruct low-achieving students with \n     their individual needs. We are giving much more time to the \n     skills each student needs to work on. As a group, we are \n     covering our ``core-skill'' material much more quickly and \n     the children are ``catching on'' and learning the material \n     more thoroughly.\n\n  Kelly Blacklaw:\n\n       This is the first year that I have taught first grade. \n     However, I am accustomed to small groups, because I taught \n     Title I Reading for three years. I taught kindergarten for \n     one year prior to teaching Title I and had 30 students with \n     an assistant. Comparing this year to that particular year, \n     reduced class size has definitely been very beneficial for \n     the progress of my students. I have been able to get to know \n     my students better and much more quickly. I have been able to \n     gain a great deal of insight into their backgrounds and their \n     strengths and weaknesses.\n\n  Ms. Simpson:\n\n       Generally speaking, my class this year is quite low. Due to \n     that fact, a smaller classroom size has been greatly \n     appreciated. I am able to more effectively monitor the \n     children's progress as I teach, and have found that more time \n     is available to reinforce and practice important skills.\n\n  They mention there was only one child who fell behind in reading.\n  These go on and on. I do not know what more we have to do to convince \nour colleagues. We are not placing a mandate on any local district. All \nwe are saying is we know this works and we hope communities will choose \nto embrace the idea of reducing class size.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \non that point for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I certainly will.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Massachusetts \nand ask him again, because we have heard from the other side that this \nis some kind of Federal mandate for local class size would the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts not agree with me that this is a voluntary steady \nstream of money for schools that choose to use this money to reduce \nclass size?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct. It is a voluntary \nprogram. It will be available, with the Senator's amendment, to local \ncommunities that have crowding in their classrooms, as it has been in \nmy own State of Massachusetts in a number of different communities with \nthe same very positive results we have seen in other places.\n  As the Senator remembers, we made a national commitment to hire \n100,000 teachers. This is the amendment the Senator from Washington \noffered--100,000 teachers. We have, I believe, 37,000 of them, and some \nof them have already proven to be our best.\n  At the time this was announced, as the Senator remembers, we had \nformer Speaker of the House Gingrich. ``We said the local school board \nwould make the decisions. No new Federal bureaucracy, no State, not a \npenny in the bill that was passed goes to pay for bureaucracy; all of \nit goes to pay for local school districts. . . .'' House Speaker \nGingrich, the first time we passed the Murray amendment, called it a \nvictory for the American people: ``There will be more teachers, and \nthat is good for all Americans.''\n  As I remember, and as I read the amendment, I believe 99 percent of \nthe funds go to the local district and the local district has the \ncontrol. Am I correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank he Senator from Massachusetts for answering that \nquestion. He is absolutely correct; 99 percent of the money does go to \nthe local schools at their discretion to use for class size because it \nis a national priority.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to point out very clearly, we need \nfewer children in classrooms so that teachers can give each child the \nattention necessary for that child to succeed. Teachers need the \nmentoring and the professional development that we have in the \nlegislation. Smaller class size is a tried and tested program. It is \neffective. We ought to have smaller classes and more opportunities for \nteachers to get the training that they need. That is what this \namendment is really about.\n  We should not forget the commitment that we made. We know what works. \nWe know it has been effective. We believe that children are worth our \ninvestment. We believe the Murray amendment is the best way to get this \njob done.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we are going to vote on the \nWarner amendment at 5:15; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Debate appears to be resolving around the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington, and I did want to speak to that. Then I guess \nwe ought to vote.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Washington is an outgrowth of a \nproposal that was put forward by President Clinton and was carried by \nthe Senator from Washington for the last couple of years. However it \nfails, in my opinion, for a variety of reasons.\n  The first reason it fails is the basic philosophy behind the \namendment which is we in Washington know better--better than you, the \nAmerican citizens who run their school districts; you, the parents \nacross America; you, the principals across America; you, the school \nboards across America--how to run your schools. This is a command and \ncontrol amendment. This is an amendment which says we are going to put \na certain pot of money on the table--your tax dollars, by the way, tax \ndollars we took from you in Auburn, NH, or Cheyenne, WY, or Chicago, \nIL. The tax dollars that we took from you, we are going to take some of \nthem and put them on the table. But before you can get any of those tax \ndollars, you have to do exactly what we tell you to do with them.\n  Specifically, in this instance, you are going to have to hire more \nteachers. Even if you do not need more teachers, you are going to have \nto hire more teachers because we in Washington know a great deal more \nabout what you need in your school system than you do. That is the \nbasic premise of this amendment. It is one of the primary reasons I \noppose it.\n  The second problem with this amendment is there is no statistical \nstandard which shows that certain class size ratios improve education. \nIn fact, study after study, significant studies--in fact, 300 studies--\nwhich have been reviewed conclude that it is the quality of the teacher \nthat is key to the quality of education more than the class size. That \nis especially true after you hit a certain level of class size.\n  In the United States today, the average class size ratio is 17 to 1. \nI think 44 States already meet the level of ratio that was put forward \nby the President as an appropriate level, which was 18 to 1. So we are \nnot talking about dramatic reductions in class size in States across \nthe country. What we are talking about is essentially trying to work at \nthe fringe with some Federal money to demand that more teachers be \nhired.\n  But the practical effect of that may be to reduce the quality of \neducation. Why? Because you may end up with poorer teachers being hired \nbecause you forced on the school system the requirement that they hire \nmore teachers rather than that they improve the quality and the ability \nof the teachers who are in the classroom, which almost every study has \nconcluded is the key to good education.\n  In fact, I hold California up as a pretty good example of how this \nworks. They set in place--their right, they have the right to do it--a \nclass size ratio proposal. As a result, they went out from 1995 and \nhired a whole bunch of new teachers. What happened? The number of \ncertified, qualified teachers went up--this is in the K-3 area--from \n1,100 to 12,000 unqualified or teachers who were of questionable \nquality. They were not certified. They had not learned how to teach a \nthird grader or second grader or first grader or one in kindergarten. \nSo it is very possible that by reducing the class size, California \nactually ended up putting 11,000 more teachers into the classroom who \ndidn't know how to teach.\n\n  A couple of other important studies proved beyond any question that \nif a student is exposed to a teacher who doesn't know what they are \ndoing in a subject, the recovery time for that student is \nextraordinary. Under a Rand\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\nstudy, they concluded a student may never recover from a poor teacher--\nwhich gets back to the initial point: We do not know whether teachers \nare good or not.\n  I do not know here, standing on the floor, whether the teacher in \nEpping, NH, is good or poor, whether the teacher going to be hired is a \ngood teacher or poor teacher. I don't know it in Cheyenne; I don't know \nit in Chicago. What I do know is the principal in that school probably \ndoes know who the good teachers are, probably does know teachers who \nhave weaknesses and need assistance, probably does know whether in one \nclass they need more teachers but in the other class they just need to \nimprove the teacher they have. Or maybe in another class they have such \na great teacher who is being pushed out of the school system because \nthey cannot afford to pay the costs because the teacher cannot afford \nto live on the salary they are being paid and they need to pay that \nteacher more.\n  I do not know the answer to those questions, but I will tell you who \ndoes: The local principals, the school boards, the teachers in the \nclass know that, and the parents whose kids are in the classroom.\n  What does this proposal say? It says it doesn't matter; you have to \nhire a new teacher. That is your option. If you want this money, you \nhave to hire a new teacher.\n  I think that was misguided. I think it was misguided when President \nClinton brought it forward earlier, and as a result we have debated \nthis matter on the floor a number of times. What did we do to try to \ncorrect this? Because we do recognize, on our side of the aisle, \nputting more teachers in the classroom may be the proper resolution to \na specific incident; that may be what some school systems need. We also \nrecognize on this side of the aisle maybe the proper resolution is \ngiving that teacher more tools to work with, maybe giving that teacher \nmore educational support, maybe giving that teacher some extra pay so \nthey can keep teaching or some of the other things they may need.\n  So we put in the bill something called the Teacher Empowerment Act. \nWhat the Teacher Empowerment Act does is to say let's merge these \nteaching funds; let's take this Eisenhower grant; let's take the class \nsize grant, put it into a pot of money, and then give the States and \nlocal school districts the opportunity to use that money in four \ndifferent areas. They can hire more teachers for their classroom if \nthat is what they think they need. They can, if they need to, say to a \nteacher who may be leaving for the private sector: You are too good. We \ncannot afford to lose you. We will pay you some more money. They can, \nif they have a teacher in a classroom who maybe isn't quite up to speed \non the academic issue they are teaching, say we are going to get some \noutside assistance; we are going to help you get your credentials up to \nspeed; we are going to give you some money to help you get some more \neducation. Or they can give the teacher some technical support in order \nto assist that teacher.\n  They can make those decisions. We do not make them on the floor of \nthe Senate. We do not tell the people who are running the local school \nboards: You must do this; you must do that. We do not tell that to the \nprincipals, the teachers, or the students that, or the parents of the \nstudents. We would rather say: Under the Teacher Empowerment Act, here \nare four uses for this pot of money. You make the decision.\n  Isn't that much more logical?\n  We are not saying that the idea of reducing the ratio in a classroom \nis bad. In fact, we are saying it is a good idea in many instances. In \nfact, we are saying it is one heck of a good idea if you have a good \nteacher. We are, however, saying that in those classrooms where the \nprincipal knows maybe he doesn't have the right teacher or she doesn't \nhave the right teacher coming in, or maybe that teacher does not know \nenough about the subject of teaching, that they ought to have other \ntools available to them to make those teachers more effective.\n  Interestingly enough, the studies have shown that by making teachers \nmore effective in the classroom you can teach a lot more kids a lot \nbetter at a lot less cost than by going out and hiring unqualified \nteachers or teachers who maybe aren't cutting it. It costs about $450 \nper student to bring a classroom into compliance with some of these \nproposals that are being proposed today, but if you were to do it \nthrough technology, it costs, I think, $90 per student. I think that \nwas, again, a Rand study.\n  We are saying on this side of the aisle, let's give the local school \nboard the flexibility to adjust the classroom size. If they want to go \nto a ratio of 10 to 1, they can use the money to hire more teachers to \ndo it. If they want a ratio, however, of 17 or 18 to 1, which is the \naverage ratio today, if they want that teacher to learn more to be able \nto teach better, they should have that option. And that option is going \nto be made available under the TEA amendment, which is known as title \nII of this act.\n  I think it also ought to be noted that the resources are committed in \nthis area. The President has made a major commitment in the area of \nresources to teacher improvement and to class size. He has funded in \nhis budget to the tune of $2.6 billion the money necessary to do \nteacher improvement and class size.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia, whose amendment is coming up which I \nam not speaking to. I suspect he wants to say something about his \namendment before it gets voted on. I yield to the Senator from Virginia \nso he can tell us what his amendment is about before we vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see my colleague seeking recognition. I \nam in no hurry.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Virginia wants to \nspeak on his amendment. If I could have 1 minute by unanimous consent \nto speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire who has spoken eloquently and passionately.\n  I remind our colleagues that the class reduction bill is not a \nmandate from the Federal Government. It is a Federal partnership from \nthe Federal Government to our classroom and to our schools that want to \nreduce class size in the first, second, and third grades.\n  I also let our colleagues know that the California experiment which \nthe Senator from New Hampshire spoke of had teachers who were hired \nthat were unqualified. I agree that we don't want that to happen. That \nis exactly why in our amendment we require fully qualified teachers to \nbe hired if these Federal funds are used.\n  I point out that a study has shown even in the California class size \nreduction reform they didn't require fully qualified teachers. Test \nscores are up and student achievement is improving. Test results have \nbeen released in the last week that show student scores are up in those \nclasses because they reduced class size. Reducing class size does make \na difference.\n  We target a number of areas in this bill from reading first to \ntechnology, to training math and science teachers. We should also \ntarget money for class size reduction.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I might quickly conclude, as the Senator \nfrom Virginia is not quite ready, the President's $2.6 billion for \nteacher improvement and class size reduction will be available at the \noption of the local community under the TEA legislation, which is a \nvery significant increase over last year's funding level.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \nset aside for 2 minutes to allow the Senator from Virginia to explain \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could we \nmake that 5 minutes so he and I can share the time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Certainly. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 383 to Amendment No. 358, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I found a technical deficiency in the \nmanner in\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\nwhich the amendment is drawn. It is a very simple one. It does not \nchange in any way the thrust of the amendment. I would like to send to \nthe desk at this time a technical change to my amendment and ask that \nit be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 383), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a sense of the Senate regarding tax relief for \n               elementary and secondary level educators)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX RELIEF FOR \n                   ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The average salary for an elementary and secondary \n     school teacher in the United States with a Master's degree \n     and 16 years of experience is approximately $40,582.\n       (2) The average starting salary for teachers in the United \n     States is $26,000.\n       (3) Our educators make many personal and financial \n     sacrifices to educate our youth.\n       (4) Teachers spend on average $408 a year, out of their own \n     money, to bring educational supplies into their classrooms.\n       (5) Educators spend significant money out of their own \n     pocket every year on professional development expenses so \n     they can better educate our youth.\n       (6) Many educators accrue significant higher education \n     student loans that must be repaid and whereas these loans are \n     accrued by educators in order for them to obtain degrees \n     necessary to become qualified to serve in our nation's \n     schools.\n       (7) As a result of these numerous out of pocket expenses \n     that our teachers spend every year, and other factors, 6% of \n     the nation's teaching force leaves the profession every year, \n     and 20% of all new hires leave the teaching profession within \n     three years.\n       (8) This country is in the midst of a teacher shortage, \n     with estimates that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed \n     by 2009 because of teacher attrition, teacher retirement, and \n     increased student enrollment.\n       (9) The federal government can and should play a role to \n     help alleviate the nation's teaching shortage.\n        (10) The current tax code provides little recognition of \n     the fact that our educators spend significant money out of \n     their own pocket to better the education of our children.\n       (11) President Bush has recognized the importance of \n     providing teachers with additional tax relief, in recognition \n     of the many financial sacrifices our teachers make.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) pass legislation providing elementary and secondary \n     level educators with additional tax relief in recognition of \n     the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses educators incur \n     to improve the education of our Nation's students.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I wish to say that the thoughts I \nembrace in my amendment have been advanced in this Chamber by other \ncolleagues over a number years. I particularly wish to recognize the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and Senator Kyl, who have made similar \nefforts through the years. Therefore, I am very proud to have my name \non this amendment. I assure you that there are many Senators, and, \nindeed, some on the other side, who have embraced this general concept \nthat teachers need equal recognition to the emphasis that has been put \nthus far on the debate on students.\n  My effort on this day, which is National Teachers Day--I think we \nhave slowly worked through the system a resolution to that effect--is \nto recognize that many, many teachers across our Nation reach into \ntheir pockets and withdraw aftertax dollars and expend them for little \nthings they observe in their daily teaching of students that are needed \nin the classroom. These teachers also have to constantly bring \nthemselves up to speed on current events in education. Many of them \nhave very burdensome financial commitments with student loans, and so \nforth.\n  I think it is time the Congress recognize this profession. For so \nmany years nursing and teaching were the two professions that were open \nto many, and now, fortunately, all the professions have been opened, \nand I hope equal opportunity is being given women in so many \nprofessions. There are now opportunities to leave teaching and seek \nhigher pay in these particular positions.\n  This is an amendment which simply says it is the sense of this \ninstitution that in the course of our deliberation on the various tax \nproposals that have come from the House and which are now beginning in \nthe Senate Finance Committee--of which my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman is a member--that it would at some point take into \nconsideration this type of legislation.\n  I have requested $1,000, which is a pretty substantial sum. My hope \nis that we can get the maximum. But I thought we would try at that \nparticular level.\n  I have discussed this with my colleague, the distinguished manager. I \nknow he has a few views. I would be happy to yield for his questions \nand make it technically feasible for him to take the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come from a teaching family. My mother \nand sister are teachers. I know of the effort they put into teaching \nand buying supplies to make things go a little bit better. It is very \ncommon and accepted in the sense that it is sort of part of the job. \nBut it shouldn't be.\n  We are at a time when our teachers' salaries are so much lower than \nthey ought to be. I think it is wrong to expect teachers to \ncontinuously take money out of their pockets in doing their job, when \nit should be taken care of through the school system. I think they \nwould appreciate and are entitled to have a tax credit of $1,000 to \ntake care of those expenditures. I will pursue that in the Finance \nCommittee for my good friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I presume the Senator supports Senators \nvoting for this measure?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. I think it is one of the best amendments we will \nhave.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered, am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Warner, in introducing this proposal. Senator Warner deserves \ncredit for focusing our attention on the selfless efforts of teachers, \nand on the financial sacrifices they make, to improve their \ninstructional skills and the classrooms where they teach. As President \nBush has put it, ``Teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay \nwith their wallets.''\n  Our amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should \npass legislation providing teachers with tax relief in recognition of \nthe many out-of-pocket, unreimbursed expenses they incur to improve the \neducation of our children. Our amendment is targeted to support the \nexpenditures of teachers who strive for excellence beyond the \nconstraints of what their schools provide. Yet our amendment is broad \nenough to embrace a number of different approaches to supporting our \nteachers through the tax code.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Teacher Support Act of 2001, \nwhich is supported by good friends, Senators Kyl, Landrieu, and \nCochran.\n  Our bill has two major provisions. First, it would allow teachers and \nteacher's aides to take an above-the-line deduction for their \nprofessional development expenses. Second, the bill would grant \neducators a tax credit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and equipment \nthat they purchase for their students.\n  According to a study by the National Education Association, the \naverage public school teacher spends more than $400 annually on \nclassroom materials. This sacrifice is typical of the dedication of so \nmany teachers to their students.\n  So often, teachers in Maine and throughout the country spend their \nown money to better the classroom experiences of their students. I \nrecently met with Idella Harter, president of the Maine Education \nAssociation, who told me of the books, rewards for student behavior, \nand other materials that she routinely purchased for her classroom. One \nyear, Idella saved all of her receipts from purchases of classroom \nmaterials. She started adding up all the\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nreceipts and was startled to discover that they totaled over $1,000! \nShe said that she decided she better stop counting at that point.\n  And Idella is not alone, Maureen Marshall, who handles education \nissues in my office, taught public school for several years in Hawaii \nand Virginia. In her first year as a teacher, she spent well over \n$1,000 of her own money on educational software, books, pocket charts \nto assist with language arts instruction, and other materials. And yet, \nbecause of her tax situation, she could not deduct these expenses from \nher taxable income.\n  The ultimate beneficiaries of efforts to provide financial assistance \nto our teachers are our students. Other than involved parents, a well-\nqualified teacher is the most important prerequisite for student \nsuccess. Educational researchers have demonstrated the close \nrelationship between qualified educators and successful students. \nMoreover, educators themselves understand how important professional \ndevelopment is to maintaining and extending their levels of competence. \nWhen I meet with teachers from Maine, they repeatedly tell me of their \nneed for more professional development and the scarcity of financial \nsupport for this worthy pursuit.\n  I greatly admire the many educators who have voluntarily financed \nadditional education to improve their skills and to serve their \nstudents better and who purchase books, supplies, equipment and other \nmaterials that enhance their teaching. By enacting modest changes to \nour tax code, we can encourage educators to continue to take formal \ncourse work in the subject matter that they teach and to attend \nconferences to give them new ideas for presenting course work in a \nchallenging manner.\n  I hope that, by adopting this amendment, which is particularly \nfitting on National Teacher Day, we will pave the way for passage of \nmeaningful tax relief for teachers later this year.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this, there are no further votes this evening. \nThe next vote occurs at 9:35 on Wednesday. However, I understand \nSenators are ready to go with amendments or second-degree amendments. \nWe will continue to work on that as long as we can get Senators to \noffer their amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered will \nimprove the coordination, accountability and delivery of educational \nservices in states all across America. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Bayh and Senator Ben Nelson in introducing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, Senator Bayh, Senator \nNelson and I served as Governors of our respective states; they served \nin Indiana and Nebraska respectively, and I served as Governor of Ohio \nfor 8 years. As my state's chief executive, I learned that few \nindividuals have more of an impact on education policy in their state \nthan the Governor.\n  Yet, under federal law, governors--the men and women who are their \nstate's CEOs--are not able to fully participate in their state's \neducation planning process.\n  Mr. President, most federal education assistance to our states \ncurrently flows directly to state education departments, where a large \npercentage of that funding is then passed on to local schools.\n  State plans submitted by state education departments to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education set the parameters that local school officials \nmust subsequently follow in developing and implementing their own \nspending plans. However, there is no requirement that governors be \ninvolved in this process, nor is there any requirement for coordination \nbetween Chief State School Officers and Governors on the use or \ndisposition of federal education dollars.\n  In some states, the Chief State School Officers are appointed by \nGovernors and are, therefore, accountable\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\nto them, while in other states, Chief State School Officers are elected \ndirectly by the people. If these individuals share the same political \nleanings, there is usually little conflict on education policy. \nHowever, where governors and chief state school officers do not see \neye-to-eye, potential conflict can arise that could threaten the \neducational needs of our children.\n  Regardless of how a state's top education official achieves his or \nher position, in each and every state, it is the governor the public \nholds accountable for the overall condition and success of public \nschools. As it is currently written, the Senate's ESEA reauthorization \nbill also holds governors accountable for student progress, even where \ngovernors have no current discretion over Federal education programs \nand Federal education funding.\n  This accountability issue is magnified under the legislation we are \nconsidering. Under Title VI of this bill, States may lose between 30 \nand 75 percent of their administrative funds for formula programs if \nStates fail to meet specified performance requirements.\n  If a State budgets those administrative funds and they are lost as a \nresult of this bill, then the entire State budget could be impacted. \nOhio, for example, received $3.1 million in Title I administrative \nfunds last year. If Ohio were to lose 75 percent of these funds, that \nwould mean about $2.33 million would have to come from somewhere else \nin the state budget.\n  Governors do play a leadership role in the development of State \neducation policy, including standards and assessments, and the \nallocation of State budget resources for public education. Governors \nare willing to be held accountable for Federal programs as well, but it \nis imperative that the Federal Government give them the authority to \nhelp determine reform through Federal education programs.\n  It doesn't make sense, that a Governor, who has to manage the State's \nbudget and is accountable for any shortfall, is not required to be \nconsulted when State educational officers set education priorities.\n  Our amendment hopes to change that.\n  What our amendment is designed to do, is very simple: it encourages \nconsolidation and coordination between Governors and chief State school \nofficers in designing State education reform plans.\n  Under our amendment, State education plans submitted to the U.S. \nSecretary of Education for Federal programs, as well as funding for the \nschool improvement program, must be jointly signed by both the Governor \nand the chief State school officer--both of them.\n  The timing of this amendment is critical, since once Congress passes \nESEA reauthorization this year, each State will finalize their \neducational plans and priorities. State legislatures will consider \nfunding and resource issues, chief State schools officers will consult \nlocal districts, and Governors will set out plans for educational \npriorities throughout the State.\n  Speaking from personal experience, having the Governor and the chief \nState school officer working together is absolutely critical. Having \nthese two individuals working independently on education policy does \nnot maximize our ability to achieve the educational goals the President \nhas set out and that this Congress has set out. I believe we need to \nrequire both signatures.\n  Our amendment will also help leverage State resources. As my \ncolleagues know, the Federal contribution to education amounts to only \n7 percent, with the State and locals funding the remaining 93 percent \nof education spending in the State.\n  Requiring joint sign off on education plans by the Governor and the \nchief State school officer enables the Governor to leverage and ensure \ncoordination of the much larger pot of state education funding to work \nwith the Federal dollars. The only way to fully leverage Federal funds \nis to ensure the coordination of these funds with State efforts.\n  Governors are the national leaders in education reform. I remember as \nGovernor of Ohio, we pushed for EdFlex authority from this body so that \nwe could have the flexibility to combine programs and target funds \nwhere they were needed. Governors like Bill Clinton in Arkansas, \nRichard Reilly in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee \nbecame well known nationally on education, not because of what they did \nin Washington, but because as Governors they innovated to improve \neducation in their States. Our current President, George W. Bush, ran \nfor President partly to share with the rest of America, the successful \neducation plan he had implemented in Texas.\n  What ultimately matters--and what should drive our decisions on \neducation policy--is whether or not our students learn. That is really \nwhat we are talking about in this debate. We must coordinate policies \nso that there is a consensus on education in the state for the benefit \nof our students. Education is too important to have our different \nstakeholders working separately. Our Governors and chief State school \nofficers must be working together.\n  Our amendment will foster greater cooperation between all State \nofficials responsible under State law for the performance of public \nschools. It will also help to ensure that state plans submitted for \napproval by the Department of Education align with the implementation \nof State accountability legislation. It is of vital importance that \nchief State school officers and Governors work together to establish \neducation goals in their States.\n  I might add, Mr. President, this amendment is strongly supported by \nthe National Governors' Association.\n  As a former Governor who had education as one of my highest \npriorities, I am offering this amendment to make sure that the highest \nelected official of every State is a full partner with Congress in the \neffort to implement true reform. I urge my colleagues to support our \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Has an order for speaking time been reached?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no such order reached.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask the Chair, I think when the leaders \nasked, there was a recognition that in order to move the process \nforward, Senator Voinovich, Senator Specter--I see the leader is here--\nthere was a recognition that Senator Feinstein was to speak briefly, \nSenator Mikulski--we have agreed to consider her amendment--and Senator \nCarnahan. I don't know whether consent was agreed to, but I think that \nwas generally the thought.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If I could generally have the opportunity to speak \nafter the last speaker, I will appreciate it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is being very gracious. There, correctly, \nwas not a consent agreement, but I think there was sort of a \ngentleperson's agreement to try to move the scheduling along. I think I \nwill be here when the Senator speaks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand. That will be acceptable? Do we have an \nunderstanding of the time the Senators will use?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Carnahan, as I understand, would like to address \nthe Chair and introduce her amendment and set it aside. Am I correct?\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask consent she be recognized for that purpose. Then \nthe Senator from California intends to introduce her amendment and \nspeak briefly. After that, the Senator from Maryland, for whatever time \nshe might use. After that, the Senator from Alabama.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I might respond to the Democratic Chair of the \nEducation Committee, I intend to speak no more than 10 minutes and \nprobably even less.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we could ask unanimous consent to that order, and \nthen I ask if I can be recognized after the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that is the order in which \nSenators will speak.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment pending right now is the \nVoinovich amendment.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To improve the quality of education in our Nation's \n                              classrooms)\n\n       On page 319, line 4, insert ``, including teaching \n     specialists in core academic subjects'' after ``principals''.\n       On page 326, line 1, insert ``, including strategies to \n     implement a year-round school schedule that will allow the \n     local educational agency to increase pay for veteran teachers \n     and reduce the agency's need to hire additional teachers or \n     construct new facilities'' after ``performance''.\n       On page 327, line 2, insert ``as well as teaching \n     specialists in core academic subjects who will provide \n     increased individualized instruction to students served by \n     the local educational agency participating in the eligible \n     partnership'' after ``qualified''.\n       On page 517, line 18, strike ``and''.\n       On page 517, line 20, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 517, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       ``(I) alternative programs for the education and discipline \n     of chronically violent and disruptive students.\n       On page 528, line 11, strike ``and''.\n       On page 528, line 14, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 528, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(16) alternative programs for the education and \n     discipline of chronically violent and disruptive students.\n       On page 539, line 10, strike ``and''.\n       On page 539, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       ``(E) alternative programs for the education and discipline \n     of chronically violent and disruptive students; and''.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, it has been suggested that families and \ncommunities give us roots, but our schools give us wings--the wings of \nopportunity that come with a solid educational background.\n  I commend President Bush for putting education at the top of the \nnational agenda. His goal to ``leave no child behind'' is one that all \nof us in the Congress should support. Indeed, education is a cause that \nall Americans can rally behind. For it is in the common interest to \nprepare our children for success. If we are interested in increased \nprosperity, higher productivity, safer streets, lower welfare rolls, \nand reduced need for government services, the place to start is in our \npublic schools.\n  The Better Education for Students and Teachers Act that we are \ndebating today is an important first step. It is the product of arduous \nand painstaking negotiations on the part of my colleagues and the Bush \nadministration. It represents bipartisan consensus. I applaud all those \ninvolved, who have put our children ahead of politics.\n  The legislation will bring greater accountability to our school \nsystem. It will mean increased testing, targeted support for failing \nschools, and new options for parents. The core principle behind the act \nis that we can identify low-performing schools through rigorous testing \nand then give them the resources they need to turn themselves around.\n  The bill is based on successful models that have been developed at \nthe state level.\n  In Missouri, we have a comprehensive accountability system in place \ncalled the Missouri Assessment Program, or MAP.\n  These tests measure student progress in math, reading, science, and \nsocial studies to see if kids are meeting what we like to call the \n``Show-Me Standards.''\n  Now I am not one who feels that increased spending automatically \ntranslates into improved results. But I do believe a key element of the \nreform effort is to provide troubled schools with the resources they \nneed to improve performance.\n  The first piece of legislation I introduced--the Quality classrooms \nAct--is designed to fit in the context of this overall education reform \neffort.\n  The Quality classrooms Act calls for a new investment in our schools, \nyet offers flexibility at the local level.\n  It provides school districts with the option of using funds on any of \nfive proven programs: hiring new teachers; building more classrooms; \nhiring teaching specialists in core subjects such as reading, math, and \nscience; creating alternative discipline programs; and instituting \nyear-round school schedules.\n  These are commonsense provisions that meet basic needs. And I am \npleased that the first two ideas--class size reduction and school \nconstruction--are already part of the education debate.\n  Today, I am introducing an amendment to accomplish the other three \nelements of the Quality Classrooms Act: specialists for core subjects; \nalternative discipline programs; and year round school programs.\n  This amendment is about flexibility, not mandates. Like the Quality \nClassrooms Act, this amendment recognizes that local districts area \nbest suited to make decisions about their needs.\n  The amendment proposes more teaching specialists because studies show \nthat reducing class size is more cost effective when focused on certain \nsubjects.\n  A good example of this is ``Success for All'' a program which enlists \nretired teachers and other part-timers as reading instructors. The \ninstructors are carefully trained and focus on small groups of \nchildren.\n  More than 700 schools have participated in this program, and have \nachieved impressive results. Students enjoy learning more, are more \nengaged, and develop closer bonds with their teachers.\n  I point out, too, that this amendment will allow funds to be used for \nalternative programs for violent and disruptive students.\n  Ask any teacher, and they will tell you that one or two chronically \ndisruptive students can destroy the learning environment for the entire \nclass.\n  Schools need the flexibility and authority to provide safe and \neffective classrooms for all.\n  At the same time, we must make sure that districts can provide \nappropriate educational resources for disruptive students.\n  Under Missouri law, a teenager who carries a gun to school can be \nexpelled and prohibited from returning to the traditional public \nschool.\n  In some areas of the state, there is simply no alternative program \navailable to this student.\n  Turning disruptive and potentially violent students out onto the \nstreets without an education is a recipe for disaster.\n  However, in some parts of the state, districts have been able to \ncreate very effective programs for these students, relying on \nalternative education grants under Missouri's Safe Schools Act. Often, \nthe alternative programs provide students with their last chance to \nreceive an education.\n  In the Kirkwood School District, an alternative school has helped \nstudents improve their grades, behavior and attendance.\n  Those participating in the program have a different learning plan \ntailored to their needs.\n  Alternative programs open the door for creativity in working with \ndisruptive students. The Kirkwood program, for example, collaborates \nwith the juvenile court system. police officers meet with students and \nlead discussions on controlling anger, on drugs and alcohol abuse, and \non decision-making.\n  As a result, discipline problems dropped dramatically. A total of 166 \nreferrals to school administrators were made for students in the school \nyear before they started in the alternative program. The following \nyear, this number dropped to 73. School officials noted that fewer \nreferrals saved the school ``at least 90 hours of administrative \ntime.''\n  Mr. President, the goal of my amendment is to recognize, reward, and \nencourage that kind of innovation and success.\n  And finally, the amendment will help school districts implement a \nyear-round school schedule where it might be appropriate.\n  Studies have shown that a year-round school schedule increases \nstudent achievement. Teachers in traditional nine-month schools often \nspend\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\nthree to six weeks in the fall reviewing material that was taught \nduring the previous year.\n  A year-round program can work well for at-risk or learning disabled \nstudents who may be struggling to grasp and retain information.\n  In addition, year-round schools can be a way to use facilities more \nefficiently. Some overcrowded schools stagger student attendance, so \nthat one group is on vacation during each grading period.\n  In one district that grows by 1,500 kids a year, the district \nimplemented a staggered, year-round schedule. This allows them to serve \n2,000 additional children in a given academic year.\n  Of course, a year-round approach may not be right for some districts. \nFor example, in rural areas, students often play a key role on family \nfarms during the summer months. That is why this amendment allows each \ndistrict to make the choice for itself.\n  There is no ``one-size-fits-all'' approach for our schools. Our \nschools and local districts need flexibility so they can make \nappropriate choices. My amendment will add to the flexibility that the \nbill already provides. I look forward to working with the manager and \nhope the amendment will receive widespread support.\n  This debate has given us an unique opportunity to improve education \nin America. Major progress is within our grasp. Our support for these \ninnovative reforms will give our children the wings of opportunity \nneeded for success.\n  Let us seize this opportunity and do what is right for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 392 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 327, after line 10, add the following:\n       (7) Carrying out programs and activities related to Master \n     Teachers.\n       (2) Master teacher.--The term ``master teacher'' means a \n     teacher who--\n       (A) is licensed or credentialed under State law in the \n     subject or grade in which the teacher teaches;\n       (B) has been teaching for at least 5 years in a public or \n     private school or institution of higher education;\n       (C) is selected upon application, is judged to be an \n     excellent teacher, and is recommended by administrators and \n     other teachers who are knowledgeable of the individual's \n     performance;\n       (D) at the time of submission of such application, is \n     teaching and based in a public school;\n       (E) assists other teachers in improving instructional \n     strategies, improves the skills of other teachers, performs \n     mentoring, develops curriculum, and offers other professional \n     development; and\n       (F) enters into a contract with the local educational \n     agency to continue to teach and serve as a master teacher for \n     at least 5 additional years.\n\n     A contract described in subparagraph (F) shall include \n     stipends, employee benefits, a description of duties and work \n     schedule, and other terms of employment.\n       (e) Study and Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than July 1, 2005, the Secretary \n     shall conduct a study and transmit a report to Congress \n     pertaining to the utilization of funds under section 2123 for \n     Master Teachers.\n       (2) Contents of report.--The report shall include an \n     analysis of:\n       (A)(i) the recruitment and retention of experienced \n     teachers;\n       (ii) the effect of master teachers on teaching by less \n     experienced teachers;\n       (iii) the impact of mentoring new teachers by master \n     teachers;\n       (iv) the impact of master teachers on student achievement; \n     and\n       (v) the reduction in the rate of attrition of beginning \n     teachers; and\n       (B) recommendations regarding establishing activities to \n     expand the project to additional local educational agencies \n     and school districts.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing an amendment to \nauthorize school districts to use teacher training funds authorized \nunder the bill to create master teachers.\n  The bill before us authorizes $3 billion for FY 2002 Title II, \nteacher training. Under this amendment, school districts could use some \nof these funds to create master teacher positions.\n  If, for example, $200 million were spent on master teachers, 6,600 \nmaster teacher positions could be created if each master teacher were \npaid $30,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary.\n  What is this all about? Why am I doing it? One of the things I have \ndiscovered is it is difficult to keep good teachers in the classroom. \nThe Senator from Vermont is in the Chamber. I can't tell him how many \ntimes I have given an award to a teacher of the year, or a teacher of \nthe month, and they accept it and say they are leaving the classroom. I \nask: Why are you leaving the classroom? Because I got a better job in \nSilicon Valley; or I am going to become an administrator.\n  When you ask why they are going to become an administrator, it is \nbecause of more money. The average teacher's salary is about $40,000 a \nyear. In California, it is $45,000 a year. So you can work 10 or 15 \nyears for that amount of money, but you can become an administrator at \n$65,000 or $70,000 a year and support your family.\n  So the idea occurred to me, what if we were to have a master teacher \nprogram and allow teachers who have taught in the classrooms for 5 \nyears--if they have certain credentials--to become a master teacher and \nreceive the salary equal to that of an administrator?\n  What would the criteria be? Under this amendment, the teacher would \nbe credentialed, have at least 5 years of teaching experience, and be \nadjudged to be an excellent teacher by administrators and teachers who \nare knowledgeable about this teacher's performance. The teacher would \nhave to be currently teaching and willing to enter into a contract to \nteach for another 5 years.\n  The master teacher, then, would become a mentor teacher, would help \nother teachers in improving instruction and strengthening teacher \nskills, would mentor less-experienced teachers, help develop \ncurriculum, and provide other professional development.\n  What is interesting is that 25 percent of beginning teachers do not \nteach more than 2 years. Nearly 40 percent leave in the first 5 years. \nFor my State, this is a huge problem. We have 284,030 teachers \ncurrently, and in the next 10 years we have to hire an additional \n300,000 teachers.\n  California's rate of student enrollment is three times the national \naverage. Therefore, we have to hire 26,000 new teachers every year.\n  If they teach 2 years, and we lose them because they can get a better \njob elsewhere, or we lose a good teacher who has taught 6 or 7 or 8 or \n10 years because that teacher wants to become an administrator to make \na higher salary, we lose teaching skills in the classroom.\n  So I thought we could try to see if these excellent teachers would \nwork in the classrooms for an additional 5 years, be willing to mentor \nother teachers, be credentialed teachers, and stay in the classrooms \nand become master teachers to help other teachers.\n  There are some existing mentoring programs. I worked earlier with \nAdam Urbanski, a teacher in Rochester, NY, who pointed out to me very \nclearly how mentoring programs keep teachers in the classroom. It \noccurred to me that master teachers could produce very good dividends.\n  One of the key things about all of this is that we expect so much \nfrom our teachers and we pay them so little. I think California is one \nof the highest cost-of-living areas in the Nation. Yet teachers earn \n$45,000. Their salary is limited.\n  I would like to say to the chairman of the committee, who is in this \nChamber, it is my understanding that the amendment is acceptable on \nboth sides. I am very pleased. I intend to follow this closely. I hope \nwe have a whole series of master teachers one day that burgeon \nthroughout the Nation, that lead the way in keeping good teachers in \nthe classroom, to increase teachers' salaries, and to increase the \nperformance of the average classroom teacher.\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\n  I thank very much the chairman of the committee for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe we can accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Is there any objection to the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 392) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nVoinovich amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 379\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 379.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is \nvery straightforward. It is a great public investment in getting our \nchildren ready for their future.\n  What this amendment does is provide for the establishment of \ncommunity technology centers in the United States under the provisions \nof th Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It would authorize $100 \nmillion to create 1,000 community-based tech centers around the \ncountry. These centers would be created and run by community-based \ngroups, such as the YMCA, the Urban League, or even a public library.\n  The Federal Government would provide competitive grants to these \ncommunity-based groups. By the third year of funding at least half of \nthe funds come from the private sector. In year one, 30 percent comes \nfrom private sector and in year two, 40 percent must come from the \nprivate sector. Again, by year three the funding would be 50-50; 50 \npercent from the Federal Government and 50 percent from the community-\nbased groups. This is truly an excellent example of a public private-\npartnership and maximization of federal funds.\n  By funding community technology centers, we will be helping to build \npublic-private partnerships around the country. I want to stress that \nthe private, nonprofit sector is eager to form these partnerships.\n  Why do we need this amendment? First of all, in the President's \neducation bill there is no provision for community technology centers. \nThe President's budget indicates he would make it a permissible use \nunder HUD to be taken out of community development block grant money. \nSo why do we want this in ESEA? We want it in ESEA because essentially \nit takes technology education to where people learn in their \ncommunities.\n  What would this mean for local communities? It would mean a safe \nhaven for children where they could learn how to use computers--use \nthem to do homework--use them to access the Internet. It means job \ntraining for adults who could use the technology centers to either get \nnew skills and new tools to enter the new economy or to upgrade their \nskills.\n  Also, these centers would serve all regions, races, and ethnic \ngroups. They will be where they are needed, where there is often \nlimited access to technology. They will be in urban, rural, and \nsuburban areas. They will be in Appalachia and Native American \nreservations, and urban centers.\n  Why do we need those? First of all, I want to acknowledge the \nfantastic work that Senator Jeffords has done in advocating something \ncalled the 21st century learning centers. He has, indeed, been a great \nadvocate of that, along with his colleague, Senator Judd Gregg. They \nreally have been excellent in establishing these learning centers.\n  They are excellent programs, but they are primarily in schools. Most \nof them are only for children. And most of them operate during very \nspecific hours. Some are open just a few hours a day; most do not \nnecessarily focus on technology. I want to acknowledge that the one in \nVermont is open weekends and even in the summer. So Vermont is really \ndoing a great job.\n  But why do we need these community tech centers in the community? In \nsome places schools are either too worn out or too dated to be wired \nfor the future. We have school facilities in desperate need of \nmodernization. And the poorer the community, usually the poorer the \nphysical condition of the school. Community Technology Centers would \nensure that technology is in the community.\n  Second, it is multigenerational. This means it could be used during \nthe day for adults and seniors and in the afternoons for structured \nafterschool activities for children, bringing them to technology. It \nalso could be open at night and on weekends. Also, it removes barriers \nto learning.\n  In many of our communities, new immigrants are shy about coming into \nschools, particularly adults. There is the need to reach out to men who \nvery often want to upgrade their skills, to be able to come into a new \nworkforce. Certainly, in my own community of Baltimore we see that. But \nthey can sometimes feel awkward at age 28, 38, or 48 walking into a \nschool building. But they would walk into a community tech center. This \nis why we believe that in addition to the 21st century learning \ncenters, these community technology centers are needed.\n\n  Let me cite a few examples. The Baltimore Urban League received a \ngrant to create a community tech center. They created a computer \nclubhouse, an afterschool computer center for teenagers. The young \npeople were taught computer skills. They also then teach other young \npeople. They are engaging in desktop publishing. During the day, it is \nused for career development, focused on Welfare-to-Work.\n  In rural Odem, TX, we have another example of a community tech center \nthat both worked with the people in the community but was also a source \nfor distance learning. In a school district in Arizona, it helped young \nNative Americans enter the high-tech workforce.\n  I could go on with example after example. Let me tell my colleagues \nthis: Thanks to the leadership of Senators Harkin and Specter, and \nLabor-HHS, they funded community tech centers through appropriations. \nBe aware that they were never authorized. Essentially, Harkin and \nSpecter just went ahead and did it. God bless them for doing it. But \nthey could only, because of the lack of authorization, fund very few of \nthese programs. In 1999, over 750 community organizations applied for \ncommunity technology center money. Under the great leadership of \nHarkin-Specter, there was only enough money to give grants to 40 of \nthese community organizations.\n  There is so much pent-up need, it points to why my legislation is \nneeded. I believe we do not have a worker shortage in the United \nStates--we have a skills shortage. Even with dot-coms now dot-bombing, \nthere still is a great need for technology workers. In fact, in \npractically every field technology literacy is needed. Manufacturing in \nmy own State has gone from smokestack to cyberstack. We must have \npeople with the skills who are ready. We don't have a worker shortage \nin this country; we have a skill shortage in this country. In addition \nto schools and libraries, to have 1,000 community technology centers \nwould be a welcome addition into these communities and neighborhoods \nfor people to have the opportunity to truly enter this new world.\n  My legislation is endorsed by groups such as the National Council of \nLa Raza, the NAACP headquartered in my own State, the American Library \nAssociation, the American Association of Community Colleges, and also \nthe Computer and Communications Industry Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                           Community Colleges,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The American Association of \n     Community Colleges (AACC) endorses your amendment to the \n     ``Better Education for Students and Teachers Act,'' to set \n     the authorization of funding for Community Technology Centers \n     at $100 million. AACC represents over 1,100 community \n     colleges across the country.\n       This program has allowed community colleges to become \n     stronger partners with their communities and has allowed them \n     to help provide access to computers, the Internet, and \n     technology to maximize participation in the digital economy. \n     Some of the community college projects currently funded \n     provided basic computer skills instruction, video \n     conferencing links, after-school programs, welfare-to-work \n     programs and educational counseling services. The programs \n     offered at community colleges serve everyone from pre-school \n     children to adults seeking lifelong learning opportunities.\n       This is a valuable program because it helps communities to \n     jointly address their challenges. The coalitions funded \n     through these programs secure non-federal matching \n     contributions and also work extensively with each other to \n     develop programs to help overcome the digital divide. The \n     federal funds provided, which cannot exceed fifty percent of \n     total project funds, provide critical seed money that will \n     establish firm foundations for project activities. Community \n     technology centers should be permanently authorized and \n     funded at levels to provide technological opportunity to \n     those who need it.\n       The American Association of Community colleges urges all \n     Senators to support your amendment to this critical \n     legislation. We thank you for spearheading this initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  George R. Boggs,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2000.\n     Senator Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR) thanks you for your effort to bring the promise of \n     computer technology to communities that currently do not have \n     equitable access to this important educational tool. In \n     particular, we would like to express our support for your \n     amendment to authorize the Computer Technology Centers (CTC) \n     program.\n       The transition from an industrial economy to one based on \n     information and technology presents numerous possibilities \n     and challenges. For Hispanics, the advent of the information \n     superhighway provides new educational opportunities. However, \n     it also may further widen existing educational achievement \n     gaps between Hispanics and non-Hispanics.\n       Studies have shown that the use of computers at home helps \n     improve academic achievement. Yet, Hispanic students have \n     less access to a computer with Internet access at home as \n     compared to White students. In fact, White households are \n     almost twice as likely (46 percent) to own a computer than \n     Hispanic (25 percent) households.\n       While there has been some success in infusing education \n     technology in America's schools, Hispanics continue to lag \n     behind their non-Hispanic peers in this area. Contrary to the \n     national statistics, schools and communities serving low-\n     income and minority students, including Hispanics, are still \n     very far behind their peers in gaining access.\n       Schools with a high number of low-income or minority \n     students have less access to computers and the Internet than \n     do affluent schools. For example, in 1998, schools with more \n     than 71 percent of its students receiving free or reduced-\n     price lunches had only 39 percent of the instructional rooms \n     connected to the internet. In comparison, schools with 11 to \n     30 percent of such students had Internet connections in 53 \n     percent of their instructional rooms.\n       There are many programs designed to help schools to obtain \n     computers, Internet access, and teacher training. \n     Unfortunately, few are designed specifically to include \n     community-based organizations (CBOs). Lacking community-\n     controlled colleges and universities or a system of Hispanic \n     churches, CBOs are the lifeline of the Hispanic community. \n     They are in a more advantageous position to assess the needs \n     of Hispanic children and families, and have proven track \n     records in providing successful services to community \n     members. The CTCs program creates opportunities for CBOs to \n     participate as partners in bringing this technology to their \n     communities and, therefore, should be supported.\n       NCLR believes that your amendment to authorize and \n     sufficiently fund the CTCs can have a significant, positive \n     impact on the lives of many low-income Hispanic families. \n     That is why we strongly support your legislation and \n     encourage the entire Congress to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        NAACP,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2001.\n     Members,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), I am writing to inform \n     you of our strong support for the amendment being offered by \n     Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD to S.1, the reauthorization of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Specifically, the \n     Mikulski amendment would authorize $100 million for fiscal \n     year 2002 and each of the following six years to create 1000 \n     new Community Technology Centers. These centers would provide \n     disadvantaged residents of economically distressed urban and \n     rural communities with access to information technology and \n     related training. NAACP President and CEO Kweisi Mfume has \n     personally met with Senator Mikulski to discuss this issue, \n     and has made enactment of her legislation an NAACP \n     legislative priority.\n       Access to computer technology is one of, if not the most \n     single important keys to success in the 21st century. A 1998 \n     report by the independent Benton Institute estimated that by \n     the year 2000, 60% of all jobs in the United States would \n     require some computer skills. Too many Americans, either \n     because of their geographical location, or their lack of \n     economic resources, or both, are being left out of the \n     computer age. This ``digital divide'' currently affects whole \n     communities and, in the end, threatens the continued \n     prosperity of our nation. The digital divide is resulting in \n     an increased concentration of poverty and a deconcentration \n     of opportunity.\n       According to one recent study while 46% of white families \n     have computers in their homes, only 23% of African Americans \n     can make the same claim, and only 25% of Hispanic American \n     homes are currently equipped with computers. If allowed to \n     continue, this disparity will only increase disadvantages \n     faced by low income Americans and Americans of color as they \n     try to enter the work force and improve themselves and their \n     communities. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the \n     numerous studies that have been done about the digital divide \n     is that they all seem to agree that the disparities are \n     growing.\n       Community Technology Centers, as proposed by the Mikulski \n     amendment, are an important step in addressing the current \n     technological inequities. While each center is different, and \n     tailored to the community it serves, the primary goal by \n     definition is to make computers, the Internet and various \n     software packages available to children and adults who might \n     otherwise be on the losing side of the digital divide. \n     Community Technology Centers typically offer both classes as \n     well as opportunities for individuals to take personal time \n     to hone their technology skills. Classes vary from preschool \n     and family programs to after school activities, adult \n     education and courses in career development and job \n     preparation.\n       Put simply, Community Technology Centers provide \n     individuals and communities with the resources to help \n     themselves and to improve their chances at becoming educated, \n     productive Americans. I hope that you agree with me and the \n     more than 600,000 card-carrying members of the NAACP that \n     Community Technology Centers are a smart and much-needed \n     investment in the future, and that you will support the \n     Mikulski amendment. Should you have any questions, I hope you \n     will not hesitate to contact me at the NAACP Washington \n     Bureau, at (202) 638-2269 or Kimberly Ross in Senator \n     Mikulski's office at (202) 224-4654 about this important \n     amendment. Thank you in advance for your attention to this \n     matter, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and \n     this and other matters that will benefit our nation as a \n     whole.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Hilary O.

Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the American Library \n     Association, I convey our support for your Community \n     Technology Centers amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act reauthorization. This amendment would enlarge \n     the scope of possibilities for these centers, increasing \n     their numbers and enabling libraries to continue to do their \n     part in trying to bridge the ``digital divide.''\n       In Maryland, the Wicomico County Free Library has begun a \n     very successful outreach project to build bridges across the \n     digital divide in that very rural county. The library \n     currently has four centers operating in a variety of \n     community areas that are free, staffed by volunteers and, \n     with library supervision, provide technology training and \n     other services to members of the community. This outreach is \n     beginning to make a real difference and your legislation \n     could enlarge community efforts like this and allow other \n     libraries in rural parts of all states to bring access to \n     technology to their communities.\n       Thank you for your efforts to enlarge the abilities of \n     libraries and other community groups to serve the public by \n     providing access to technology tools, increased skills and \n     information,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Nancy C.

Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the Computer and \n     Communications Industry Association (CCIA), I am pleased to \n     offer our support for your legislation to provide Federal \n     finding for Community Technology Centers. This proposal would \n     benefit not only those whom it would serve in economically \n     distressed communities, but also the information technology \n     industry.\n       Your legislation recognizes the critical need for \n     policymakers and industry to address the growing ``digital \n     divide'' in our country between those with ready access to \n     computers and the Internet, and those for whom the promise of \n     technology is beyond their grasp. Our members believe that \n     technology can have a great leveling effect between the \n     wealthy and the disadvantaged by providing access to \n     information and services that have previously been \n     unavailable to many Americans.\n       In addition, our industry faces a critical shortage of \n     workers to sustain the incredible economic growth and \n     innovation that we have experienced over recent years. \n     Particularly by exposing disadvantaged children and young \n     people to technology and teaching them basic technological \n     skills, we believe that the Community Technology Centers \n     would greatly influence these students to pursue the academic \n     disciplines that will prepare them for high-tech careers. We \n     recognize that only by reaching out to all Americans will we \n     be able to fulfill our shared goals as a country and promote \n     our general welfare.\n       We commend you for introducing this excellent proposal and \n     look forward to working with you to achieve its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Jason M. Mahler,\n\n                                                Vice President and\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I could elaborate on this, but I know the Senator from \nAlabama is waiting to speak. I urge the adoption of my amendment. \nPerhaps after we hear from the distinguished chairman, who has really \nbeen a leader in new ways to teach and educate children, I will \nsubsequently ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think the Senator should ask for them now.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 378\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute or two to \nraise some concerns I have about the Murray amendment which would \nrequire schools to use Title II funding to reduce class size and would \ncost $2.4 billion.\n  Mandating class size reduction is a matter that we have to be very \ncareful about. It may sound good, and it may seem that reducing class \nsize is the right thing to do in America. And I suppose it polls well. \nI know President Clinton pushed class size reduction very hard during \nhis administration.\n  I took some time to look at the numbers and to see how this would \nwork. I visited a lot of schools in Alabama, talked to teachers and \nprincipals. I don't hear them telling me their No. 1 goal is to reduce \nclass size.\n  The serious question is, Is this a public policy that we ought to \nmandate on the schools? We know we have reduced class size \nsignificantly in the last decade or so and have gone from an average \nclass size of 30 in 1961 to an average class size of 23 in 1998. During \nthe period of time that we reduced class size, there was no improvement \nin standardized test scores.\n  We also know that schools in South Korea and in Taiwan have class \nsizes that are nearly twice ours and they have test scores better than \nours.\n  Another factor we must consider when talking about class size \nreduction is the cost. Schools would have to hire more teachers. I have \nsupported money for teachers today. But if we hire more teachers, are \nwe really getting a bang for our buck? And if we do, where are they \ngoing to teach? They can't teach out under the shade tree. They have to \nhave a classroom. That classroom has to be heated and cooled. It has to \nhave a roof over it. You have to have insurance and upkeep and \nmaintenance. That costs money.\n  If you require schools to reduce their class sizes by 25 percent, you \nhave to have 25 percent more teachers. Not only that, you have to have \n25 percent more classrooms, 25 percent more equipment, 25 percent more \ninsurance, 25 percent more maintenance. It is tremendously expensive.\n  All I am saying is, I reviewed an article in ``Education Week'' of \nSeptember 1999. It suggested that mandating class size reduction is a \nbad idea. In fact, the Education Department, as late as 1988 said \nreducing class size would have little or no positive results and would, \nin effect, be a waste of money. In fact, it would be a waste of a lot \nof money.\n  The numbers I have seen do not indicate that class size is a critical \nfactor in student education. In fact, as many studies show, smaller \nclass size seems to correspond more with lower test scores more than \nshowing an increase. One reason is that a good teacher is critical to \nlearning. If you are bringing on more teachers, you are more likely to \nbring on less qualified teachers than you have had and you could \nactually show a decline in learning.\n  I won't go on about that tonight. I know there is a strong feeling \nthat this is the right direction in which to go, but I would be very \nreluctant--and I think the Senate should be reluctant--to mandate at \nthe Federal level State school systems to undertake major class size \nreduction when we can't say with any certainty that it is worth that \nexpense, that it is going to get the kind of bang for our buck that we \nwant to get.\n  I believe that there are other things schools can do with this $2.4 \nbillion that and could produce more of an improvement in education. We \nshould leave that decision to the schools and not mandate a \n``Washington-Knows-Best'' fix.\n  I urge my colleagues to be cautious about a commitment to requiring \nschools to reduce class size, because we do not need to require our \nconstituents and our school systems to expend extraordinary sums of \nmoney if we can't be certain that it is going to receive a benefit \ncommensurate with that cost.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank our colleagues for \nremaining on the floor tonight and presenting their amendments. I think \nthese are amendments that strengthen the legislation.\n  I might mention, first of all, Senator Feinstein's amendment, which \nhas been accepted. I think it adds an additional dimension to making \nsure the mentoring system would work well between senior teachers and \nnewer teachers and will help all teachers be more effective in the \nclassroom. The mentoring system has been enormously important, not only \nin enhancing education for children, but also in terms of retaining \nteachers. In many instances, the youngest, least experienced teachers \nteach in the most challenging classrooms, and 50% of those teachers \nleave teaching in the first five years.\n  What we have also seen--and the statistics demonstrate--that when \nteachers have a mentor--pairing new teachers with a more senior \nteacher--those younger teachers develop teaching skills. They become \nbetter teachers. They feel more confident about their teaching, and \ntheir interest in staying in teaching is enhanced, and the students are \nthe beneficiaries. That is certainly something that we want to \nencourage in this legislation, and I think the Feinstein amendment \nstrengthens that particular proposal.\n  I know when Senator Carnahan talked with us earlier about the \namendment on professional development and about year-round schools and \nproviding teaching specialists in reading in more schools, we saw--and \nI have referenced this earlier during the discussion and debate--the \nvalue of improved reading instruction in enhancing academic \nachievement. Today in the Washington Post, we read about the Prince \nGeorges County Schools where the young children are reading for close \nto 90 minutes to 2 hours, and then spending a concentrated period of \nadditional time on math. There is no question that spending more time \nreading has had a very positive impact.\n  I have seen it in a number of other situations myself, and I think \nthe Carnahan amendment gives important options on how to use resources \nin terms of hiring specialists in reading, and enhancing professional \ndevelopment.\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\n  Then, there is also some allowable use in terms of the year-round \nschools. Experiments in year-round schools are being conducted in a \nnumber of different communities. Again, this legislation provides \nadditional flexibility in the use of funds, while adding more \naccountability. I think Senator Carnahan has increased that kind of \nflexibility but still maintained the focus in terms of professional \ndevelopment. I think that is a very worthwhile use.\n  Finally, I am a strong supporter and cosponsor of the Mikulski \namendment. I have admired Senator Mikulski as the leader in the Senate \non the issue of the digital divide. I think all of us are very \nmindful--it is one of the reasons that we are here--about the digital \ndivide in our country. Senator Mikulski, from the beginning, has \nidentified new technology as being as significant as an education tool, \nin terms of the numbers of opportunities that it opens up, or the \nnumbers of opportunities that are closed down if children are not \nexposed to the Internet and to newer technologies.\n  She has developed a very effective concept of these technology \ncenters, which she has outlined. I visited the Computer Clubhouse in \nBoston last fall, which is one of the community technology centers in \nBoston. I met high school students who had attended the center for 3 \nyears. They told me that coming to the Clubhouse had changed their \nlives. Because they had the positive experiences at the Center, they \nare planning to go to college and study math, science, or engineering. \nWith the very small investment this amendment would provide, we could \nbegin to put a technology center in every needy community in this \ncountry.\n\n  Information technology is changing how we learn at an incredible \nrate. New resources are added to the Internet every day. Web pages are \nas common as fax machines and cell phones. We cannot wait for needy \nindividuals to find their own way to get access to modern resources. We \nhave a responsibility to get the necessary tools to the high poverty \nurban and rural communities, and community technology centers are one \nway to fulfill that responsibility. So I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  Finally, Massachusetts was, just several years ago, 48th out of 50 in \nterms of the Internet accessibility. It was really extraordinary, Mr. \nPresident. We have responded to the concept of a fellow named John Gage \nfrom Sun Systems in California, who developed this idea of ``Net \nDays''--that is, to challenge the new industries to donate computers to \nschools and challenge labor to put wire down in these areas and in \nschools.\n  We did a number of these in my State on four different Net Days. On \nNet Day, we would announce the progress made in the last 6 months. We \nwent from 48th to the top 20 percent of states with Internet access in \nthe country. Boston is the first urban center that had complete \nInternet accessing and training of teachers--it is very impressive.\n  I must say the generosity of the high-tech community was incredibly \nimpressive to me. They were enormously responsive. So many of these \ncompanies are headed by young professionals and it was the first time \nthey had been asked to do something. They welcomed the opportunity to \nbe involved in their communities.\n  Then we challenged labor. In the city of Boston, on a voluntary \nbasis, we got 350 miles of cable laid by the IBEW in Boston. Many of \ntheir children are going to these schools. It was an incredible sight \nto see so many different workers volunteering on Saturdays to wire the \nschools. It was an incredible coming together, and there was a great \nsense of pride in the achievement.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the Mikulski amendment will be an enormous \nforce in helping to make sure that the access to the Internet, the \ntechnology, the curriculum, and the training of professional personnel \nwill be effective. I know the Senator well; she will pursue this to \nmake sure no child is left behind in the technology area. She is \nserious about closing the digital divide.\n  I thank our colleagues here today. We have made some important \nprogress. We are strongly committed to starting early tomorrow and \nworking late tomorrow night. We want to have a full opportunity to \naddress education issues, but we want to try to also move this process \nforward. I am very grateful for the patience and courtesy of our \ncolleagues today in helping us to move the legislation forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. \nWe are working really well together on both sides. I praise all our \nMembers. We are beginning to make real progress on this bill and, \nhopefully, we will have it finished well within the time allotted to \nus.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 388, As Modified\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSpecter's second-degree amendment be modified with the changes that are \nat the desk, and I state that this is just a drafting change and makes \nno substantive changes in the language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 388), as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the 1st word and insert the following:\n\n       .

Mr. President, I rise to note what should be a happy \noccasion but is instead a somber, worrisome, troubling and \ndisconcerting situation.\n  Today is the 39th birthday of Gao Zhan, a woman of Chinese descent \nwho on her 38th birthday lived in Northern Virginia with her husband \nDong Hua Xue and her 5-year-old son Andrew.\n  Far from spending this 39th birthday in the day in the warm embrace \nof her loving family, maybe opening a present that her son Andrew made \nfor her, or blowing out candles, she is somewhere else--enduring her \n87th day of detention by the officials of the People's Republic of \nChina, some 7,000 miles away from home in an unknown location and in \nunknown condition, with no contact whatsoever with her husband and her \nson.\n  Gao Zhan, who has permanent resident status in the United States, is \na scholar at American University studying women's and family issues, \nespecially as they relate to China and Taiwan. She was held for 43 days \nbefore she was even charged with a crime. At that time, the Chinese \nofficials alleged that she was a spy for a foreign government but \npresented no evidence, aside from asserting that she had supposedly \nconfessed.\n  Also very troubling was the fact that when she and her husband and \nson were attempting to leave Beijing after spending the Chinese New \nYear with her family, her husband and 5-year-old son were also detained \nand held separately from her for 26 days before being released. In \nfact, the 5-year-old son was held separately.\n  Indeed, the coerced separation of young Andrew, who is a U.S. citizen \nby birth, violated consular agreements with China. But according to \nAndrew's father, this detention has also traumatized this youngster \npsychologically. This once outgoing, talkative little boy has turned \ninward. He literally clings to his father's leg almost constantly, and \nhe continues to suffer nightmares, emotional withdrawal, and other \nadverse effects. Sometimes he will be eating supper and he will ask his \nfather, ``Where is my mother?''\n  It is often said that we fear what we do not know. For 87 days, Gao \nZhan's family and friends have known precious little about her \nsituation, and they are afraid. They don't know her location. They do \nnot know her physical condition. They do not know the basis for the \ncharges against her. No one has been permitted to see her--not our \nconsular officials, who have lodged more than a dozen official protests \nwith the Chinese, not the lawyers in Beijing or New York, who are \nauthorized to practice law in China, whom her husband hired. This \ndenial is even a violation of Chinese law. They have not even allowed \ninternational humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross, to see \nGao Zhan.\n  On April 5, I introduced legislation, S. 702, which would grant Gao \nZhan her desire to become a U.S. citizen. Her son, as I mentioned \npreviously, is also a U.S. citizen. Her husband recently completed his \noath in the naturalization process--he took the oath 2 months ago--and \nis a U.S. citizen.\n  Gao Zhan has met all of the requirements necessary to become a \ncitizen, except for one--raising her hand and taking the oath of \nallegiance to the United States. She has established residency for at \nleast 5 years prior to her application. In fact, she has lived in the \nUnited States since 1989. She passed the INS test on U.S. history, \ngovernment, and language. And she passed the FBI background \ninvestigation.\n\n  Gao Zhan has clearly demonstrated her intent and desire to become a \nU.S. citizen. S. 702 would help effectuate her desire in her absence. \nAt the same time, I believe taking this unprecedented action might help \nafford her the full range of protections that are accorded to U.S. \ncitizens all around the world.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service has notified the Senate \nthat Gao Zhan meets the requirements for naturalization, including good \nmoral character. I therefore urge my colleagues, both on the Judiciary \nCommittee and in the full Senate, to move this bill to make Gao Zhan a \ncitizen as quickly as possible. While this legislation may not \nguarantee that China will begin respecting human rights of its own \ncitizens and visitors, it might help reunite a wife and mother with her \nhusband and child.\n  Gao Zhan's detention is part of a larger and disturbing pattern of \narrests, of which Senator Jeffords is well aware, in China and the \npattern of arrests of United States-based academics and residents that \npredates the incident involving detention of our 24 Navy crew members. \nOver the past several months, we have become aware of the detention of \ntwo American citizens of Chinese descent and three Chinese-born holders \nof American green cards,\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nincluding Gao Zhan and another scholar who is a resident of Hong Kong.\n  I have been made aware that one of these permanent U.S. residents, \nLiu Yaping, a businessman whom the Chinese have accused of fraud and \ntax evasion, is reportedly suffering from an aneurysm and his life \ncould be in serious jeopardy. In addition, Gao Zhan also suffers from a \nchronic heart condition, and her family is understandably concerned \nabout her health.\n  A number of my colleagues and I have already petitioned the Chinese \nEmbassy for Gao Zhan's release on humanitarian grounds, to no avail. At \nthe very least, Gao Zhan and others being held in China deserve humane \ntreatment, contact with our consular officials, their families, and \nlegal representation.\n  This sort of treatment of U.S. citizens and residents over the course \nof the past several months is clearly not the way to mend the frayed \nand unsettling relations between China and the United States.\n  I call on our administration to continue doing everything in its \npower to seek Gao Zhan's return. I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation granting her citizenship, and I call on the Chinese \nGovernment to release Gao Zhan and return her to her family.\n  Knowing that the Chinese authorities do not allow any \ncommunications--even an e-mail, not even allowing a birthday card--\nwouldn't it be nice to just get a birthday card signed by her 5-year-\nold son and her husband, to know that they are OK. Knowing that is not \ngoing to be allowed, on behalf of the freedom-loving people of this \ncountry and all around the world, I still express our happy birthday \nwishes and hope our thoughts and prayers and actions will result in Gao \nZhan spending her 40th birthday back home with her friends and family, \nand especially her 5-year-old son who needs his mother.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nraising this issue. The person he is referring to is the mother of a 5-\nyear-old. I also have taken as a cause Ngawang Choephel, who is a young \nman from Tibet who attended college and then went back to Tibet to work \non trying to make a history of the language and the culture there and \nwas arrested and, without any trial at all, imprisoned and still is in \nprison.\n  I finally had to go to the Chinese just to get the mother to see her \nson, which she was guaranteed to do under Chinese law. We finally did \nsucceed in getting the two together, but he remains incarcerated in \nTibet.\n  These are just a few, I am sure, of many such incidents. We should \nalways keep these in mind when we decide what kind of relationship we \nare going to have with China.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL STEVE PENN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Lieutenant Colonel \nSteve Penn for his meritorious service to the U.S. Senate both as a \nLegislative Fellow and as the Deputy Director of the Marine Corps \nLiaison Office from July 19, 1996 to April 24, 2001. Lieutenant Colonel \nPenn's uncompromising professionalism and interpersonal skills provided \nan immense contribution to the mission of communicating the \nCommandant's message in the United States Senate. As a fellow, he \nexpertly advised Senator Roberts and his staff on matters of national \nsecurity. In the Senate Liaison Office, he led scores of congressional \nand staff delegations on fact-finding trips to all corners of the globe \nwith unparalleled ease. Additionally, he routinely prepared and \ndelivered briefs to Senators often involving very complex military and \nMarine Corps issues, always with diplomacy and candor. Lieutenant \nColonel Penn consistently maintained uncompromising standards for \ndedication and accuracy in his work. His personal pride and loyalty to \nthe Marine Corps guided his work and deeds, and resulted in superior \nresults. His unselfish devotion to duty, exceptional performance, and \noutstanding professionalism have served the Members of Congress and the \nprofessional staff well, and provided a priceless contribution to the \nMarine Corps. My colleagues join me in wishing Lieutenant Colonel Penn \nall the very best in his next assignment as a member of the Inspector \nand Instructor Staff, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines in Encino, \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4499-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4499-S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE AAA SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL LIFESAVING MEDAL AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the young men and women who have been selected to \nreceive special awards from the American Automobile Association. Three \nsafety patrollers will receive the 2000 AAA School Safety Patrol \nLifesaving Medal Award. This award is the highest honor given to \nmembers of the school safety patrol.\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the school safety patrol in this \ncountry, helping in over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young people \nensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, and \nback home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But, on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions, placing \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic \nactions of this year's recipients exemplify this selflessness, and \nrichly deserve recognition.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from South San \nFrancisco, CA.\n  On September 28, 2000, just as children were leaving Our Lady of \nMercy School for the day, a car hit another car, veered out of control \nand plowed into the school parking lot. Safety patroller Dustin Ramirez \nhelped maintain control until rescue and police officials arrived. His \nquick thinking and courage helped prevent any students from being hurt.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Brooklyn \nCenter, MN.\n  On January 4, 2001, safety patroller Stefani Egnell was preventing \nstudents at Willow Lane Elementary School from crossing the street \nuntil she could determine if a speeding car was going to stop. Stefani \nprevented one 8-year-old girl from stepping in front of the car. She \nalso pulled a boy who hadn't heard her warning back out of harm's way.\n  The third AAA Lifesaving Medal winner comes from Manassas, VA.\n  In March 2000, quick action by safety patroller Jonathan Waldron \nstopped a third grade student from being hit by a bus that had begun \npulling away from the curb. Since the youngster was in the blind spot \nof the bus, the driver did not see him. Jonathan pulled him out of the \npath of the bus and prevented what could have been a tragedy.\n  In addition to honoring safety patrollers with the Lifesaving Medal \nAward, AAA also recognizes the School Safety Patroller of the year. \nThis award is presented to patrollers who have performed their duties \nabove and beyond their normal responsibilities and demonstrate \noutstanding leadership, dependability, and academic strength.\n  Courtney Graf Bernet has been named School Safety Patroller of the \nYear by AAA Mid-Atlantic. Courtney is a sixth-grader at Lee's Corner \nElementary School in Fairfax, VA. In November, 2000, Courtney was on \npatrol duty when a fellow student alerted her that he was having a \nseizure. Courtney instinctively knew what to do to make the student \nsafe and comfortable. She helped him sit down on a soft, grassy area, \ntook off his backpack so he wouldn't hurt himself, and sent his sister \nfor help. After the crisis was over, she also made sure the other \nstudents at the stop safely got on their bus.\n  Courtney's friends and teachers describe her as courageous and \nresponsible. She excels at using computers, and when she is faced with \na challenge, she perseveres until she succeeds. She and all of the \nother AAA winners deserve our thanks and applause.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and thanks to these \nyoung women and men who are visiting the Capitol today. They are an \nasset to their communities, and their families and neighbors should be \nvery proud of their courage and dedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\n  Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring \nstudent safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against \ntraffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange \nsafety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the \nvery best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school \nsafety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic \naccidents and fatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound.\n  And we owe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for \ntheir selfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed \ndeserves the praise and recognition of their schools, their communities \nand the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4500-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  Today, I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred August 8, \n2000 in Providence, Rhode Island. Two young men said they were severely \nbeaten and kicked by two strangers. The two victims were walking down a \nstreet when a car slowed and passed them. Minutes later the car drove \nby again, and the occupants began shouting vulgarities, anti-gay slurs \nand said, ``We're going to kill you.'' The victims yelled back; the \nperpetrators allegedly got out of the car, shouted more anti-gay slurs \nand vulgarities, threw a beer can at them and then proceeded to beat \nand punch the victims in the head and body until one of them almost \nlost consciousness. The perpetrators eventually got in their car and \nfled, and witnesses called for help.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4500-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4500-S4502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NUCLEAR CONTROL INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Your \n     contribution to the debate on nuclear proliferation has been \n     invaluable over the years and undoubtedly has helped make the \n     world a safer one in which to live. I will always appreciate \n     your & Senator Ribicoff's role in initially involving me in \n     the nonproliferation issue during my early days in the \n     Senate. While we have not always agreed on the specific \n     measures to be taken in support of nonproliferation, we have \n     always shared the objective that the control of nuclear \n     weaponry must rank high on the list of the nation's public \n     policy priorities. Your tireless work in support of that \n     objective well deserves the commemoration it is receiving \n     today.\n       Best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     John Glenn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Nuclear Power and the Spread of Nuclear Weapons: Can We Have One \n                           Without the Other?\n\n       Good morning, I am Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear \n     Control Institute, and I want to welcome you to NCI's 20th \n     anniversary conference, ``Nuclear Power and the Spread of \n     Nuclear Weapons--Can We Have One Without the Other?''\n       NCI got started 20 years ago on a spring day like today \n     when I landed a $7,500 contribution from an anonymous member \n     of the Rockefeller family. Wade Greene, the Rockefeller \n     program officer who has been so helpful to a number of non-\n     profit organizations represented here today, called it a \n     ``stimulative grant'' to encourage giving by other \n     foundations. But I had just lost my job on Capitol Hill, when \n     the majority of the Senate switched to the party other than \n     the one my boss and subcommittee chairman, Gary Hart, \n     belonged to. So, I wasted no time and applied the Rockefeller \n     check to renting a desk in the corridor of a small law firm \n     located in a town house a block away from here, on N Street. \n     With the desk came a posh conference room, suitable for \n     holding meetings with other NGOs with an interest in \n     plutonium and proliferation, and NCI was born.\n       In those days, NCI stood for The Nuclear Club Inc. The name \n     was too clever by 5/8ths. But we used it anyway in a full-\n     page New York Times ad, on Sunday, June 21, 1981, to launch \n     our fledgling organization. The ad, which you will find in \n     your folders, posed the question, ``Will Tomorrow's Terrorist \n     Have an Atom Bomb?''--a question, unfortunately, still highly \n     relevant today, as is the answer. NCI's name has changed, but \n     our mission--to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons \n     to nations, or to groups--remains the same.\n       The ad's creator was Julian Koenig, an original member and \n     still a member of our Board. He is a Madison Avenue legend, \n     now retired, whose credits included Volkswagen's original \n     ``Think Small'' campaign and the naming of ``Earth Day.''\n       At first, Mr. Koenig expressed reluctance about joining our \n     board, but I assured him that NCI would have to solve the \n     plutonium problem in five years, or he and I probably \n     wouldn't survive to talk about it anyway. I was wrong on \n     both counts. We haven't solved the problem. We are still \n     around to talk about it. To paraphrase Faulkner, NCI has \n     endured, if not prevailed. We are all still here to talk \n     about the role of nuclear power, plutonium and other \n     associated proliferation risks--that is the purpose of our \n     meeting today.\n       Those of you familiar with NCI's work probably detect \n     something different about today's program. When we planned \n     this conference--and here I wish to acknowledge the \n     contribution of Marvin Miller of MIT, a long-time technical \n     adviser and all-around shmoozer for NCI--we discussed whether \n     we should look at nuclear power in a broader context: Do we \n     need nuclear power? How essential is it? This is a policy \n     area that Nuclear Control Institute has not ventured into \n     before. Although some in industry and bureaucracy conclude \n     that our opposition to civilian use of plutonium and the \n     other nuclear weapons material, highly enriched uranium \n     (HEU), means that we are opposed to nuclear power, we are in \n     fact not an anti-nuclear organization. We have maintained a \n     policy of neutrality on nuclear power and steer clear of \n     efforts to shut the industry down. We are anti-plutonium and \n     anti-HEU, not anti-nuclear.\n       Our purpose today in examining the need for nuclear power, \n     and the possible alternatives to it, is the current push by \n     industry and apparently by the Bush Administration to revive \n     nuclear power and to expand it in response to growing \n     concerns about electricity-supply shortages and global \n     warming.\n       To underscore this point, today's Washington Post quotes \n     Vice President Cheney as saying, ``We need to build 65 new \n     power plants for the next 20 years, and my own view is that \n     some of those ought to be nuclear, and that's the \n     environmentally sound way to go.''\n       We strongly believe that such an initiative should not go \n     forward without first examining whether there is an \n     irreducible proliferation risk associated with nuclear power, \n     and whether this risk is serious enough to change current \n     commitments to nuclear power.\n       If the nuclear industry refuses to end its love affair with \n     plutonium, especially now that it is widely acknowledged that \n     plutonium is not an essential fuel because of the abundance \n     of cheap, non-weapons usable uranium, then the world may well \n     be better off without nuclear power. In that case, we should \n     look to alternative sources of energy and to energy \n     conservation and efficiency measures. Even if industry gives \n     up plutonium, there are still severe proliferation dangers \n     associated with the prospect of cheap, efficient enrichment \n     technology and with potentially limitless sources of uranium.\n       So, we will be examining two sets of questions today:\n       Are there viable alternatives to nuclear power?\n       Are the proliferation risks associated with nuclear power \n     so great as to make these alternative approaches imperative?\n       We have called on a world-class set of experts to address \n     these questions, and we also have an expert audience \n     representing a full range of views that should keep the \n     speakers on their toes. NCI has always sought to be inclusive \n     and to invite opposing viewpoints to be represented at its \n     conferences. This approach sometimes generates heat, but \n     also light. We ask the speakers to keep to their time \n     limits and the questioners to be succinct and to the \n     point. We have a number of\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n     issues to cover in one day and can only do so if concision \n     is king.\n       I want to highlight some of NCI's concerns about the \n     proliferation and security risks of nuclear power and about \n     the way these risks are now being addressed. I hope these \n     points help to inform and to stimulate the discussions that \n     follow.\n       It is important to recognize the central role of fissile \n     materials as the driving force behind proliferation. Granted, \n     any decision to go nuclear is a political one, but the \n     capability to execute that decision is technical. It is \n     impossible to build nuclear weapons without plutonium or HEU. \n     Thus, it should be straightforward that the nuclear power \n     industry imposes a menace on the world if its insists on \n     utilizing these explosive nuclear fuels when it is possible \n     to run nuclear power and research reactors without them. As \n     will be discussed by the luncheon speakers and the afternoon \n     non-proliferation panel, nuclear power programs have provided \n     cover for actual or attempted weapons-making in a number of \n     countries. In each case, closing the fuel cycle to extract \n     plutonium enriching uranium to weapons grade, or importing \n     weapons-grade uranium to run research reactors were the \n     quintessential elements of those programs.\n       Seeking to restrict and eliminate use of these fuels was \n     the objective of the Congressional non-proliferation \n     initiatives of the 1970s and of the Ford and Carter \n     administrations. But these initiatives ran into political \n     trouble because of the fierce opposition of our European and \n     Japanese allies, who refused to follow the U.S. example. \n     Today, the plutonium and breeder programs in these countries \n     are in desperate financial straits, and this situation \n     presents the United States an opportunity to reopen these \n     issues and to seek cooperative approaches for disposal of \n     excess fissile materials without introducing them as fuels.\n       Even the pro-plutonium British Nuclear Industrial Forum, in \n     a recent analysis of prospects for the industry, made this \n     statement: ``Proliferation is a major issue in the nuclear \n     fuel cycle. Nuclear Power may become more acceptable to the \n     public if reprocessing is shut down.'' Clearly, the plutonium \n     program in Britain, as in Germany and Japan, is encountering \n     great difficulties. I have been privileged to be the only \n     American invited to participate in a stakeholders' dialogue \n     with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., the government-owned fuel \n     cycle company, on its plutonium program. As a result of this \n     dialogue, BNFL has now agreed to undertake a formal \n     assessment of immobilizing Britain's 60-plus ton stockpile of \n     civilian plutonium as an alternative to fabricating it into \n     MOX fuel.\n       However, despite this and other opportunities for the \n     United States to revisit the plutonium component of U.S. non-\n     proliferation policy, ``transparency'' and ``gradualism'' \n     still dominate U.S. policy today. But achieving transparency \n     of the world's plutonium stockpiles is no substitute for \n     getting rid of them, while gradualism can be an excuse for \n     not doing anything effective. The rapid growth of stocks of \n     plutonium serves to illustrate this point. The growth has not \n     been as rapid as we projected in 1983 when NCI commissioned \n     David Albright to do his first study of this project. At that \n     time, we projected 600 tons of separated civilian plutonium \n     by the year 2000. Today, because of large-scale \n     cancellations of new nuclear power and fuel-cycle plant \n     orders, and of the demise of the breeder reactor, the \n     actual amount of separated, civilian plutonium is about \n     200 tons--still an awesome figure that approximates the \n     amount of military plutonium in the world.\n       But, by way of contrast, it should be noted that stocks of \n     civilian highly enriched uranium exported by the United \n     States have gone down dramatically--the result of the RERTR \n     (Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors) program, \n     run by the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory, with relatively \n     strong support by the Executive Branch. In this case, there \n     is a law in effect (the Schumer Amendment) which applies a \n     sanctions approach and bars exports of HEU except to research \n     reactors whose operators have agreed to convert to high-\n     density, low-enriched uranium that cannot be used in bombs. \n     The result: HEU exports by the United States are now \n     virtually nil, limited to relatively small amounts to support \n     continued operation of reactors while they are in the process \n     of conversion.\n       Plutonium is a different story, however, Provisions in the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act 1978, which were intended to \n     restrict commerce in plutonium derived from U.S.-supplied \n     nuclear fuel, have been circumvented by the Executive Branch.\n       It is important to note the pivotal role of Japan in all of \n     this. Those of you familiar with the activities of NCI know \n     that we focus attention on the Japanese plutonium program. We \n     are sometimes criticized for doing so. Questions have been \n     raised as to why we are so concerned about plutonium in \n     Japan, given Japan's adherence to the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and to IAEA safeguards.\n       The answer is that Japan strongly resisted U.S. efforts to \n     avoid commercial use of plutonium and is now the lynchpin for \n     world plutonium commerce. Japan is the most important \n     customer today of the European reprocessing and MOX \n     industries. Without Japan, these industries might well be \n     forced to shut down.\n       The Japanese plutonium program is losing domestic public \n     acceptance as a consequence of a succession of nuclear \n     accidents in Japan, as well as a scandal that developed when \n     BNFL workers deliberately falsified quality-control data for \n     plutonium-uranium, mixed oxide (MOX) fuel that was shipped to \n     Japan for use in light-water reactors. Outside Japan, there \n     is a considerable suspicion in the East Asian region as to \n     why Japan wants to accumulate so much weapons-usable \n     plutonium when there is a clear alternative in the form of \n     low-enriched uranium fuel. NCI has pointed out in a detailed \n     economic analysis that Japan could ensure its energy security \n     by building a strategic reserve of non-weapons-usable uranium \n     at a fraction of the cost of its plutonium and breeder \n     programs.\n       NCI regards Japan as a special case, too, because, of all \n     the civil plutonium-consuming countries, Japan refuses to \n     acknowledge the weapons utility of reactor-grade plutonium \n     despite many briefings on the subject by the U.S. Government. \n     NCI commissioned the late Carson Mark, former head of weapons \n     design at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to do an analysis \n     of the weapons utility of reactor grade plutonium. This study \n     eventually convinced the IAEA that reactor-grade plutonium \n     was suitable for073 weapons, but unfortunately the Japanese \n     government and industry continue to refuse to do so.\n       The Japanese plutonium program has also prompted strong \n     protests from many states that are alarmed by the regular \n     transports of MOX fuel and highly radioactive reprocessing \n     waste that now pass close to their coastlines, en route from \n     Europe to Japan. Japan has not been responsive to the safety \n     and security concerns about these shipments that have been \n     raised by the en-route states, or to their demands for \n     environmental impact assessments, advance consultation on \n     emergency planning, and guarantees of salvage of lost cargoes \n     and indemnification against catastrophic consequences of \n     accidents or attacks.\n       The consequence of all this is that the Japanese plutonium \n     program is mired in controversy, both domestically and \n     internationally. In NCI's view, it should be regarded as a \n     special case and of special concern. If Japan should \n     eventually decide against further use of plutonium fuel and \n     the European plutonium industry collapsed as a result, it \n     might then be possible to build an international consensus to \n     eliminate commerce in plutonium as well as bomb-grade \n     uranium.\n       We think Japan and the other big plutonium-producing and--\n     consuming countries do count because they set an example and \n     a standard for the rest of the world. I will return to this \n     subject this afternoon during the non-proliferation panel.\n       I also want to highlight NCI's concerns about the \n     possibility of reactors as radiological weapons--that is, the \n     risk of sabotage of nuclear power plants. This is not just a \n     Russian problem. It is an American problem, as well. Half the \n     nuclear power plants in the United States have failed to \n     repel mock attacks--so-called force-on-force exercises \n     supervised by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC \n     refuses to take enforcement action in response to the \n     failures, and is in the process of weakening the rules of the \n     game in response to industry complaints. The agency even \n     refuses to officially acknowledge the pass-fail nature of the \n     exercises when the mock attackers reach and ``destory'' a \n     complete set of redundant core cooling systems. Perhaps the \n     NRC is right. It's not pass-fail. It's pass-melt.\n       NCI's Scientific Director, Edwin Lyman, will have more to \n     say on this subject at this afternoon's technical fixes \n     panel.\n       There is a curious historical context to this issue. It \n     goes back to 1913, when H.G. Wells wrote a book entitled The \n     World Set Free. In 1933, the Hungarian physicist, Leo \n     Szilard, was thinking about this book, which he had read the \n     year before, at the historic moment when, as he crossed \n     Southhampton Row in the Bloomsbury section of London, he \n     figured out the nuclear chain reaction. Wells, in this book, \n     depicted a future nuclear war that began after atomic energy \n     had been harnessed for peaceful purposes. But it was warfare \n     that involved not exploding atomic bombs, but machines that \n     spewed forth radiological poisons--the equivalent of a modern \n     reactor meltdown.\n       My concern is that sobotage of nuclear power plants may be \n     the greatest domestic vulnerability in the United States \n     today. Many plants are not protected adequately, industry \n     operators seem not prepared to pay the cost of doing so, and \n     the NRC seems ill-disposed to require them to do so. It is \n     not even certain that security of nuclear power plants \n     against attack and sabotage can be assured by \n     conventional, private means. This is a subject worth \n     taking a hard look at.\n       It also raises the larger question of the adequacy of \n     nuclear regulation today. It is essential to maintain strong, \n     independent nuclear regulation free of undue industry \n     influence. When I got into this business as a U.S. Senate \n     staffer more than 25 years ago, my first responsibility was \n     to handle the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. This act \n     ``fissioned'' the Atomic Energy Commission into separate \n     regulatory and promotional agencies, and thus transformed a \n     weak regulatory division of the AEC into a strong, \n     independent NRC. As I observe the NRC today, I am concerned \n     that it is looking more and more like the old AEC regulatory \n     division, subject to undue influence by industry and \n     particularly by industry's powerful friends on Capitol Hill. \n     This is also a matter deserving of close scrutiny.\n       When I started out, I was very much influenced by the \n     thinking of two leading nuclear contrarians. One was David \n     Lilienthal, who\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n     had served as both the first head of the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority and the first chairman of the Atomic Energy \n     Commission. His Congressional testimony in 1976 in opposition \n     to U.S. nuclear exports and in support of non-proliferation \n     legislation caused a furor among his former colleagues. He \n     once said to me, ``If we assume nuclear proliferation to be \n     inevitable, of course it will be.'' That made a lot of sense \n     to me then, and still does today.\n       Ted Taylor, America's most creative fission bomb designer \n     and a member of NCI's Board, also made a concise and \n     compelling point: ``Nuclear is different,'' he said. And to \n     illustrate the point, he noted that the bomb that destroyed \n     Nagasaki set off an instant of explosive energy equivalent to \n     a pile of dynamite as big as the White House that was \n     contained in a sphere of plutonium no bigger than a baseball. \n     That was a first-generation bomb, a technological feat now \n     within the grasp of terrorists or radical states if they \n     manage to get their hands on the material.\n       Ultimately it comes down to a test of reasonableness. Is it \n     reasonable to assume, over time, that millions of kilograms \n     of plutonium can be sequestered down to the less than 8 \n     kilograms needed for such a bomb? This question, in my view, \n     must be answered before giving any further comfort to and \n     support of an industry that remains officially committed to \n     utilizing plutonium as a fuel--and surely before supporting \n     an extension and expansion of that industry in response to \n     electricity-supply shortages and global warming.\n       I close with a reminder from one of NCI's original Board \n     members, the historian Barbara Tuchman, who in her book of \n     the same title gave a sobering description of the ``march of \n     folly'' that drives nations to destruction. She identified \n     this phenomenon, one repeated throughout recorded history, as \n     ``pervasive persistence in a policy demonstrably unworkable \n     or counterproductive.'' To qualify as folly, she said, it \n     ``must have been perceived as counter-productive in its own \n     time, not merely by hindsight, . . . (and) a feasible \n     alternative course of action must have been available.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4502-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4502-S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to honor America's mothers. On Sunday, May 13th, families across \nAmerica will celebrate Mother's Day. This is a special time of year, \nwhen we pay tribute to our mothers for playing an important role in our \nlives.\n  Mother's Day is a time to thank mothers for their patience, \ncompassion, and devotion. Mothers have taught us to be who we are today \nand who we will be in the future. They instill values of respect and \nhonor in our lives. On this day, we acknowledge the role mothers play \nin shaping our nation's future, one child at a time.\n  Our mothers were first honored in this way in 1907, when Anna Jarvis \npetitioned influential political and religious leaders to adopt a \nformal holiday honoring mothers. She hoped that such an observance \nwould increase respect for parents and strengthen family bonds. Thanks \nto her efforts, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second \nSunday in May as Mother's Day. He declared that on this day, the U.S. \nflag is to be displayed in government buildings and at people's homes \n``as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of \nour country.''\n  This year, as we celebrate Mother's Day, we are reminded of the \nchanging role of mothers in our society. Today, mothers are not only \nhomemakers and volunteers. They are lawyers and doctors, teachers and \nnurses, Senators and CEOs. In fact, half of American women with \nchildren under the age of eighteen now work full time, outside the \nhome. Whether our mothers work inside or outside the home, they are our \ncaretakers and nurturers. They are the cornerstone of our country. \nTheir role in our society is priceless.\n  With all of our mothers' hard-work and devotion, it is no wonder that \neach year families search for the perfect gift to give for Mothers' \nDay. We purchase flowers, candy, and cards. Yet, America's mothers \ndeserve more. Mothers want to know that their children are safe in \nschool, receiving the best possible education, and protected from \ndangers in the community. This is where we, as lawmakers, have a role \nto play. We can do more to help mothers. We can help give them \nsomething they want and deserve for Mother's Day by passing legislation \nthat reduces the number of guns on our streets, improves our schools, \nand protect our neighborhoods.\n  One year ago I joined over 900,000 mothers, fathers and children \nacross the country in the Million Mom March. We came out on Mother's \nDay to renew our commitment to our children--we will continue to work \ntirelessly to prevent the senseless gun related deaths of our children. \nWe want to raise our children, not bury them.\n  We joined together to talk about the need for gun safety and sensible \ngun control. Yet this body has turned a deaf ear to the calls.\n  While some downplay the fact that guns are more rampant in America \nthan in any other country, more and more children are killed by guns. \nEvery day, 10 mothers are told that their child has been killed by \ngunfire. That is 10 too many. Last Congress, I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with eight other Senators, known as the Child Access \nPrevention, CAP, bill, in an effort to hold gun owners accountable when \nthey fail to safely store their firearms. Gun owners need to assume \nresponsibility for safely storing their firearms in a way that is not \naccessible to children. Unfortunately, the Congress did not pass my \nbill. I plan to reintroduce this legislation during this Congress and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Here we are, two years after Columbine, one year after the Million \nMom March, and two months after Santana High, and this Senate still has \nnot acted on any gun legislation. How many more mothers will have to \ncelebrate Mother's Day without their children at their side before we \nbegin helping law enforcement and school officials end the violence in \nour schools? Our mothers should not have to fear sending their children \nto school. We must pass sensible gun laws--for our nation, for our \nchildren, for our mothers.\n  This year, for Mother's Day, let us also assure mothers that their \nchildren are receiving a quality education. Too many school children \nface challenges that inhibit their ability to learn. Student-to-teacher \nratios are too large, teachers are not properly trained, and the best \ntechnology is not made available. Mothers count on our schools to \nprovide their children with the best possible education. Yet, our \nschools are not meeting the standards. While Congress debates funding \npriorities, our children are leaving school unprepared for their \nfutures.\n  We must increase Federal support for education to ensure that all our \nchildren have the skills and knowledge they will need in the future. \nOur goal must be to make every child a success story. Allocated funding \nwill allow schools to reduce class sizes and increase professional \ndevelopment programs for teachers. It will help local schools invest in \nand integrate new technology in classrooms and help expand school \ncounseling, school safety, and substance abuse programs. By helping our \nschools, we will assure mothers that their children are ready for the \nfuture.\n  As a gift for Mother's Day, we can also give children a place to go \nafter school hours. With one half of American mothers working full time \noutside the home, many children come home from school to an empty \nhouse. It is during this time when many unsupervised children find \ntrouble. A study released by the YMCA of the USA designated the hours \nbetween 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. as the ``danger zone.'' Teenagers are more \nlikely to drink, smoke, or engage in sexual activity because they are \nunsupervised. But this time could and should be used for productive \nactivities.\n  The hours after school should be a time to learn and grow, not invite \ntrouble. We need to expand funding for programs like Chicago's \nLighthouse after school program, so that children have access to \ntutoring and mentoring programs, recreational activities, and literacy \neducation after the school day ends. When children participate in these \nprograms, working mothers can be reassured that their children are not \nonly safe, but thriving, while they are at work.\n  In conclusion, Sunday is our special opportunity to recognize the \nrole of mothers and to thank them for their nurture, care, and love.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to honor America's mothers. On Sunday, May 13th, families across \nAmerica will celebrate Mother's Day. This is a special time of year, \nwhen we pay tribute to our mothers for playing an important role in our \nlives.\n  Mother's Day is a time to thank mothers for their patience, \ncompassion, and devotion. Mothers have taught us to be who we are today \nand who we will be in the future. They instill values of respect and \nhonor in our lives. On this day, we acknowledge the role mothers play \nin shaping our nation's future, one child at a time.\n  Our mothers were first honored in this way in 1907, when Anna Jarvis \npetitioned influential political and religious leaders to adopt a \nformal holiday honoring mothers. She hoped that such an observance \nwould increase respect for parents and strengthen family bonds. Thanks \nto her efforts, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second \nSunday in May as Mother's Day. He declared that on this day, the U.S. \nflag is to be displayed in government buildings and at people's homes \n``as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of \nour country.''\n  This year, as we celebrate Mother's Day, we are reminded of the \nchanging role of mothers in our society. Today, mothers are not only \nhomemakers and volunteers. They are lawyers and doctors, teachers and \nnurses, Senators and CEOs. In fact, half of American women with \nchildren under the age of eighteen now work full time, outside the \nhome. Whether our mothers work inside or outside the home, they are our \ncaretakers and nurturers. They are the cornerstone of our country. \nTheir role in our society is priceless.\n  With all of our mothers' hard-work and devotion, it is no wonder that \neach year families search for the perfect gift to give for Mothers' \nDay. We purchase flowers, candy, and cards. Yet, America's mothers \ndeserve more. Mothers want to know that their children are safe in \nschool, receiving the best possible education, and protected from \ndangers in the community. This is where we, as lawmakers, have a role \nto play. We can do more to help mothers. We can help give them \nsomething they want and deserve for Mother's Day by passing legislation \nthat reduces the number of guns on our streets, improves our schools, \nand protect our neighborhoods.\n  One year ago I joined over 900,000 mothers, fathers and children \nacross the country in the Million Mom March. We came out on Mother's \nDay to renew our commitment to our children--we will continue to work \ntirelessly to prevent the senseless gun related deaths of our children. \nWe want to raise our children, not bury them.\n  We joined together to talk about the need for gun safety and sensible \ngun control. Yet this body has turned a deaf ear to the calls.\n  While some downplay the fact that guns are more rampant in America \nthan in any other country, more and more children are killed by guns. \nEvery day, 10 mothers are told that their child has been killed by \ngunfire. That is 10 too many. Last Congress, I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with eight other Senators, known as the Child Access \nPrevention, CAP, bill, in an effort to hold gun owners accountable when \nthey fail to safely store their firearms. Gun owners need to assume \nresponsibility for safely storing their firearms in a way that is not \naccessible to children. Unfortunately, the Congress did not pass my \nbill. I plan to reintroduce this legislation during this Congress and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Here we are, two years after Columbine, one year after the Million \nMom March, and two months after Santana High, and this Senate still has \nnot acted on any gun legislation. How many more mothers will have to \ncelebrate Mother's Day without their children at their side before we \nbegin helping law enforcement and school officials end the violence in \nour schools? Our mothers should not have to fear sending their children \nto school. We must pass sensible gun laws--for our nation, for our \nchildren, for our mothers.\n  This year, for Mother's Day, let us also assure mothers that their \nchildren are receiving a quality education. Too many school children \nface challenges that inhibit their ability to learn. Student-to-teacher \nratios are too large, teachers are not properly trained, and the best \ntechnology is not made available. Mothers count on our schools to \nprovide their children with the best possible education. Yet, our \nschools are not meeting the standards. While Congress debates funding \npriorities, our children are leaving school unprepared for their \nfutures.\n  We must increase Federal support for education to ensure that all our \nchildren have the skills and knowledge they will need in the future. \nOur goal must be to make every child a success story. Allocated funding \nwill allow schools to reduce class sizes and increase professional \ndevelopment programs for teachers. It will help local schools invest in \nand integrate new technology in classrooms and help expand school \ncounseling, school safety, and substance abuse programs. By helping our \nschools, we will assure mothers that their children are ready for the \nfuture.\n  As a gift for Mother's Day, we can also give children a place to go \nafter school hours. With one half of American mothers working full time \noutside the home, many children come home from school to an empty \nhouse. It is during this time when many unsupervised children find \ntrouble. A study released by the YMCA of the USA designated the hours \nbetween 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. as the ``danger zone.'' Teenagers are more \nlikely to drink, smoke, or engage in sexual activity because they are \nunsupervised. But this time could and should be used for productive \nactivities.\n  The hours after school should be a time to learn and grow, not invite \ntrouble. We need to expand funding for programs like Chicago's \nLighthouse after school program, so that children have access to \ntutoring and mentoring programs, recreational activities, and literacy \neducation after the school day ends. When children participate in these \nprograms, working mothers can be reassured that their children are not \nonly safe, but thriving, while they are at work.\n  In conclusion, Sunday is our special opportunity to recognize the \nrole of mothers and to thank them for their nurture, care, and love. On \nSunday, when we salute our mothers for the role they have played in our \nlives, let's recommit ourselves to give them a gift in return, a gift \nthey will treasure. Let's pass sensible gun laws, increase funding to \nour schools, and protect our communities. That is what our mothers \nwant, on Mother's Day and every day. And that is what we should give \nthem.\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4503-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEDICARE INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am so pleased to join my good \nfriends, Senator Hutchison from Texas and Senator Bayh from Indiana, in \nsupporting this legislation to help Medicare payments keep pace with \nthe rising costs of hospital care, and to halt further Medicare \nreductions to teaching hospitals.\n  Our hospitals are under tremendous strain. They face soaring costs \nfrom nearly every direction: The growing number of uninsured \nindividuals coupled with the devastating shortages of skilled health \ncare workers. The struggle to afford skyrocketing pharmaceuticals \nprices, while simultaneously investing in emerging needs, such as \ninformation technology. At the same time, reductions in Medicare \npayments have hindered hospitals' ability to respond to these increased \ndemands. How can we expect patients to receive quality health care when \nwe're asking our hospitals to do more with so much less?\n  As you know, this week we are focusing on the crisis around the \nshortage of nurses. Ninety-one percent of hospitals in New York State \nreport shortages of registered nurses, RNs. But this is really just the \ntip of the iceberg. The shortages in the health care workforce permeate \nthe entire health care system, especially our hospitals. There are \nshortages in pharmacists, technicians, nurse aides, billing staff, and \nhousekeepers that have all negatively impacted the quality of care New \nYorkers are able to receive.\n  As a representative of the State of New York, I am especially \ntroubled by the growing strains that our hospitals have been forced to \ncontend with on top of the devastating cuts that have resulted from the \nbalanced budget agreement of 1997, BBA. I have heard numerous firsthand \naccounts of the adverse impact on New York hospitals and the facts \nspeak for themselves: In the 2 years following the BBA, New York \nhospitals' financial health ranked worst in the Nation. In fact, almost \ntwo-thirds of New York hospitals had negative operating margins last \nyear. And in addition to the workforce shortage affecting health \nproviders nationwide, New York providers are also confronting labor \ncosts increases of 5-7 percent a year, while the Medicare rates for \ninpatient hospital rates, even with the full market basket update we \nare seeking in today's legislation, expected to rise only around 3.1 \npercent.\n  In recent years, Congress has successfully provided some short-term \nrelief to address areas where the cuts enacted in the BBA of 1997 went \nmuch further than intended. However, much of the relief merely \npostponed scheduled cuts in Medicare payments and that is why the \nlegislation that we are introducing today is so important.\n  This legislation today would eliminate some of those previously \ndelayed cuts. First, it would restore the market basket update for \ninpatient hospital rates to the full level, rather than market-basket \nminus 0.55 percent, as scheduled for fiscal year 2002 and 2003. This \nimportant step will help hospitals nationwide keep up with the rising \ncosts of inpatient care for Medicare beneficiaries. This provision \nhelps all hospitals in New York State by increasing inpatient hospital \npayments across the board.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation would also address the \ncuts faced by teaching hospitals to their Medicare indirect medical \neducation payments. Teaching hospitals are the crown jewels of our \nNation's health care system and play a vital role in making our system \none of the finest in the world.\n  We rely on them to train physicians and nurses, care for the sickest \nof the sick and the poorest of the poor, and engage in research and \nclinical trials. Thanks to the research, for example, at Memorial \nSloan-Kettering, cancer patients will suffer less while receiving \nchemotherapy because of a drug that was developed there.\n  As my predecessor and friend, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in \nwhose footsteps I am so honored to be following, put it so well a few \nyears ago, ``We are in the midst of a great era of discovery in the \nmedical science. It is certainly not a time to close medical schools. \nThis great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in the \nUnited States . . . And it is centered in New York City.''\n  This legislation that we are introducing today would address the cuts \nfaced by teaching hospitals to their Medicare indirect medical \neducation payments. Last year's Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement Act of 2000, BIPA, provided some relief by delaying the \ncuts to help teaching hospitals cover the costs of caring for sicker, \nmore complicated patients. Today's provision would make that relief \npermanent by freezing the indirect medical education adjustments \npercentage at 6.5 percent.\n  In addition, teaching hospitals throughout the State would benefit, \nincluding rural hospitals such as Kingston Hospital, Benedictine \nHospital, Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital Medical Center, Olean \nGeneral Hospital, and Hepburn Medical Center in Ogdensburgh, NY.\n  Today's legislation is essential to ensuring that our Nation's older \nand disabled patients can continue to receive the high quality of care \nthat they deserve. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nadministration to address this and other important health care \npriorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4503-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4503-S4504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize that May is \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Month, and I want to acknowledge the \nmany accomplishments and contributions that people of Asian and Pacific \nIsland descent have made to Minnesota and to our country.\n  Their many different talents, cultures, and histories have played \nimportant roles in building and strengthening our country, and they \nhave exemplified the important traditions of hard work, respect for \nfamily and elders, and the value of a quality education.\n  Since their arrival in this country, they have believed strongly in \nthe American Dream and in better opportunities for those who seek them. \nThese qualities have enabled them to overcome adversity and \ndiscrimination, and allowed them to achieve enormous successes in \nvirtually every field.\n  The complexion of my home state of Minnesota is changing \ndramatically. We have seen a sharp increase in the number of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders who reside in our state, and we welcome \nthe opportunity to continue to work with them to create a better \nMinnesota.\n  In one of my first meetings as a new Senator, I had the opportunity \nto visit with the Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans, and I learned \nof the many important contributions which this community makes to my \nhome state. They shared with me not only their successes, but also \ntheir continuing struggles to ensure that Minnesotans of Asian and \nPacific Island descent have the best education, housing, health care, \nand job opportunities possible.\n  I would like to acknowledge just a few of the Minnesotans of Asian or \nPacific Island descent whose efforts have made Minnesota a better place \nto live and work. In the political arena, the Honorable Satveer \nChaudhary became the first Asian American to be elected to the \nMinnesota state legislature and now serves as the highest-ranking \nelected official of Indian descent in the nation. Ms. Zarina Baber \nhelped establish the volunteer based clinic in Fridley known as \nAl'Shifa, which provides culturally specific health care free of charge \nto needy or uninsured patients. Ms. Baber volunteers as the director of \nthis clinic and has developed partnerships with area hospitals and \nclinics. Mr. Lee Pao Xiong recently became the first non-African \nAmerican President of Minneapolis' Urban Coalition. He has served on \nPresident Clinton's Commission on Asian and Pacific Islanders, and has \nbeen a leader in helping the Hmong community to make the transition to \nmainstream America while preserving the integrity of their own culture. \nWai Lee, a devoted mother of four, as well as an active member of the \nFaribault community, has skillfully combined motherhood with activism. \nShe has volunteered in the Faribault community for many years, taught \nEnglish as a Second Language, and developed a mentor program to involve \nchildren and help them with their English skills. Venture\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nCrew 6, a community organization made up of Asian youth leaders, is \nworking to make Minnesota a better place to live and train young people \nto be future leaders. The group's mission is to help Minnesota youth \ngrow, develop, and foster leadership skills while serving their \ncommunities. The members, made up of traditional and ``at risk'' youth, \nlend a hand to the state's elderly, and provide a variety of other \nvolunteer services in several Minnesota communities.\n  There are many other women and men who belong on this ``Honor Role'' \nof outstanding Minnesotans. During this month, we should all take time \nto remind ourselves of the important contributions made to our society \nby those of Asian American and Pacific Island descent, who bring with \nthem rich cultures, desire for growth and opportunity, and the chance \nto achieve the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4504-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPORT PROMOTION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of \nU.S. trade policy, in particular the funds directed toward export \npromotion in the Bush administration fiscal year 2002 budget.\n  Until only recently, the United States had been experiencing the \nlargest period of sustained economic growth in our history, with over \n20 million jobs created, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the \nlowest poverty rate in 20 years, and substantial increases in gross \ndomestic product and productivity. According to nearly every analyst, \nthere is a direct correlation between increased international trade and \nthese statistics, with exporting firms and workers contributing as much \nas 30 percent to our economic growth. Exports in U.S. goods and \nservices have risen by almost 50 percent over the last eight years. \nThis translates into increased international sales for business of all \nsizes, increased opportunities for high-wage employment, and enhanced \neconomic security for Americans.\n  Significantly, our trade policy over the last 8 years has included \ntangible resources directed toward export promotion initiatives, the \nprimary goal being to ensure that exporters, large, medium, and small, \ncould take advantage of market opportunities occurring as a result of \ninternational trade negotiations and market liberalization. Included in \nthis trade strategy were a range of policy programs, from trade \npromotion and financing, to market monitoring and compliance, to \ndatabase creation and business counseling, all of which were \nspecifically designed to ensure that U.S. firms of all sizes had the \ninformation they needed, that they were positioned to take advantage of \nforeign markets, and, in this manner, that we could unlock the full \npotential of our national economy.\n  As I examine the current budget I am concerned that this commitment \nto export promotion has weakened significantly under the new \nadministration. Given the rapid changes occurring in the international \npolitical economy, I am concerned that the administration is ignoring \nthe challenges U.S. firms now face with their competition. Given the \nemphasis placed on these programs by foreign governments at this time, \nI am concerned about the effect this change will have on the level of \nour exports. Given the state of our economy at this time, I am \nconcerned this will simply be another factor contributing to a decline \nin economic growth.\n  Let me give some specific examples of the budget cuts I am referring \nto. Based on the budget numbers provided by President Bush: Funding for \nthe Trade Development Program, which performs trade investment \nanalyses, works with firms to identify and capitalize on overseas trade \nopportunities, and conducts export promotion programs, will decrease \nfrom $66 million last year to $52 million this year. Funding for the \nMarket Access and Compliance Program, which monitors foreign country \ncompliance with multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, will \ndecrease from $33 million last year to $28 million this year. Funding \nfor the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Services, which maintains databases \non markets overseas and counsels U.S. firms on export opportunities, \nwill decrease from $199 million last year to $194 million this year. \nFunding for the Export-Import Bank, which provides export financing for \nU.S. companies, will decrease from $865 million last year to $633 \nmillion this year. Funding for the International Trade Administration, \nwhose primary goal is to expand opportunities for sales by U.S. firms \nin foreign markets, falls from $364 million last year to $361 million \nthis year.\n  From where I stand, we should not be cutting back on funding for \nthese programs. On the contrary, we should increase funds for programs \ndesigned to translate American productivity, vitality, and ingenuity \ninto sales overseas. Unfortunately, what we see here is a policy that \nruns contrary to the needs of our own country, and, significantly, the \npolicies of most countries in the global trading system. The Bush \nadministration trade policy incorrectly assumes that market \nimperfections do not exist, and that assistance to firms represents \ninterference in the way the market works. If you look around the world \nand examine the trade and export policies of other countries, you will \nsee this policy is an anomaly.\n  If you go down the list of our trading partners anywhere in the \nworld--be it Japan, France, Canada, Mexico, or Brazil--all consider the \nexports of their goods and services to be a top government priority, \nand, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, contribute substantial \nresources, both human and financial, to this goal. The most recent data \navailable shows that the United States ranks dead last among a group of \nour trading partners, measured in terms of spending on export promotion \nas a percentage of GDP. And these data were calculated prior to the \nfiscal year 2002 budget cuts by the Bush Administration. All of these \ncountries--France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Korea, Spain, \nSweden, and the Netherlands--understand that trade is not an end in and \nof itself, but one of the tools by which governments can raise the \nliving standards of its people.\n  In his nomination testimony before the Finance Committee in January, \nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stated that President Bush \nassigned a high priority to trade policy as part of his domestic and \ninternational agenda. He argued at that time that trade policy is \nimportant not only because it incrementally improves the economic \nwelfare of all Americans, but also because it shapes the basic \nframework of the international system. Through international trade we \nnot only export goods and services, we also export democratic values \nand stability.\n  I agree with this statement. But my concern is that the Bush \nAdministration is committed to this kind of trade policy in rhetoric \nalone. Their budget for export promotion activities suggests that they \nare unwilling to back up their words with substance--in this case, real \nfunding for the programs that do the work needed to help U.S. firms. \nFrom where I sit, it is essential that the United States fund these \nprograms so American business can continue to act as an engine of \ngrowth for the country. I am convinced that there is a national \neconomic interest, tangible and beneficial, that needs to be pursued in \nan effective manner by the United States. While I accept the notion of \nfree markets, I believe there are imperfections and biases in the \ninternational trading system that necessitate a commitment of resources \nto trade and export policy.\n  President Bush has argued that he has focused on the people's \npriorities in his budget and put first things first. I would argue that \nhis trade policy--the resources directed toward export promotion policy \nin particular--are simply another example of the fundamental flaws in \nhis strategic goals for the country. There is still time to make a \nchange in direction. There is still time to fund the programs that have \ndone so much for American businesses and the American people. I urge \nthe Administration to reconsider the funding levels for these programs, \nand bring them back to the appropriate level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4504-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4504-S4505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

CHRISTMAN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career \nof an outstanding soldier and a good friend, Lieutenant General Daniel \nW. Christman, who is retiring after more than thirty-six years of \nactive military service. General Christman's exemplary military career, \nculminating in five years as the Commanding General and Superintendent \nof the United States Military Academy at West Point, exemplifies the \nprofessionalism and seriousness of purpose that have helped make the \nU.S. military the best in the world.\n  Prior to his service at the United States Military Academy, General \nChristman had a remarkable military career for over 30 years. General \nChristman graduated first in his class from West Point and later taught \nin the Department of Social Sciences as an Assistant Professor of \nEconomics. He has held several senior executive positions in the Army, \nall of which have taken advantage of his unique talents for creative \nleadership and strategic vision. Using his training in civil \nengineering, he has commanded a major U.S. Army Corps of Engineer \nDistrict in Savannah Georgia and headed the Army's Engineer School in \nthe early 1990s.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, General Christman has played a \nvital role in development and implementation of some of the most \nimportant security policy issues of the last several decades. He served \nin the Ford Administration as a member of the National Security Council \nStaff. During the Gulf War, he directed a strategic planning group \nwhich advised the Army's Chief of Staff on war prosecution policies. He \nrepresented the U.S. in Brussels, Belgium as a member of NATO's \nMilitary Committee where he had active involvement in the historic \nexpansion of NATO, pursuing peace in the Balkans and military dialogue \nwith Russia. Immediately before arriving at West Point, General \nChristman served for two years as Assistant to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. In that position he advised the \nSecretary of State on a broad range of issues, including arms control \nwith Russia and Middle East peace negotiations between Israel and \nSyria.\n  General Christman's tenure as the 55th Superintendent of the U.S. \nMilitary Academy has been marked by a forward thinking strategic vision \nand the development of a more cooperative and positive environment at \nthe Academy. I met with General Christman soon after I was sworn in as \nSenator and have been greatly impressed by his leadership at West \nPoint. His success at obtaining critical funding support has enabled \nWest Point to continue to attract high quality young cadets willing to \nembark on Army careers. He helped to raise funds for the Center for the \nProfessional Military Ethic, as well as endowments for several academic \ndepartment chairs and improved athletic facilities. He helped to \ninspire the creation of a dynamic and forward-looking Strategic Vision \nfor the U.S. Military Academy 2010.\n  General Christman's exemplary service and devotion to duty, honor and \ncountry have left a lasting impact on the U.S. Military Academy, and \nindeed the U.S. Army. His numerous awards reflect the respect and \nadmiration of those who have had the privilege to serve with him.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the outstanding \nservice to our nation of Lieutenant General Daniel William Christman, \nthe 55th Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. On June \n30, 2001, General Christman will retire from the United States Army \nafter an outstanding career of more than 36 years of service in peace \nand in war to the Army and the Nation.\n  General Christman is a modern model of the soldier-scholar. After \ngraduating first in his class from West Point in 1965, then young \nsecond Lieutenant Christman traveled to Fort Benning to undertake the \nRanger Course. He then served as a Platoon Leader and later as a \nCommander in the 2d Infantry Division, Korea. In 1969, he commanded a \ncompany in the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam.\n  Returning from combat, General Christman went on to distinguish \nhimself in numerous command and staff positions with U.S. Forces, both \noverseas and in the Continental United States. In Europe, his \nassignments included serving as the 19th U.S. Representative to the \nNATO Military Committee in Brussels, Belgium, and Commander of the 54th \nEngineer Battalion in Wildflecken, Germany.\n  General Christman's key command positions included service as the \nCommanding General of the U.S. Army Engineer Center and Commandant of \nthe U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and \nCommander of the Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in \nSavannah, Georgia.\n  General Christman occupied senior executive positions in Washington, \nD.C. which required creative leadership and strategic vision. He served \nas a Staff Assistant with the National Security Council during the Ford \nAdministration, and as Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General for \nNational Security Affairs in the Reagan Administration. General \nChristman was the Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy at the \nDepartment of Army Headquarters. In this capacity, he supported \nnegotiations relating to the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control \ntalks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on behalf of the Chief of Staff \nof the Army and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also \nserved as Assistant to General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff advising the Secretary of State on a broad range of \nmilitary and national security issues such as arms control with the \nRussian Federation and the Middle East peace negotiations between \nIsrael and Syria.\n  Over the years, General Christman also found time to continue his own \neducation. He earned a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering and a \nMasters Degree in Public Administration from Princeton University, and \nholds a Law Degree from George Washington University.\n  For his service, General Christman has received, among others, the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service \nMedal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star \nMedal, Merit Service Medal and the Air Medal.\n  General Christman has made many valuable contributions to our nation \nand the Army, but I believe that he has left his most indelible mark on \nthe United States Military Academy, the institution where he began, and \nwill soon end his Army career. After his graduation, General Christman \nfirst returned to his alma mater in 1970 as an Instructor, and later \nAssistant Professor in the Department of Social Sciences. Then in 1996, \nGeneral Christman undertook his last assignment as Superintendent. For \nthe past five years, he charted the course for officer education into \nthe new century.\n  Under his guidance, the Academy crafted a new mission statement, \nstrategic vision, and a new public funding paradigm to enable the \ninstitution to compete and excel in an era of transformation. His \nassessment of current needs and insight of future possibilities\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nhas resulted in a revised academic curriculum and an increased focus on \nthe profession of officership. From the outset, General Christman \nsought the insight of Academy graduates and the neighboring community, \nwhere appropriate, to give these groups a closer identification with \nhis decisions.\n  A consummate professional, General Christman's dedication to \nexcellence and his unsurpassed devotion to duty, honor, and country \nhave marked his distinguished service over the last 36 years. His \nservice reflects a deep commitment to West Point, the Army, and our \nnation. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking General Christman \nfor his honorable service to the citizens of the United States of \nAmerica. I wish him, his wife Susan, and their children, continued \nsuccess and happiness in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4506-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RETIREMENT OF RONALD CARL CASNER OF McVEYTOWN, PA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nRonald Carl Casner of McVeytown, PA, as he retires as Vice-President \nfrom Omega National Bank after 42 years. He has given a great deal of \ntime and energy to his profession, and has ensured a trustworthy \nbanking service to his customers for many years. On June 30, 2001, he \nwill bring his lengthy and accomplished career to a close, and I \ncommend him for the many years of service he has provided to his \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Casner was born February 7, 1936 in Lewistown, PA. After he \ngraduated from high school, he served in the United States Marine Corps \nfrom 1954-1958. Upon his return to the United States from his military \nservice, Ronald became employed at the former Penn Central National \nBank, located in Mount Union and Huntington, PA. When Mr. Casner \nretires in June, he will retire as Vice-President of what is now Omega \nNational Bank.\n  Mr. Casner is a member of the McVeytown United Methodist Church, \nserves on the Church's Board of Trustees, is an avid sportsman, and is \na member of the Loyal Order of the Moose. His involvment in these civic \norganizations displays Mr. Casner's dedication both as a professional \nand in the community. Ronald and his wife, Anna, have two daughters, \none grandson and one granddaughter.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing Mr. Ronald Casner \nfor the many years he has given to his community. May his retirement be \nfilled with health, happiness and memorable times with family and \nfriends for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4506-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEON HIGH SCHOOL BAND\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to honor the outstanding history of the Leon High School \nBand in Tallahassee, Florida. Now in its 61st year, Leon High School \nBand's tradition of distinction is second only to the academic and \npersonal integrity of its members.\n  Officially organized in 1940, Leon Band and its colorful history \nremain a source of great pride for everyone involved with the program. \nDuring those early years, the ``Marching Redcoats'' took the field at \nthe 1946 Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, attended the Cherry Blossom \nFestival in Washington, D.C. and was proclaimed the official band of \nthe State of Florida. The honors, acclaim and achievements, however, \ndid not stop there; the band visited Mexico in 1974 to enter the \nFestival of Bands and toured Austria for the International Music \nFestival in 1977.\n  More recently, under the direction of Timothy Paul, the Leon High \nBand has continued its quest for excellence. Not only have they won the \nSudler Order of Merit for Historical Bands, but in December, 2000, the \nband was presented with the prestigious Sulder Flag of Honor, an \ninternational award honoring musical expertise. Individually, band \nmembers consistently attain superior ratings in district and state \ncompetition. The grand tradition of the Leon High School Band continues \nand richly deserves our commendation and recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4506-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SEARCHING FOR SEQUOYAH\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a \nfamily that has dedicated much time and energy into preserving its \nCherokee heritage. Dr. Charles Rogers of Brownsville, TX, his wife \nSheron, his son, George Charles Sherson, and his mother, Mary Layton \nRogers, have traveled to Mexico in search of the grave of the famous \nCherokee, Sequoyah.\n  Sequoyah is credited with inventing a writing system for the \nCherokees by making symbols which form words. As a result of this \nsyllabary, thousands of Cherokees became literate. In recognition of \nhis monumental contribution, the Cherokee Nation awarded him a silver \nmedal, along with a lifetime literary pension.\n  Sequoyah was born in Tennessee, in 1776, to Nathaniel Gist, a \nVirginia fur trader, and Wut-teh, the daughter of a Cherokee Chief. He \nalso lived in Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas before moving to Oklahoma, \nwhere he lived until 1842. He then set out to find the Chickamauga \nCherokees, who had moved to Mexico. He died the following year in \nMexico, but the exact location of his grave has remained unknown.\n  Dr. Rogers and his family, who come from a long line of Cherokees \nthemselves, have searched extensively for Sequoyah's grave. Their \nefforts may have paid-off as they believe they have found the burial \nsite in a rock-covered cave near the ``lost-village'' of Sequoyah. Epic \nand Gloria Rodriguez of Mexico, whose ancestors helped Sequoyah and \nother Cherokees, directed the Rogers to the location. The Rogers' \nintent is not to return the remains of Sequoyah to Oklahoma, but to \nrecognize his grave in order to preserve the richness of the Cherokee \nheritage.\n  I hope you will join me today in honoring Sequoyah, for his \ncontribution to the Cherokee people, as well as the Rogers family, for \ntheir work to preserve the legacy of this Cherokee hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4506-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAGE GROTON\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Page Groton. He was a native of Baltimore who served his \ncountry with pride.\n  Page Groton spent his career working to improve the lives of working \nmen and women. He played an important role in America's labor movement. \nHe understood why unions are so important. He put his values into \naction.\n  Page enjoyed a long career as a trade union member, leader and \nlobbyist. He began working in Baltimore as a member of the Civilian \nConservation Corps before becoming an electrician at a shipyard in \nPennsylvania. Page answered his country's call to duty by joining the \nNavy in the Pacific during World War II.\n  After returning to the shipyard when the war ended, Page was elected \nunion president of his boilermakers local. In 1962, Page Groton moved \nto Washington and became vice president of the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers Union. Once in Washington, Page found the \ntime to share his knowledge of labor issues with students from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin School for workers. He finished his career as a \nlobbyist for the Metal Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.\n  I am so grateful for Page's friendship and support. In 1986, I found \nmyself in a tough Senate primary campaign against two good friends of \nmine: Congressman Mike Barnes of Montgomery County, and Governor Harry \nHughes of Maryland. Page was instrumental in helping the statewide AFL-\nCIO to know me.\n  Page Groton's life is an example of dedication to a cause higher than \noneself. His legacy is his family, as well as an ethic of service that \nAmericans and Marylanders may follow with pride. His beloved wife \nMayrene Williams Groton and their two children, seven grandchildren, \nand five great grandchildren are in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/08/senate-section/article/S4506-5", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4506-S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RETIREMENT OF A.

Reid Leopold, Jr., MD, an accomplished physician from the great \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania who will be retiring on June 30, 2001. Dr. \nLeopold has dedicated his entire professional life to improving the \nhealth and well-being of others in our communities.\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\n  Dr. Leopold was born October 7, 1931 in Lewistown, PA. A graduate of \nLewistown High School, he studied for four years at Bucknell University \nin Lewisburg, PA before moving on to study medicine at Pittsburgh \nMedical School. In addition to practicing medicine for 43 years, Dr. \nLeopold served his country in the United States Navy for two years and \nserved as Mifflin County Coroner from 1964 to 1996.\n  A member of St. John's Lutheran Church in Lewistown, Dr. Leopold is \nmarried to the former Karen Doyle, and has two daughters, three sons, \ntwo step-daughters and eight grandchildren. Also a sports enthusiast, \nDr. Leopold can often be found spending his free time boating and \nfishing in Lake Raystown.\n  Dr. Leopold has been an outstanding member of the Lewistown \ncommunity, and has provided his friends and neighbors with quality \nhealthcare for many, many years. I congratulate him on his retirement \nand hope that he is blessed with many years of relaxation and enjoyment \nwith friends and family.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join with me in recognizing the \ncontributions that Dr. Leopold has made to the medical profession and \nto improving the lives of others.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide both \nState and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers \nduring internal investigations, interrogation of law enforcement \nofficers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, to ensure \naccountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to \nenact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in ``The Federalist No. 3,'' John Jay \nwrote that ``[a]mong the many objects to which a wise and free people \nfind it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for \ntheir safety seems to be the first.'' Such is the importance that our \nnation historically has placed on the maintenance of law and order. And \nour law enforcement officers, whom our country has charged with \ncarrying out this primary responsibility, shoulder a weighty, and often \ntimes dangerous, burden. In 1999 alone, one hundred and thirty-four law \nenforcement officers fell in the line of\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nduty, making the ultimate sacrifice to protect our communities.\n  While most Americans are aware that their police officers work in a \ndangerous environment, many Americans do not know that in enforcing the \nlaws that exist to protect us all, these officers, themselves, often \nare denied basic legal protections in internal investigations and \nadministrative hearings and are penalized for exercising their free \nspeech and associational rights. They live in fear of being \ninvestigated without notice, interrogated without an attorney, and \ndismissed without a hearing, often times at the behest of some recently \narrested criminal looking for a payback. In short, many officers do not \nenjoy the same basic due process and First Amendment rights as does the \ncriminal element from which they are trying to protect us.\n  According to the National Association of Police Organizations, Inc., \nNAPO, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this country, officers enjoy \nsome legal protections against false accusations and abusive conduct, \nbut hundreds of thousands of officers have very limited due process and \nFirst Amendment rights and confront limitations on their exercise of \nthose and other rights.'' And according to the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, FOP, ``[i]n a startling number of jurisdictions throughout this \ncountry, law enforcement officers have no procedural or administrative \nprotections whatsoever; in fact, they can be, and frequently are, \nsummarily dismissed from their jobs without explanation. Officers who \nlose their careers due to administrative or political expediency almost \nalways find it impossible to find new employment in public safety. An \nofficer's reputation, once tarnished by accusation, is almost \nimpossible to restore.'' In short, a trumped-up charge against a police \nofficer can result in a lifetime sentence of a damaged career and \nreputation.\n  It is time for our Nation to end this sorry situation. We must make \nsure that every member of law enforcement, in every jurisdiction in the \ncountry, is able to participate in the political process without fear \nof retaliation and is able to do his or her job without wondering \nwhether they can defend themselves if their performance is scrutinized. \nTo this end, I am proud to rise today with Senator Biden to introduce \nthe ``Law Enforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act \nof 2001.'' This bill would guarantee due process rights to every police \nofficer who is subject to investigation for non-criminal disciplinary \naction, and it would protect them from retribution on the job for \nparticipating in the political process while off the job. Some of these \nprotections are: the right to be informed of administrative charges \nprior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an \ninvestigation; the right to a hearing, as well as an opportunity to \nrespond; and the right to be represented by counsel or another \nrepresentative.\n  While this bill would protect the men and women who serve on the \nfront lines of our nation's war against crime, it would not do so at \nthe cost of citizen accountability. Just the opposite. It would \nstrengthen the ability of individual citizens to hold accountable those \nfew officers who misuse their authority. Specifically, as NAPO notes, \n``[o]ften police departments lack any guidelines and procedures for \nhandling and investigating complaints, thus raising doubts about \nofficer accountability.'' This bill will fill that void and thereby go \na long way to dispelling such doubts. By establishing, as the FOP \nobserves, ``an effective means for the receipt, review and \ninvestigation of public complaints against law enforcement officers \nthat is fair and equitable to all parties,'' this bill ensures that \nlegitimate citizen complaints against police officers will be actively \ninvestigated and that citizens will be informed of the progress and \noutcome of those investigations. It thus strikes an appropriate \nbalance: the bill makes sure that every police officer has basic \nfundamental procedural rights, while at the same time ensuring that \ncitizens have the opportunity to raise legitimate complaints and \nconcerns about police officer conduct.\n  This legislation is the product of much hard work and continual \nrefinements by leading law enforcement groups, most notably the FOP and \nthe NAPO. They have both strongly endorsed it, and, like Senator Biden \nand me, will work hard for its enactment. Over the years, Senator Biden \nand I, in conjunction with these groups, have made similar efforts to \nprotect the men and women who protect us. While we have not yet been \nsuccessful, we remain undeterred and will continue working toward our \ngoal. The time has come to give our law enforcement officers the basic \nand fundamental rights that they desperately deserve. We urge our \ncolleagues to join us in this very worthy effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 841. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate discriminatory copayment rates for outpatient psychiatric \nservices under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nMental Illness Non-Discrimination Act with my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator John Kerry.\n  In brief, my bill would a correct a serious disparity in payment for \ntreatment of mental disorders under Medicare law. Medicare \nbeneficiaries typically pay 20 percent coinsurance for most outpatient \nservices, including doctor's visits. Medicare pays the remaining 80 \npercent. But for treatment of mental disorders, Medicare law requires \npatients pay 50-percent coinsurance. Under my bill, patients seeking \noutpatient treatment for mental illness would pay the same 20 percent \ncoinsurance required of Medicare patients seeking treatment for any \nother illnesses.\n  Let's look at this issue in another way. If a Medicare patient has an \noffice visit for treatment for cancer or heart disease, the patient is \nresponsible for 20 percent of the doctor's fee. But if a Medicare \npatient has an office visit with a psychiatrist, psychologist, social \nworker, or other professional for treatment for depression, \nschizophrenia, or any other condition diagnosed as a mental illness, \nthe co-insurance for the outpatient visit for treatment of the mental \nillness is 50 percent. What sense does this make?\n  Indeed, my bill has a larger purpose, to help end an outdated \ndistinction between physical and mental disorders, and ensure that \nMedicare beneficiaries have equal access to treatment for all \nconditions.\n  Perhaps this disparity would matter less if mental disorders were not \nso prevalent. But the Surgeon General has told us otherwise. The \nimportance of access to treatment for mental disorders is emphasized in \na landmark report on mental health released by the Surgeon General in \n1999. The Surgeon General reported mental illness was second only to \ncardiovascular diseases in years of healthy life lost to either \npremature death or disability. And the occurrence of mental illness \namong older adults is widespread. Upwards of 20 percent of older adults \nin the community and an even higher percentage in primary care settings \nexperience symptoms of depression. Older Americans have the highest \nrate of suicide in the country, and the risk of suicide increases will \nage. Untreated depression among the elderly substantially increases the \nrisk of death by suicide.\n  There is another sad irony. While Medicare is often viewed as health \ninsurance for people over age 65, Medicare also provides health \ninsurance coverage for people with severe disabilities. The single most \nfrequent cause of disability for Social Security and Medicare benefits \nis mental disorders--affecting almost 1.4 million of 6 million \nAmericans who receive Social Security disability benefits. Yet, at the \nsame time, Medicare pays less for critical mental health services \nneeded by these beneficiaries than if they had a non-mental disorder.\n  But there is also the very good news that there are increasingly \neffective treatments for mental illnesses. With proper treatment, the \nmajority of people with a mental illness can lead productive lives. Yet \nbecause of fears of stigma and a lack of understanding of mental \ndisorders, too often mental disorders go untreated. Our payment \npolicies should not provide another barrier to access to care.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to bring Medicare payment policy \nfor mental disorders into the 21st century.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\nSnowe in introducing the Medicare Mental Illness Non-Discrimination \nAct. This legislation will establish mental health care parity in the \nMedicare program.\n  Medicare currently requires patients to pay a 20 percent co-payment \nfor all Part B services except mental health care services, for which \npatients are assessed a 50 percent co-payment. Thus, under the current \nsystem, if a Medicare patient sees an endocrinologist for diabetes \ntreatment, an oncologist for cancer treatment, a cardiologist for heart \ndisease treatment or an internist for treatment of the flu, the co-\npayment is 20 percent of the cost of the visit. If, however, a Medicare \npatient visits a psychiatrist for treatment of mental illness, the co-\npayment is 50 percent of the cost of the visit. This disparity in \noutpatient co-payment represents blatant discrimination against \nMedicare beneficiaries with mental illness.\n  The prevalence of mental illness in older adults is considerable. \nAccording to the U.S. Surgeon General, 20 percent of older adults in \nthe community and 40 percent of older adults in primary care settings \nexperience symptoms of depression, while as many as one out of every \ntwo residents in nursing homes are at risk of depression. The elderly \nhave the highest rate of suicide in the United States, and there is a \nclear correlation between major depression and suicide: 60 to 70 \npercent of suicides among patients 75 and older have diagnosable \ndepression. In addition to our seniors, 400,000 non-elderly disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries become Medicare-eligible by virtue of severe and \npersistent mental disorders. To subject the mentally disabled to \ndiscriminatory costs in coverage for the very conditions for which they \nbecame Medicare eligible is illogical and unfair.\n  There is ample evidence that mental illness can be treated. \nUnfortunately, among the general population, those in need for \ntreatment often do not seek it because they are ashamed of their \ncondition. Among our Medicare population, the mentally ill face a \ndouble burden: not only must they overcome the stigma about their \nillness, but once they seek treatment they must pay one-half of the \ncost of care out of their own pocket. The Medicare Mental Illness Non-\nDiscrimination Act will eliminate the 50 percent co-payment for mental \nhealth care services. By applying the same 20 percent co-payment rate \nto mental health services to which all other outpatient services are \nsubjected, the Medicare Mental Illness Non-Discrimination Act will \nbring parity to the Medicare program and improve access to care for our \nsenior and disabled beneficiaries who are living with mental illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 842. Bill to ensure that the incarceration of inmates is not \nprovided by private contractors or vendors and that persons charged or \nconvicted of an offense against the United States shall be housed in \nfacilities managed and maintained by Federal, State, or local \ngovernments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nSafety Act. This bill will prohibit the placement of Federal prisoners \nin facilities run by private companies and deny specified Federal funds \nto State and local governments that contract with private companies to \nmanage their prisons. Incarceration, or the deprivation of a person's \nliberty, is the penultimate control a State exercises over its \ncitizens. That authority should not be delegated to any private, for-\nprofit entity. We must restore responsibility for public safety and \nsecurity to our Federal, state and local governments.\n  As our nation has confronted prison overcrowding in recent years, \nprivate companies have stepped in to help communities address this \nissue by claiming they could alleviate bed shortages and manage prisons \nmore cost effectively than governments. But private companies and \ngovernments do not share the same goals with respect to corrections. \nFederal, State and local governments are motivated by public safety and \njustice, while private companies are motivated by a desire to cut costs \nand make a profit. Today, some 120,000 of our nation's 2 million total \njail and prison beds are provided by private for-profit companies. As \nreports of escapes, riots, prisoner violence, lack of adequate medical \ncare and abuse by staff in private prisons abound, many have begun to \nquestion the wisdom and propriety of delegating this essential \ngovernment function to private companies.\n  At a prison in Youngstown, OH run by a private company, 20 inmates \nwere stabbed, two fatally, within a ten month period shortly after the \nprison opened in May 1997. After the company claimed it had addressed \nthe problem, six inmates, four of them murderers, cut a hole in a fence \nduring recreation time and escaped in broad daylight. A report released \nin 1998 by the U.S. Department of Justice cited inexperienced and \npoorly trained officers and resulting excessive use of force at this \nYoungstown facility. The Justice Department also noted that the company \nfailed to recognize its responsibilities as a correctional service \nprovider and its reluctance to accept blame for the unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement at the prison. In 1999, the prison company \npaid $1.65 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought by inmates \nwho complained that, among other things, the prison provided inadequate \nmedical care and that guards were abusive.\n  Unfortunately, the problems that plague the Youngstown facility are \nnot unique. A private prison in Whiteville, TN, which houses many \ninmates from my home state of Wisconsin, has experienced a hostage \nsituation, an assault of a guard, and a coverup to hide physical abuse \nof inmates by guards. A security inspection found that this facility, \nrun by a private prison corporation, had unsecured razors, obstructed \nviews into individual cells, and an unsupervised inmate using a \ncomputer lab labeled ``staff only.''\n  Proponents of prison privatization claim that private prison \noperators save taxpayers money. But this has never been confirmed. In \nfact, two government studies raise significant doubt about whether \nprivate prisons save money. One study conducted by the GAO stated that \nthere is a lack of ``substantial evidence that savings have occurred'' \ndue to prison privatization. A second study completed by the Federal \nBureau of Prisons arrived at the same result: there is no strong \nevidence to show that States save money by using private prisons.\n  Private prison companies are guided by the same business principles \nas other corporations. Their goal is to make a profit and, in turn, \nplease officers and shareholders. This profit motive is inappropriate \nwhen the safety and security of guards and our communities are \nthreatened by prison violence and escapees.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen this cost-cutting turn into cutting \ncorners on public safety. Cutting corners means hiring unqualified and \nuntrained corrections personnel, as well as understaffing facilities. \nFurthermore, when prison riots break out or inmates escape, these costs \nare not cut but instead are shifted to the taxpayers, who must foot the \nbill for U.S. Marshals, sheriffs or local police or other officials to \nstep in and clean up the mess.\n  Private prison corporations make money when they house more inmates \nand provide fewer services. The result is that prisoners are deprived \nof the rehabilitation, education, and training that make it less likely \nthat they will commit more crimes after they have served their time. \nThis drive to keep ``beds filled'' is especially troubling because it \nadversely affects our nation's African American community, which is \nalready over-represented in the prison system.\n  The legislation I introduce today, The Public Safety Act, addresses \nthese concerns. It prohibits the Federal government from delegating \nresponsibility for incarceration of inmates to private entities. The \nbill also conditions Federal prison funds to states upon their \nagreement to retain responsibility for the incarceration of inmates and \nnot contract out this solemn responsibility to private companies. \nGovernments may contract with private vendors to provide auxiliary \nservices such as food or clothing, but governments would be prohibited \nfrom contracting out the core correctional responsibility of housing, \nsafeguarding, protecting or disciplining inmates.\n  Correctional officers have joined together with other government \nemployee groups and criminal justice activists to support this \nlegislation. The bill's supporters include the American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, the\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, AFGE, the International \nUnion of Police Associations, the Fraternal Order of Police and the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union.\n  Let us restore safety and security to the many Americans who work in \nprisons. Let us protect the communities that support prisons. And let \nus ensure the rehabilitation and safety of the individuals housed there \nso that they may return to society as productive law-abiding citizens. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Public Safety Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 842\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The issues of safety, liability, accountability, and \n     cost are the paramount issues in running corrections \n     facilities.\n       (2) In recent years, the privatization of facilities for \n     persons previously incarcerated by governmental entities has \n     resulted in frequent escapes by violent criminals, riots \n     resulting in extensive damage, prisoner violence, and \n     incidents of prisoner abuse by staff.\n       (3) In some instances, the courts have prohibited the \n     transfer of additional convicts to private prisons because of \n     the danger to prisoners and the community.\n       (4) Frequent escapes and riots at private facilities result \n     in expensive law enforcement costs for State and local \n     governments.\n       (5) The need to make profits creates incentives for private \n     contractors to underfund mechanisms that provide for the \n     security of the facility and the safety of the inmates, \n     corrections staff, and neighboring community.\n       (6) The 1997 Supreme Court ruling in Richardson v. McKnight \n     that the qualified immunity that shields State and local \n     correctional officers does not apply to private prison \n     personnel, and therefore exposes State and local governments \n     to liability for the actions of private corporations.\n       (7) Additional liability issues arise when inmates are \n     transferred outside the jurisdiction of the contracting \n     State.\n       (8) Studies on private correctional facilities have been \n     unable to demonstrate any significant cost savings in the \n     privatization of corrections facilities.\n       (9) The imposition of punishment on errant citizens through \n     incarceration requires State and local governments to \n     exercise their coercive police powers over individuals. These \n     powers, including the authority to use force over a private \n     citizen, should not be delegated to another private party.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subtitle A of title II of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994, an applicant shall provide \n     assurances to the Attorney General that if selected to \n     receive funds under such subtitle the applicant shall not \n     contract with a private contractor or vendor to provide core \n     correctional services related to the incarceration of an \n     inmate.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall apply to grant \n     funds received after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Effect on Existing Contracts.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to a contract in effect on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act between a grantee and a \n     private contractor or vendor to provide core correctional \n     services related to correctional facilities or the \n     incarceration of inmates.\n       (2) Renewals and extensions.--Subsection (a) shall apply to \n     renewals or extensions of an existing contract entered into \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``core correctional service'' means the housing, \n     safeguarding, protecting, and disciplining of persons charged \n     or convicted of an offense.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY IN THE DUTIES OF \n                   THE BUREAU OF PRISONS.\n\n       Section 4042(a) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (7);\n       (2) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4); and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) provide that any penal or correctional facility or \n     institution except for nonprofit community correctional \n     confinement, such as halfway houses, confining any person \n     convicted of offenses against the United States, shall be \n     under the direction of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons \n     and shall be managed and maintained by employees of Federal, \n     State, or local governments;\n       ``(6) provide that the housing, safeguarding, protection, \n     and disciplining of any person charged with or convicted of \n     any offense against the United States, except such persons in \n     community correctional confinement such as halfway houses, \n     will be conducted and carried out by individuals who are \n     employees of Federal, State, or local governments; and''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 843. A bill to provide assistance to States to expand and \nestablish drug abuse treatment programs to enable such programs to \nprovide services to individuals who voluntarily seek treatment for drug \nabuse; to the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Treatment on \nDemand Assistance Act to help ensure that substance abuse treatment is \navailable to all substance abusers who seek it.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, each year \ndrug and alcohol related abuse kills more than 120,000 Americans. In \n1999, an estimated 14.8 million Americans were illicit drug users, with \nnearly 5 million of them addicted to drugs.\n  Drugs and alcohol abuse costs taxpayers nearly $276 billion annually \nin preventable health care costs, extra law enforcement, auto crashes, \ncrime and lost productivity.\n  Additionally, the detrimental effect of substance abuse manifests \nitself in numerous ways. For instance, substance abuse is often the \nroot behind family violence and other criminal activity.\n  Even more devastating is that according to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, drug injections are one of the most common \nmodes of transmission of the AIDS virus.\n  In an effort to combat this problem, before stepping down as \nAmerica's Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey outlined in his final \nreport that the prescription for solving America's drug problem was: \n``prevention coupled with treatment accompanied by research.''\n  Despite the recognition that substance abuse treatment should be on \nthe Nation's agenda, there is still a large gap between those in need \nof drug treatment and the availability of treatment programs. Thus, \nwhen substance abusers finally do seek treatment, they are often turned \naway because of long waiting lists.\n  The numbers are shocking. While some substance abusers are not \nseeking treatment, many are, and are being turned away. In California, \nfor example, 60 percent of all facilities that maintain a waiting list \nhave an average of 23 people on their list on any given day.\n  Nationwide, there are over 5 million substance abusers, yet less than \nhalf are receiving treatment for their drug problems, leaving over 2.8 \nmillion people in need of treatment. This is unacceptable.\n  In order to address this problem, I strongly believe that along with \nincreased funding for law enforcement, especially those proven programs \nrun in jails and prisons, it is also necessary to provide additional \nfunding for treatment programs. Indeed, I believe that enforcement and \ntreatment are critical elements of an effective comprehensive drug \ncontrol policy.\n  To meet that goal, however, will require additional investment. \nThrough the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, \nSAMHSA, the Federal Government currently provides over $2 billion to \nstates and local entities for drug treatment programs, and total \nFederal spending in this area is just over $3 billion. Yet, this is not \nenough to get people the help they need when they need it.\n\n  For this reason, I am introducing the Treatment on Demand Assistance \nAct. Congressman Cal Dooley will introduce a companion measure in the \nHouse.\n  My bill would double the Federal government's funding for drug \ntreatment over five years, to $6 billion in fiscal year 2006.\n  Current treatment on demand programs focus on the specific drug abuse \nneeds of the local community. For instance, in San Francisco and \nCalifornia's Central Valley, methamphetamine abuse is especially \nproblematic and continues to be on the rise. In other cities, cocaine \nabuse or marijuana is the drug of choice. Treatment programs should be \ntargeted to address these local epidemics.\n  That is why the additional funding in this bill is provided through \nSAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and gives the Center the \nflexibility to\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\ntarget funds where they are needed most. Of the $3 billion in \nadditional funding set aside, 50 percent is provided in the form of \nformula grants to States, and 50 percent is reserved for direct grants \nto treatment centers.\n  The Treatment on Demand Assistance Act would also reward states that \nhave instituted a policy of providing substance abuse treatment to non-\nviolent drug offenders as an alternative to prison, as California \nrecently did with the enactment of Proposition 36. The bill authorizes \n$250 million per year for five years to provide matching grants to \nstates. These funds could be used to help pay for treatment as well as \nto provide other elements of a comprehensive anti-drug abuse program \nfor non-violent offenders, including drug testing, drug courts and \nprobation services.\n  In order to ensure that the funding is being effectively distributed, \nthe bill would require the General Accounting Office to monitor the \nprogram during the 2nd and 4th year of the grant programs.\n  Already, there is a groundswell of interest in this bill, with over \n100 organizations from both the treatment and law enforcement community \nactively supporting it. If groups as diverse as the California \nSheriff's Association, the California Public Defenders Association and \nthe National Association of Social Workers can come together, then \nsurely we can find the funding necessary to invest in substance abuse \ntreatment. Recent studies indicate that for every additional dollar \ninvested in substance abuse treatment taxpayers would save $7.46 in \nsocietal costs. Clearly, such an investment is worthwhile, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support treatment on demand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the list of \nendorsers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 843\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Treatment on Demand \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, each year drug and alcohol related abuse kills more \n     than 120,000 Americans.\n       (2) In 1999, an estimated 14,800,000 Americans were current \n     illicit drug users.\n       (3) States across the country are faced with increasing \n     demands for drug treatment programs.\n       (4) In addition, methamphetamine abuse continues to be on \n     the rise. Methamphetamine abuse accounts for 5.1 percent of \n     all treatment admissions, which was the fourth highest \n     percentage after cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.\n       (5) Current statistics show that methamphetamine use is \n     increasing rapidly especially among the nation's youth.\n       (6) There are over 2,800,000 substance abusers in America \n     in need of treatment.\n       (7) This number exceeds the 2,137,100 persons receiving \n     treatment.\n       (8) Recent reports indicate that every additional dollar \n     invested in substance abuse treatment saves taxpayers $7.46 \n     in societal costs.\n       (9) In California, the average cost to taxpayers per \n     inmate, per year, is $23,406 versus the national average cost \n     of $4,300 for a full treatment program.\n       (10) Drugs and alcohol cost taxpayers nearly \n     $276,000,000,000 annually in preventable health care costs, \n     extra law enforcement, auto crashes, crime and lost \n     productivity versus $3,100,000,000 appropriated for substance \n     abuse-related activities in fiscal year 2000.\n       (11) Nationwide, 59 percent of police chiefs believe that \n     drug offenders are served better by participation in \n     treatment programs versus prisons only.\n       (12) Current treatment on demand programs such as those in \n     San Francisco and Baltimore focus on the specific drug abuse \n     needs of the local community and should be encouraged.\n       (13) Many States have developed programs designed to treat \n     non-violent drug offenders and this should be encouraged.\n       (14) Drug treatment prevention programs must be increased \n     in order to effectively address the needs of those actively \n     seeking treatment before they commit a crime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) assist individuals who seek the services of drug abuse \n     treatment programs by providing them with treatment on \n     demand;\n       (2) provide assistance to help eliminate the backlog of \n     individuals on waiting lists to obtain drug treatment for \n     their addictions;\n       (3) enhance public safety by reducing drug-related crimes \n     and preserving jails and prison cells for serious and violent \n     criminal offenders;\n       (4) complement the efforts of law enforcement by providing \n     additional funding to expand current community-based \n     treatment efforts and prevent the recidivism of those \n     currently in the correctional system; and\n       (5) assist States in the implementation of alternative drug \n     treatment programs that divert non-violent drug offenders to \n     treatment programs that are more suited for the \n     rehabilitation of drug offenders.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nagricultural and animal waste sources as a renewable energy resource; \nto the committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nencourage the expansion of an often overlooked domestic energy resource \nthat offers a source of revenue for our rural communities and an avenue \nfor cleanup of agricultural waste. I am pleased to be joined by co-\nsponsors Senator Hutchinson and Senator Helms.\n  It has been well-publicized that our country faces mounting \nuncertainty in meeting our energy demands. After years of getting \nlittle attention, we are now in a period where the development of \ndomestic energy resources has reached a crucial point. I support our \nefforts to diversify our energy supply resources to ensure our nation's \nenergy security, support our business and agricultural economies, and \nprotect our individual consumers. This time of challenge also offers \ngreat opportunities. One of those is the opportunity to encourage a \nlargely untapped resource to provide domestic energy, while also \npromoting the protection of the environment and rural development. I am \nspeaking about energy derived from agricultural and animal waste \nsources.\n  Electricity from biomass and waste sources using modern technology is \na renewable resource that can add to our domestic energy supply. The \nprocess uses manure and waste products that are heated and converted \ninto biogas that is burned to generate electricity, which is sold into \nthe power grid. This technology is widely accepted in Europe where over \n600 systems are in operation today. In this country, the technology is \ngaining acceptance following numerous successful case studies. This \nprocess offers farmers an option for cleaning agricultural waste that \nis a known source of groundwater contamination and air pollution. The \nrevenue generated from the sale of electricity provides a source of \nincome to offset the cleanup costs, while providing important kilowatts \nto the power grid.\n  The bill I am introducing today would extend the 1.5 cent per \nkilowatt hour production tax credit that is currently available to \nwind, closed-loop biomass, and poultry waste by making it available to \nall agricultural and animal waste sources.\n  There have been other bills introduced that would extend the tax \ncredit to additional renewable sources such as solar energy. I \nencourage efforts to broaden the definition of renewable sources and, \nfor that reason, I am also proposing an amendment to S. 388, the \ncomprehensive national energy bill introduced by Senator Murkowski. The \namendment would add agricultural and animal waste as a renewable energy \nresource listed under that bill.\n  The use of modern technology to generate electricity from waste \nshould not be overlooked.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX RELIEF FOR \n                   ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The average salary for an elementary and secondary \n     school teacher in the United States with a Master's degree \n     and 16 years of experience is approximately $40,582.\n       (2) The average starting salary for teachers in the United \n     States is $26,000.\n       (3) Our educators make many personal and financial \n     sacrifices to educate our youth.\n       (4) Teachers spend on average $408 a year, out of their own \n     money, to bring educational supplies into their classrooms.\n       (5) Educators spend significant money out of their own \n     pocket every year on professional development expenses so \n     they can better educate our youth.\n       (6) Many educators accrue significant higher education \n     student loans that must be repaid and whereas these loans are \n     accrued by educators in order for them to obtain degrees \n     necessary to become qualified to serve in our nation's \n     schools.\n       (7) As a result of these numerous out of pocket expenses \n     that our teachers spend every year, and other factors, 6% of \n     the nation's teaching force leaves the profession every year, \n     and 20% of all new hires leave the teaching profession within \n     three years.\n       (8) This country is in the midst of a teacher shortage, \n     with estimates that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed \n     by 2009 because of teacher attrition, teacher retirement, and \n     increased student enrollment.\n       (9) The federal government can and should play a role to \n     help alleviate the nation's teaching shortage.\n       (10) The current tax code provides little recognition of \n     the fact that our educators spend significant money out of \n     their own pocket to better the education of our children.\n       (11) President Bush has recognized the importance of \n     providing teachers with additional tax relief, in recognition \n     of the many financial sacrifices our teachers make.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should--\n       (1) should pass legislation providing elementary and \n     secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     students.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 384.
