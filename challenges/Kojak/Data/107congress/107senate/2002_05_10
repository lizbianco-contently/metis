Madam President, I want to speak on a couple of subjects \nthis morning. First is what is happening in Israel.\n  Obviously, it is good news that at the Church of the Nativity, which \nis a shrine of significant importance to all of us who are Christian--\nobviously, it being the birthplace of Christ--that there has been a \nsettlement. This is a step in the right direction. It is something we \ncan take relief in because, clearly, the church itself was in physical \nrisk, as were the people inside and outside of the church. It would \nhave been a terrible tragedy in this conflict\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nbetween the parties in the Mideast if that shrine had been permanently \ndamaged. So this is good news.\n  At the same time, of course, we should not overstate it as an event. \nClearly, there is much still happening in the Mideast. Israel, in \nexercising its rights, will probably proceed to take further action to \ntry to find the people who are responsible for the terrible suicide \nbombing that occurred just a few days ago. There may be a military \naction in Gaza. At least that is what is being represented. I think we \nas a culture--our country--have to decide how we are going to deal with \nthis situation.\n  The President has made it very clear that as a result of the \nterrorist attacks on our Nation, we intend to track down terrorists \nwherever they are and we intend to bring them to justice. In addition, \nif there is a government that supports those terrorists, we intend to \ntreat that government as an enemy and bring it to justice, as we did in \nAfghanistan. I believe this to be the absolutely appropriate authority. \nThis is the Bush doctrine. This is the guideline that we must follow. \nWe are in a fight, whether we like it or not, for our cultural \nsurvival, for our civilization and its survival.\n  The purpose of our enemy is not to take real estate or take advantage \nof real estate or take advantage of economic gain, as has been the \ntradition of war over the centuries. The purpose of our enemy is to \nsimply kill us because we are American. In fact, if you read the books \nof Osama bin Laden and of Mulla Muhammad Omar, you see this all the \ntime. The quotes simply say they call on their followers to kill \nAmericans because they are Americans, and for no other reason, and to \ndestroy us. That is their goal.\n  Well, if the Bush doctrine states clearly and appropriately that our \npurpose is to find terrorists and bring them to justice, and to treat \nterrorist governments as if they are our enemy and bring those \ngovernments down, then we cannot say to Israel that they should not \nfollow that doctrine. Israel is equally under a terrorist attack--in \nfact, in many ways, more so because they are more threatened because of \ntheir physical situation.\n  As the suicide bombers continue to kill innocent people and cause \ngreat personal injury and try to disrupt the Nation of Israel, which is \na democracy and which is an ally, we as a nation must support Israel \nand say: You have the right, as we also believe we have the right, to \npursue these terrorists and bring them to justice and pursue \ngovernments that support these terrorists and bring them to justice.\n  It is very clear--I do not think there can be any question about it--\nthat the Palestinian Authority has been a source of support for \nterrorist activity. We need to support Israel at this time as we would \nexpect our allies and have expected our allies to support us during our \ndifficult time.\n  It does mean there probably will be further confrontations, but it \nalso means that at least we will be standing for a purpose which is \nclear and definable and which is true and correct, and that is we will \nnot tolerate terrorism against our country or against our allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4186-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4186-S4188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, last night an agreement was reached on \nthis trade promotion authority, on the trade adjustment language, and \nthe Andean trade agreement, three bills which have been bundled by the \nmajority leader--there is a fourth one, the general tariffs agreement--\nthat we have been trying to work through as a body. Last night, I \nunderstand the parties negotiated a comprehensive settlement to these \nissues involving trade and trade adjustment.\n  Trade promotion authority is very important legislation. We as a \nnation, and States such as New Hampshire specifically--and States such \nas the Presiding Officer's State especially--depend inordinately on our \ncapacity to have free trade with other countries because our States, \nour culture has its competitive edge not in some material or commodity \nwe produce, such as an agricultural good or oil; our economic advantage \nin New Hampshire is that we have people who are very bright and produce \ngoods that are on the cutting edge.\n  Unfortunately, in the international economy, when you are producing \ncutting-edge goods, there is a tendency of other nations that cannot \nkeep up to block those goods from coming into their country.\n  It always works to our advantage to open up a country's trade with us \nbecause the goods which we produce--which are on the cutting edge, \nwhich are the next generation, and always a step ahead of their \ncompetition--become available for sale in that country where we have \nopened barriers.\n  In New Hampshire, for example, almost 30 percent of the jobs are tied \ndirectly to products which are produced and sold overseas. So trade \npromotion authority--which is basically a vehicle to allow the \nadministration to negotiate trade agreements, almost all of which, I \npresume, will allow us to enter other markets--trade promotion \nauthority is very important legislation. This Congress has passed it \nyear in and year out--for many years. In fact, I voted for it \ninnumerable times when I was in the House and even had a chance to vote \nfor it in the Senate.\n\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years, it has become tied up with \nother issues, but I do believe there has always been a strong \nbipartisan consensus to give the President trade promotion authority.\n  Unfortunately, as I mentioned, we have now attached to trade \npromotion authority other issues because people realized around here \nthat if there is a train leaving the station and you can put something \non it, the odds are you are going to be able to pass it. These are \nitems which might not pass under a freestanding situation. That is \nunfortunate because trade promotion is so important. It should not be \nthrown into this type of a bundle. It should be voted on separately. \nBut the majority leader decided to bundle it.\n  In that bundle he has put some things which I find to have serious \nproblems, specifically the trade adjustment language and the expansion \nof the entitlements under the trade adjustment language.\n  There are two major initiatives in this proposal which are going to \nsignificantly expand direct costs and burdens on the taxpayers of \nAmerica and will open the door to policy activity in an arbitrary way, \nand we cannot see the unintended consequences yet, which I think are \ngoing to be significant and extraordinarily expensive.\n  The trade adjustment bill, which is not involved in negotiating \ntreaties, the purpose of which is to assist people whose jobs have been \nimpacted as a result of trade activity--in other words, if you worked \nfor a textile mill in New Hampshire maybe 20 years ago, and that \ntextile mill was put out of business because of trade activity, because \nof low-cost cotton goods coming into the country--in fact, it happened \neven more recently than that. There are a couple companies in the \nwestern part of New Hampshire that have gone out of business in recent \nyears as a result of trade activity. If you work for that type of \ncompany, under the trade adjustment authority, you would have certain \nbenefits accrued to you in the areas of training and unemployment \ncompensation so you can have an opportunity to get back into the \nworkforce more quickly and be less impacted by that trade activity.\n  What is being proposed in this bill, however, is a significant \nexpansion to benefit those people--well-intentioned, obviously--who \nhave been dislocated as a result of trade activities, specifically the \nexpansion of health care coverage and a wage supplement should they not \ntake a different job. Let's talk about both of these.\n  Madam President, the health care benefit means if you lose your job \nand it is designated a job loss as a result of trade activity, you will \nbe able to get health insurance. Seventy percent of the cost of that \nwill be paid by the Federal Government. You will be out of work, but \nyou will be able to get health insurance. You will have to buy it \nthrough a pooling agreement. You will not be able to go out on the \nmarket and buy it. You will have to buy it through a pooling agreement, \nand you will be reimbursed through what is called a refundable tax \ncredit. It is a tax benefit, a payment which amounts to an entitlement \npayment and really is not tax related at all. You will get this money \nand be able to buy through this pooling agreement, theoretically\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\nat least, health insurance. It might not be the health insurance you \nwant, but you can buy it and get 70-percent support for it.\n  What is the problem with that? It sounds pretty good. Yes, it is \npretty good, obviously. What does it do? It does a couple of things. \nFirst, if you are working today in America, you may not have health \ninsurance. You are paying taxes, but you may not have health insurance. \nThere may be a variety of reasons you do not have health insurance.\n  This bill says a person who is unemployed has a right to have their \nhealth insurance underwritten to the extent of 70 percent of its cost, \nbut a person who is employed and may not have health insurance does not \nget health insurance. That clearly creates a huge inequity in our \nsystem.\n  It is a new concept: If you are unemployed, you have a right to \nhealth insurance. But if you are employed and you do not have health \ninsurance, you are out of luck.\n  The implications of this are that either you are going to start \ncovering everybody because, obviously, you are already covering the \nunemployed or you are going to leave a large segment of America saying: \nHey, I am working for a living; I am paying taxes for a living; I do \nnot have health insurance, but I have to pay extra taxes so that \nsomebody who is not working can have health insurance.\n  I think that is going to be hard to swallow for people who are \nworking and do not have health insurance.\n  In addition, the structure and the way the health insurance is going \nto be purchased make very little sense. The pooling agreements do not \nexist. In fact, the State that is probably furthest ahead in pooling \nagreements is New Hampshire, and we do not even have it up and running \nyet.\n  The concept that one cannot go out in the marketplace and buy it if \nthey want, that one has to buy it through some sort of structured event \nwhich may mean they are going to get insurance they do not need, \ncoverage they do not need, costs they do not need, probably get a lot \nbetter deal maybe if they go out and buy it through a different system, \nthe limitation which basically is forcing them to buy it in one \nspecific way versus allowing them to use the marketplace, completely \nmakes no sense. If this is going to be done, which to begin with is to \ncreate a major new entitlement, then it ought to at least be done in a \nway that makes economic sense to the person who is getting the benefit \nand makes sense to the insurance market so that a healthier insurance \nmarket is made rather than a less healthy insurance market.\n  In this proposal, it will not be positive for health insurance for \nenergizing better coverage. There is a major new entitlement being \ncreated under this bill, which is being created in back rooms \nsomewhere, which has never really gone through the light of day of the \ncommittee process and which has very little to do with trade--in fact, \nnothing to do with trade, for that matter--and is opening the door to a \nhuge new issue of how we deliver health care coverage in this country.\n  As a result, it is setting down a path which we may not be able to \nget off and which may basically lead to a massive expansion along the \nlines of what was proposed by President Clinton of the way we address \nhealth care in this country, which is essentially a nationalization \nsystem. I do not think that is too far fetched a step to take. This is \nmore than just putting your toe in the water as to moving down that \nroad. When we start insuring people who do not have jobs and give them \nhealth insurance when there are people who do have jobs who do not have \nhealth insurance, it is going to be incredibly expensive. Who pays in \nthe end? Well, the money we use in the Federal Government does not come \nfrom the sky. It comes from the wage earner. It comes from people who \nhave to pay taxes.\n  This is a huge, brandnew entitlement being put together in the middle \nof the night--this one especially in the middle of the night--which has \nnot been properly vetted and which has significant issues surrounding \nit.\n  The second concept in this bill which raises very serious public \npolicy questions is this idea the Federal Government is going to come \nin and say to somebody who has lost a job as a result of trade activity \nthat if that person goes out and finds a job that does not pay them as \nmuch as they had in the job they lost as a result of trade activity, \nthe Federal Government is going to come in and arbitrarily pay a \nportion of the difference between what that person earned under their \njob prior to the trade activity and the job after the trade activity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 10 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Missouri.\n  What is the practical effect? Let's take an example. If someone is \nworking, for example, for a steel company, which is an example that is \nfairly current considering the discussions, and they were being paid \nlabor union wages at a very high rate--let's say they were making \n$40,000 a year, maybe more--and they lost their job allegedly because \nthe steel was no longer competitive with the foreign steel that was \ncoming in--there are a lot of factors that may have led to that, \nincluding the fact that wage rates were no longer competitive--and then \nthey move out of that job and take another job--let's say they decide, \nwell, I would like to teach; I have done steel for 20 years and I am \ntired of it; I want to do something else, maybe I want to go into \nteaching--and they get a teaching job at a private school, say a \nCatholic school that does not pay too much--it is more of a social \nservice really--and they are getting paid $20,000 to do that, the \n$20,000 they are not making the Federal Government is going to come in \nand supplement and say, we are going to pay the difference or a portion \nof that difference.\n  Well, that creates all sorts of unintended consequences and adverse \nselection issues. I can see a lot of people saying, I am going to close \nmy company down, claim the trade caused them to close their company \ndown and they are going to go out and get another job which pays a lot \nless, which is a job they always wanted to have; they are tired of \ndoing this job, and they will let the Government pay the difference.\n  The implications of this are absolutely staggering. One does not have \nto think too long to see what the implications are. And who is paying \nthe cost? Where is this money coming from? The American wage earner, \nthe people still working for a living, working hard, they have to pick \nup that difference. Essentially we are going to pay people not to be as \nproductive as they were before, because in our society theoretically \npeople are paid based on their productivity. The implications for our \neconomy are significant; the implications for the Federal Treasury are \nsignificant; the implications for our taxpayers are significant. It is \na public policy initiative of huge import, and maybe we want to do it, \nbut I do not think we want to do it in the middle of the night the way \nthis bill is proceeding.\n  The trade adjustment language in this bill raises very significant \nproblems, and to hook it to the trade promotion authority raises the \nquestion: Is it worth the price of getting trade promotion authority to \nput in place these types of expansive public policy initiatives which \ninvolve huge implications on the expenditure side of our Government? \nThat is a question with which the Senate has to deal.\n  Obviously, the Senate may be supportive of it, but it is a question \nwith which we have to deal. I think it is a question we should vote on \nbecause it is way outside the budget and a point of order is \nappropriate to these two issues because they are outside the budget. We \nought to at least have a supermajority addressing this issue rather \nthan having it passed on a simple majority.\n  I thank the Chair, and I especially thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, first, I support and second very strongly \nthe comments made by my good friend and colleague from New Hampshire. I \nam a traditionalist, and I like to see things\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\ncome out of the committee because, frankly, committee work ensures \nthere is full consideration of all the measures that come to the floor. \nWe have seen leadership rewriting bills--the farm bill, the energy \nbill, the stimulus bill--and the products are not good.\n  What my colleague from New Hampshire has described seems to me not \nonly a very expensive, very bad policy direction that has been taken on \nthis trade adjustment assistance, it is beginning to smell to me like \nan effort to love it to death. I have been around legislative bodies \nlong enough to know if one does not want to stand up and kill \nsomething, such as trade promotion, they do not want to come out and \nsay, no, I am not for free trade, the best way to kill it is to put so \nmuch stuff on it that it sinks.\n  This was not done in committee. This was not done in the light of \nday, as the Senator from New Hampshire said. This was done behind the \nscenes. This was an effort to sabotage trade promotion. I hope this \nbody will say no. Frankly, if it were to go to the President with all \nof this junk on it, I hope he would veto it and send it back.\n  We need trade promotion authority. We do not need a huge new \nsocialistic program to have the Federal Government paying people's \nsalaries when they are working. Trade adjustment assistance \ntraditionally as we have had it, yes, it makes a lot of sense, but to \nhave a whole new health care program, not going through the committee \nstructure, a whole new income supplement program not fully considered, \nnot aired out, put on this bill, I think is an outrage.

The President \ndeclared this week Small Business Week and we have had small business \nactivities all week talking about wonderful entrepreneurs who are \nmaking the economy grow and providing jobs as well as strengthening \ntheir communities.\n  I don't think there is any question that small businesses are the \nfoundation of our economy. They employ over half the private sector \nworkforce. Two-thirds of all new jobs are created by small businesses. \nThey constantly lead the way in innovative and creative solutions to \nthe challenges that face us.\n  Some very large businesses, obviously, started as small businesses. \nOthers have chosen to remain small. This country's future will be \ndetermined by today's small businesses.\n  With so much at stake, we have adopted the policy in the Committee on \nSmall Business of doing something that was not traditional prior to \n1995 when we started going out and listening to the broad range of \nconcerns of small business. I am proud to say on a bipartisan basis the \nCommittee on Small Business over the last 7 years has not only listened \nto the needs of small business but done a very good job in responding \nto those needs. As the ranking member of the committee, I can say I \nhave always learned when I have listened to the small businesses in my \nState and around the country.\n  There is something now they are discussing that has moved to the top \nof their concerns, moved to the top of the ladder. Small business \nconcerns used to be regulatory issues, tax issues, bundling issues, \navailability of the SBA credit assistance. The issue driving small \nbusiness owners and their employees nuts is the issue of the cost of \nhealth care. Small businesses are saying they cannot get the kind of \nhealth care for themselves and their employees and families that a \nlarge business or a union or a government can provide.\n  There are about 40 million people in this country without health \ninsurance. We talk about that a lot. This is a serious concern. Madam \nPresident, 60 percent of those--24 million--are in the small business \nfamily. Of the 40 million without health insurance, 24 million are from \nsmall business. They are either workers in small business or members of \nthe family of small business employees. Why? To a large extent in the \npast we have not given tax deductions for entrepreneurs, small business \nproprietors who buy health insurance for themselves.\n  I started that battle in 1995 and by 2003 we finally get 100-percent \ndeductibility. Now the problem is the cost of health insurance. Many \nindividuals who are among the employed but uninsured work for small \nbusinesses that would like to provide health insurance but can't \nbecause in some instances it is too expensive; in other instances they \ncannot bargain with and get the kind of benefits they need. They are \nnot talking about lavish benefits.\n  We are trying to get basic health care for employees, their families, \ntheir children, mothers who need prenatal and postnatal care, children \ngetting vaccinations. It does not matter how many mandates are passed \nregarding what States say to businesses, what they ought to do, health \nplans saying what they ought to do, or even a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nOne basic right the small businesses don't have is the right to be able \nto purchase affordable health care.\n  It seems to me the only solution to help the employed but uninsured \nis to allow small businesses across the country to pool together and \naccess health insurance through their membership in a bona fide trade \nor professional organization. This should provide small businesses the \nsame opportunities as other large insurance purchasers. The association \nhealth plans, or AHPs, would reduce cost, to spread the costs and risk, \nincrease group bargaining power with large insurance companies, and \ngenerate more insurance options for small business.\n  The principle underpinning AHPs is simple, the same principle that \nmakes it cheaper to buy a soda by the case than in individual cans. \nBulk purchasing is why large companies and unions get better rates for \nemployees and small business. It is time we bring the same kind of \nFortune 500-style employee health care benefits to the Nation's Main \nStreet small businesses and their employees.\n  AHPs are not a new idea. They have been talked about, argued about, \ncompromised for almost a decade. During that period, what once was \nthought to be a manageable problem has become the crisis we have today. \nA bill has been introduced by my neighbor, my friend from Arkansas, \nSenator Hutchinson, that creates these AHPs. It is the Small Business \nHealth Fairness Act of 2001. I cannot overstate the urgency of moving \nthis legislation. The House has passed a similar bill. The President \nhas strongly come out in support of AHPs. The President does not want \nsmall businesses to be health insurance islands under themselves. I \nagree. We must do this for small businesses, their employees, and their \nemployees' families.\n  Also, it is important we go ahead and make permanent the tax cuts we \nprovided last year. More than 21 million businesses filed tax returns \nas individuals. These are nonfarm, sole proprietorships, partnerships \nand S Corporations. They had receipts of less than $1 million. And 92 \npercent of all small businesses under $1 million are passthrough \nentities. The tax rate relief we gave last year means there will be \nmore money to invest in the business, to invest in equipment, and to \nput more people to work. We need to make it permanent.\n  We are not talking about rich ``fat cats'' here. According to 1999 \nCensus data, of the nearly 15 million full-time, self-employed people \nin 1999, median business earnings were $30,000 and 38 percent of them \nearned between $30,000 and $75,000.\n  In addition, the former chief economist for the SBA's Office of \nAdvocacy, testified last March before the Senate Finance Committee that \n``[e]very dollar of profit or tax relief tends to be re-invested in the \n[owner's] firm.'' With more of their tax dollars in hand, these small \nbusiness owners will be able to reinvest in their businesses--purchase \nnew and more efficient equipment. They will be able to expand their \nproduct lines and the services they render. And--most importantly--they \nwill be able to continue creating more jobs in our home towns.\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\n  But the tax bill did not stop at just cutting tax rates. It also \ndramatically changed the death tax, putting it on the road to \nextinction by 2010. Too often we have heard about the family-owned \ncompany that has had to be sold just to pay the death taxes. According \nto the SBA, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not \nsurvive through the second generation and fully 87 percent do not make \nit to a third generation. That's an absurd result of the tax code.\n  But we are forgetting an even greater problem caused by the estate \ntax. Thousands of small businesses in this country waste millions of \ndollars each year on estate planning and insurance costs just to keep \nthe doors open if the owner should die.\n  To put this into perspective, a survey of family owned businesses in \nUpstate New York revealed that average spending for tax planning, \nattorney and consultant fees, life insurance premiums, internal labor \ncosts, etc., was nearly $125,000 per company over a 5 year period. \nThat's even before any Federal estate taxes are counted.\n  Just think what could be done with that kind of money in a small \nbusiness if it didn't have to be paid to accountants, lawyers, and \ninsurance companies. It could be used to create more jobs in our \ncommunities. In short, the estate tax can spell the end of a small \nbusiness, but it is also a jobs killer in this country.\n  With all of its strengths, however, the tax bill has one major flaw--\nprocedural rules in the Senate forced it to be limited to a ten-year \nlife. So, while America's entrepreneurs can enjoy the benefits of the \ntax bill today and over the next several years, our work is not \nfinished. We must make the tax cuts, and in particular the repeal of \nthe estate tax, permanent. Otherwise, our success in reducing the tax \nburden will turn into the largest tax increase in American history come \n2011. That's a result I will strongly oppose and hope never to see.\n  Of course, another of the primary issues that come to me is how to \ncreate more small businesses. Money and good management skills are keys \nto starting and running a successful small business. The federal \ngovernment has demonstrated that it is capable of delivering help in \nboth areas to small businesses through the Small Business \nAdministration. Each year, over one million small business people and \nentrepreneurs receive help from the SBA's core management assistance \nprograms: the Small Business Development Centers, SCORE, and the Women \nBusiness Centers.\n  At the same time, SBA has demonstrated an ability to make loans and \nventure capital available to 40,000-50,000 small businesses annually. \nWhile the number of small businesses has exploded over the past decade, \nthe SBA credit programs have not been able to keep pace with the \ndemand. As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, SBA's credit \nprograms are not designed to compete with the private sector; rather, \nthey are supposed to meet the demand from small businesses that cannot \notherwise obtain a regular commercial loan or investment capital.\n  This demand is great; unfortunately, these programs are not meeting \nthe growing small business demand, particularly from women-owned small \nbusinesses, which is the fastest growing small business segment. Much \nof the blame can be placed on career bureaucrats in the Office of \nManagement and Budget who use unrealistically high default estimates to \ndrive up the cost of the SBA's flagship 7(a) guaranteed business loan \nprogram. Just for next year, OMB's estimates are adding an unnecessary \n$100 million in appropriations to the cost to run the program. Since \n1992, OMB's estimates have caused the borrowers and lender to pay about \n$1.4 billion in excess fees. The excess fees and the pressure for \nhigher appropriations have placed unnecessary and counterproductive \nlimits on the growth of the 7(a) loan program.\n  The other SBA credit programs have also experienced similar problems. \nThe 504 Development Company Loan Program has paid excessive fees \ntotaling over $400 million, and the Small Business Investment Company \nProgram has paid in $500 million over the amount needed to run that \nprogram.\n  To begin to correct this problem, last December Congress enacted S. \n1196, which included key provisions lowering the fees from the 7(a) and \n504 loan programs. These changes will go into effect on October 1, \n2002.\n  Last fall, I introduced the Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery \nAct of 2001, S. 1493, which is designed to provide effective economic \nstimulus to small businesses in three distinct but complementary ways: \nincreasing access to capital for the Nation's small enterprises; \nproviding tax relief and investment incentives for our small firms and \nthe self-employed; and directing one of the Nation's \nlargest consumers--the Federal government--to shop with small business \nin America.\n\n  Subsequently, Senator Kerry and I introduced S. 1499, which adopts \nthe access to capital provisions from S. 1493. This bill is a \nbipartisan collaboration to devise one-time modifications to the 7(a) \nand 504 Loan Programs because the traditional approach to disaster \nrelief will not address the critical needs of thousands of small \nbusinesses located at or around the World Trade Center, the Pentagon \nand in strategic locations throughout the United States. S. 1499 has \npassed the Senate and is waiting for action in the House of \nRepresentatives. In the near future, I am hopeful we can add this \nimportant bill to another must-pass bill so that it can be on the \nPresident's desk for his approval.\n  The SBA has undertaken the first creative steps to reach more small \nbusiness borrowers. I applaud their efforts and encourage the SBA \nmanagement team led by Administrator Hector Barreto to do more. It is \nestimated there are as many as 25 million small businesses in the \nUnited States. Our Federal credit programs need to be able to reach \nmany more small commercial borrowers. When I hear from women's business \nowners that they cannot obtain loans or investment capital, I want to \nknow why the SBA programs are not serving this fast-growing segment of \nour Nation's business community. When minority entrepreneurs cannot \nobtain credit, I want to know what SBA is doing to correct this \nproblem.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am in a position to take the battle to the OMB. But \nit is up to the SBA to work with our Nation's lenders and venture \ncapitalists to find ways to expand existing programs and to create new \nways to deliver credit assistance to help fuel the engine that drives \nthe economy of the United States--the small business community.\n  One thing that can sap the strength of that engine is the burden \nimposed on small businesses by regulations. The SBA Office of Advocacy \nhas estimated that regulations cost businesses with less than 20 \nemployees almost $7000 per employee per year. This is nearly 60 percent \nhigher than businesses with over 500 employees.\n  Six years ago, Congress, without dissent in the Senate, took an \nhistoric step towards reigning in the federal government's regulatory \nmachine and protecting the interests of small businesses. My Red Tape \nReduction Act, what others call the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act, ensured that small businesses would be given \na voice in the regulatory process at the time when it could make the \nmost difference: before the regulation is published as a proposal.\n  Without question, the Red Tape Reduction Act has yielded some \nremarkable results and provided small businesses with a greater voice \nand opportunity to have an impact in the rulemakings which threaten to \ndo them the most harm. Perhaps the best known provision is the \nrequirement that OSHA and EPA convene panels to receive comments from \nsmall businesses before their regulations are proposed. This gives \nthese agencies the unique opportunity to learn up front what the \nproblems with their regulation may be, and to correct these problems \nwhen it will cause the least difficulty. This has resulted in \nsignificant changes being made, and in one case, EPA abandoning a \nregulation because they recognized that the industry could deal with \nthe issue more effectively on their own.\n  Experience with this panel process has proven to be an unequivocal \nsuccess. The former Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration Jere Glover has stated that, ``Unquestionably, the \nSBREFA panel process has had a very salutary impact\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\non the regulatory deliberations of OSHA and EPA, resulting in major \nchanges to draft regulations. What is important to note is that these \nchanges were accomplished without sacrificing the agencies public \npolicy objectives.''\n  Unfortunately, however, there are still examples where agencies have \nnot provided small businesses with the appropriate opportunity to \nparticipate, and have flouted the requirements of SBREFA through \nabusing the flexibility Congress provided to the agencies to determine \nhow and when they would comply. It has become clear that these are more \nthan mere isolated incidents and that the Red Tape Reduction Act itself \nneeds to be amended to achieve the goal Congress had in mind when \npassing the original Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the subsequent Red \nTape Reduction Act.\n  This is why I introduced The Agency Accountability Act, S. 849 during \nlast year's Small Business Week. This bill would further amend the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act and close some of the loopholes that \nagencies have exploited in their desire to pursue their regulatory \nagendas on the backs of small businesses by doing the following:\n  It requires the agency to publish a summary of their economic \nanalysis supporting the decision not to certify a regulation as not \nhaving ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities,'' and to make the full economic analysis available to the \npublic so that interested parties will be able to evaluate whether the \nagency has met their burden to do adequate outreach and analysis in \ndetermining the impact of the regulation.\n  It allows small entities to seek judicial review of \nthis certification decision if they believe that the agency has not \nsupported it with adequate data and analysis.\n\n  It directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration to promulgate a regulation to define further the terms \nof ``significant economic impact'' and ``substantial number of small \nentities'' so that agencies can no longer define these terms themselves \nand claim that they were within the bounds of the law when their \ndefinitions allow them to avoid the requirements of SBREFA and the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n  Finally, it adds the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Forest \nService, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service to the list of agencies that must conduct small \nbusiness review panels before they can issue proposed regulations.\n  Another area the agencies have failed at miserably is to supply the \ncompliance assistance that is required by the Red Tape Reduction Act. \nGAO has issued a report that clearly indicates how agencies have \nignored this requirement or made a complete botch of it when they have \nattempted to meet it. I will be introducing legislation to address this \nproblem soon.\n  My views are simple. I want an agency that intends to regulate how a \nbusiness must conduct its affairs to do so carefully and only after it \nhas taken every step to insure that it will impose on that small \nbusiness the least amount of burden to achieve its stated objective. \nOnce they do issue a regulation, they have an obligation to be able to \nexplain what small businesses must do to comply with it. This is not \nabout blocking agencies from promulgating regulations, it is about \nmaking sure they produce the best regulations possible with the least \nunnecessary burden on small businesses.\n  Six years ago, the Senate said in a unanimous voice that it wanted \nagencies to treat small businesses fairly. That commitment to \nprotecting this most vulnerable segment of our economy, at a time when \nthe Federal government can literally determine if a business will \nsurvive as a result of the regulatory burden imposed on it, is still \nalive. It is time that we ensured agencies are accountable for their \nactions by enacting the Agency Accountability Act.\n  On the positive side, the Federal Government can be and should be a \nreliable and committed purchaser of goods and services from small \nbusinesses. The Small Business Act says that small firms shall have the \nmaximum practicable opportunity to compete for Federal contracts. This \nis good for small business, good for the purchasing agencies, and good \nfor the taxpayer who pays the bills because when small business \ncompetes for contracts this lowers the prices and raises the quality.\n  Small business benefits from having access to a stable revenue stream \nwhile they get up-and-running. The Small Business Act recognizes how \ngovernment contracting can contribute to business development and \neconomic renewal. For example, my HUBZone program provides contracting \nincentives for small firms to locate in blighted neighborhoods, helping \nthem win Federal contracts and stabilize their revenues while they \ndevelop a nongovernmental customer base.\n  The State of Small Business, on this front, is mixed. We finally \nsucceeded in restoring funding for the HUBZone program, as SBA finally \nsent up a reprogramming request that the Appropriations Committee found \nacceptable. The mishap that occurred last year, of defunding the \nHUBZone program, has now been corrected.\n  Moreover, SBA is on the verge of removing the biggest of the \nroadblocks currently holding the HUBZone program back. Contrary to \nexpress Congressional direction, the previous Administration had put \nthe HUBZone and 8(a) contracting programs in competition with each \nother, by trying to give an automatic preference to 8(a) in all cases. \nWe at the Small Business Committee had sought to avoid pitting these \nprograms against each other, by mandating parity between the programs. \nContracting officers would be equally obligated to carry out both \nprograms.\n  SBA disregarded the congressional will on this point, and contracting \nofficers found the regulations confusing. SBA's noncompliance hurt both \nprograms, because contracting officers did not know what to do.\n  In January, SBA published proposed rules to correct this situation \nand to establish the parity that Congress intended. I am confident we \nare about to enter a new era in which the HUBZone program will finally \nlive up to its potential.\n  And not a moment too soon, either. This program will direct \ncontracting dollars into the most chronically distressed areas of the \nnation. People who live in these areas, without jobs and often without \nhope, need the opportunities that the HUBZone program will provide. \nFinally, we are going to get serious about getting help to these folks \nwho need it so desperately.\n  Unfortunately, Federal government's performance in contracting with \nwomen-owned small businesses is less encouraging. Since 1994, when \nCongress enacted a goal of 5 percent of contract dollars for women-\nowned firms, the Government has consistently fallen short. We have \nnever met that goal. We have never come close.\n\n  Last year, I received a report from the General Accounting Office on \ncontracting participation by women-owned firms. The clear message was \nthis: if the Government is to meet the 5 percent goal, the Department \nof Defense must meet its own 5 percent goal. DOD is the 800-pound \ngorilla in Federal procurement. Sixty-four percent of Federal \ncontracting dollars come from the Pentagon. Without a full DOD \ncommitment to the women-owned business goal, the rest of the Government \ndoes not handle enough contracting dollars to make up the shortfall.\n  Similarly, DOD frequently uses the practice of bundling small \ncontracts together so that small businesses are unable to bid on the \nwork. In the words of President Bush ``Bundling effectively excludes \nsmall businesses.'' He understands this hurts small business and has \nasked OMB to look for ways to avoid this approach and for opportunities \nto break up bundled contracts to permit more participation by small \nbusiness. I welcome the President's support in this cause.\n  This week Senator Kerry and I offered a bill that would close \nloopholes in the definition. I appreciated working with him to develop \nthis important measure. Increasingly, it looks like we are getting \nclose to a meeting of the minds on this issue, and I am hopeful we can \nat long last do something serious to control contract bundling and \nensure that the Federal government's contracting practices allow for \nthe maximum possible participation by small business.\n  Never has our country needed or relied upon small businesses as much \nas\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nnow in the wake of the devastating attacks of September 11. Yesterday, \nmy colleague Senator Kerry and I introduced a resolution, S. Res. 264, \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that small business participation is \nvital to the defense and security of our Nation. On September 11, 2001, \nthe people of the United States were subject to the worst terrorist \nattack in American history. Our nation's response has been truly \nastounding. And it should come as no surprise that small businesses are \nplaying a vital role in that response.\n  Small businesses have the unique ability to respond quickly and \nprecisely, to emerging needs and conditions. Many of the most \ninnovative solutions to our problems such as new technologies for \ndefense readiness come from small firms. In fact, in October 2001, the \nPentagon's technical support working group sent out an urgent plea, \nseeking ideas and technology to assist the military fight terrorism. In \njust two months, legions of small businesses responded to the \nPentagon's call. Over 12,500 ideas poured into the Pentagon, most of \nthem from small businesses. This remarkable response once again shows \nthat small business remain the most innovative sector of the United \nStates economy, accounting for the vast majority of new product ideas \nand technological innovations.\n  Just last week I had the opportunity to acknowledge the volunteer \nefforts of three Missouri companies that are helping re-build over an \nacre-long section of the Pentagon's roof, which was damaged badly in \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  Frederic Roofing and Sheet Metal Company of St. Louis, Performance \nRoof Systems of Kansas City, and Watkins Roofing of Columbia, are \nparticipating in a massive effort to help repair part of the damage \nsustained by the Pentagon. These Missouri companies are independent, \nsmall businesses, modern-day Davids ready and willing to take on part \nof a Goliath-sized project. They have joined with roofing contractors \nfrom across country and the National Roofing Contractors Association to \nraise in excess of $500,000 worth of cash, materials, and labor toward \nthis project. Their work reflects the enterprising spirit that makes \nsmall businesses such a potent force in our economy. They deserve our \nadmiration for rolling up their sleeves and pitching in to help restore \nthe Pentagon.\n  To help raise awareness of small business innovation in the homeland \ndefense area, on July 10, 2002, Senator Kerry and I will co-host an \nexpo on Capitol Hill to showcase small businesses and their homeland \nsecurity products. The Small Business Homeland Security Expo will \nprovide an opportunity for small business owners to educate us here in \nWashington about their latest innovative products, technology, and \nresearch. I am excited to bring these hardworking entrepreneurs here to \nshow us just how valuable their contributions are to our Nation's \nsecurity and defense. These small businesses are a cross-section of \nAmerica--they are women-owned, minority-owned, and often represent \neconomically disadvantaged areas.\n  Numerous small businesses have lined up to showcase their exciting \nproducts and services for homeland defense and the fight against \nterrorism. We intend to highlight these businesses at the Expo and in \nthe accompanying book being prepared for the event. The work of small \nbusinesses toward this goal is a product of the same volunteer spirit \nthat helped save lives, combat unthinkable disaster, and restore the \nnation's hope after the darkest hours of September 11.\n  Madam President, I am happy to report to the Senate that the small \nbusiness sector of our economy is thriving even though the challenges \nthey face are stiff and numerous. The determination to be successful is \na hallmark of small businesses as it has been the foundation of our \nnation throughout the years. Small businesses are at the forefront of \nnew advances in technology, health care, environmental management, and \nvirtually every industry possible. I have no doubt that small \nbusinesses will continue to lead the way.\n  The big question I have is whether we will be able to help them. \nSmall business wants the Federal government to be a friend, not an \nadversary. They want us to be their customer and advisor, not a \ncompetitor or intruder. In every action we take, we must always ask \nwhat the impact on small businesses will be, and make every effort to \nrefrain from that action if we do not believe it will have a beneficial \nimpact. The future of our country is tied to the future of small \nbusiness and by enhancing the conditions that support small business, \nwe will ensure a more prosperous future for all.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 3009, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3009) to extend the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act, to grant additional trade benefits under that Act, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very proud to be able to stand in \nthis Chamber today and say that we have reached a compromise on fast \ntrack, trade adjustment assistance, Andean trade, and the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences, or GSP.\n  Last night, my good friend and colleague, Senator Grassley and I--\nalong with the administration--were able to reach an agreement that I \nbelieve will gain very broad bipartisan support.\n  As I have said before, this bill, if passed, will be the first major \nrewrite of international trade legislation in 14 years. It is an \nhistoric opportunity for all of us.\n  Last week, I outlined the need for fast track and for renewing and \nexpanding the Andean Trade Preference Act. Those bills are identical to \nthe bills offered last week.\n  Let me outline today the compromise that was reached on trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  I believe that the TAA legislation will be one of the most important \nbills to be adopted by the Senate this year. Importantly, this bill \nmakes several changes to the TAAA program to make it more effective.\n  First, it extends the period for which TAA pays out income support \nfrom 52 to 78 weeks. This allows TAA recipients to stay in the program \nlong enough to complete training for new jobs.\n  Second, we expand eligibility for TAA benefits to secondary workers. \nFor example, if an automobile producer is affected by imports, \ndisplaced workers in supplier companies--tire and windshield \nmanufacturers, for example--will also be covered. We expect that \napproximately 65,000 additional workers will be eligible for TAA \nbecause of this provision.\n  Third, we agreed to extend TAA benefits when a U.S. manufacturing \nplant moves offshore to any country. In addition, we have codified the \nprovisions covering downstream workers who are currently covered by the \nNAFTA transitional program.\n  Fourth, we expand TAA benefits. This legislation authorizes $300 \nmillion for training--nearly tripling the program.\n  The legislation also helps TAA recipients obtain healthcare \ninsurance. Displaced workers will be eligible for an advanceable, \nrefundable tax credit of 70 percent.\n  That money can be used for COBRA or for the purchase of certain \nState-based group coverage options. We also provide interim assistance \nthrough the National Emergency Grant program.\n  In my opinion, this is most significant bipartisan agreement on \nhealth care in many, many years.\n  Fifth, this legislation provides a special TAA program for family \nfarmers, ranchers, and fishermen.\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n  And finally, this bill creates a pilot program on wage insurance--a \nconcept that has been endorsed by former USTR Carla Hills and Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n  In addition to agreeing on a much improved and expanded TAA program, \nwe have also agreed to extend the Generalized System of Preferences \nthrough the end of 2006. This important legislaiton extends \npreferential duty treatment for goods from developing countries.\n  As a part of the deal reached last night, we will update the \ndefinition of ``core worker rights'' in GSP to make it consistent with \nthe ILO's 1998 definition of core worker rights.\n  This is important, of course, because in considering countries' \neligibility for GSP benefits, the President must consider whether they \nare taking steps to protect core worker rights.\n  With the updated definition, the President's evaluation will now \nencompass countries' compliance with the ILO prohibition on the worst \nforms of child labor and the ILO prohibition on discrimination with \nrespect to employment and occupation.\n  As I said when I began my remarks, I am very proud of this \nlegislation. But it would not have been possible without the help of \nmany of my colleagues.\n  So let me end with some thanks. First, on the TAA bill, Senators \nBingaman and Snowe have been instrumental in this process. And on the \nAndean trade bill, Senator Bob Graham has been a tireless advocate.\n  I also thank Senator Daschle for this support through both the \ncommittee process and as we completed negotiations.\n  And finally, I thank two of my colleagues on the Finance Committee, \nSenator Breaux and Senator Phil Gramm, for their help in reaching \nconsensus on this deal.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I very shortly expect to go through the procedure \nwhere we can lay down this substitute amendment and begin working \nthrough various amendments that will be offered to that amendment. That \nshould happen momentarily.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a letter \nSenator Dayton and I are sending to the pharmaceutical companies of \nAmerica--and invite colleagues to join with us in doing that--\nexpressing our concern about articles we read yesterday about a \ncampaign that evidently is starting through an organization to spend \nmoney on advertising, promoting what is a woefully inadequate plan for \nseniors and families that appears to be proposed by our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives through the Republican side of the aisle \nthat in fact would be available, would pay less than 20 percent of the \ncost for our seniors on Medicare for their prescription drugs, and \nwould use reductions in hospital fees--another cut to hospitals--and \ncertainly in Michigan, whether it is our rural hospitals or urban \nhospitals, we have seen enough cuts and closures of hospitals and \nfacilities. We don't need any more cuts in our hospitals.\n  But they are proposing to cut more reimbursements for hospitals and \nalso to provide some kind of a per-visit fee for home health care. One \nof the things we heard was a $50 fee. We are getting this from the \nmedia, so it may not be the exact number. Regardless, the notion of \nadding some kind of a fee or copay for home health care and cutting \nhospitals further to pay for a woefully inadequate proposal that would \npay for less than 20 percent of the costs that our seniors pay for \ntheir prescription drugs I find very disturbing.\n  We are hearing that the drug companies now are contributing $3 \nmillion for an unrestricted education grant to a group that is very \nclosely aligned with them to run ads promoting this particular plan. \nThe plan is good for the drug companies. It is not good for American \nseniors. It is not good for American families. It is not good for \nAmerican business that is paying the tab for health care premium costs, \nwhether it is a big business or a small business.\n\n  When we look at the $3 million they are willing to invest, again in \nadvertising, promoting a plan that is good for them, bad for the \nAmerican people, Senator Dayton and I are sending a letter that \nbasically will indicate we are asking them, instead of using the $3 \nmillion they are giving to this group to run advertising, to use the $3 \nmillion for lower prices, lower prices for our seniors.\n  Just to read a portion of this:\n\n     . . . we were greatly disturbed to read in yesterday's New \n     York Times that the pharmaceutical industry is funding a \n     group called United Seniors Association that will run \n     television ads supporting the House Republican prescription \n     drug plan . . . we have learned that the House bill is \n     totally inadequate. . . .\n       The New York Times article states that drug companies will \n     devote as much as $3 million for this media campaign. We \n     respectfully urge you to redirect these funds and devote them \n     to lowering the price of prescription drugs to all Americans, \n     especially our nation's seniors. We think this would be a \n     much better use of your profits.\n\n  This is a letter going to each of the companies urging them, rather \nthan continuing to advertise excessively, 2\\1/2\\ times more in \nadvertising than research on their products and continuing to fund \ngroups that put forward plans that don't make any sense other than for \nthe companies themselves--rather than spending all the money to do \nthat, I invite the companies that do good work--we are proud of what \nthey do and the lifesaving medicines they create--once they are \ncreated, we are asking them to work with us to make sure they are \naffordable to every American, that they are affordable to our seniors \nand our families; that a small business in America doesn't have to drop \ninsurance coverage for employees because of rising, spiraling-out-of-\ncontrol prescription drug prices. This is another example of $3 million \ngoing to fund an effort to stop the right thing from being done in the \nUnited States--a woefully inadequate plan. Instead of making the plan \nbetter, instead of spending the money to help lower prices so that more \nseniors don't walk away from the pharmacy without being able to get \nthat prescription after looking at the price--instead of doing that, \nthey are spending another $3 million in advertising and promoting a \nplan that doesn't make sense for America.\n\n  So I invite colleagues to join with Senator Mark Dayton and me today \nin sending this letter and asking the companies--thank them for their \ngood work, but ask them to join with us in a meaningful proposal for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, and also to take the dollars they \nare spending now to fight the efforts to lower prices, and just lower \nprices. They would get a lot\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\nfurther if they just put that money into lowering their prices so that \nit is more affordable for every American.\n  I urge my colleagues and invite them to join with Senator Dayton and \nme to urge the companies to change their approach and work with us to \nlower prices for every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this coming Sunday is Mother's Day, so \nrecognized nationally. Of course, we all know that every day is \nMother's Day. We should also know that simply having children does not \nmake mothers. ``Simply having children does not make mothers.'' That is \na quotation that I have taken from John A. Shedd, a very apt quotation \nin today's culture.\n  Napoleon Bonaparte said, ``The future destiny of the child is always \nthe work of the mother.''\n  All across the Nation, brunch reservations are being made, cards are \nbeing mailed, flowers are being ordered, gifts are being bought, and \nphone circuits will overload. It can mean only one thing, as I \nindicated earlier: This coming Sunday is Mother's Day. One day out of \n365. Mother's Day.\n  In a great spasm of tender sentiment, Americans will set out to honor \nand celebrate the women most important to them--not Hollywood \ncelebrities, not rock music stars--if stars we must call them at all--\nnot fashion models, not athletes, but those who have devoted such \nenergy and creativity to the timeless task of raising children and \nbuilding families. I, too, wish to offer my tributes.\n  It is fitting that Mother's Day is celebrated in May, when the Earth \nis vibrant with new life. Mother birds are busy on the nest keeping \nhatchlings warm and their gaping mouths filled. In the tangled \nthickets, wild young are venturing forth from warren and den. The \nlittle foxes that, in the Bible references ``spoil the vine,'' wrestle, \nand the little rabbits sample the first tiny wild strawberries. \nButterflies visit the glossy, yellow buttercups and the snowy blossoms \nof the wild blackberries. The world seems as gentle, peaceable, and \nserene as any mother could wish for her children. Of course, we know \nthe world is not always quite so benign, but we can still be impressed \nby those mothers who face tragedy with great courage in order to \nprotect and shield their children. The mothers who lost husbands on \nSeptember 11 and remained strong and positive examples for their \nchildren, when bitterness and despair would be so understandable, are \nheroes and heroines each and every day.\n  Mothers set indelible examples, the effects of which last for \ngenerations. My own mother, whose early death during the great flu \npandemic in 1918 meant that I would be raised by relatives, should have \nleft no trace upon my character. After all, I was only about a year old \nwhen she went to Heaven. Yet her selflessness in thinking of me on her \ndeathbed, and expressing the wish that I would be cared for by one of \nmy father's sisters, left me with the deep and abiding assurance of her \nlove for me.\n  I had three older brothers and a sister, and it was in that great \ninfluenza epidemic that she was taken away, as millions of other \nmothers were taken away--perhaps 20 million people around the world \nlost their lives during that great influenza epidemic of 1917-1918. It \nis said that 12 million people in India died from the influenza, the \nswine flu. Perhaps 750,000 people in America died.\n\n  As I say, it was her wish, my mother's wish, that I be taken by one \nof my father's sisters whose name was Vlurma. I believe my father had \nnine sisters and perhaps two or three brothers, but it was one of his \nsisters, a sister who had married Titus Dalton Byrd, who took me in \nresponse to my dying mother's wish.\n  But for her wish, Mr. President, I would not be here today. I would \nnever have gone to West Virginia to be reared in the coal mining \ncommunities in the southern part of the State had it not been for that \nmother's wish. I probably would have never sworn the oath in entering \nupon the office of U.S. Senator had it not been for that wish, my \nmother's wish, that I, the baby, should be brought up in the home of \nTitus Dalton Byrd and Vlurma Byrd, the only child in that home.\n  The Byrds had one child before I was born. That child was named \nRobert Madison Byrd. That child died of scarlet fever. The Byrds moved \naway from North Carolina and to West Virginia and moved me with them.\n  At first I had been named Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr., by my father \nand my mother. My mother's name was Ada--Ada Mae. The two wonderful \npeople who raised me changed my name to Robert Carlyle Byrd.\n  So my mother's wish is a priceless gift even now, all of these years \nlater. And the woman who raised me, my aunt, imbued me with her quiet \nfaith and reverence for the Creator and impressed upon me her work \nethic. I always call her ``mom.'' She was the only mother I really ever \nknew. There are millions of other men and women around the world who \ncan speak of their mothers as I have spoken of mine. They may have lost \ntheir mothers early or at some point along life's way. Many of them \nhave sweet memories of those mothers. I do not have any memory of my \nmother, but somehow I know that her prayers have always followed me. I \nbelieve that. And I believe that she is in Heaven today.\n  The woman who reared me, my biological father's sister, was one of \nthe few really, really great people I have known in my life. I had the \ngood fortune to meet with many world leaders during my years in the \nSenate and especially during my years as majority leader in the Senate. \nI met with the Shah of Iran just a few weeks before he left Iran, never \nto return. I met with the current King of Jordan's father. I first met \nhim 47 years ago. I met, as I mentioned earlier, the Shah of Iran. I \nfirst met him 47 years ago--in 1955.\n  I met with the President of Syria. I shook hands with Nassar of \nEgypt. I visited with and talked with German Chancellor Schmidt and \nGerman Chancellor Kohl. I met with Margaret Thatcher in her offices in \nLondon. I met with the Saudi family. I met with Prime Minister Begin of \nIsrael. I met with Vice President Deng of China. I met with Mr. \nKhrushchev in the Crimea in his summer home.\n  I met with many other world leaders--Kings and Shahs and Princes and \nPresidents and Senators and Governors. These were outstanding \npersonages, the leaders of the world. I had one-on-one meetings with \nthese people. I met with President Sadat of Egypt. But the truly great \npeople in my life and according to my standards were not national \nleaders or politicians, they were just common people. One of them was \nthe man who raised me, Titus Dalton Byrd, a coal miner. I never heard \nhim use God's name in vain in all of his life. He was a humble man. He \npaid his debts. He never spoke ill of a neighbor. He was a good man, as \ngood as men can be. The Bible says no man is good, but he was as good \nas men become. He was a great man, in my sight.\n  The woman who raised me was a great woman. Neither of them had any \neducation to amount to anything. I doubt that either of them had ever \ngone to the third grade in school. I was the first person in all of my \nfamily line who ever graduated from elementary school or from high \nschool or from college.\n  They never made it to the third or fourth grade in school, but they \nwere great souls, they had great hearts, they had honest minds, and \nthey imbued me with a respect for the Bible and a respect for religion.\n  I can listen to any man's religion. It can be a man of Islam. It can \nbe a Hindu. It can be a Protestant. It can be a Jew. I can listen to \nany of them. I can pray with any of them. That is the way I was taught.\n  These two people who raised me were great people. That aunt, as I \nsay, I never knew any name for her but\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\n``Mom.'' I did not know that she was not my mother until I was in my \nyear of graduation from high school. I can close my eyes and see her, \nafter a long day, working to make ends meet in a hardscrabble West \nVirginia mining community, sitting at a scrubbed kitchen table, and \ndiscussing the Bible.\n  Those were some hard times in those days. When my wife and I married \nalmost 65 years ago--in less than 3 weeks, if the Lord lets us live to \nsee the day--our first refrigerator was half of an orange crate, or a \ngrapefruit crate. I was a produce boy in a coal company store, so I \nsold grapefruits, oranges, other citrus fruits, other fruits, and \nvegetables. So I brought an empty orange crate home and nailed it up \noutside the kitchen window. That was during the Great Depression. \nDuring the late 1920s I lived as a boy on Wolf Creek in Mercer County, \nno electricity in the home, no running water in the house. Those were \nthe days of the 2-cent stamp and the penny postcard.\n  I know what the word ``mother'' means, and I know what the word \n``father'' means, even though my father and my angel mother did not \nrear me. But this old aunt and uncle who knew little about their ABCs \nbut who knew much about life and about the things that count mostly in \nlife, they reared me; they loved me. I heard ``mom'' pray many times in \nthe stillness of the night. When the kerosene lamp was out, I would \nhear her voice coming from another room. I knew she was on her knees.\n  After I was elected to Congress, there were occasions when I would \ndrive to West Virginia and go to her house. I would get there perhaps \nat 12, 1, or 2 in the morning. I would knock on the door, and she would \nanswer the door. She would always ask me if I wanted her to fix me \nsomething to eat at that hour. Then after I spent most of the weekend \nin West Virginia and was about to return to Washington, she would fix a \ngood noonday meal, and then say to me: ``Robert, you be a good boy; I \nalways pray for you.''\n  It used to be when I was a little boy living on Wolf Creek Hollow, I \nwould take bags of corn up to the mill on the top of the mountain. We \nhad one horse named George. I had a pony. I would put a bag of corn \nacross that pony's back, take it up to the mill, and the miller would \ngrind the corn into meal, and that evening ``mom'' would make a cake of \ncornbread.\n  We had one cow, and sometimes ``mom'' would take me out with her to \nmilk the cow. I would sit there and have a cup, and she would squeeze \nthat milk down in the cup. I would drink that cup of milk with the foam \nfreshly wrought from the bag of the cow.\n  I still see my aunt, who was--the only mother I ever really knew. She \nnever kissed me in her life. I never received a mother's kiss, unlike \nBenjamin West, that great American painter who was living at the time \nthe Constitution of the United States was written in Philadelphia. He \nwould take to his mother, so the story goes, little drawings of birds \nand flowers, and she took him upon her knee. It is said that she kissed \nlittle Benjamin West's cheek as he sat on her knee and she told him he \nwould grow up to be a great painter. So he grew up to be a painter of \nearly American scenes. ``The Death of General Wolfe'' was by Benjamin \nWest. The story is told that Benjamin West said a mother's kiss made \nhim a great painter.\n  I do not remember ever receiving a mother's kiss, but I received \n``mom's'' love. I still see her in my mind's eye when my wife Erma and \nI sit together on Sundays and read the Bible. My aunt taught me a great \ndeal about the quiet dignity with which she lived her life. Mothers \nteach when they insist that their children brush their teeth and eat \ntheir vegetables. Mothers teach by saying bedtime prayers, by reading \nbedtime stories, and by singing lullabies. As I say, simply having \nchildren does not make mothers, but mothers do sing lullabies at the \nbedsides of their children.\n  They demonstrate their love not only through hugs and praise, but in \neach meal they make, each load of laundry they fold, each toy they put \naway. Children absorb lessons from the people around them, and \nespecially from the parents they look up to. So, mothers teach by \nexample when they read themselves instead of watching television, the \nvast wasteland that numbs peoples' minds or by being careful with their \nspeech and with the way they live their lives. Each small lesson helps \nto weave the cloth of their children's lives. It is for these daily \nlessons, the laughter shared and tears dried, that we put so much \neffort into making Mother's Day special. And we ought to make it \nspecial. We ought to see Mother on this Mother's Day and every other \nday of the year that it is possible.\n  A poem by an anonymous poet captures the inspiration that mothers \nprovide:\n\n                        When Mother Reads Aloud\n\n     When Mother reads aloud, the past\n     Seems real as every day;\n     I hear the tramp of armies vast,\n     I see the spears and lances cast,\n     I join the trilling fray;\n     Brave knights and ladies fair and proud\n     I meet when Mother reads aloud.\n     When Mother reads aloud, far lands\n     Seem very near and true;\n     I cross the desert's gleaming sands,\n     Or hunt the jungle's prowling bands,\n     Or sail the ocean blue.\n     Far heights, whose peaks the cold mists shroud,\n     I scale, when Mother reads aloud.\n     When Mother reads aloud, I long\n     For noble deeds to do\n     To help the right, redress the wrong;\n     It seems so easy to be strong,\n     So simple to be true.\n     Oh, thick and fast the visions crowd\n     My eyes, when Mother reads aloud.\n\n  Manufacturers of greeting cards, florists, jewelers, clothing stores, \neven the phone company suggest that their products are treasured by \nmothers, and I am sure that they are. But mothers also treasure the \nlumpy clay vases made by young potters and filled with wild flowers \ntorn from the yard. Mothers love the care and love that their loved \nones put into this celebration. Flowers or no flowers, homemade cards \nor store-bought, mothers love being surrounded by their families most \nof all. Each child is some mother's treasure, her precious angel, even \nwhen that child is grown and gone to far away places. A mother's \nchildren are her greatest works, her magnum opus, her masterpiece. A \nphone call or a meal shared together provides an opportunity to relive \nthe memories that make each family special. Erma and I can look around \nthe table as we think of her mother, Erma's mother, a fine Christian \nwoman who lived a good life. A wonderful mother-in-law. We think of her \nas we sit around the table with our two lovely daughters and their \nfamilies knowing that our two newest members, our little great \ngranddaughters,--let me repeat that, our little great-granddaughter, \nare fortunate to share in our close-knit family.\n  As in all families, my mother, my aunt who raised me, my wife, my \ndaughters, my granddaughters and my great-granddaughters our grandsons, \nour daughters-in-law, our sons-in-law, all share many titles. They are \nproud citizens of this fair land. They are strong, talented, \nindependent women. They may hold many business titles. They are \nsisters, cousins, and aunts. They are, or may be, wives. But the title, \nthe job, that will give them the greatest pleasure in their lives, will \nbe to be called ``Mother.'' Remember that simply having children does \nnot make mothers. The title comes with much labor, much patience some \ntedium, hopefully not too many tears, and love beyond measure. The job \nwill call upon their every reserve of strength and every ounce of \ncreativity, but it will never tax their ability to love and to cherish.\n  This Sunday, scrubbed and shining, let us present the mothers in our \nlives with fitting tribute. Give them flowers, cards, good food, and \npresents, but most of all, let us give them our gratitude and repay, in \nsmall measure, the love and devotion that they have showered upon us.\n  I close with a few stanzas from a poem by Elizabeth Akers Allen. It \nis called ``Rock Me to Sleep.''\n  I offer it to my own sweet angel mother, who hears me now, who is \nlistening today with millions of other mothers like her who have gone \non to that land where the flowers never wither and the rainbow never \nfades.\n\n     Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\n     Make me a child again just for to-night!\n     Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\n     Take me again to your heart as of yore;\n     Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\n     Smooth the few silver threads from my hair;\n     Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n     Over my heart, in the days that are flown,\n     No love like mother-love ever has shone;\n     No other worship abides and endures--\n     Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\n     None like a mother can charm away pain\n     From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\n     Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n     Mother, dear Mother, the years have been long\n     Since I last listened your lullaby song:\n     Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\n     Womanhood's years have been only a dream.\n     Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\n     With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\n     Never hereafter to wake or to weep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n  I will yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize the \n100th Anniversary of the City of Idabel, Oklahoma.\n  Idabel is the county seat of McCurtain County, located in the \nSoutheast corner of Oklahoma. The scenic rivers and wilderness that \nsurround Idabel rival the beauty of any region in the United States.\n  Idabel has a rich cultural history. For 75 years, from the 1830s into \nthe twentieth century, Idabel was under the sovereignty of the Choctaw \nTribe. Following their removal from Mississippi, the Choctaws occupied \nand ruled over the land that we today know as Idabel.\n  In 1902, before Oklahoma even became a state, the town of Purnell was \nincorporated along a rail line. It was named after Isaac Purnell, a \nrailroad official at the time. This name did not last long, however. \nOur very own United States Postal Service rejected the town's name \nbecause it was too similar to that of another Oklahoma town Purcell. \nFor two years, this incorporated town batted possible names around, \nnames like Mitchell and Hoyopa, until finally settling on the name \n``Idabel''--a combination of the first names of Isaac Purnell's \ndaughters.\n  While rich in its history and in the beauty of its surroundings, the \ngreatest part of Idabel are the people who live there from the people \nwho set up shop in that small trade village in the early twentieth \ncentury to the present day students, the Idabel Warriors, who are the \nfuture of this great town.\n  The people of Idabel are devoted to God, to their country, and to \ntheir families. I am proud to honor their centennial, and am privileged \nto serve as their representative here in the U.S. Senate. May their \nnext one hundred years be as fruitful as the first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4195-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              NURSES' WEEK\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, this week commemorates the \ncontributions of the nursing profession to patients and health care and \nthe dedication of those individuals who have chosen nursing. Yet in all \nthe years that we have acknowledged how much nurses mean to the \ndelivery of health care and our quality of life, we have not done \nenough to ensure the viability of nursing as a profession. The 2001 \nAmerican Nurses Association (ANA) National Survey revealed that 715 \nhospitals had 126,000 openings for nursing positions and an 11 percent \nvacancy rate. Nursing schools across the country report that enrollment \nhas significantly decreased and the ANA also projects that 65 percent \nof present nurses will retire within this decade. These statistics \nsignal a nursing crisis and that means a health care crisis for this \ncountry.\n  At both the June 14, 2001, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing \non the looming nursing shortage and the June 27, 2001, Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee hearing on the federal government's role in \nretaining nurses for delivery of federally funded health care services, \nI emphasized an alarming statistic that the federal health sector, \nemploying approximately 45,000 nurses, may be the hardest hit in the \nnear future with an estimated 47 percent of its nursing workforce \neligible for retirement by the year 2004. Current and anticipated \nnursing vacancies in all health care settings are attributed in part to \nworsening work place conditions with mandatory overtime and increasing \npatient care workloads.\n  I believe today we are facing a widespread and complex challenge with \nthis nursing shortage and there are no quick fixes. Congress has passed \nsome important measures to help nurses to continue to take safe and \neffective care of their patients and to assist health care facilities \nto recruit and retain needed nurses. Some of these important measures \nwill help recruit new nurses and assist with the cost of education, \nlike the Nurse Reinvestment Act and S. 937 which I authored and which \nwill now permit the transfer of entitlement to educational assistance \nunder the Montgomery GI Bill by members of the Armed Forces thus \nallowing spouses and children of eligible service members to use \ntransferred GI bill assistance for undergraduate or graduate nursing \neducation.\n  Additionally, the VA Nurse Recruitment and Retention Enhancement Act \nwas signed into law this year and will help to alleviate the \nanticipated VA nursing shortage by addressing working conditions, \nimplementing a Nurse Cadet Program to encourage high school students to \npursue nursing careers as well as other education incentives. I was \npleased to have played a major role in development and passing this \nmeasure as well.\n  Congress, Federal and State agencies, private and public health care \norganizations are all actively working to develop solutions to the \nlooming nursing shortage. We want nurses to know that they do have \nallies who will work with them to find solutions.\n  To further demonstrate our support of nurses, I am also proposing \nthat the U.S. Postal Service issue a nursing stamp to say, ``Thank you \nfor being a Nurse.'' This stamp will help to raise public awareness of \nthe nursing crisis and show our support of the nursing profession.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in a long-term commitment to \nsupport the nursing profession. I want to say a special ``thank you'' \nto the nurses who were there for me when I was injured in Vietnam. \nThese nurses gave me care and hope. I do not care to think of the \nfuture of health care without these dedicated and knowledgeable \nnurses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4195-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 378.

An engrossed resolution adopted by the Assembly of \n     the State of Wisconsin relative to the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois Rivers' Inland Waterways Transportation System; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                      2001 Assembly Resolution 56\n\n       Whereas, the state of Wisconsin borders or contains over \n     360 miles of the upper Mississippi River and 11 navigation \n     locks and dams along those borders; and\n       Whereas, many of Wisconsin's locks and dams are more than \n     60 years old and only 600 feet long, making them unable to \n     accommodate modern barge tows of 1,200 feet long, nearly \n     tripling locking times and causing lengthy delays and \n     ultimately increasing shipping costs; and\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n       Whereas, the use of 1,200-foot locks has been proven \n     nationwide as the best method of improving efficiency, \n     reducing congestion, and modernizing the inland waterways; \n     and\n       Whereas, the construction of the lock and dam system has \n     spurred economic growth and a higher standard of living in \n     the Mississippi and Illinois river basin, and today supplies \n     more than 300,000,000 tons of the nation's cargo, supporting \n     more than 400,000 jobs, including 90,000 in manufacturing; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than 60% of American agricultural exports, \n     including corn, wheat, and soybeans, are shipped down the \n     Mississippi and Illinois rivers on the way to foreign \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin farmers, producers, and consumers rely \n     on efficient transportation to remain competitive in a global \n     economy, and efficiencies in river transport offset higher \n     production costs compared to those incurred by foreign \n     competitors; and\n       Whereas, the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers lock and \n     dam system saves our nation more than $1.5 billion in higher \n     transportation costs each year, and failing to construct \n     1,200-foot locks will cause farmers to use more expensive \n     alternative modes of transportation, including trucks and \n     trains; and\n       Whereas, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n     congestion along the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers is \n     costing Wisconsin and other producers and consumers in the \n     basin $98,000,000 per year in higher transportation costs; \n     and\n       Whereas, river transportation is the most environmentally \n     friendly form of transporting goods and commodities, creating \n     almost no noise pollution and emitting 35% to 60% fewer \n     pollutants than either trucks or trains, according to the \n     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and\n       Whereas, moving away from river transport would add \n     millions of trucks and railcars to our nation's \n     infrastructure, adding air pollution, traffic congestion, and \n     greater wear and tear on highways; and\n       Whereas, backwater lakes created by the lock and dam system \n     provide breeding grounds for migratory waterfowl and fish; \n     and\n       Whereas, the lakes and 500 miles of wildlife refuge also \n     support a one-billion-dollar per year recreational industry, \n     including hunting, fishing, and tourism jobs; and\n       Whereas, upgrading the system of locks and dams on the \n     upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers will provide 3,000 \n     construction and related jobs over a 15-year to 20-year \n     period; and\n       Whereas, in 1999 the state of Wisconsin shipped 1,100,000 \n     tons of commodities, including grain, coal, chemicals, \n     aggregates, and other products; and\n       Whereas, 3,900,000 tons of commodities, including grain, \n     coal, chemicals, aggregates, and other products, were shipped \n     to, from, and within Wisconsin by barge, representing \n     $313,000,000 in value; and\n       Whereas, shippers moving by barge in Wisconsin realized a \n     savings of approximately $40,000,000 compared to other \n     transportation modes; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin docks shipped products by barge to 6 \n     states and received products from 11 states; and\n       Whereas, there are approximately 20 manufacturing \n     facilities, terminals, and docks on the waterways of \n     Wisconsin, representing thousands of jobs in the state; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting a \n     collaborative navigation study of the economic and \n     environmental factors to be considered when examining capital \n     improvements to the upper Mississippi River system; and\n       Whereas, the navigation study will release initial results \n     in a summer 2002 report; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the assembly, That the Wisconsin assembly \n     formally recognizes the upper Mississippi River as a river of \n     statewide significance for natural, navigational, and \n     recreational benefits; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Wisconsin assembly recognizes the \n     importance of timely modernization of the inland waterway \n     transportation infrastructure to Wisconsin agriculture and \n     industry in this state, the region, and the nation and, \n     pending results of the navigation study, urges Congress to \n     authorize funding to construct 1,200-foot locks on the upper \n     Mississippi and Illinois river system; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the assembly chief clerk shall transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the president and secretary of \n     the U.S. senate, the speaker and clerk of the U.S. house of \n     representatives, the chair of the senate committee on \n     commerce, science, and transportation, the chair of the house \n     committee on transportation and infrastructure, and the \n     members of the congressional delegation from this state.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. An engrossed resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Wisconsin relative to autism \n     spectrum disorder; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       2001 Senate Resolution 16\n\n       Whereas, autism spectrum disorder has been labeled the \n     silent epidemic of our time, silent because this \n     developmental disorder has robbed at least 400,000 children \n     of their ability to communicate and interact with their \n     families and loved ones, and silent because there are \n     currently no established autism registries in the nation to \n     tell us how many people are actually afflicted with this \n     disorder; and\n       Whereas, current statistics tell us that autism affects at \n     least one in every 500 children in America, and recent \n     anecdotal evidence suggests that autism rates are increasing \n     to possible one in every 250 children; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. house of representatives has passed a \n     resolution, H. CON. RES. 91, recognizing the importance of \n     increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorder, and \n     supporting programs for greater research and improved \n     treatment of autism and improved training and support for \n     individuals with autism and those who care for them; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That: the members of the Wisconsin \n     Senate urge the U.S. Senate to concur in H. CON. RES. 91; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate chief clerk shall provide a copy \n     of this resolution to each member of the Wisconsin \n     congressional delegation, to the members of the U.S. Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, to the \n     secretary of the U.S. Senate, and to the clerk of the U.S. \n     House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-234.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Vermont relative to the National \n     Guard; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                          House Resolution 37\n\n       Whereas, within days of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., the nation's \n     governors activated National Guard soldiers and airmen to \n     augment security at 422 of the nation's international \n     airports, and\n       Whereas, in true state-federal partnership, National Guard \n     forces are providing aerial port security under the command \n     and control of the sovereign states, territories, and the \n     District of Columbia, and the federal government is funding \n     such duties ``in the service of the United States'' under 32 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 502(f) hereinafter referred to as ``Title 32 \n     duty'', and\n       Whereas, Title 32 duty has been used, inter alia, for more \n     than 20 years for National Guard full-time staffing, for \n     National Guard support for local, state, and federal law \n     enforcement agencies under Governors'\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\n     Counter-Drug Plans for more than 12 years, for National Guard \n     Civil Support Team technical assistance for local first \n     responders for more than two years, and for aerial port \n     security following the attacks of September 11. Of particular \n     note, the National Guard Counter-Drug Program has long \n     included Title 32 support for United States Customs, Border \n     Patrol, and Immigration and Naturalization Service activities \n     at United States Ports of Entry, and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, \n     increased security and inadequate federal staffing have \n     limited the flow of persons, goods, and services across our \n     nation's borders. These factors have contributed to a \n     weakening of the American and Canadian economies, and\n       Whereas, the governors of northern tier border states wrote \n     President Bush in November 2001, offering to provide Title 32 \n     National Guard augmentation for United States Customs, Border \n     Patrol, and Immigration and Naturalization Service operations \n     at United States Ports of Entry. Such relief could have been, \n     and still can be, effected within days of acceptance by the \n     federal government, and\n       Whereas, there is still no relief at our borders due to \n     inaction on the governors' offer of Title 32 National Guard \n     assistance and conflicting Department of Defense proposals to \n     federalize the National Guard or otherwise enhance border \n     security with active duty military personnel instead of Title \n     32 National Guard members, and\n       Whereas, federalizing the National Guard under U.S.C. Title \n     10 would degrade the combat readiness of units from which \n     Guardsmen would be mobilized, interfere with effective state \n     force management, and prevent personal accommodations for \n     soldiers and their civilian employers, and\n       Whereas, stationing federal military forces at the United \n     States-Canada border would be an unprecedented unilateral \n     action by the United States, and\n       Whereas, the nation's border states need prompt relief \n     which can best be provided by Title 32 National Guard forces \n     being deployed to assist lead federal agencies at the borders \n     ``in the service of the United States'', but under continued \n     state command and control, and\n       Whereas, the Vermont State Legislature opposes \n     federalization of the National Guard or assignment of federal \n     military forces for United States border security, now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That this \n     legislative body urges the President and U.S. Congress to \n     assure prompt augmentation of lead federal agencies at the \n     borders by accepting the governors' offer of National Guard \n     forces under state command and control pursuant to 32 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 502(f), and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House be directed to send \n     copies of this resolution to President George W.

Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Louisiana congressional delegation and the \n     United States Congress to support the Act to Leave No Child \n     Behind. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     endorse the Act to Leave No Child Behind and the efforts \n     being made to make certain that no child is left behind. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation and to \n     the presiding officers of the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-241. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relative to \n     welfare reform; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted its own \n     version of ``welfare reform'' in 1995, taking into account \n     the nature of labor market in Massachusetts, the financial \n     resources of the Commonwealth and the particular needs of \n     low-income families with children; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government in 1995 granted \n     Massachusetts a waiver from the then-existing Federal \n     requirements enabling Massachusetts to implement its version \n     of welfare reform; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government in 1996 adopted its version \n     of welfare reform, TANF, and, in recognition of their leading \n     roles, allowed Massachusetts and other states with pre-\n     existing waivers to continue to operate their programs under \n     such waivers; and\n       Whereas, one purpose of TANF was to allow states greater \n     flexibility to operate their cash assistance programs for \n     needy families; and\n       Whereas, since 1995, the number of Massachusetts families \n     receiving cash assistance from the Commonwealth has declined \n     by more than 50 percent; and\n       Whereas, almost half of the Massachusetts families \n     continuing to receive cash assistance are families including \n     a family member with a disability or with very young \n     children; and\n       Whereas, under the Massachusetts program operated under the \n     Federal waiver, such families are exempt from the time limits \n     and work requirements; and\n       Whereas, because of adverse economic conditions in the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts and around the country, the \n     number of low-income families needing cash assistance has \n     started to rise; and\n       Whereas, because the original TANF law barred states from \n     using Federal TANF funds to provide assistance to certain \n     legal immigrant families, Massachusetts, since 1997, has \n     expended state funds to provide needed services to immigrant \n     families; and\n       Whereas, the 1996 Federal Welfare Reform Law expires on \n     September 30, 2002 and must be reauthorized by the United \n     States Congress and the President on or before that date; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts waiver will expire in 2005 \n     unless the state is allowed to renew it; and\n       Whereas, without the waiver, Massachusetts may suffer \n     Federal financial penalties for continuing to operate its own \n     program and incur substantial additional costs related to \n     child care, transportation, and other supportive services; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal TANF block grant received annually by \n     the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has declined in real value \n     by 13 percent since 1996 and, if continued at current levels, \n     will decline further in real value over the next several \n     years; and\n       Whereas, without additional Federal TANF funding, \n     Massachusetts may be forced to cut back on existing services \n     for needy families; and\n       Whereas, the National Governors' Association has called on \n     Congress to allow states with waivers to continue operating \n     under them, to increase TANF funding and to allow states with \n     greater flexibility in operating their TANF programs; now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, that any reauthorized TANF law should include:\n       A. Authority for Massachusetts and other states with pre-\n     existing waivers to continue and renew them at state option;\n       B. Increased TANF block grant funding for Massachusetts;\n       C. Increased flexibility for states to determine what \n     activities and what level of participation should satisfy \n     Federal work requirements, in part to enable states \n     appropriately to meet the needs of low-income families with \n     disabilities;\n       D. Increased flexibility for states to grant hardship \n     exemptions from the Federal 5-year time limit on receipt of \n     TANF assistance, in part to enable states appropriately to \n     meet the needs of low-income families with disabilities;\n       E. Removal of restrictions on states using TANF funds to \n     provide benefits to legal immigrants; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the members of the Massachusetts delegation \n     to the Congress of the United States should actively seek to \n     ensure that the provisions listed above are included in any \n     reauthorized TANF law; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States, to the Presiding Officer of each branch of \n     Congress and to the members thereof from this Commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-242. A joint resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Maine relative to correcting \n     inequities for retirees drawing social security benefits; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, retirees covered by federal, state or local \n     government retirement programs are facing hardship in \n     retirement; and\n       Whereas, the retirement benefits of these retirees are low \n     and the cost of health insurance is high and climbing every \n     year; and\n       Whereas, added to this bleak economic picture, even though \n     many of these retirees may qualify for Social Security \n     through their own or their spouses' work, Congress will not \n     let them benefit as other citizens do; and\n       Whereas, the first roadblock, the windfall elimination \n     provision of the federal Social Security Act, requires 30 \n     years of ``substantial earnings,'' as rated on a scale, \n     before a retiree is eligible for the full Social Security \n     benefit. If a retiree does not have 30 years, or some years \n     fall below the standard, the Social Security benefit may be \n     reduced or eliminated; therefore, retirees who earned a \n     pension from working for a government agency and also worked \n     part-time under Social Security may see their Social Security \n     benefits reduced or eliminated; and\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n       Whereas, the 2nd roadblock the government pension offset of \n     the federal Social Security Act, reduces the survivor benefit \n     under Social Security by 2/3 of an individual's retirement \n     benefit. This means the death of a spouse of a retiree is a \n     double tragedy because the offset will reduce the family \n     income by 1/3 or more and then freeze it at that level. Any \n     future increase in the retiree's retirement will result in \n     the loss of Social Security benefits; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, support the repeal of \n     the government pension offset and the windfall elimination \n     provision from the federal Social Security Act; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4199-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary:\n       Report to accompany S. 1974, a bill to make needed reforms \n     in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and for other \n     purposes.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2503. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to permit an \nindividual to operate a commercial motor vehicle solely within the \nborders of a State if the individual meets certain minimum standards \nprescribed by the State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing companion \nlegislation to H.R. 2466, the Commercial Driver's License Devolution \nAct of 2001, which was originally brought to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives last July by my friend from North Carolina, \nRepresentative Howard Coble.\n  I believe it is no secret to my colleagues here in the Senate, that I \nsupport small business and returning power to the States. The \ntraditional, one-size-fits-all approach to governing has done more harm \nthan good, and this bill is an attempt to remedy some of that.\n  This legislation will give States the option to establish their own \ncommercial driver's license, CDL, requirements for intrastate drivers. \nIt will return power to the States by giving\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nthem the option to license intrastate drivers of commercial motor \nvehicles based upon testing standards determined by the individual \nStates. And I stress, it will be an ``option.''\n  I want to emphasize that this legislation is not a Federal mandate \nimposed on States. States that choose not to participate would remain \nunder Federal guidelines. A State that chooses to exercise this option \nwould in no way diminish the role of the CDL in the long-haul trucking \nindustry. Additionally, this legislation effectively precludes two or \nmore States from using this option as the basis for an interstate \ncompact.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Commercial Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act of 1986, CMVSA, required States to establish a new and \nuniform program of testing and licensure for all operators of \ncommercial vehicles both intra and interstate. The principal objectives \nof the Act have been met, and would not be harmed by this legislation \nI'm introducing here today.\n  I have no issue with the CMVSA. It is a good law, and at the time the \nprovisions it contained were necessary and timely for improving the \nstandards of performance for long-haul truck drivers in this country. \nHowever, I, like my counterpart in the House, believe the CMVSA was \nimposed upon intrastate commerce where the operation of trucks may be a \nsmall but necessary part of an individual's job. Therefore, the reality \nwas that Washington imposed its will on thousands of small businesses \nacross this country who aren't involved in long-haul trucking and we \nexpected them to adjust to any circumstance that might arise. That's \nunfair and not what government is supposed to be about.\n  When you have conditions such as these, I believe it should be within \na State's discretion to determine what kind of commercial vehicle \nlicensure and testing is required for commerce taking place solely \nwithin its borders.\n  This legislation is important to our Nation's small businesses, \nespecially those dependent upon commercial truck travel, which means \nit's important to the consumers. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2504. A bill to extend eligibility for refugees status of \nunmarried sons and daughters of certain Vietnamese refugees; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 1840, a bill to extend the eligibility for refugee \nstatus of immigrants who are the unmarried children of qualified \nVietnamese nationals. This bill would extend the authority to process \nsuch individuals through fiscal year 2003, as it was set to expire \nearlier this year. The House and Senate have been in communication \nregarding this bill for some time, and given that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee approved the House version of this bill by unanimous consent \nthis morning, I have little doubt that the entire Senate will extend \ntheir support.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation and one that will \nprovide crucial relief to a small, yet deserving group of people, the \nchildren of those Vietnamese nationals who were placed in internment \ncamps by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and are now in the United \nStates as refugees. We simply cannot expect the sons and daughters of \nthese Vietnamese nationals to be forgotten. It is our duty to support \nthe sacrifices that these families made for freedom and democracy and I \nfind it most appropriate that we prevent further persecution by \nwelcoming their children.\n  I want to commend Congressman Tom Davis on his introduction of this \nlegislation in the House. I urge my Senate colleagues' support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2505. A bill to promote the national security of the United States \nthrough international educational and cultural exchange programs \nbetween the United States and the Islamic world, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senators Lugar, Leahy, Chafee, \nDodd, Hagel, Gordon Smith, Cochran, Brownback, Jeffords, Durbin, \nFeingold and I are introducing legislation to increase the level of \nstudent and other exchanges between Americans and visitors from the \nIslamic world.\n  Our legislation, the Cultural Bridges Act, would authorize $75 \nmillion above current appropriations in fiscal years 2003 through 2007 \nto expand the activities of the State Department's existing educational \nand cultural programs in the Islamic world. It would also authorize $20 \nmillion in fiscal years 2003 through 2007 for the Department of State \nto establish a new high school student exchange program to enable a \nsmall number of competitively selected students from the Islamic world \nto study in the United States at a public high school for an academic \nyear.\n  There are no better ambassadors for American values than Americans \nthemselves, and student exchange programs have proven to be an \neffective tool in reaching out to the next generation of leaders. As \nSecretary Powell said in his August 2001 Statement on International \nEducation Week, ``I can think of no more valuable asset to our country \nthan the friendship of future world leaders who have been educated \nhere.''\n  One of the clear lessons of September 11 is that our government needs \nto do more to ensure that future generations in the Islamic world \nunderstand more about American values and culture. A recent Gallup poll \nin nine predominantly Muslim countries revealed strong anti-American \nattitudes. Nearly 1.5 billion people live in the Islamic world, and if \nwe ignore these sentiments, we do so at our own peril. If we try to \naddress the problem directly, by teaching American values to students \nfrom the Islamic world, we have a chance, in the long run, of changing \nnegative attitudes. It's a long process, which September 11 has taught \nus we must begin now.\n  The State Department currently manages outstanding international \nstudent educational and cultural exchange programs that have helped \nfoster mutual respect and understanding in many countries worldwide. \nThese programs, which enable approximately 5,000 Americans to travel \nabroad and 20,000 foreign visitors to travel to the United States \nannually to study, teach, engage in people-to-people programs, have \nbeen enormously successful in promoting American values and cultural \ntolerance.\n  Unfortunately, visitors and students from the Islamic world are \nsignificantly underrepresented in many of these programs. Individuals \nin the Islamic world represent approximately 25 percent of the world's \n6.2 billion people. However, in fiscal year 2000, less than 10 percent \nof the participants in State Department cultural and educational \nexchange programs were from the Islamic countries covered under our \nlegislation, and less than 12 percent of the budget was spent on these \ncountries. Additionally, according to the State Department's Bureau of \nEducational and Cultural Affairs, direct appropriated funding for \nexchanges has fallen by almost a third since 1993 which adjusted for \ninflation.\n  The additional $75 million our legislation authorizes for existing \nprograms to be expanded in the Islamic world is essential to our \nnation's objective of promoting greater understanding of American \nvalues and ideals. Existing programs provide the essential building \nblocks our nation needs for an expanded and sustained effort to reach \nmore broadly into these societies, to foster mutual respect, and to \ncounter the ignorance and hatred that can lead to acts of terrorism.\n  In October of last year, President Bush spoke eloquently about the \nneed to reach out in friendship to children and the Islamic world. In a \nspeech to students at Thurgood Marshall Extended Elementary School, the \nPresident said that America is ``determined to build ties of trust and \nfriendship with people all around the world, particularly with children \nand people in the Islamic world.\n  To facilitate the President's goal of reaching children, our \nlegislation would create a new program for high school students from \nthe United States. No Federal program currently exists to facilitate \nsuch student exchanges with ever-increasing numbers of youth in the \nIslamic world.\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\n  There are many benefits to reaching out to students while they are \nyoung and open-minded to enhance mutual cultural understanding and \ntolerance. Today's high school students are tomorrow's leaders, and we \nneed to begin working with them now to inform their attitudes about our \ncountry.\n  In a January 20, 2002 op-ed in the Washington Post, a former \nFulbright scholarship recipient from Egypt expressed concern that his \nuniversity in Egypt was and continues to be fertile ground for \nrecruiters from terrorist or extremist organizations. Our challenge is \nto provide young students with the opportunity to learn about America, \nparticipate in all aspects of American family life, and understand our \nvalues before they reach that stage.\n  The high school student exchange program authorized in our \nlegislation is modeled on the State Department's highly successful \nFuture Leaders Exchange Program, FLEX, which brings approximately 1,000 \nstudents ages 15-17 from the Newly Independent States to the United \nStates each year to attend an American high school for a year and live \nwith an American family.\n  The FLEX program has been extremely effective in shaping attitudes \namong the students selected to participate from the Newly Independent \nStates. A 1998 U.S. government study, which compared Russian FLEX \nalumni with other Russian youth of the same age, indicated that the \nFLEX alumni are more open to and accepting of Western values and \ndemocratic ideals. They are more likely to want to become leaders in \nand to make a contribution to their society. They tend to be more \noptimistic about the future of their country, especially its evolution \nto a more democratic, rule-of-law society, than other Russian youths.\n  Importantly, the FLEX program has been successful in the six \npredominantly Islamic countries from the Newly Independent States, \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan. More than 1,500 students from those Muslim countries have \nstudied and lived in the United States since the program began. FLEX \nalumni in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are teaching English in their \nhome countries, and alumni in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have been \ninvolved in activities to develop democratic practices. Given the track \nrecord in these countries, there is every reason to believe that a high \nschool student exchange program would succeed throughout the Islamic \nworld.\n  Like the existing student exchange program for the Newly Independent \nStates, our legislation requires participating students in high school \nexchanges form the Islamic world to be selected competitively and in a \nmanner that ensures geographic, gender, and socio-economic diversity. \nTo quality, students must be tested extensively and interviewed under \nState Department guidelines. As with the FLEX program, the State \nDepartment will work with experienced American non-governmental \norganizations to recruit, select, and place students and will remain in \nclose contact with the public high school, American host family, and \nAmerican non-governmental organizations while the students are in the \nUnited States.\n  Importantly, all students and visitors participating in programs \nauthorized in this legislation must be admissible under all immigration \nlaws and procedures. Furthermore, legislation recently passed by the \nSenate would improve our ability to screen foreign students by \nrequiring increased communication among the State Department, the INS, \nand the schools enrolling foreign students and closing gaps in the \nexisting foreign student monitoring program.\n  Our legislation has been endorsed by the Alliance for International \nEducation and Cultural Exchange, AMIDEAST, AFS, the Academy for \nEducational Development, the American Councils for International \nEducation, the American Institute for Foreign Study, the Institute of \nInternational Education, the National Council for International \nVisitors, Sister Cities International, World Learning, and World Study \nGroup.\n  About the Cultural Bridges Act, the Director of the Alliance for \nInternational Educational and Cultural Exchange, a coalition of 65 \norganizations with chapters in all 50 states, former Ambassador Kenton \nKeith, wrote: ``Winning the war on terrorism will demand more than just \nour military prowess. It will require us to engage the peoples of the \nIslamic world about our society and values if we are to forge the \nmutual understanding and respect that will be the basis of peaceful \nproductive relationships. The exchanges authorized in your bill are the \nmost cost-effective way to encourage the positive personal and \ninstitutional relationships that will enhance our long-term national \nsecurity.'' I ask unanimous consent that copies of this and other \nendorsement letters be included in the Congressional Record at the end \nof my statement along with the text of the legislation.\n  America must respond to the terrorist threat on many levels. We need \nto ensure that our defenses are strong, our borders are secure, and our \nrelationships with allies are vibrant. We also need to do more in the \narea of public diplomacy.\n  It is clearly in America's national security interest to promote more \npeople-to-people contacts throughout the Muslim world. Indeed, in a May \n3rd speech to the World Affairs Council in California, Deputy Secretary \nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz spoke about the need to reach out and \nstrengthen voices of moderation in the Islamic world and to bridge the \n``dangerous gap'' between the West and the Muslim world. He said \nAmerica must ``begin now . . . the gap is wide and there is no time for \ndelay.''\n  After September 11, many of the Muslim countries condemned those acts \nand pledged to help the United States fight terrorism. As we have seen \nin Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere in the Muslim world, some \nindividuals and factions within a country can support terrorists and \nterrorist organizations, while others seek to resolve issues \npeacefully. America must reach out in friendship to all individuals in \nthe Islamic world who share our worldview.\n  The Koran says, ``O Mankind! We created you from a single pair of a \nmale and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may \nknow each other.'' These words speak eloquently of the need for this \nlegislation. Building bridges of understanding and tolerance across \ncultures will help ensure that Americans and people of the Islamic \nworld will truly understand and know each other. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cultural Bridges Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Educating international students is an important way to \n     impart cross-cultural understanding and create goodwill for \n     the United States throughout the world.\n       (2) Students from the Islamic world are significantly \n     underrepresented among the approximately 500,000 \n     international students who study in the United States \n     annually.\n       (3) The volume of professional and cultural exchanges \n     between the United States and the Islamic world is extremely \n     low compared to other regions, and these exchanges have \n     proven extremely effective worldwide in building productive \n     people-to-people ties.\n       (4) The Federally-funded Future Leaders Exchange Program \n     for high school students from the former Soviet Union, \n     administered by the Department of State, has demonstrated the \n     positive impact of reaching out to international students at \n     the secondary school level, introducing them to American \n     culture, and strengthening their commitment to democratic \n     values and ideals.\n       (5) A critical element in the war against terrorism will be \n     increasing mutual understanding and respect between the \n     peoples of the United States and peoples around the world, \n     particularly those of the Islamic faith.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nChafee, Leahy, Hagel, Gordon Smith, Cochran, Brownback, and Jeffords in \nintroducing the Cultural Bridges Act of 2002. Put simply, our bill \nauthorizes funding for international student exchange programs between \nthe United States and countries of the Islamic world.\n  The bill authorizes $20 million to establish a secondary school level \nstudent exchange program that would bring students from the Islamic \nworld to America in order to foster greater understanding and \ntolerance. It also authorizes an additional $75 million to existing \nstudent and foreign-exchange programs such as the Congress-Bundestag \nProgram, Fulbright Scholarships, etc. The purpose is to foster mutual \nrespect between our peoples and a greater understanding of the \ndifferences and similarities between the cultures.\n  One of the lessons learned in recent months is that the United States \nneeds\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\nto create more effective tools of public diplomacy. The most striking \nexample of this was a December 2000-January 2001 Gallup Poll in nine \npredominantly Muslim states that revealed very strong anti-American \nattitudes in a majority of the countries. There are no more effective \nmeans to spread American values and influence and to create goodwill \nthan international student exchanges. As a result, I have concluded it \nis in U.S. national security interests to create an exchange program \nfocused on Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n  Last year only 10 percent of participants in various State Department \nstudent and cultural exchange programs came from Islamic countries \noutside the former Soviet Union. Our new program will bring students \naged 15 to 17 to attend high school and live with an American family \nfor a year. Recruitment and selection of participants will be conducted \non a competitive basis designed to ensure geographic, gender, and \nsocio-economic diversity.\n  The legislation is based on the successful Future Leaders Exchange \nProgram, FLEX, for high school students in the former Soviet Union. The \nnew exchange program with Islamic states would be administered by the \nDepartment of State and will utilize similar guidelines and regulations \nestablished for the FLEX Program and utilize organizations experienced \nin such exchanges. A study of Russian FLEX alumni concluded that they \nare more open to and accepting of Western values, democratic ideals and \nforeign interaction than other students of the same age.\n  In addition to the importance of increasing understanding between the \nUnited States and Islamic countries, we must also appreciate and \naddress the continuing threat of terrorism. Our bill requires all \nstudents and visitors participating in programs authorized in this \nlegislation to comply with the immigration procedures in the USA \nPATRIOT Act. Students will travel to the United States under J-visas.\n  I am pleased our legislation has garnered the support of so many non-\ngovernmental organizations involved in the implementation and \nmanagement of student and cultural exchanges. As the Alliance for \nInternational Educational and Cultural Exchange wrote in their letter \nof April 2: ``Winning the war on terrorism will demand more than just \nmilitary prowess. It will require us to engage the peoples of the \nIslamic world about our society and values if we are to forge the \nmutual understanding and respect that will be the basis of peaceful, \nproductive relationships. As September 11 and its aftermath makes \nclear, our public diplomacy has fallen short.'' The Alliance concludes \nby saying that the ``. . . legislation is the right bill at the right \ntime.''\n  In addition to the Alliance, we have also received letters of support \nfrom: the AFS Intercultural Programs USA, the Academy for Educational \nDevelopment, the American Councils for International Education, the \nAmerican Institute for Foreign Study, the Institute of International \nEducation, the National Council for International Visitors, Sister \nCities International, World Learning, the World Study Group, and the \nAmerica-Mideast Educational and Training Services.\n  I understand the administration has reviewed our legislation and \nindicated that they would support its passage, pending the allocation \nof necessary resources. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join \nSenator Kennedy, our cosponsors and I in ensuring swift passage of this \ntimely and important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       America-Mideast Educational\n\n\n                                  and Training Services, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: AMIDEAST is the \n     largest American NGO promoting educational and cultural \n     exchanges between the United States and the Arab world, where \n     we have worked for over 50 years to strengthen mutual \n     understanding and cooperation between Arabs and Americans. I \n     am writing today to thank you for introducing the Cultural \n     Bridges Act of 2002.\n       The Middle East is experiencing its most severe crisis \n     since 1948. The chasm of misunderstanding between Arabs and \n     Americans has never been wider. As I write to you today, \n     demonstrations are taking place on high school and university \n     campuses throughout the Middle East and North Africa \n     denouncing what they perceive to be America's unfair support \n     for Israeli's actions in the Occupied Territories. To win the \n     war on terrorism, we need to find new ways to reach the youth \n     of the Arab world, to quell their hostility towards us, and \n     to engage them in constructive dialogue.\n       The Cultural Bridges Act of 2002 will afford us that \n     opportunity. It will promote educational exchanges between \n     the United States and the Islamic world, enabling Muslim \n     youth to learn about our society and values first-hand and \n     then serving as ambassadors of peace upon their return home, \n     while affording American students first-hand experience \n     abroad providing them with valuable insight and understanding \n     about the Arab and Islamic worlds.\n       Your legislation is important and timely. We thank you for \n     championing this bold initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              William A. Rugh,\n\n                                        U.S. Ambassador (retired),\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Alliance for International\n\n\n                            Educational and Cultural Exchange,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: On behalf of the \n     65 member NGOs of the Alliance for International Educational \n     and Cultural Exchange, I write to thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing the Cultural Bridges Act of 2002.\n       Winning the war on terrorism will demand more than just our \n     military prowess. It will require us to engage the peoples of \n     the Islamic world about our society and values if we are to \n     forge the mutual understanding and respect that will be the \n     basis of peaceful, productive relationships. As September 11 \n     and its aftermath make clear, our public diplomacy has fallen \n     short.\n       Building productive ties will require a sustained and \n     serious commitment that reaches well beyond our current \n     efforts. The exchanges authorized in your bill are the most \n     cost-effective way to encourage the positive personal and \n     institutional relationships that will enhance our long-term \n     national security.\n       Congressional leadership will be crucial to this endeavor. \n     Student and exchange flows from the Muslim world are among \n     the lowest of any region, and significant new resources will \n     be required to jump-start this effort. Moreover, a clear \n     federal commitment will leverage private sector support from \n     universities, schools, businesses, and communities across the \n     U.S. This initiative will engage the American people directly \n     in the conduct of the highest priority foreign policy.\n       Your legislation is the right bill at the right time. You \n     have the gratitude and support of members of the exchange \n     community throughout the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Kenton w.

Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: I am writing on \n     behalf of our staff, volunteers, and board members located in \n     all 50 States to express our pleasure and thanks for \n     initiating the cultural Bridges Act of 2002.\n       AFS is the oldest, largest, and most diverse high school \n     exchange program in the United States and in the world. We \n     understand and appreciate the leadership you have \n     demonstrated in sponsoring this bill. Public diplomacy in the \n     Islamic world requires the focus and funding contained in \n     your bill. Our 54 years of experience in the field of \n     exchange tells us that a serious commitment, sustained over a \n     number of years, will be needed to defeat terrorism at its \n     roots by increasing understanding and tolerance among people \n     of different countries, beliefs and values. AFS exchanged \n     students from Germany and Japan with the U.S. almost \n     immediately after World War II. Today those countries are our \n     allies. Democratic principles, respect for others, and \n     individual freedom are our values, and they can be powerful \n     when seen through daily interaction with our families and \n     students.\n       You are doing the right thing. We stand ready to support \n     you in any way we can.\n       Thank you for your pursuit of peace and freedom.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alex J.

Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar and Chafee: On behalf of the \n     Academy for Educational Development, a non-profit \n     organization serving people in more than 160 countries, I \n     want to thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     Cultural Bridges Act of 2002.\n       International exchange programs are a critical component of \n     the war on terrorism. Exchange programs enhance mutual \n     understanding and build long-term bridges with individuals in \n     other countries. Expanding the flow of people, ideas and \n     information will promote greater understanding of the United \n     States and will advance our foreign policy objectives.\n       The International Visitor Program has been particularly \n     effective at reaching future foreign leaders and at advancing \n     key foreign policy objectives. For example, a recent \n     leadership development program brought student leaders from \n     the Middle East and North Africa for exchanges with student \n     leaders across the United States. Another program on the role \n     of religion in the United States brought administrators from \n     religious educational institutions, or ``madrassahs,'' in \n     Pakistan to meet with civic and religious leaders in several \n     cities. Programs such as these that target key issues and \n     leaders should be significantly expanded in the Islamic \n     world.\n       Although the world's attention has been focused on the \n     Muslim world, exchange programs from countries with large \n     Islamic populations are underrepresented in U.S. government-\n     sponsored exchange programs. Your bill will significantly \n     enhance the capacity to reach out to individuals in these \n     countries through people-to-people exchanges that are among \n     our best tools of diplomacy.\n       We thank you for your leadership, vision and commitment in \n     introducing this critical piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Stephen F. Moseley,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Councils\n\n\n                                  for International Education,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: I write to \n     commend you for your leadership in introducing the Cultural \n     Bridges Act of 2002, a legislative initiative designed to \n     engage the diverse Islamic populations around the world \n     through international exchange programs. I particular want to \n     thank you for focusing on high school exchanges as a highly \n     effective mechanism for introducing the United States to this \n     audience, and them to our fellow Americans.\n       While our country's public diplomacy efforts--which include \n     exchange programs--have earned us many friends in parts of \n     the world, the dramatic events of September 11th and our \n     examination of our standing with key populations in the \n     Islamic world since those terrorist attacks have revealed \n     that we have neglected a critical world population stretching \n     from West Africa to Southeast Asia. This arc crosses the Arab \n     Middle East, through Southeastern Europe and Central Asia to \n     Indochina; approximately 1.4 billion people populate the \n     countries along this arc. Your initiative would make it our \n     national policy to reach out to the peoples of these \n     countries to build mutual understanding.\n       The Cultural Bridges Act of 2002 would capitalize on our \n     nation's capacity to educate and inform by bringing \n     individuals to the United States to learn about our culture, \n     language, and aspirations--all while studying in school, \n     mastering their chosen profession, or doing research. It \n     provides a highly effective (and low cost) way to positively \n     influence foreign populations through citizen diplomacy, \n     something we've done well with post-war Europe and Japan, \n     Latin America, and most recently with the countries of the \n     former Warsaw Pact.\n       My own organization has utilized academic and youth \n     exchanges for more than 25 years with the former Soviet \n     Union. Among our many successes in fostering understanding of \n     the United States in that region, some of the most impressive \n     results result from exchange programs involving youth, like \n     the Future Leaders Exchange Program, and secondary school \n     teachers, like the Excellence in Teaching Awards Exchange \n     Program--both funded through an earlier congressional \n     initiative, the FREEDOM Support Act. The Cultural Bridges Act \n     that you are introducing in the Senate would facilitate \n     similar successes in the Islamic World.\n       The American Councils has experience with working in the \n     Muslim communities of the NIS--communities that exist \n     throughout the 12 countries of the old Soviet Union. Some of \n     the most dynamic needs for expanded exchange opportunities in \n     the NIS are apparent in the predominately Islamic countries \n     of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \n     Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan--countries that are critical to \n     addressing our urgent security concerns in Central Asia and \n     all of which would be eligible to benefit from your \n     legislation.\n       Your exchanges initiative is both an effective bulwark \n     against ignorance of the United States and a proactive \n     measure for securing the peace we hope to achieve through our \n     current military campaign. I applaud your leadership in \n     introducing this bill, and look forward to its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dan E.

Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: As a member of the Alliance for \n     International Educational and Cultural Exchange, I write to \n     thank you for your leadership in introducing the Cultural \n     Bridges Act of 2002.\n       Winning the war on terrorism will demand more than just our \n     military prowess. It will require us to engage the peoples of \n     the Islamic world about our society and values if we are to \n     forge the mutual understanding and respect that will be the \n     basic of peaceful, productive relationships. As September 11 \n     and its aftermath make clear, our public diplomacy has fallen \n     short.\n       Building productive ties will require a sustained and \n     serious commitment that reaches well beyond our current \n     efforts. The exchanges authorized in your bill are the most \n     cost-effective way to encourage the positive personal and \n     institutional relationships that will enhance our long-term \n     national security.\n       Congressional leadership will be crucial to this endeavor. \n     Student and exchange flows from the Muslim world are among \n     the lowest of any region, and significant new resources\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n     will be required to jump-start this effort. Moreover, a clear \n     federal commitment will leverage private sector support from \n     universities, schools, businesses, and communities across the \n     U.S. This initiative will engage the American people directly \n     in the conduct of the highest priority foreign policy.\n       Your legislation is the right bill at the right time. You \n     have the gratitude and support of members of the exchange \n     community throughout the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert J.

Edward M. Kennedy, Richard G. Lugar, and Lincoln D. \n       Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Institute of International \n     Education, including our Trustees and volunteers across the \n     country, please accept IIE's thanks and appreciation for the \n     leadership you are showing by introducing the Cultural \n     Bridges Act of 2002. Your initiative could not be more \n     relevant and timely.\n       As always, the leadership of Congress in international \n     educational exchange is critical. Now, in vulnerable areas of \n     the world where peace, understanding and progress through \n     education are vitally needed to insure that terrorism and \n     intolerance are eliminated, your legislation addresses key \n     areas where we can work to build shared values.\n       Exchanges of high school and college students, graduate \n     students and young professionals, as well as others, who can \n     help create the climate we need where progressive democratic \n     developments flourish are sorely needed in Africa, the Near \n     East, Central and South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The focus \n     of your Cultural Bridges Act of 2002 on members of the \n     Organization of Islamic Conference includes virtually every \n     nation we need to reach if we are serious about making people \n     to people diplomacy work for youth. As you know, the \n     Institute has always regarded the Mutual Educational and \n     Cultural Exchanges Act of 1961 as one of the most important \n     of all this nation's foreign policy documents. By directing \n     the Department of State to establish new initiatives through \n     the authority of the 1961 Act you will assure that the \n     philanthropic and higher education sectors not only support \n     your efforts but help you leverage government resources for \n     important common purposes.\n       Please let me know if there is anything the Institute can \n     do to assist you in this critically important endeavor at a \n     time of great national need.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n     ------ ------\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                              National Council for\n\n\n                                       International Visitors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: On behalf of the \n     Board and members of the National Council for International \n     Visitors (NCIV), we thank you for your initiative in \n     introducing the Cultural Bridges Act of 2002. NCIV members--\n     nonprofit program agencies and 95 community organizations \n     across the United States--organize professional programs, \n     home visits, and cultural activities for participants in the \n     State Department's International Visitor Program and other \n     exchanges. More than 80,000 volunteers are involved in NCIV \n     member activities each year, including WorldBoston, \n     International Center of Indianapolis, and the World Affairs \n     Council of Rhode Island.\n       NCIV members promote citizen diplomacy--the idea that the \n     individual citizen has the right, even the responsibility, to \n     help shape U.S. foreign relations ``one handshake at a time'' \n     through exchanges. We are grateful for your leadership in \n     introducing this legislation that will make more of these \n     handshakes possible with participants from underserved areas \n     of the world.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alan Kumamoto,\n       Chair, Board of Directors.\n     Sherry L. Mueller,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Sister Cities International,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: On behalf of \n     Sister Cities International and the 700 U.S. cities joined in \n     cooperative sister city partnerships with 1,500 international \n     cities in 121 countries, I applaud your leadership in \n     introducing the Cultural Bridges Act of 2002. The Cultural \n     Bridges Act of 2002 will be a vital tool in the conduct of \n     U.S. foreign policy and public diplomacy in response to new \n     challenges facing the United States.\n       The need for increased international understanding and \n     cooperation has never been more imperative than in the \n     aftermath of September 11. International education and \n     exchange programs are critical elements in advancing U.S. \n     foreign policy and national security, as they build \n     understanding and cooperation between Americans and future \n     foreign leaders. Nearly 150 present and past foreign heads of \n     state made their first visits to the United States on \n     exchange programs. This powerful tool for building \n     productive, positive relationships has served the United \n     States extraordinarily well over the years, and has included \n     visits from world leaders such as Anwar Sadat and Indira \n     Gandhi, French Premier Lionel Jospin and British Prime \n     Minister Tony Blair.\n       Perhaps most importantly, the Cultural Bridges Act boldly \n     leads the way for the federal government to encourage \n     sustainable, cooperative relationships between the United \n     States and the Islamic world. In the fight against terrorism \n     and efforts to improve our national security, there can be no \n     doubt that fostering international exchanges will help \n     diminish negative stereotypes and build an environment of \n     mutual understanding and respect for differences. \n     Furthermore, the Cultural Bridges Act will help foster \n     citizen diplomacy initiatives that will promote the \n     involvement of local citizens in international engagement. \n     Now more than ever, the federal government must invest in \n     capacity building at the community level to promote citizen \n     diplomacy, particularly with regard to the Islamic world. As \n     we know, resources allotted for these activities are \n     drastically insufficient in the current climate, and we hope \n     the introduction of the Cultural Bridges Act will move our \n     nation in the right direction of enhanced cooperation.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this pressing issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tim Honey,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               World Learning,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: Thank you for \n     your leadership in introducing the Cultural Bridges Act of \n     2002. Enactment of this legislation will make possible \n     increase opportunities to bring current and future leaders \n     from the Islamic world to the United States and to send \n     Americans to Muslim counties to teach and study.\n       Expanded opportunities for citizen exchange between the \n     United States and the Islamic world will help to engender \n     increased respect, understanding and trust between our \n     peoples. building this mutual understanding will enhance our \n     national security by broadening the range of productive \n     interactions between the United States and Muslim countries.\n       Currently, student and other exchange flows with Muslim \n     countries are lower than with regions of the world. The \n     programs which the Cultural Bridges Act authorizes would \n     provide for significant increases at this crucial time for \n     our nation. Thank you again for your leadership in working to \n     strengthen these important programs.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Robert Chase,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            World Study Group,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Lugar, and Chafee: On behalf of the \n     World Study Group, I write to thank you for your leadership \n     in introducing the Cultural Bridges Act of 2002. The World \n     Study Group and its affiliated J-1 visa programs are \n     dedicated to increasing understanding and trust between \n     people through international cultural exchange.\n       Building productive ties with Muslim world will require a \n     sustained and serious commitment that reaches well beyond our \n     current efforts. The exchanges authorized in your bill are \n     the most cost-effective way to encourage the positive \n     personal and institutional relationships that will enhance \n     our long-term national security goals. Breaking down \n     misunderstanding requires that our peoples know each other \n     better.\n       Congressional leadership will be crucial to this endeavor. \n     Student exchanges from the Muslim world are among the lowest \n     of any region, and significant new resources will be required \n     to jump start this effort. Moreover, a clear federal \n     commitment will leverage private sector support and will \n     immediately engage the American people directly in the \n     conduct of this high priority foreign policy initiative.\n       Your legislation is the right bill at the right time. On \n     behalf of AYUSA, AuPairCare, and Intrax Inc., we thank you. \n     You have the gratitude and support of our staff and field \n     representatives throughout the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Wilhelm,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4205-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3401.

SUGAR POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tariff-rate quotas imposed on imports of sugar, \n     syrups and sugar-containing products under chapters 17, 18, \n     19, and 21 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States are an essential element of United States sugar \n     policy;\n       (2) circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will, if \n     unchecked, make it impossible to achieve the objectives of \n     United States sugar policy;\n       (3) the tariff-rate quotas have been circumvented \n     frequently, defeating the purposes of United States sugar \n     policy and causing disruption to the United States market for \n     sweeteners, injury to domestic growers, refiners, and \n     processors of sugar, and adversely affecting legitimate \n     exporters of sugar to the United States;\n       (4) it is essential to United States sugar policy that the \n     tariff-rate quotas be enforced and that deceptive practices \n     be prevented, including the importation of products with no \n     commercial use and failure to disclose all relevant \n     information to the United States Customs Service; and\n       (5) unless action is taken to prevent circumvention, \n     circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will continue and \n     will ultimately destroy United States sugar policy.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     maintain the integrity of the tariff-rate quotas on sugars, \n     syrups, and sugar-containing products by stopping \n     circumvention as soon as it becomes apparent.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the \n     ``Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the \n     national security of the United States. Trade is critical to \n     the economic growth and strength of the United States and to \n     its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships \n     promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve \n     the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold \n     War, binding nations together through a series of mutual \n     rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in \n     international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and \n     peace throughout the world.\n       (2) The national security of the United States depends on \n     its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a \n     vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been \n     the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize \n     opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of \n     the economy of the United States, such as information \n     technology, telecommunications and other leading \n     technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical \n     equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, \n     and intellectual property. Trade will create new \n     opportunities for the United States and preserve the \n     unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, \n     political, and military affairs. The United States, secured \n     by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century.\n       (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that \n     dispute settlement procedures under international trade \n     agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations \n     provided in such agreements. Nevertheless, in several cases, \n     dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body have \n     added to obligations and diminished rights of the United \n     States under WTO Agreements. In particular, dispute \n     settlement panels and the Appellate Body have--\n       (A) given insufficient deference to the expertise and fact-\n     finding of the Department of Commerce and the United States \n     International Trade Commission;\n       (B) imposed an obligation concerning the casual \n     relationship between increased imports into the United States \n     and serious injury to domestic industry necessary to support \n     a safeguard measure that is different from the obligation set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (C) imposed an obligation concerning the exclusion from \n     safeguards measures of products imported from countries party \n     to a free trade agreement that is different from the \n     obligation set forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (D) imposed obligations on the Department of Commerce with \n     respect to the use of facts available in antidumping \n     investigations that are different from the obligations set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements; and\n       (E) accorded insufficient deference to the Department of \n     Commerce's methodology for adjusting countervailing duties \n     following the privatization of a subsidized foreign producer.\n\n     SEC. 2102.

and\n       (iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus \n     curiae submissions from businesses, unions, and \n     nongovernmental organizations.\n       (4) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding trade-related \n     intellectual property are--\n       (A) to further promote adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property rights, including through--\n       (i)(I) ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the \n     Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \n     Rights referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15), particularly with \n     respect to meeting enforcement obligations under that \n     agreement;

and\n       (B) to ensure that such standards do not place United \n     States persons at a competitive disadvantage in international \n     trade.\n       (7) Improvement of the wto and multi-lateral trade \n     agreements.--The principal negotiating objectives of the \n     United States regarding the improvement of the World Trade \n     Organization, the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other \n     multilateral and bilateral trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage \n     of the World Trade Organization and such agreements to \n     products, sectors, and conditions of trade not adequately \n     covered;

COMMITTEE STAFF.\n\n       The grant of trade promotion authority under this title is \n     likely to increase the activities of the primary committees \n     of jurisdiction in the area of international trade.

The primary committees of \n     jurisdiction should have adequate staff to accommodate these \n     increases in activities.\n\n     SEC. 2110.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Andean \n     Trade Preference Expansion Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in \n     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade \n     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has \n     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source \n     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean \n     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs \n     and expanded export opportunities in both the United States \n     and the Andean region.\n       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element \n     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean \n     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based \n     economic development that provides sustainable economic \n     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the \n     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable \n     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by \n     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable \n     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global \n     competition for its legitimate trade.\n       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a \n     threat to the security interests of the United States and the \n     world. This problem has been partially addressed through \n     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in \n     2000.

TRANSPARENCY IN NAFTA TRIBUNALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA) allows foreign investors to file claims \n     against signatory countries that directly or indirectly \n     nationalize or expropriate an investment, or take measures \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation'' of such an \n     investment.\n       (2) Foreign investors have filed several claims against the \n     United States, arguing that regulatory activity has been \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation''. Most \n     notably, a Canadian chemical company claimed $970,000,000 in \n     damages allegedly resulting from a California State \n     regulation banning the use of a gasoline additive produced by \n     that company.\n       (3) A claim under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA is \n     adjudicated by a three-member panel, whose deliberations are \n     largely secret.\n       (4) While it may be necessary to protect the \n     confidentiality of business sensitive information, the \n     general lack of transparency of these proceedings has been \n     excessive.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this amendment is to ensure \n     that the proceedings of the NAFTA investor protection \n     tribunals are as transparent as possible, consistent with the \n     need to protect the confidentiality of business sensitive \n     information.\n       (c) Chapter 11 of NAFTA.--The President shall negotiate \n     with Canada and Mexico an amendment to Chapter Eleven of the \n     NAFTA to ensure the fullest transparency possible with \n     respect to the dispute settlement mechanism in that Chapter, \n     consistent with the need to protect information that is \n     classified or confidential, by--\n       (1) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement under \n     Chapter Eleven are promptly made public;\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n       (2) ensuring that with respect to Chapter Eleven--\n       (A) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public; and\n       (B) all hearings are open to the public; and\n       (3) establishing a mechanism under that Chapter for \n     acceptance of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, \n     unions, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (d) Certification Requirements.--Within one year of the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the U.S. Trade Representative \n     shall certify to Congress that the President has fulfilled \n     the requirements set forth in subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 4202. EXPRESSION OF SOLIDARTIY WITH ISRAEL IN ITS FIGHT \n                   AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Israel are now engaged in a \n     common struggle against terrorism and are on the frontlines \n     of a conflict thrust upon them against their will.\n       (2) President George W. Bush declared on November 21, 2001, \n     ``We fight the terrorists and we fight all of those who give \n     them aid. America has a message for the nations of the world: \n     If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or \n     arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist \n     or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist, and you will be \n     held accountable by the United States and our friends.''.\n       (3) The United States has committed to provide resources to \n     states on the frontline in the war against terrorism.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--\n       (1) stands in solidarity with Israel, a frontline state in \n     the war against terrorism, as it takes necessary steps to \n     provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist \n     infrastructure in the Palestinian areas;\n       (2) remains committed to Israel's right to self-defense;\n       (3) will continue to assist Israel in strengthening its \n     homeland defenses;\n       (4) condemns Palestinian suicide bombings;\n       (5) demands that the Palestinian Authority fulfill its \n     commitment to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the \n     Palestinian areas;\n       (6) urges all Arab states, particularly the United States \n     allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to declare their unqualified \n     opposition to all forms of terrorism, particularly suicide \n     bombing, and to act in concert with the United States to stop \n     the violence; and\n       (7) urges all parties in the region to pursue vigorously \n     efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace \n     in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/10/senate-section/article/S4243-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 107-7\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following \nprotocol transmitted following the recess of the Senate on May 9, 2002, \nby the President of the United States:\n  The Protocol to the Agreement of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency Regarding Safeguards in the United States (Treaty Document No. \n107-7);\n  I further ask that the protocol be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I submit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the \nProtocol Additional to the Agreement Between the United States of \nAmerica and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application \nof Safeguards in the United States of America, with annexes, signed at \nVienna June 12, 1998 (the ``Additional Protocol''). Adhering to the \nAdditional Protocol will bolster U.S. efforts to strengthen nuclear \nsafeguards and promote the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, which \nis a cornerstone of U.S. foreign and national security policy.\n  At the end of the Persian Gulf War, the world learned the extent of \nIraq's clandestine pursuit of an advanced program to develop nuclear \nweapons. In order to increase the capability of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (the ``Agency'') to detect such programs, the \ninternational community negotiated a Model Additional Protocol (the \n``Model Protocol'') to strengthen the Agency's nuclear safeguards \nsystem. The Model Protocol is to be used to amend the existing \nbilateral safeguards agreements of states with the Agency.\n  The Model Protocol is a milestone in U.S. efforts to strengthen the \nsafeguards system of the Agency and thereby to reduce the threat posed \nby clandestine efforts to develop a nuclear weapon capability. By \naccepting the Model Protocol, states assume new obligations that will \nprovide far greater transparency for their nuclear activities. \nSpecifically, the Model Protocol strengthens safeguards by requiring \nstates to provide broader declarations to the Agency about their \nnuclear programs and nuclear-related activities and by expanding the \naccess rights of the Agency.\n  The United States signed the Additional Protocol at Vienna on June \n12, 1998. The Additional Protocol is a bilateral treaty that would \nsupplement and amend the Agency verification arrangements under the \nexisting Agreement Between the United States of America and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in \nthe United States of America of November 18, 1977 (the ``Voluntary \nOffer''), which entered into force on December 9, 1980. The Additional \nProtocol will enter into force when the United States notifies the \nAgency that the U.S. statutory and constitutional requirements for \nentry into force have been met.\n  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the ``NPT'') \nrequires non-nuclear-weapon states parties to accept Agency safeguards \non their nuclear activities. The United States, as a nuclear-weapon \nstate party to the NPT, is not obligated to accept Agency safeguards on \nits nuclear activities. Nonetheless, it has been the announced policy \nof the United States since 1967 to permit the application of Agency \nsafeguards to its nuclear facilities--excluding only those of direct \nnational security significance. The Additional Protocol similarly \nallows the United States to exclude its application in instances where \nthe United States decides that its application would result in access \nby the Agency to activities with direct national security significance \nto the United States or access to locations or information associated \nwith such activities. I am, therefore, confident that the Additional \nProtocol, given our right to invoke the national security exclusion and \nto manage access in accordance with established principles for \nimplementing these provisions, can be implemented in a fashion that is \nfully consistent with U.S. national security.\n  By submitting itself to the same safeguards on all of its civil \nnuclear activities that non-nuclear-weapon states parties to the NPT \nare subject to, the United States intends to demonstrate that adherence \nto the Model Protocol does not place other countries at a commercial \ndisadvantage. The U.S. signature of the Additional Protocol was an \nimportant factor in the decisions of many non-nuclear-weapon states to \naccept the Model Protocol and provided significant impetus toward their \nearly acceptance. I am satisfied that the provisions of the Additional \nProtocol, given our right to manage access in accordance with Article 7 \nand established implementation principles, will allow the United States \nto prevent the dissemination of proliferation-sensitive information and \nprotect proprietary or commercially sensitive information.\n  I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State concerning the Additional Protocol, including an \narticle-by-article analysis, a subsidiary arrangement, and a letter the \nUnited States has sent to the Agency concerning the Additional \nProtocol. Additionally, the recommended legislation necessary to \nimplement the Additional Protocol will be submitted separately to the \nCongress.\n  I believe that the Additional Protocol is in the best interests of \nthe United States. Our acceptance of this agreement will sustain our \nlongstanding record of voluntary acceptance of nuclear safeguards and \ngreatly strengthen our ability to promote universal adoption of the \nModel Protocol, a central goal of my nuclear nonproliferation policy. \nWidespread acceptance of the Protocol will contribute significantly to \nour nonproliferation objectives as well as strengthen U.S., allied, and \ninternational security. I, therefore, urge the Senate to give early and \nfavorable consideration to the Additional Protocol, and to give advice \nand consent to its ratification.\n                                                      George W.
