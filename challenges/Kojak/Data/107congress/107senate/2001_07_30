Mr. President, the first half hour is for that of the \nDemocrats. The second half hour is for that of the Republicans. We are \ngoing to have time evenly divided between 2:30 and 5:30 on the motion \nto proceed to the emergency Agriculture supplemental authorization \nbill.\n  The majority leader has directed me to announce to everybody that we \nhave a schedule this week that we must complete. We have to complete \nwork on this very important Agriculture supplemental. It is an \nemergency measure that is very important to the country. We have the \nVA-HUD appropriations bill to complete. We have to complete the work of \nthe past week on the Transportation appropriations bill. Also, we must \ndo the Export Administration Act.\n  The reason we must complete the Agricultural Assistance Emergency Act \nis because, if we don't, we lose funding. It is targeted so that if \nthis money is not spent prior to the first of September, it is \nbasically lost for the farmers of this country, and that would be a \nreal disaster.\n  The reason we must complete the Export Administration Act--the most \nimportant piece of legislation the high-tech industry has this year--is \nbecause this act expires in the middle of next month. Even if we extend \nit, it is not anything that will help the high-tech industry. We need \nto change the basic foundation of the act because what is happening is \nAmerican companies are having to go overseas to start manufacturing \nthese products because some of the real simple pieces of equipment that \ncan be bought at Radio Shack, such as the PalmPilot that I use, people \nsay is in violation of the present act. We need to be able to sell \nthese export products to foreign countries, where about half of our \nmarket is.\n  The Transportation appropriations bill--the leader indicated that \nsometime this week he will call for another cloture vote. Based upon \nprior votes on this matter, cloture should be passed--cloture should \ntake effect, and we would have 30 hours after that.\n  We have a tremendous amount of work to do this week prior to the \nAugust recess. I hope that we can complete all of these things in a \ntimely fashion. As soon as we complete them, we can start the August \nrecess. Until we do that, it will be difficult to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 1:30 \np.m. shall be under the control of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, or his designee.\n  Also, under the order previously entered, the time until 2 p.m. shall \nbe under the control of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, or his \ndesignee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8371-8", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things I want to visit about this \nmorning is something I read in the morning newspapers; that is, there \nis now another effort being made to pass a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I hope that people will get a new page in their \nsong book. We have danced that tune. We have had long hours and days of \ndebate in the Senate on a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\n  From the information I have received, they still want to do it using \nthe Social Security surpluses. It seems to me that we have done very \nwell without a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. When \nthis debate started, as you will recall, based upon the beginnings of \nthe Reagan administration, there was an effort to cut taxes and \nincrease spending. That was a recipe for disaster. We now have a debt \nof about $5 trillion as a result of that. We have now, it seems, the \nsame basic scenario. There is being an effort made to cut taxes, and we \nalready know, based upon having passed the supplemental appropriations \nbill, Mr. President, that our surplus is basically gone.\n  In an effort to further grind down domestic spending, it appears \nthere is an effort being made to go back where we were a few years ago \nsaying what we really need to make things great in this country is a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. When that debate \nstarted during the first Bush administration, there was an annual \ndeficit of about $300 billion.\n  In the last 8 years, we have been able to do a great job without a \nconstitutional amendment. We have reduced the annual deficit to where \nnow we are having surpluses. Prior to this budget--we will see how much \ndamage this budget does to the progress we have made--we have been able \nto have many months of low inflation and low unemployment, the longest \nin some 40 years.\n  We have been able to reduce the Federal payroll, separate and apart \nfrom the military, some 300,000 fewer jobs than we had before. Job \ncreation has been really significant. Some 22 million new jobs have \nbeen created. I am trying to figure out why we need, at this stage, a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I am afraid what has taken place in this short administration of Bush \nII is, it appears, a recipe for disaster. I say that because the income \nof this country will be cut back significantly.\n  I made a call today, and I am not going to divulge the name of the \nindividual to whom I spoke, but I would be happy to do that privately \nwith the President pro tempore or anyone else who wants to ask me, but \nI will not do it for the press because it was a relatively private call \nwith someone at a large corporation.\n  He indicated that in the last few days the value of this stock, of \nthis major American corporation, international corporation, has dropped \nsome 70 percent--in a matter of about a week.\n  The chief executive officer of this major company told me this \nmorning he believes for the first time this softening of the economy we \nhave all talked about is now being felt worldwide. This is a worldwide \ncompany. For this stock, in a week's period of time, to decline 70 \npercent indicates this country had better slow down and slow down its \nefforts to change the way things have been going.\n  They have been going great. Senator Moynihan, who was a valued Member \nof the Senate, said there are Members of the Senate, Members of \nCongress, people in and outside of government, who for decades have \ndetermined they cannot cut back domestic spending by facing it head on \nand saying we want to cut this program for the Forest Service or for \nany program one wants to pick--the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of \nReclamation, which entities do so much good--they cannot do this head \non because these entities do so much good. I have just picked a few off \nthe top of my head.\n  What they are doing instead is just squeezing down the domestic \ndiscretionary spending so these entities will, in effect, starve \nthemselves, and that is what is happening. That is what Senator \nMoynihan said was going to happen, and it appears he is right. What \nthey are trying to do is starve the domestic aspect of our spending.\n  We are going to have to realize what we are facing. There are going \nto be huge requests even this year for more defense spending, and I am \nsure there is a need for more defense spending, but also there is a \nneed for domestic discretionary spending.\n  I held a hearing in my subcommittee of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee last Monday, dealing with this Nation's infrastructure. \nI brought in mayors from around the country to talk about what is \nhappening in their cities. It is scary, to say the least.\n  The mayor of Atlanta, GA, said that most mayors in America now are on \nterm limits and the No. 1 wish of mayors from around America is: Please \ndo not have the water system, the sewer system, break down, before my \nterm is up. Let the next mayor face the problem because it is coming. \nIt is just a question of when.\n  The mayor of Atlanta said in this relatively new, modern city in the \nsense that most of the growth has taken place recently, there is a very \nbig backlog of things which need to be done. Some of their water \nsystems in Atlanta are very old and are being put together by--I am \nexaggerating--chewing gum. They are just holding them together. They do \nnot have enough money to do it right.\n  I had Mayor Williams of our National City, Washington, DC, testify in \nmy subcommittee. Those of us who spend a lot of time in Washington, DC, \nhave all seen and read in the paper about the manhole covers blowing \noff in the Georgetown area. He said that is a result of work not being \ndone that needs to be done with the electricity, with the sewers, with \nthe water systems. He said some of the water pipes in Washington, DC, \nare old wooden pipes.\n  We heard from the Mayor of Washington, DC, saying the infrastructure \nneeds of this metropolitan American Federal city are disastrous. He \nneeds help. If there is a city in America we should help, it is \nWashington, DC, where tourists come to see the Nation's Capitol, but we \nhave manhole covers blowing off into the air like mortars. He said \nthere are going to be more of them; they do not have the wherewithal to \nfix them.\n  Mark Morial, the mayor of New Orleans, came in and testified. New \nOrleans is a famous city, with a great and rich heritage. I am reading \na book now about Andrew Jackson, ``Battle of New Orleans.'' It is a \nwonderful book. New Orleans has 100 water pumping stations. That is the \nway it is. That is the way they have to get the water out of the city. \nThere is lots of water. If they did not pump the water out, the city \nwould be flooded. The pumping stations use pumps over 100 years old.\n  The mayor said, how much longer can they keep doing what they are \nsupposed to do? The pumps are 100 years old. Some of those pumps came \ninto existence before the turn of the last century, and we are still \nusing them.\n  The mayor of Las Vegas, NV, Oscar Goodman, testified. It is the most \nrapidly growing city in America, the fastest growing State in America.\n  I asked: Is it true, Mayor Goodman, we must build 12 new schools \nevery year in the Las Vegas area, 1 every month, to keep up?\n  He said: Senator, you are wrong. It is now up to 14. We have to build \nmore than one school every month to keep up with the growth there. We \nreally need help. Las Vegas needs help. Clark County, where Las Vegas \nis, needs help.\n  What are we talking about doing? Spending time on the Senate floor \ntalking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget? We need \nto talk about ways to help the cities of Atlanta, New Orleans, Las \nVegas and Washington, DC. That is what we need to be spending some time \non.\n  We are on a literal powder keg of things that need to be done for our \ncities.\n  I also say this: If there was ever a time for bipartisanship, it is \nnow. The Senate is under the control of the Democrats, just barely. The \nHouse is under the control of the Republicans, just barely. We have a \nman who is President of the United States, who received fewer votes \nthan the person he beat. It would seem to me this is a time that cries \nout for bipartisanship, to work together to get things done.\n  Yet we had a filibuster last week that held up another appropriations \nbill. It was based on an issue--and I know the people who disputed the \nMexican trucking issue believe fervently in their side. There were two \nsides, and both believed in their causes. What went on in this Chamber \nwas not good for the well-being of the country. We needed to pass the \nappropriations bill, take it to conference. That is where it is going \nto be decided. It is not going to be decided in the Senate.\n  The House has a provision that, in effect, bans Mexican trucks coming \ninto America. It passed by a 2-to-1 margin. What we had crafted by \nSenators Shelby and Murray was a middle ground,\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nand that still was not good enough. The bill was taken down and will be \nbrought back up. We will vote again on cloture, and this week sometime \nwe will pass the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  But we need to work on issues that are important to this country. \nLast week a report came out dealing with Social Security and what \nneeded to be done. One of the main directions of that report is for the \nPresident's commission to do an analysis of Social Security. Most \neveryone said the people had a preconceived idea before they were \nappointed, and that is to privatize Social Security. We have heard from \na lot of people that such a plan would require a 41 percent cut in \nbenefits in order to maintain Social Security solvency, according to an \nOctober 2000 Century Foundation analysis by the country's leading \neconomists. It is very unlikely that private accounts would earn enough \nto dig out of the hole. Average single earners would still face 20 \npercent cuts, with married couples and lower earners doing even worse. \nSo there are a lot of issues that we are being forced to talk about by \nthe administration.\n  I think it is important we take a look at Social Security to see what \nwe can do to build it up in the outyears, but for people saying Social \nSecurity is a disaster, it is broke, simply isn't true. Everyone will \ndraw 100 percent of the benefits until almost the year 2040. And if we \ndid nothing with Social Security prior to 2040--and I certainly hope we \nwill not--people would still be able to draw 80 percent of their \nbenefits. They should be able to draw 100 percent of the benefits.\n  I think that another direction we are getting from the White House is \nnot appropriate, and that is talking about Social Security being \nbankrupt. It is not. We need to take a look and do some things so in \nthe outyears it is going to be strong and everybody can draw 100 \npercent of their benefits, not just 80 percent of the benefits. We also \nlook forward to having the committee chairmen work hard on having \nhearings so that we can report out as many of the President's \nnominations as we can. I personally think that the process isn't good; \nit takes so long. There is a huge hole at the end, and all these \nnominations are stuffed in this hole. At the other end, where they come \nout down, it is about this big. It is a very tiny little hole. It is a \nfunnel that has a small end on it. What happens is we do not have the \nopportunity in a timely fashion to look at these people. They go \nthrough the Justice Department, vetted by the White House, and outside \nentities take a look at them. It has become so burdensome that even an \nindependent analysis says the quickest President Bush can have all his \nnominees in place will be next February. That is really too slow, and \nwe are going to do our best to process these nominees as fairly and \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that we are allowed to go to the \nEmergency Agriculture Assistance Act of 2001. It is very important \nlegislation for almost the entire country--I shouldn't say almost the \nentire country. It is important for the whole country. Title I deals \nwith commodities, and these commodities are things that we take for \ngranted. When we go to the grocery stores, these things are always \nthere. Farmers have difficulty year after year doing what needs to be \ndone. This is an emergency supplemental. As we have heard on this floor \nfrom Senators from different parts of the country, if their farmers \ndon't get relief, they will, in effect, go bankrupt. That is why we \nneed to do this as quickly as possible.\n  Title II is very important. It deals with conservation. There is a \nnew part of the bill that has received a lot of direction and \nattention. The conservation aspect of this bill is important because we \nare looking at things we haven't done in the past, such as wetlands \nreserve programs and conservation reserve programs. So I would hope \nthat Senators Harkin and Lugar, who will be the managers of this \nlegislation, are allowed to go forward with this bill as quickly as \npossible.\n  It is too bad we are going to have a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed, but that is what we have been asked to do.\n  Title III deals with nutrition, which is a substantial part of this \nprogram. It requires a Farmers' Market Nutrition Pilot Program, \ndistribution of commodities, things that again we take for granted. So \nI hope that we move to title IV dealing with credit and rural \ndevelopment, which is certainly something that Nevada cares about; \ntitle V dealing with research; and title VI, disaster assistance, we \ncan move as quickly as possible.\n  We understand there will be a number of amendments. We hope that we \ncould move to these amendments quickly and not have to face another \ncloture motion on the bill itself. I think all we are doing is holding \nup legislation that is vital to the very existence of the family farm. \nWe have heard time and time again how important family farms are to \nAmerica. This legislation will preserve thousands of family farms that \nare in desperate shape at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I very much appreciate the senior Member of this body, \nthe President pro tempore, who is presiding at this time, for giving me \nthe opportunity to advise my colleagues of the seriousness of the \nenergy crisis in this county. I think we would all agree that the \nmatter of energy is something we take a good deal for granted. We take \nfor granted that America has been blessed with an affordable, \nplentiful, reliable supply of energy which pretty much provides us with \na standard of living second to none. But it is something, again, that \nis there. We take it for granted. And we look forward to it continuing.\n  We have had some attention given to the crisis out in California, but \nfor the most part it has not hit the majority of Americans. I think it \nis fair to say from the following information we have seen there is a \ngrowing concern that perhaps what happened in California could spread \nto other parts of the country.\n  As far as our national security is concerned, we have had a lot of \ndiscussion; we have seen communiques; we have seen articles concerning \nthe national security of our country tied into energy simply because we \nhave increased our imports of crude oil into this country from about 37 \npercent in 1973 to over 56 percent at this time.\n  As a consequence, we have become more beholden to OPEC and, the OPEC \ncartel, and the OPEC cartel has set a price structure of $22 to $28 and \nreduced supply. It is pretty much assumed now we are going to be in a \nperiod of increased dependence on imported oil from OPEC in the Middle \nEast for the increasing timeframe in the future until we find another \nalternative to crude oil, which is not likely to occur.\n  In addition, we have economic security which, of course, is fostered \nby\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\ngrowth and our continued expansion of jobs and the personal aspects \nassociated with energy. The security of our lives is somewhat dependent \non energy, the future of our dreams. We have factors to consider such \nas commitment, safety, and freedom from harm. Energy is directly \nrelated to that in the sense of what happens when our kids are home; \nthe lights go out, the security alarm does not work--things to be \nconcerned about in a very rapid period of time. We have the issue of \njob security to keep Americans at work and create more jobs. Energy \npowers the workplace, and that moves this economy forward, bringing \neach of us along with it.\n  As we look at our standard of living, our plentiful supply of energy, \nthe affordability, and the recognition that some of this is in \nquestion, I think we have to look at the reality associated with the \nactions being contemplated in this body and the House of \nRepresentatives. It is our understanding that the House of \nRepresentatives will be addressing an energy bill this week.\n  The reason things are different this time is we have brought together \na set of circumstances which I have highlighted on previous occasions, \nbut previously it was different. We have had a series of situations \nhighlighted by what is happening in California. We have seen an \nincreased dependence on foreign oil, as I have indicated, of 56 \npercent. The Department of Energy indicates that will increase to 64, \n65, 66 percent by the year 2010.\n  What is different about oil compared with our other sources of \nenergy? America and the world move on oil. We have other sources of \nenergy for electricity, including coal, natural gas, wind, hydro. But \nwe use oil. As we look at our increased dependence on foreign oil, we \nrecognize it affects our national security. Yet we are becoming more \nand more subject to control by the Middle East. We have not had any \nnuclear plants licensed in over 10 years in this country; nuclear is \nabout 20 percent of our energy. We have seen gas prices soar from $2.16 \nto over $10 and then come down again, but nevertheless we have seen a \ndramatic increase at a time when we are using natural gas at a faster \nrate than we are finding new gas reserves. We have not seen a new oil \nrefinery in this country in almost 20 years. We have not seen a coal-\nfired plant built in the last 10 years. We find suddenly we do not have \nadequate transmission; the transmission lines are overloaded, both \nnatural gas and electricity. So things are different now.\n  I fear as we pursue an energy bill in the Senate, we are going to end \nup where we were the last time we attempted to make some subjective \ncorrections. I think it is important to recognize this in the Energy \nCommittee where most of this legislation resides. In 1992, we passed a \nnumber of very positive, meaningful bills out of committee to increase \ndomestic production, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to \nexpedite infrastructure, develop alternative fuels, encourage renewable \nfuel development, promote conservation, and increase funding for the \nLIHEAP program which provides assistance for those with low income.\n  My point is we passed a meaningful bill but what we enacted was \nvirtually nothing: Double flush toilets and a left turn on a red light. \nThat is what we passed.\n  If we pursue an energy bill this time, it appears to me we are \npursuing much of the same that we passed in committee but are not \npassing into law simply because of a concern by well-meaning \nenvironmental groups that there is something wrong with increasing \nsupply. We will have to increase supply.\n  I also point out job security. This is a jobs issue in the United \nStates. It was interesting to hear the debate the other day in the \nHouse of Representatives. The Teamsters and the Democratic caucus had \nan opportunity to express the merits of increased supply.\n  As a consequence of the points I made relative to the fact that \nthings are different, yet we are pursuing the same old alternatives, we \nare putting emphasis on renewal, putting emphasis on alternatives, \nplacing emphasis on wind power and solar power, but we are not really \nincreasing supply as the demand has increased.\n  This chart demonstrates what is happening. The burden of increasing \nenergy bills hurts most those families who can afford it the least. \nAlmost 14 percent of the family budget is spent on energy for families \nearning less than $15,000. The point is obvious and most convincing: \nRunaway energy rates are costing Americans a great deal of money in \ntheir households, as well as costing jobs.\n  We have reviews from coast to coast. American working families have \nseen more than 400,000 jobs basically disappear since the first of the \nyear. A large reason for that, a significant reason, is the cost of \nenergy. In June alone, 114,000 jobs were lost. Most of those were good-\npaying jobs, manufacturing jobs, for so many families. We saw Northwest \nAirlines lose 2,000 jobs; International Paper, 3,000 jobs; aluminum \nplants in the Northwest find it more profitable to sell electricity \nthan make aluminum; Miller Brewing Company found high energy costs made \nit more economic to brew beer in Dallas and ship it to California \ninstead of brewing it there in the first place. In Delaware last week, \nDu Pont indicated it was relieving its workforce by some 1,500, and \npossibly up to 5,000, jobs and another 1,500 contract jobs. The reason? \nIncreased energy costs.\n  The problem is widespread: 54 companies had mass layoffs in Wisconsin \nin May, a significant portion due to high energy costs; Oregon alone \nhas had 7,000 employees laid off since last summer. State officials \nblame rising energy and fuel costs. California blackouts have cost \n135,000 jobs in California. Unless we turn this around, the economic \ndoom of a few short years ago will turn into a prolonged bust. The \nreason for this is the demand has increased but we have not increased \nthe supply.\n  As I indicated, the emphasis has been on renewables and alternatives. \nWe spent some $6 billion, but they still account for less than 4 \npercent of the total energy mix. That includes hydro as well. As we \nlook at potential solutions, there are some at hand. That is the \nPresident's comprehensive, balanced natural energy plan. The plan \nincludes more than 100 specific recommendations to increase \nconservation, improve energy, and domestic supplies of energy as well. \nThis plan will directly create more than 1.5 million new jobs. We need \nthese jobs in the United States today.\n  The direct benefits speak for themselves, but the indirect benefits \nwill be immeasurable. By easing energy costs, returning stability and \nreliability to our energy grid, businesses can again look forward to \ngrowth, and that means jobs. Through incentives to promote new energy \nproduction, the energy plan will help to ensure meeting our growing \ndemand. New energy supplies mean new jobs. They mean the stability of \nexisting jobs. The plan places an emphasis on American ingenuity and \nAmerican technology. We are using our best and brightest to craft \nsolutions to these energy problems. It will take hard work. It will \ntake new thinking and new jobs as well.\n\n  The plan also encourages development of resources that exist here at \nhome, and that includes the safe exploration for energy under a small \nportion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  It is interesting to see some of the propaganda on this issue. I have \nhere a page from Rollcall. It is sponsored by a number of the \nenvironmental groups--American Rivers, Defenders of Wildlife. It is \nrather interesting because what it says is what, in effect, we did in \n1992. It says:\n\n       Let's Promote Clean Energy\n       A responsible bill would encourage the use of clean energy \n     and set significantly higher efficiency standards for motor \n     vehicles to reduce global warming pollution. Clean and \n     renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and geothermal. \n     . . .\n\n  That is where we were in 1992. Surely we want this technology. But it \nsimply is not here yet. It now constitutes less than 4 percent of our \nenergy supply.\n  This is part of the problem when we listen to our well-meaning \nfriends who simply propose a clean energy bill. They do not say how we \nare really going to increase the supply. We have to dramatically \nincrease the supply.\n  Rollcall says:\n\n       Let's Reduce Pollution\n       We could significantly cut emissions of global warming \n     pollutants by setting stronger fuel economy standards for \n     cars, SUVs and light trucks.\n\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n\n  They talk about 40 miles per gallon. But they do not talk about the \npreference of Americans to buy automobiles. One of the interesting \nthings in this country is that the 10 most fuel-efficient automobiles \non the market today constitute exactly 1.5 percent of the automobile \nsales.\n  They also say:\n\n       Let's Improve Energy Efficiency\n       The cleanest, cheapest, quickest way to meet our energy \n     needs is to improve energy efficiency. To help consumers, \n     let's have an energy bill that dramatically increases the \n     fuel economy of our vehicles. . . .\n\n  That is fine, but what does it do to increase supply? We have hydro; \nwe have nuclear, but it does not say anything about increasing nuclear \nenergy in this country, which is clean.\n  We are going to fall into the same trap we did in 1992. We are going \nto go through a lengthy process here, but we are not going to produce \nany more energy. One of the things that bothers me a little bit is the \nmisleading statement in this particular ad. It says:\n\n       The bill would open up pristine and ecologically fragile \n     lands like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Rocky \n     Mountain Front to oil drilling. There's no excuse for \n     sacrificing these and other national treasures and the \n     wildlife that depends on them. . . .\n\n  They further say:\n\n       The economically recoverable oil in the Arctic Refuge would \n     meet only six months of our nation's needs, and wouldn't \n     start reaching us for ten years.\n\n  Both those statements are absolutely false. To suggest it would be a \n6-month supply would be to assume that there would be no other energy \nproduced in the United States or imported into the United States for a \n6-month period.\n\n  If you want to turn it around, you say: Therefore we are not going to \nallow any development to occur in Alaska. Therefore the United States \nwill be short a 6-month supply.\n  It is used over and over again. It is a standard environmental pitch. \nIt says it would take 10 years. It would not take 10 years. The \nDepartment of Energy and Department of Interior have indicated they \nwould have oil on line in 3.5 years, if indeed the oil is there in the \nabundance it has to be.\n  In conclusion, I think we should note a couple of facts that are very \nreal. We are looking at jobs in this country. Opening ANWR would create \nabout 700,000 new jobs nationwide, associated with the development of \nANWR if, indeed, it carries the reserves that we anticipate.\n  We anticipate somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels of oil. \nThat would equal what we would import from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year \nperiod of time.\n  Here at home we have this opportunity. We are not going to drill our \nway out of this crisis, but we can substantially relieve our \ndependence.\n  The other point I want to make is about national security. We are \nbecoming more and more dependent on countries such as Iraq where we \nenforce the no-fly zones. Sadam attempted to shoot down our U-2 just \nlast week. We buy a million barrels of oil from Iraq, and what do we do \nwith the oil? We put it in our planes and go bomb him, take out his \ntargets. He develops a missile capability and aims it at our ally, \nIsrael. I don't think that is the best foreign policy.\n  If you look at the ANWR chart, you get a different view of the \nrealities. And the reality is there is a huge area called ANWR. It is a \nrelatively significant portion of dedicated wilderness: 8.5 million \nacres are in wilderness, 9 million already in refuge, and 1.5 million \nacres are the 1002 area that we are considering opening. There is no \nscientific evidence that says we cannot do it safely.\n  What about refuges? We do all kinds of development in refuges. We \nhave 30 refuges all over the country where we drill for oil and gas. \nThese are the States that have them. We have the specific refuges here \nin Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Montana, Mississippi, \nAlaska, California. What is so different about ANWR?\n  Is there a reason we cannot use this technology in ANWR? Refuges are \nopen to exploration for minerals and oil and gas as well. It is easy to \nconfuse a refuge with a wilderness or with a park, but we do not allow \nany motorized access in wildernesses and parks. Each is unique to its \nown specific purpose. The balanced use of Federal land is commonplace \nin a refuge. It is the norm. So many people misunderstand that.\n  In more than 30 Federal refuges from coast to coast we safely explore \nfor mineral resources. There are over 400 wells in Louisiana alone, so \nwhat is different about ANWR?\n  By definition, refuges are balanced places where the environment is \nalways protected and resources are explored only where the resource \nexists. ANWR is a refuge and it is no different. To suggest we cannot \ndo it safely is not proven by any scientific evidence. This is an \nemotional argument brought about by the environmental community to \ngenerate revenue and dollars.\n  Let me conclude with a couple of references because my time is almost \nup. We have new technology in ANWR. The new technology is the \ndirectional drilling which lends itself very much to 3D seismic. The \nold way you used to drill was to go straight down. If you hit it, you \nwere lucky. This is the new systematic 3D seismic which allows you to \nget into the pockets of oil. It is estimated by the technologists, \ntoday if we were going to drill under this cap, we could come out at \ngate 8 at Reagan Airport. This technology has advanced that much.\n  We have the toughest environmental standards here in the world. \nPrudhoe Bay is the finest oilfield in the world even though it is 30-\nyear-old technology.\n  What is Prudhoe Bay? Prudhoe Bay has produced its thirteen-millionth \nbarrel of oil. It was supposed to only have 10 million barrels. My \npoint is, as we look at the prospects for ANWR, the prospects for a \nmajor discovery according to the geologists is quite good, with an \nestimate of 5.6 to 16 billion. If it is 10 billion, it would be as big \nas Prudhoe Bay which has supplied this Nation with 20 percent of its \ncrude oil for the last 20 years. Exploration would be limited to a \nsliver of land, roughly 2,000 acres.\n  We have ice roads, which is new technology, as the chart will show. \nThis is the directional drilling. There are the ice roads. We build \nthese out of water. Some people say there is no water in the North \nSlope. That is ridiculous. You build snow fences, generate snow, you \ncan drill down below permafrost and there is plenty of water, or you \ncan take the salt water and use it through a desalination process, \nwhich is quite common.\n  This advanced technology makes the footprint manageable. A 2,000 \nacre-foot would average five average family farms. Caribou do not calve \nin the 1002 area. They did not this year or the last 2 years. Here is a \npicture of the calving area. The environmental arguments just do not \nsupport any of these generalizations.\n  There is an abundance of drilling on the Canadian side. There is a \ncaribou herd. Here is the information on the charts. It shows where \nAnderson Exploration conducted seismic studies. There are lease sales \nand echo plan areas all over the Canadian side. Here is the range of \nthe Porcupine caribou herd, and here is the drilling that is going on. \nOf course, here is Alaska and here is Canada.\n  My point is to suggest that while the Canadians object to our \ninitiating activity, they have a very aggressive ongoing program. \nObviously, they look at themselves as competitors with Alaska supplying \nthe United States with oil and gas.\n  Exploration and development of ANWR is supported by Alaskans. \nAlaskans are proud and protective of the environment. Alaska has the \nbest oversight in the world in the development of oil and gas. Prudhoe \nBay is required to adhere to State law as well as Federal law. We care \nabout where we get our oil. If we look at the area of Saudi Arabia and \nOPEC nations, we don't seem to give any consideration on how it is \nproduced and whether it is done environmentally and in a compatible \nmanner.\n  Alaskans are proud and protective of the environment, and we are \nwilling to do our part to end the energy crisis. There is no NIMBY in \nmy State; that is, ``Not in my backyard.'' Seventy-five percent of all \nAlaskans favor exploration. The Alaskans who live there--the people who \nmust breathe the air, drink the water, and make the decisions about \ntheir communities--support exploration. It is absolutely unfair to deny \nthem the same kind of opportunity everyone else enjoys in this country.\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\n  Kaktovik is a small village in ANWR in the 1002 area. \nEnvironmentalists say there is nothing there, that it is the Serengeti \nof the north. It is a village of about 250 people. There is a physician \nthere, a small school, and a general store. They are real people.\n  Do not be misled by the suggestion that somehow we don't have the \ncapability and we cannot do it safely. We can. Why not do it for \nAmerican jobs?\n  This issue reaches a critical mass this week as Congress finally--and \nI emphasize ``finally''--begins to work on a comprehensive energy bill. \nI urge my colleagues both here and in the other body to recognize that \nthis is a fork in the road, and our efforts can have great impact for \nthe American worker. Do we continue down the path of instability and \nrising energy costs--a path that finds more American families with pink \nslips and uncertain futures--or do we head down a path for job creation \nbased on solid science and growth?\n  With a comprehensive, balanced national energy strategy in place, we \ncan look forward to reliable, affordable, and plentiful energy that has \nfueled this economy in the past and that will power a bright future. I \nhope that is the choice because we cannot afford to make the mistakes \nwe made in 1992.\n  I will not stand by in this body and allow us to pass an energy bill \nthat does not increase the supply of energy in this country. It simply \nis unconscionable. That is apparently where we are headed, to some \ndegree.\n  I think it is important that we recognize what is going on in the \nHouse of Representatives and those in opposition who are suggesting \nalternative renewables with no increased supply, and recognize that we \nhave a serious concern over the loss of jobs in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Chattanooga Times by Lee Anderson who has been to ANWR and has some \ninteresting things to say about it.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       President George W. Bush wants to help head off our future \n     energy problems by drilling for oil in the far, far north of \n     Alaska, in an area called the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge.\n       Environmentalists and liberals are yelling, ``Over our dead \n     bodies.'' And now that the Democrats control the United \n     States Senate, they think they will win. But would you rather \n     continue to rely on Iraq's Saddam Hussein and a host of other \n     foreign nations for American oil?\n       There are some facts about Alaska and the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge that sensible people should look at \n     rationally--though many people won't do that.\n       In the first place, the proposed drilling site is so far \n     away and in such a desolate, cold and forbidding area that \n     almost no one will ever see it.\n       Second, it's not far from Prudhoe Bay, where current oil \n     production is proceeding without serious problems.\n       But perhaps most important is the fact that the proposed \n     oil production would affect very little land. Consider:\n       Alaska spreads over 615,230 square miles; already has 125 \n     million acres in national parks, preserves and wildlife \n     refuges.\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge consists of 19 million \n     acres. But the area proposed for drilling is only 1.5 million \n     acres. And of that, only about 2,000 acres--about twice the \n     size of Chattanooga's Lovell Field--would be used.\n       Will reason prevail and bring oil production? Probably not \n     soon.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield any remaining time to the \nSenator from Wyoming. I thank the Chair for his attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Alaska. Certainly that \nissue is important to all of us. We will be dealing with it soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8376-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8376-S8377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk about some of the bills \nthat are coming up and what I see as a very important aspect of what we \ndo here in the Congress. What we do, of course, is important. But let's \nhave some reasoning about where we want to be over time so that the \ndecisions we make as we go through our daily work will be implemented \nwith a vision of where we want to go.\n  Obviously, we have different views of what our role is here. I was \nlistening to my friend from Nevada, who is concerned about balanced \nbudgets because the Federal Government will not be able to spend \nenough. Others believe that maybe a balanced budget is where we ought \nto be and that there ought to be some limit on the size of government.\n  The fact is that States and local governments are very important \ncomponents. It makes a difference in where you see things down the \nroad.\n  I am specifically interested in what is happening in agriculture. We \nwill have a bill before us today on supplemental funding for \nagriculture. Before long, we will have the 2002 appropriations for \nagriculture. More importantly, perhaps next year or even at the end of \nthis year, we will have a new farm bill. That farm bill and the \nappropriations bills we are now dealing with will help us decide where \nwe are going in agriculture.\n  Those are the kinds of decisions in the longer term that we have to \nmake. Of course, we have to deal with the necessary daily things, but \nwe really ought to be asking where we want agriculture to be in 10 \nyears or in 15 years. These appropriations bills will have a great deal \nto do with where we go.\n  I think the same thing is true with health care. We are in the \nprocess right now of seeking some revision of Medicare. It is needed. \nWe are talking about how we are going to handle pharmaceuticals. What \nis it we want? How do we want health care structured over time? What do \nwe think is the best way to serve the people of this country? Those are \nthe kinds of decisions that I think too often we don't really give \nenough consideration to--where we are tied up with how we are going to \nget funding for this for next year and how we are going to keep this \nprogram at this level.\n  Hopefully, we can step back and see with some vision. Maybe you call \nit 20/20. Where do we want to be over a period of time?\n  The Senator from Alaska talked about energy. We are doing some things \nwith energy. Here again, I think we ought to be talking about where we \nare and some of the things we want to have happen over time, with less \ndependency on overseas and less dependency on OPEC. At the same time, I \nam sure we want to be certain we have an adequate supply so that we \nwill have a strong economy and so we can do the things we want to do--\nreasonably priced--over the long range.\n  One of the things we experience in my State, an energy-producing \nState, is boom and bust. All of a sudden, natural gas is worth $9 when \nit was $1.5 or $2. Everything goes up all of a sudden. Then the price \ncomes down, and the economy comes down.\n  We want diversity of fuel; we don't want to be dependent on one \nthing.\n  Conservation: Obviously, we need to decide what to do. What do you \nwant over time? We want conservation. Is that too much of a sacrifice? \nCan we do research so that conservation will allow us to use less fuel \nand still have the same kind of services? I think so, with renewables \nand new uses.\n\n  I remember someone talking at an energy meeting in Casper, WY--where \nI live--saying we have never run out of a fuel. I suspect that is true. \nWhat do we do? We find new and better sources or we use them in a \nbetter way. I suspect that is what we ought to be thinking about in \nterms of applying our long-term efforts.\n  What about agriculture? Obviously, we want sufficient food. \nObviously, we would like to be able to supply food to foreign markets. \nWe want clean food and safe food.\n  I think most people would like to see family farmers remain on the \nfarm so we don't become an entirely corporate body. Of course, we want \nto preserve open space. We want to preserve the lands that are being \nused--and farm communities.\n  These are some of the things we really ought to measure against what \nwe are talking about to see if they indeed have the best chance to \nproduce those kinds of visions.\n  Medicare: We want health care for everyone. We want to keep it in the \nprivate sector--at least some of us do. Sometimes that is a different \npoint of view. We want to encourage research. We want to limit \ncatastrophic costs so no one is saddled with unreasonable\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\ncosts; and, of course, control utilization. How do you do that? \nCertainly, each of us has to have a little participation in the cost. \nWe want top-quality care.\n  My time has about expired. I want to make the point that we have some \nopportunities always, but particularly on those three bills. There will \nbe others that will help shape the future. Education, of course, is \nanother one. Where do we want to be over a period of time?\n  I am hopeful that in addition to doing those things--obviously, in \nthe short term--we will also measure what we do and how it will impact \nwhat we give when the time comes for us to deal with it in the future.\n  I think my time has expired. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I want to summarize where we are on the \ncomprehensive energy legislation issue that all of us are interested in \nmoving ahead, and to tell you my perspective on it at this point.\n  As we began the year, we identified two sets of issues. There were \nthe short-term challenges we faced as a country, and then there were \nthe more long-term issues. The short-term challenges included the very \nhigh prices for electricity in California, which I think all of us \nrecognized at that time were not just unreasonable but were exorbitant \nreally for many residents in California. Really, the wholesale prices, \nbeing very high, were not being passed on to consumers at that time, \nalthough the consumer retail prices started to reflect those high \nprices that had been charged for such a long time.\n  Second, of course, natural gas prices were very high. That was a \nconcern.\n  A third short-term concern was the inadequacy of funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. That is the program Congress put \nin place many years ago to help low-income families in this country pay \ntheir utility bills. The demand on that program was so great during \nthis last winter, and even into this spring and early summer, that most \nStates that operate that program, and are dependent on Federal funds to \ndo so, were out of funding. So that was another short-term problem we \nneeded to address.\n  Fortunately, most of these short-term issues have been addressed in \nsome significant way. The price of wholesale power in California has \ncome down, perhaps not as far as it eventually will and should, but it \nhas come down substantially. The price of natural gas has come down. \nAgain, that is not being reflected to the extent it should as yet in \nhome utility bills, but that hopefully will happen quickly, too.\n  As to the LIHEAP program--the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram--we have put $300 million of new funding into the supplemental \nappropriations bill that we sent to the President to try to keep that \nprogram functioning through the rest of this summer.\n  So those are short-term issues we have seen resolved to some extent. \nAnd I feel good about that.\n  There remain, however, a great many long-term challenges that the \ncountry has in dealing with its energy future. Let me mention a few of \nthose because I believe we can work in a bipartisan way to deal with \nthem to help resolve those issues.\n  One, of course, is supply. We do not have assured adequate supply \ngoing forward over the next several years. We need to look at ways to \nincrease supply. One is affordability. We are concerned about the price \nof the various sources of energy: Electricity, natural gas, gasoline at \nthe pump.\n  Efficiency in the use of energy is a major challenge. We have \ntremendous inefficiency in power production in this country. We need to \nfind ways to increase efficiency in that respect. In many cases, two-\nthirds of essentially all the power for fuel going into our power \nplants is lost because of inefficiency in power production.\n\n  I believe we all want less pollution from the burning of fossil \nfuels. I think we have come to recognize that as fossil fuels burn we \ndo have pollution. We need to find ways to diminish that. We need more \ndiversity in our fuel supply. We need to shift to more use of renewable \nenergy, to the extent the technology permits that, and to the extent \nthe cost of producing that renewable energy permits.\n  So we have a great many long-term goals that the country wants to \nachieve. I believe we can do that. I think we can do it in this \nCongress. I think we can do it in this session of this Congress.\n  The President, to his credit, has presented the country with a \nnational energy plan. There has been a lot of criticism of parts of \nthat plan. I share some of that criticism. But I do think the President \nshould receive credit for having made this a priority issue for the \ncountry. He has said this is something he thinks needs to be addressed. \nI agree with that; this is something that needs to be addressed.\n  We need to pass an energy bill addressing these long-term concerns. \nThe House of Representatives is expected to act this week on a major \nenergy bill. There will be substantial controversy about some of the \nprovisions in that bill. And there are, frankly, several provisions in \nthe bill, as it comes to this Chamber, with which I do not agree.\n  I do not agree with the proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to drilling and exploration. I do not think that is a \nsubstantial solution to our problems. I do not believe we should \nproduce legislation to accomplish that, and send it to the President, \neven though he has requested that we do so. So that is one point of \ndisagreement.\n  I hope very much that we will do something significant to improve \nvehicle fuel efficiency. We are always concerned about the growing \ndependence on foreign sources of oil. And those sources are growing. We \nimport a tremendous amount of oil. Most of that goes into the \ntransportation sector, and most of that for cars and light-duty \nvehicles of various kinds. So we need to find ways to increase vehicle \nfuel efficiency. We can do that as well.\n  Let me say there are a great many other challenges we also have. I \nknow time is short. I intend to begin a markup of an energy bill in the \nEnergy Committee this Wednesday. I hope we can move ahead on a \nbipartisan basis. Then we can also set the framework for moving ahead, \nwhen the Congress returns in September, on the balance of a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  This is something that will benefit the country; it is something we \ncan do in the Senate; and we can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I ask if he will \nrespond to a question I have about the energy bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am pleased to respond.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to my friend from New Mexico, I \nwas speaking with Senator Lugar. One of the things that has so \nintrigued me about the legislation you will mark up is that there is a \nsection in the bill that deals with renewables; is that right?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we will have a section in the bill \ndealing with renewable energy production. The one we are marking up \nthis Wednesday deals with research and development and training \nprograms. When we come back in September, we expect to have a section \ndealing with renewable energy production.\n  Mr. REID. There isn't any one answer to the energy problem, is there? \nIt is a combination of solutions that you have talked about, such as \nrenewables. It is going to take a lot of cooperation and partnering to \nbe able to answer the energy needs of this country; is that right?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator, he is exactly \nright. There are a variety of technologies that can help us to meet our\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\nenergy needs. There are a variety of sources for energy production. We \nneed to move ahead on each of them. That is my view.\n  Mr. REID. There is no magic bullet, not one thing that is going to \nsolve all the problems of energy relating to our country's needs; is \nthat true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again, that is certainly my view. There \nis no single solution to the problem. We need to make progress on \nincreased energy supplies from a great many sources. We need to make \nprogress on more efficiency in various ways. Clearly, we need to do a \nbetter job of conserving the energy we do produce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8378-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, unfortunately, the Senator from New \nMexico, chairman of the Energy Committee, is not in the Chamber now. I \nhad hoped to be able to pose a question to him.\n  That question would have been regarding his comment indicating he was \nopposed to opening ANWR. He did not give a reason why, nor did he have \nto. I hope we will have an opportunity on this particular issue to have \na good debate, a debate that evaluates the issue in its entirety.\n  One of the things I keep referring to, with which the occupant of the \nChair has some familiarity, is the unique circumstances surrounding a \nvery small number of aboriginal residents of the north slope, the \nresidents of Kaktovik. Their particular plight lends itself to some \nconsideration by this body.\n  I don't think I will have the opportunity of using the charts, but I \ncan probably show this better if one of the gentlemen will go back and \nI can get them to show the actual ownership in the 1002 area of the \n92,000 acres of land that is owned by these aboriginal people.\n  This is the historical land of their birthright. It is their village \nland. As a consequence of the manner in which the Federal Government \nchose the structure of management of the 1002 area and the surrounding \narea associated within ANWR, we found an enclave of 92,000 acres of \nprivate land that could not be utilized by the villagers who own the \nland.\n  One has to address the propriety of what private land is all about, \nif indeed you can't use it. This particular area is in such a specific \ndirective from Congress that the residents, the owners can't even drill \nfor natural gas to heat their homes, let alone develop any of the \nsubsurface rights for their wherewithal, simply because there is no way \nto access the area without trespassing on Federal land. This doesn't \nseem reasonable or fair.\n  I am sorry to say the charts have gone back to my office. I will have \nto address this matter again with a visual presentation.\n  These are the kinds of considerations that aren't addressed and would \nbe addressed in the proposed legislation to authorize the opening of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Why should this group of Alaska \nEskimos be denied the birthright to resource their land as any other \nAmerican citizen would?\n  This is just one inconsistency associated with this issue. It is a \ntype of issue that would fall on the ears of many in this body who \nbelieve in fairness and equity. That is a factor in the consideration \nof the merits.\n  I am continually confronted with Members who say: I am opposed to it. \nThey are very reluctant to get into a debate as to why. The rationale \nis pretty obvious. There is a lot of pressure from America's \nenvironmental community. America's environmental community has \ngenerated an awful lot of membership and dollars by taking a stand on \nthis issue and laying down a fear that somehow we cannot open this area \nsafely or that somehow it is contrary to traditional use to drill in a \nrefuge.\n  As I have indicated earlier in my presentation today, we have oil and \ngas drilling in 30 refuges in this country. We have 118 refuges where \nthere is actual oil, gas, and minerals. There are over 400 wells in the \nrefuges in Louisiana. We have them in New Mexico. Why is it \ninappropriate to suddenly say we cannot allow drilling in the 1002 \nrefuge area when we have advanced technology? There is no justifiable \nreason other than the pressure that is brought on Members by the \nenvironmental community. That is the kind of debate I hope we can get \ninto.\n\n  I would like to see scientific evidence that suggests, if indeed \nthere is a rationale to support it, that we can't do it correctly; \nscientific evidence to suggest that Prudhoe Bay is not the best oil \nfield in the world in its 30-year old technology; scientific evidence \nto suggest that this won't create literally thousands of new jobs, such \nas 700,000, in the United States. Almost every State in the Union would \nbenefit from this.\n  I would like to hear a debate as to why it is in the interest this \ncountry to become more dependent on the Saddam Husseins of this world. \nThat is what has happened. As we know, 6 weeks ago, we were at 750,000 \nbarrels a day. Today we are a million barrels a day. Are we here to do \nwhat is right for America or are we here to simply respond to the \npressures of America's environmental community as it laments on fear \ntactics that are not based on any scientifically sound research?\n  That is the reality with which we are faced. As we look at what is \nhappening in the House of Representatives this week, they are going to \ntake up the issue.\n  There is going to be a motion to strike ANWR from the energy bill. It \nis kind of amazing to me to see what is happening over there because \norganized labor suddenly has said this is a jobs issue; that we are \nlosing jobs all over the United States. But right now the one item that \nwe can identify that would allow for the creation of thousands of new \njobs is opening this area. So it is an argument as to whether you can \ndo it safely; whether we can protect the Porcupine caribou herd; \nwhether we can get the oil on line soon enough--in 3\\1/2\\ years--or \nwhether it is a substantial supply.\n  As I have indicated, if it is there in the abundance it would have to \nbe to replace what we import from Saudi Arabia in a 3-year period of \ntime, can we do it safely? There is no evidence to suggest that we \ncan't. These are the discussions that we will have. I hope every Member \nwill encourage open debate on this floor on the merits of opening ANWR. \nI have heard people say, ``I would rather this didn't come up'' and ``I \nwould rather we didn't have to vote on this'' and ``it makes me feel \nuncomfortable.''\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\n  We are sent here to do a job, Mr. President; to take tough votes. We \nare sent here to do what is right for America. If what is right for \nAmerica is to increase our dependence on imported oil from Saddam \nHussein, well, that is beyond my interpretation of what is right for \nAmerica.\n  I look at Saddam Hussein as an enemy. He is attempting to shoot down \nour airplanes. We are enforcing a no-fly zone. We continue to do that. \nIt is in our national interest. Why should we be importing more and \nmore oil from him? Oil is fungible. If we spilled oil on the desk of \nthe Presiding Officer, it would spill all over the table. If we buy the \noil from Saddam Hussein today, we could buy oil from OPEC and let \nsomebody else buy Saddam Hussein's oil. That is one way to dodge this \nso-called inconsistent bullet. But we don't seem to be doing it.\n  This Senator is going to--probably on the Jordan bill--bring up an \namendment again to terminate our purchase of oil from Iraq. To me, it \nis absolutely inconsistent that we would depend on that source. It \naddresses our national security. The national security of this country \nshould not be 56-percent dependent on imported oil.\n  One thing that continues to frustrate me a little bit is the \nassumption by many that oil simply comes out of the gas station. You go \ndown there and insert your credit card and fill your tank, and there is \nvery little consideration that somebody has to produce it; that it has \nto be refined; that it has to be transported; and America and the world \nmove on oil.\n  We get complacent and somehow we are concerned about electricity. We \nhave a lot of alternatives for electricity. We have hydro, nuclear, \nnatural gas, and coal. But America moves by oil. We have an opportunity \nto relieve our dependence--not that we are going to eliminate it, but \nwe can relieve it--by coming to America, to my State of Alaska, where \nwe have the technology to do it safely. Again, Mr. President, I will \nkeep this in the perspective of reality. This is a pretty small \nfootprint--about 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres. That is the size \nof the State of South Carolina. That is what we can do with the \ntechnology we have. It is just beyond me that Members fail to want to \ndiscuss the merits. They fail to discuss why we should not do it. They \nare uncomfortable with the issue.\n  Again, that is not why we were sent here. We were sent here to make \nhard decisions and vote in the best interest of America. To me, to \nrelieve our dependence on imported oil addresses specifically our \nnational security interest. It is an issue that is coming before this \nbody. It is going to be before the Energy Committee of which I am the \nranking member.\n\n  I hope Senator Bingaman and I, in that committee, can have spirited \ndebates on the specific merits of why it is not in the interest of the \nUnited States and our national security to relieve our dependence on \nthese increased sources of oil from the cartels of OPEC, to try to \ndevelop sources here at home, keep the jobs at home.\n  Look at the balance of payments--over half of the balance of payments \nis the cost of imported oil. We can reduce that. So why should \nAmerica's labor sources not come to grips with this and begin to lobby \nit, as they are successfully doing? So this issue is an issue that is \ntimely, an issue that should be addressed fully in an extended debate \nbased on science, not emotion. The emotional arguments have prevailed. \nThey have prevailed very strongly because of an organized, extreme \nenvironmental group that fails to recognize that this energy crisis is \nnot going to be solved alone by alternatives, renewables, new \ntechnology, solar, wind.\n  This energy crisis is going to have to be resolved by a balanced \nprocess, where we advance, if you will, funding for these new \ntechnologies, but they alone can't solve the problem. We are going to \nhave to increase clean coal utilization. We are going to have to \naddress what to do with nuclear waste in this country because nuclear \nprovides us with 22 percent of the energy in this Nation. We are going \nto have to recognize that we are now using our natural gas reserves \nfaster than we are finding new ones, and we are going to have to again \naddress the realities associated with the generation of electricity \nfrom our hydro sources, many of which have not been expanded to any \ngreat extent. We are going to need a comprehensive bill, with \ntechnology, alternatives, renewables, but it has to have an increased \nsupply. Otherwise, we will go through what we did in 1992 and we will \nfail. The American people will hold us accountable, as they should.\n  ANWR is not the total answer, by any means, but it is part of the \nsolution to regaining our independence, reducing the vulnerability of \nthis country, and recognizing that these are real jobs to be created \nright here at home. I think my friend brought me a chart relative to \nthe ownership by the Native people of Alaska. I started with this, and \nI think it is appropriate that in the broad scheme of things, the \ninterest of many of the residents is forgotten.\n  This is the 1002 area here. We have a pointer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent for another minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is a million and a half acres of the 1002 area. \nWe have here in white the ownership by the residents of Kaktovik. This \nis 92,000 acres. As you can see, you have no way out. This is all \nFederal land. In the selection of their Native lands when they had the \noriginal village up here, a location that has been there for many \ncenturies, under the land claims legislation, the provision was they \ncould not develop these lands until Congress had made a determination \nspecifically on what to do with this area. Only Congress has the \nauthority to open it up. These residents sit here in an enclave with \nprivate land they cannot develop. They cannot even drill for natural \ngas to heat their homes. That is an injustice. That would be corrected, \namong many other things, by this legislation that we propose in opening \nup ANWR.\n  I thank the Chair for the time allotted me and allowing me to extend \nmy remarks.\n  I tell everybody that I look forward to a very spirited debate with \nenough time so we can get into the meat of this issue. I encourage my \ncolleagues who say, ``I am sorry, I can't support it,'' to start giving \nus reasons why, other than just the rhetoric associated with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8379-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8379-S8391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2001--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The matter before the Senate is the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1246.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the parliamentary situation \nis we are now on the motion to proceed to the agricultural supplemental \nbill. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are on the motion to proceed to the Emergency \nAgricultural Assistance Act of 2001?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The vote on the motion to invoke cloture will take place \nat what time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 5:30 p.m. today there will be a vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. At 5:30 today, for the benefit of all Senators, there \nwill be a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the emergency agricultural assistance bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer for clarifying that.\n  As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will take this \ntime to discuss what is in this bill and why we should proceed to the \nbill and not wait any longer.\n  We have this week to finish, and I understand then the Senate and the \nHouse will be going out for the month of August, at the end of this \nweek. This bill really ought to be done this week. Then we have to go \nto conference with the House, bring the conference report back and send \nit on to the President. I am hopeful we will do that because most of \nthe monies that are provided in this bill, which are allocated by the \nBudget Committee, really do need to get out. The fiscal 2001 funds need \nto\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\nget out prior to September 30. It will take awhile to get the money out \nin September, although I have information that certainly the Department \nof Agriculture can get this money out in the month of September.\n  However, if we have to come back in September to complete action on \nthis bill and then go to conference, back and forth, then there might \nbe a problem. We do have to get this bill done this week, and that is \nwhy I am sorry some in the leadership on the Republican side decided to \nengage in extended debate on the motion to proceed. Otherwise, we would \nbe on the bill right now.\n  In about 3 hours we will invoke cloture and then be on the bill, and \nhopefully we can wrap it up very soon.\n  The need for assistance to America's farmers and ranchers, and the \ncommunities in which they live, is very critical. Without the \nassistance in this bill, tens of thousands of farmers and ranchers are \nin danger of going out of business. This package is designed to do the \nbest we can to address the many problems in agriculture across the \nNation while staying within the limitations of the budget resolution.\n  I want to underscore that. This package is in full compliance with \nthe budget resolution. There are no points of order that will lie \nagainst this bill because it is in accordance with the budget. It is \nfully in accordance with the budget resolution.\n  If we compare today's market situation for the crop sector with what \nit was in the mid-1990s, crop farmers are expected to receive at least \n$16.7 billion less in net income based on both lower farm prices and \nhigher input costs. The help from existing Government payments only \nmakes up about half that gap, leaving a financial shortfall of a little \nover $8.5 billion. That is compared to where it was in the mid-1990s.\n\n  This package we will have, we hope, before us this evening will offer \ndirect payments and other benefits to a range of crop producers, but it \nstill will not make up that entire gap. Even with this package, \nfarmers, in terms of their net income, adjusting for inflation, will \nnot be where they were in the mid-1990s.\n  Farmers are in dire need of assistance. The bill we have before us \nprovides considerably more assistance than the House bill. It is a \nsubstantial package, and it is considerably larger than the House bill.\n  Again, I point out the needs are great and they are urgent. Crop \nprices are low. Production expenses have gone up sharply. Farmers are \nin the classic cost-price squeeze.\n  I do not want to cite all the provisions in the bill, but I would \nlike to mention a few. We have included in the bill funding for the \nfull level of market loss assistance that was provided last year. That \nmeans this bill will provide an additional payment in September at the \nrate of the 1999 Freedom to Farm payment for feed grains, wheat, rice, \nand cotton. That is what it was last year, and it will be the same this \nyear.\n  I want to make it very clear: I am not a big fan of the AMTA payment \nmechanism which is used for the market loss assistance payments. I \nbelieve there are real inequities in that formula, and we must change \nit in the next farm bill.\n  Our staff and I looked very carefully at whether there could be an \nalternative payment mechanism for putting out the assistance before \nSeptember 30 other than the AMTA formula. However, in view of this \nshort timeframe for USDA to get the payments out and some other \nfactors, the best available approach under the circumstances is to use \nthe same market loss payment approach that has been used in recent \nyears.\n  The inequities have been in this since the start of the 1996 farm \nbill, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill. The market loss assistance \npayments were based on the AMTA formula, and basically this formula \nwent back some 20 years to look at what the base acreage was in those \nbasic commodities of feed grains, wheat, cotton, and rice.\n  It was based upon the production pattern at that time and based on a \npercentage of the base acreage, times the established yield, times the \nset price that is in the Freedom to Farm bill, which equaled the \npayment.\n  Here is where the inequity arises: Let us say we were neighboring \nfarmers. My farm was in Northern Iowa and the Presiding Officer's was \nin southern Minnesota, right across the boundary, the same farming. Let \nus say that 20 years ago I decided I was going to put all my land in \ncorn. I was not going to get involved in crop rotations. I just planted \neverything fence row to fence row of corn. So my base got high.\n  The Presiding Officer, on the other hand, decided the best way to \nfarm would be to involve himself in crop rotations, maybe a corn/bean-\ntype rotation, or one involving hay and pasture. He decided it would be \ngood to put in buffer strips or grassed headlands.\n  That was 20 years ago. Let us advance to right now. Let us say now, \nhowever, the Presiding Officer and I are planting the same crop mix of \ncorn and soybeans. We both have the same acreage of corn today, but \nbecause I planted so much 20 years ago and the Presiding Officer did \nnot, I get more money from the Government because of what I did 20 \nyears ago. That is an inequity. Farmers who practiced good crop \nrotations and conservation are penalized. Those that planted continuous \ncorn or another crop get the highest payment. It is not fair.\n\n  We also found other inequities. Some receive market loss assistance \npayments who are not even planting any of the grains--they did 20 years \nago--but because they established their base 20 years ago they can be \ndoing something else entirely, and they are still getting that payment. \nYet another farmer who doesn't have that base history may be receiving \nnothing or very little.\n  The AMTA payment mechanism is inequitable and has been since the \nbeginning. It ought to be changed.\n  In view of the short timeframe we have in getting money out before \nthe end of September, there was no other way to do it. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to change that in the next farm bill.\n  The present farm bill has one more year to run. Before we get to that \nmechanism next year, we should come up with a different mechanism.\n  There are a few other areas of importance. The bill has full funding \nfor soybean and other oil seeds payments at last year's level; also \nmoney for cotton seed and peanut farmers; funding to help the specialty \ncrop producers with assistance for commodity purchases and special \nassistance for apple producers. However, in this bill, the funds for \nspecialty crops in terms of market loss assistance amount to $420 \nmillion. This amount, some say, is a lot. It is nearly identical to the \n$416 million we provided specialty crop producers in crop insurance and \nappropriations bills last year.\n  America's apple growers are experiencing the worst economic losses in \nmore than 70 years, having lost $1.5 billion since 1996, an estimated \n$500 million during the past year alone. Current apple prices, which \nare as low as 40 percent below the cost of production, are driving many \nof our family farmers out of existence. The average prices received by \ngrowers for fresh market apples in March of this year were the lowest \nin more than 10 years, 31 percent below prices in March 1999, 29 \npercent below the 5-year average.\n  Again, apple farmers need some help. Quite frankly, what could be \nmore healthful for our population and especially for our kids in school \nthan an ``apple a day to keep the doctor away,'' as our mothers used to \nsay. We have a commodity that is healthful, helps prevent illness and \ndisease, yet the people who grow them are in serious financial trouble. \nI thought it was important in this bill to provide some help and \nsupport for apple farmers who are in dire straits.\n  We also provide in the bill nutrition-related assistance mainly \nthrough helping provide commodities for schoolchildren, families, and \nseniors in need.\n  The package includes a substantial commitment to agricultural \nconservation. Several of these programs are out of money. This package \nputs much needed funding into the conservation programs. There is \nfunding for technical assistance that allows the Conservation Reserve \nProgram to go forward. It has no money for fiscal 2002 presently. There \nis funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program, and the \nFarmland Protection Program. Basically, it provides four conservation \nprograms with funds. The demand exceeds the amount of funding by a \nfactor of 5 or 6. In other words,\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nthere are five times more applications, applications that are approved, \nfor the Wetlands Reserve Program than we have the money for.\n  Some may ask, why fund them in this bill? The answer is, if we wait \nto fund them until later, several of the programs will lie dormant in \nfiscal year 2002 for several months, at least, pending a new farm bill \nor other legislation. We don't know when that may be completed.\n  Keep in mind, the conservation provisions in the bill reported out of \nour committee constitute only 7 percent of the total package. I don't \nthink that is too much to ask.\n  Many farmers are hurting. Of course, we have the market loss \nassistance payments which I described as inequitable in many cases for \nmany farmers practicing good conservation that don't have a high base. \nThese conservation payments do two things. They help support their \nincome, but it also provides a benefit for everyone in cleaning up our \nwater and our air and saving soil. In that way, it is as much as an \nemergency need to those farmers and to us as the market loss assistance \npayments. Surely we can afford 7 percent of the entire bill to care for \nour land and water and deal with the critical conservation and \nenvironmental challenges in agriculture.\n  For fiscal year 2002, CBO estimates conservation spending will be \nabout 12 percent of USDA mandatory farm program spending. Adding $542 \nmillion, as we have in this bill, to the fiscal year 2002 spending on \nconservation, only raises that share to 13.5 percent. That is a very \nmodest increase at best and still much less than is needed. Even with \nthe money we included, of all of the USDA mandatory farm spending \nprogram, it will only be 13.5 percent next year for conservation.\n  In 1985, I believe about 97 percent of our funding for conservation \nwent to farmers on working lands and 3 percent went to land taken out \nof production. Today, I believe it is about 85 percent that goes for \nland out of production and 15 percent on working lands, overall, of all \nthe conservation funding. What we are trying to do is get that balance \na little bit more oriented to helping farmers actually working the land \nrather than just taking it totally out of production.\n  I strongly believe we have a balanced package, one I hope will \nreceive broad support in the Senate. It has been crafted to address \nneeds across the country, from Florida to Washington State and from \nMaine to New Mexico and California. It has also been crafted to address \nthe needs on both sides of the aisle.\n  I come back to the issue of the budget and spending. We will hear a \nlot of debate about this on the floor this evening and tomorrow. \nHopefully we can wrap up this bill up yet this evening.\n  The budget resolution as adopted by the Congress provides for the \nAgriculture Committee to spend up to $5.5 billion in assistance to \nfarmers in fiscal year 2001, which ends September 30th this year. That \nis what we have done. We have not gone over that. We have put $5.5 \nbillion into the bill for 2001.\n  The Budget Committee also allows the Agriculture Committee to spend \nup to $7.35 billion next year, in fiscal year 2002, starting October \n1st.\n  The Budget Committee did not say to the Agriculture Committee: You \ncan't meet and decide how to spend it until after October 1st. We just \ncannot write legislation that outlays the money before October 1st.\n  Now, a budget point of order would lie if we wanted to take that \n$7.35 billion and move it to before September 30th. We didn't do that. \nAs we all know, we said we will spend the $5.5 billion this year, but \nbecause the needs are great and the fiscal year and the crop year don't \ncoincide, we decided to meet in the committee and determine how to \nspend $2 billion of next year's money next year. So the $2 billion we \ndecided to spend will be spent after October 1 of this year, in fiscal \nyear 2002, and it is in full accordance with what the Budget Committee \nallowed us to do. Again, I point out the Budget Committee did not say \nto the Agriculture Committee: You cannot meet and you cannot decide how \nto spend that money this year. They just said: You cannot obligate it \nuntil after October 1. That is what we did.\n\n  We met. We saw the need, and we said we are going to spend $2 billion \nof that after October 1, which is fully allowed under the budget \nresolution. There is no shifting from one fiscal year into another.\n  I heard it in the committee when we were debating this in the \ncommittee and I have heard other people on the floor refer to the fact \nthat we have gone way over what the budget resolution allowed; the \nbudget resolution allowed us $5.5 billion and we are up to about $7.5 \nbillion in this bill.\n  I will continue to say as often as I can--it looks like I am going to \nhave to say it a lot in the next few hours--we spend $5.5 billion in \nthis year as the budget resolution allows. We spend $2 billion next \nyear as the budget resolution allows. That is all we have done. We have \nthe authority to do that. We are completely within the budget to do \nthat.\n  Again, regarding the use of fiscal year 2002 funds, this package \nsimply reflects the reality of the difference between crop years and \nfiscal years. Most of the cost of farm programs associated with the \ncrops this year, the crop that is in the ground in many of our States \nright now, some are being harvested--in wheat country, for example, \nsome of the smaller grains are being harvested. Up in our area, we have \nnot started yet, but that will happen this fall--but most of the crops \nare in the ground. The impact of the low prices will not really be felt \nuntil next fiscal year, 2002. That is just how farm programs work.\n  I simply cannot see the problem in using some part of the fiscal 2002 \nmoney to help agricultural producers deal with the problems of the 2001 \ncrop year. That is all we have done. We have done it in a way that is \nin accordance with the budget.\n  Again, contrary to some of the arguments, we are not spending up next \nyear's money. We are saving most of it to be spent at a later time. \nWhat we are spending is being used for its intended purpose: to fund \nprograms within the Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction. So we had \n$7.35 billion for the next fiscal year. We have spent in this bill \nbefore us $2 billion of that $7.35 billion. That leaves about $5.35 \nbillion for next year that we can use, either separate and apart by \nitself, or we can fold it into the farm bill if, in fact, we do pass a \nfarm bill later this year.\n  Let's discuss the package before the Senate today compared with what \nwe did last year. In last year's crop insurance bill, there was a farm \nassistance package that included $5.5 billion for fiscal year 2000, \nplus an added $1.64 billion for fiscal year 2001. So the total package \nwe passed last year was about $7.1 billion. This year's package is in \nthat ball park. It is a little bit higher, but really very close to \nwhat we did last year.\n  I just ask the rhetorical question: How could it have been fiscally \nresponsible to provide that level of assistance last year, but it is \nirresponsible to provide that level of assistance this year?\n  When it comes to America's crop producers across the country, their \nsituation has not improved and probably has worsened during the last \nyear. So the need is still there. The package is very similar in size \nto last year. If the situation is every bit as bad as last year, and we \nhave a package of a similar size to last year, I cannot understand any \nobjection to this.\n\n  Again, there is a similarity to last year, but there is also a \ndifference. When we approved a package of over $7 billion last year, we \nhad nothing left over the next year in the budget resolution; that is, \nwe enacted a bill during fiscal year 2000 and we used both fiscal year \n2000 money and fiscal year 2001 money and we left zero dollars for \n2001. That is what happened last year.\n  This year, however, we are spending fiscal year 2001 money, a portion \nof 2002 money, and we will have $5.35 billion left over for next fiscal \nyear, which we did not do last year. So, again, I repeat for emphasis \nsake: We now have $5.5 billion to spend before September 30 on farm \nassistance. We have already that much left for the remainder of fiscal \nyear 2002. So we are, with this package, maintaining a budgetary \nposition for fiscal 2002 very similar to the one we have for this year.\n  Some will say: Should we now be spending the money that could be \nsaved for the new farm bill? First, because of the difference between \ncrop-\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\nyears and fiscal years, spending on the new farm bill will really focus \non fiscal year 2003 and later years, not fiscal year 2002. The farm \nbill we are under right now runs through next year. It runs through \nnext year. So if our committee is going to be fashioning a new farm \nbill, really it is going to be focusing on 2003 and beyond, not for \nfiscal year 2002.\n  So, again, if those who say that $7.35 billion should be left for the \nfarm bill, are they saying that none of it should be spent next year? \nThey are going to put it in 2003? There are a lot of farmers going to \ngo broke next year if that is the case, and we will be in dire straits \nnext year.\n  Again, what we have tried to do is provide a smooth transition from \nthis fiscal year to the next crop-year, and then to the next year \nbeyond that when we will have a new farm bill. Whether the money is \nspent on a new farm bill or not, the objectives are the same: to meet \nthe needs of farm and ranch families and address other priorities of \nfarm policy. There are many farmers in this country who cannot wait for \na new farm bill; they need the help right now. They are struggling to \nhang on. If we can get them some immediate help while saving some funds \nfor the next farm bill, which we are doing, that seems to me to be the \nright thing to do.\n  I want to take a moment to discuss a letter from the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget concerning this legislation. In that \nletter, Mr. Daniels says he will recommend the President not sign a \nbill providing more than $5.5 billion in additional assistance for \ncrop-year 2001.\n  Again, I am not certain how we read this. I read this saying we have \ncomplied with that. We provide no more than $5.5 billion for crop-year \n2001. Even though the letter refers to the 2001 crop-year, I can assume \nthat the letter reflects some confusion between the fiscal year and the \ncrop-year.\n  I just went through all that, the difference between the crop-year \nand a fiscal year. Maybe there was some confusion in that letter. As is \ncommonly done, this bill includes assistance for the current crop-year, \n2001.\n  Some of this money will be spent in fiscal year 2002, but it will \nhelp cover the shortfall to agricultural producers for crops grown in \nthe 2001 crop and calendar year. Again, there is nothing unusual about \nproviding assistance in the next fiscal year for crops that were, in \nfact, grown in an earlier numbered crop or calendar year--that is the \nway farm bills work. The fiscal year ends on September 30. That is not \nwhen the crop-year ends, not in my area. The crop-year doesn't end for \na long time after that. Some crop-years end about that time or before \nthat, in certain parts of the country. So you cannot just base \neverything on when the clock tolls on the end of the fiscal year in \nterms of farm assistance. We do that all the time, provide that \ncarryover.\n  Again, having said that, I want to underscore that this bill is in \nfull compliance with the budget resolution. No budget point of order \nlies against this bill. It is within the prerogative of the Senate to \napprove this legislation. It is within the prerogative of the \nAgriculture Committee to both spend up to $5.5 billion for this fiscal \nyear, and up to $7.35 billion for the next fiscal year.\n  I have to question the justification for Mr. Daniels' threat that he \nwould recommend the President not sign this, and I must also question \nwhether or not they are confusing crop-years and fiscal years.\n  Is Mr. Daniels saying that Congress will not be allowed to deliver \nthe assistance to agriculture that is clearly provided in the budget \nresolution? I am sorry. The White House and OMB have no jurisdiction \nover that.\n  Is Mr. Daniels saying that the promise of assistance to farm \nfamilies, which is clearly contained in the budget resolution, isn't \nworth the paper on which it is written? From everything I am aware of, \nPresident Bush and the White House were on board with the budget \nresolution that was put together by Republican majorities in the Senate \nand the House. That was the budget resolution which provided the \nwherewithal of the tax-writing committee to put through the tax bill.\n  I recall Republican colleagues pointing favorably to the budget \nresolution and agricultural funding when the budget resolution went \nthere also. We are now being told by the White House that the President \nmay not sign it, even though it is fully within the budget resolution.\n  Why? Mr. Daniels simply says $5.5 billion is enough. That is that. \nMaybe it is enough until September 30.\n  But Mr. Daniels ought to go down and sit at some of the kitchen \ntables in the farmhouses and say, OK. Until September 30, and after \nthat you are on your own.\n  There is a lot of assistance that will be needed after September 30. \nThe crop-years don't pay attention to when the fiscal year ends.\n  Tell them that Congress won't be allowed to use the money in the \nbudget resolution until after September 30.\n  Finally, I must point out that Mr. Daniels is wrong to suggest \nfunding is not needed for conservation. I went through that a little \nbit ago. The facts are, if we don't provide this funding, several \nprograms will lie dormant for a number of months before they can be \nfunded again.\n  Again, it is not just payments to farmers for the loss of prices for \ntheir corn, wheat, cotton, rice, apples, and a lot of other \ncommodities--peanuts, cottonseeds, and everything else we have. It is \nalso to help farmers--maybe because of their planting history--who \ndon't get much under the AMTA payments. Yet, they have been good \nstewards. These are good farm families. By providing them some help \nwith conservation funding, we both are able to help them, and we are \nable to help the country as a whole by providing for cleaner water, \ncleaner air, and less soil runoff.\n  This package is substantial, but it is very close to what we had last \nyear in terms of spending. It is very close to what we had last year in \nterms of specialty crops. All in all, this package is not a heck of a \nlot different than what we had last year. It is a little bit more. Last \nyear it was about $7.1 billion. This year it is about $7.5 billion. \nMost of that additional money is going for conservation, which is \nsorely needed around the country.\n  It is a balanced package. It is balanced regionally. It addresses a \nlot of urgent needs. It fits within the budget resolution. I hope we \ncan support it. I am hopeful that any amendments seeking to change it, \nto shift it, or to cut down on the payments will not be successful.\n  Again, I am sorry we had to go through this exercise of filing \ncloture on the motion to proceed. We should be on the bill right now. \nWe have been held up at least 1 day because someone in the Republican \nleadership on the other side decided to filibuster the motion to \nproceed to this emergency farm package. We had to file a cloture \nmotion. At 5:30 today we will vote on the cloture motion on the motion \nto proceed. Again, I am hopeful it will be overwhelmingly approved, and \nthat maybe yet we can even reach some agreement to wrap this bill up \nthis evening. At least that is my desire.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that when we go into a quorum \ncall the time should be divided equally between both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that when we go back into a quorum call the time \nremaining be evenly divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk today about the emergency \nsupplemental bill that will be on the floor dealing with the farm \nproblem we have in this country.\n  I just heard my colleague, Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \ncommittee. I commend him for what he has\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\ndone. I think he made a great statement. I think he has written a good \nbill, and Congress ought to pass it posthaste.\n  It is rather strange that we find ourselves in this position. We are \nin the position of debating the motion to proceed to go to the actual \nbill on the floor of the Senate. Let me say that again. We are debating \nthe motion to proceed. We are debating whether we should proceed to a \nbill to provide emergency help to family farmers.\n  I guess those who are stalling our being able to get to that bill are \nprobably not facing, with respect to their personal income, the \ncircumstances family farmers are facing. Soybeans have recently been at \na 27-year low in price; cotton, a 25-year low; wheat and corn, a 14-\nyear low; rice, an 8-year low. Prices have collapsed as if they had \ndropped off a cliff. They have stayed down for a number of years, only \nrecovering slightly, at times.\n  So family farmers, who are out there in the country and have invested \nsweat and equity in their family farm trying to make a living, have \ndiscovered that their income has completely collapsed. This has \nrequired Congress to try to patch up a bad farm bill with emergency aid \nyear after year after year.\n  We really need to write a better farm bill. I know Senator Harkin, \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee, is leading the effort to do \nthat. I fully support him. In the meantime, we need to provide some \nemergency help. That is what this bill is designed to do. It is called \nan emergency supplemental to try to provide some help to family farms.\n  If one needs more insight into what is happening to our family farms, \none can probably see it in the circumstances described to me by a \nLutheran minister one day this past year. This Lutheran minister works \nin New England, ND, as the pastor of the local Lutheran church. We were \ntalking about the struggle that family farmers are having in our \ncountry, and especially there, which is near my hometown of Regent in \nsouthwestern North Dakota.\n  She said to me: In our little town, where we have a shrinking \npopulation--this is a town of probably 800 people-- we have about 4 \nfunerals for every wedding I conduct as pastor of our church. Four \nfunerals for every wedding--I was thinking to myself about that movie \n``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' This is just the opposite: four \nfunerals for every wedding.\n  What is she saying with that data? What that means is the population \nin those rural areas is getting older. Young people are moving out. \nFamily farmers are shutting down family farms because they can't make \nit, and those economies are just shrinking. The root of all of it is a \nfarm program that does not work. It just isn't able to give families a \nfeeling they can stay on the family farm and make a decent living.\n  We are in this Chamber today on an emergency supplemental bill to try \nto help family farmers. The Senate can move ahead or it does not have \nto move ahead. This is not like milking. If this were a dairy \noperation, come 5:30, if you had 80 cows that were fresh and needed to \nbe milked, you could not sit around the house twiddling your thumbs \nsaying: I don't think I will milk this afternoon. You would have to go \nto the barn and start milking those cows. If it was spring planting \ntime, you wouldn't have the opportunity to say: I won't go spring \nplanting this afternoon. You have to fuel up the tractor and go plant \nsome seeds.\n\n  Farmers understand deadlines. Farmers understand that you need to get \nthings done when it is time to get them done; this Senate ought to as \nwell. Having to debate the motion to proceed is an outrage.\n  Who is stalling here? And why? We ought not have to debate the motion \nto proceed to an emergency supplemental bill to help family farmers. On \nFriday, one of my colleagues on the other side said: I am holding it up \nbecause it costs too much money. I say: You have every right to try to \nreduce the amount of help for family farmers. Let the bill come to the \nfloor and then offer an amendment. If you want to cut it by $2 billion \nor $4 billion, offer that amendment, and then let's have a vote. If \nenough Senators vote with you, you will have cut the amount of help for \nfamily farmers. I am not going to support that, but why would you \nconsider holding up the bill because you have your nose out of joint \nthat it costs too much? If you think it costs too much, then offer an \namendment to decrease it.\n  Let me say this. From my standpoint, I think this investment in \nfamily farms for this country is a bargain. A good deal deserves \nrepeating: I think investing in families who are out there trying to \nmake a living on the family farm is a bargain for this country in that \nI believe it strengthens this country.\n  Europe does not have this kind of internal debate. Europe decided \nlong ago that it wants to maintain a network of family farms across \nEurope. Why? Because it has been hungry. It doesn't want to be hungry \nagain. How does it prevent that? They work to preserve a network of \nfamily farmers living on the land in Europe.\n  Go to a small town in Europe some evening and ask yourself whether \nthat town is alive. It is. Small towns in Europe are alive. They have \nlife because of family farms, which are the blood vessels that flow \ninto those communities, are doing well in Europe.\n  In this country, family farms are flat on their backs, struggling to \nmake a living because prices have collapsed. Has anyone in this Chamber \nwho makes an income had it reduced by 40 percent? That is what family \nfarmers face when they discover that the price for their crop has \ncollapsed. They put the seed in the ground in the spring. They pray \nthat nothing is going to happen to it: no insects, no hail, no \nexcessive rain, but enough rain. They pray that nothing bad is going to \nhappen. Then they harvest it in the fall and they put it on a truck and \ntake it to the elevator, only to be told that in a world that is \nhungry, with 500 million people going to bed every night with an ache \nin their belly because it hurts to be hungry, they are told: Your food \ndoesn't have any value, Mr. Farmer. They wonder about the value \ncontained in that statement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I was across the hall watching the presentation of the \nSenator from North Dakota. I had two questions I wanted to ask him.\n  Did I understand the Senator correctly when I heard him say that the \nSenator from Idaho said he didn't like this bill because it was too \nmuch money, and the Senator from North Dakota responded, if that is the \ncase, let us go ahead and debate the bill and offer an amendment that \nit is too much? Is that what you said?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is what I said. This bill isn't too much money. It \nis within the framework of what we decided as a Congress that we were \ngoing to spend on the budget. It spends the required amount in this \nfiscal year, and then $2 billion in the next fiscal year. It does not \nviolate the budget.\n  The point I was making was that real income for family farmers has \nfallen to the level of the 1930s. This is the real income achieved by \nfarmers out there who are struggling to raise a family and run a farm. \nIt is clearly an emergency. We have clearly brought to the floor \nlegislation that does not violate the Budget Act. Yet even though it is \nan emergency supplemental, we can't get to the bill. We have to debate \ntoday a motion to proceed to the bill.\n  I am outraged by the fact that there is stalling on a bill that \nrepresents a clear response to an emergency in American farm country.\n  Mr. REID. Another question I will ask the Senator from North Dakota: \nNevada is a State that has some agricultural interests. We have a few \ngreen belts, not many. Those we have are very important to the State.\n  Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in North Dakota; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In North Dakota, which is a rural State, agriculture is \n40 percent of the State's economy. It is clearly the 500-pound gorilla \nof economic activity in States such as North Dakota. But it is not just \nNorth Dakota, it is Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, Nebraska, South \nDakota, and Iowa. There is a whole heartland in this country whose \neconomies are supported by agriculture, by family farm producers.\n  Mr. REID. I have served in the House with the Senator from North \nDakota and also in the Senate. It is difficult\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nfor those of us who are not from farm States to comprehend what a \nfamily farm is. I have heard you say on a number of occasions how the \nfamily farms are disappearing.\n  Would this bill, if we don't pass it in a timely fashion, force other \nfamily farmers to go out of business?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is no question that will be the case. There isn't \nany question if we don't provide a bridge, and quickly--between the \ncurrent inadequate farm bill and a new farm bill that tries to provide \na decent safety net and a bridge across price depressions--there isn't \nany question that family farmers in a number of cases around the \ncountry will not be allowed to continue. These are people who are more \nthan just in this for a business. These are people for whom family \nfarming is their life. It is all they know. It is what they do. It is \nwhat they want to do.\n  There is so much value in family farming in a country. Farmers \nproduce much more than just wheat or corn or soybeans. They produce \ncommunities. They produce cultural value. It is a seed bed for family \nvalues that moves from family farm to small towns to big cities. It is \nsuch an enormous contribution to the country. That is why, as I \nmentioned, in Europe they decided long ago that the kind of economy \nthey want is an economy that has healthy family farm agriculture--a \nnetwork of producers living on the land throughout Europe producing \ntheir food. We should make a similar commitment and write a farm bill \nthat does that.\n  In the meantime, this emergency supplemental is the bridge to get \nfrom here to there. I do hope beyond this afternoon we are not further \ndelayed by anyone stalling with what clearly is an emergency piece of \nlegislation designed to reach the extended hand out to say to family \nfarmers that we are here to help during tough times.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I appreciate his \nbringing up the family values that we have in farm States.\n  Our friend, Pat Moynihan, who just left the Senate, used to say that \nto have good scores on tests for students, high school students, you \nshould just move them near the Canadian border, North Dakota, South \nDakota, States along the border, the farm States. The kids do better \nthan anyplace in the country with their tests; is that true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the case. We have some of the highest tests, \neducation tests in the country. It has a lot to do not so much with the \nspecific teachers or the specific schools, but it has to do with the \nfamily values of family farms and small towns and rural life. That is \nnot to denigrate any value that anyone else has. It is simply to say \nthat the kind of family values that spring from a rural State produce \ngood achievement in education.\n  There was a wonderful author who has since died, world-renowned \nauthor, actually grew up in Fargo, ND, and lived in New York and London \nbefore he died. He wrote a number of books. His name was Richard \nCritchfield. He wrote books that described the rolling of family values \nin this country's history in two centuries, the rolling family values \nfrom family farms to small towns to big cities, and the refreshment and \nnurturing of the value system in the country by having that happen.\n  I grew up in a town of 400 people--not quite 400, between 300 and 400 \npeople. We raised livestock and other things. But I understood what \nthose values meant when a fellow named Ernest died of a heart attack \nwith his crop out there needing to be harvested. All the neighbors \nshowed up and harvested the crop. It is like the old barn raising, the \nneighbor-to-neighbor help in which they form communities. Those values \nby which people form communities to help them through tough times are \nvery important values for the country.\n  That is why I came to the floor to talk about this legislation. It is \nmoney to be sure, but that money represents a bridge. There are very \nfew people in the country who have seen a total collapse of their \nincome the way family farmers have. The income for their work and the \nincome for the measure of their effort is down 40 percent, 50 percent \nfrom what it used to be. How many businesses or how many enterprises in \nthis country are getting 1930s level income in real dollars? That is \nwhat is happening to family farmers. It is unfathomable to me that we \nare such a strong country in terms of having this aspiration to build a \nnational missile defense along with all these technologies. We are \ndoing all these things, yet we have 500,000 people who go to bed every \nnight hungry as the dickens.\n  We have this food in such abundant quantity, yet we can't find the \nway to connect the two so that family farmers have a chance to make a \nliving and people who are hungry have an opportunity for a better life. \nThere is something that is not connecting very well in this country on \nthis policy. That is why I want us to write a better farm bill. In the \nmeantime, we must have this bridge to get there. The bridge is this \nbill, an emergency supplemental bill that provides about $5.5 billion \nin this fiscal year, and roughly $2 billion, slightly less, in the next \nfiscal year, to help family farmers over these troubled times.\n  Mr. REID. One last question of the Senator: We know how important \nagriculture is. We are the breadbasket of the world. And it is \nimportant that we do something in this emergency supplemental bill. We \nwere asked by the Chair to withhold. Another bill was brought by the \nHouse of Representatives, the Export Administration Act, which has \npassed the House. All they did was continue the bill that is now in \nexistence, which is also a disaster for the high-tech industry.\n\n  The Senator knows that the high-tech industry has a number of things \nthey need to remain competitive. One is to make sure we pass \nlegislation that modernizes the ability of these high-tech companies to \nexport things that are now sold in Radio Shack that, under present law, \nthey can't do.\n  I want my friend to comment on what he sees happening here in the \nSenate. I reflect back to last year, when we were in the minority, we \npassed by the August recess eight appropriations bills. We have now \npassed three because, as you know, they have been slow-walking the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and we hope we are fortunate enough \nto get the VA-HUD bill. We must do something on this emergency bill \nthat we are now trying to get before the Senate on agriculture. We also \nneed to do the Export Administration Act. I think my friend will agree \nthat it will allow the high-tech industry to stop exporting jobs \noverseas and do them here so they can manufacture equipment here, sell \nit overseas, and not have to move their businesses overseas to \nmanufacture equipment over there. But we are not going to be able to do \nthat, it appears. It looks as if the House is satisfied with extending \nthe act that is already in existence, which the industry says doesn't \ndo us any good at all.\n  Will my friend comment on what is happening in the Senate with these \nthings?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada, I think, knows the answer to \nthis question. Not very much is happening in the Senate, regrettably. \nWe have a large amount to do, yet this place has been slowed down. Last \nweek, it was sort of a parade-in-rest all week because people didn't \nwant the Senate to get its work done. Trying to get something done in \nthe Senate is like trying to walk through wet cement. It is pretty hard \ngoing. It is not as if there is not a lot to do and there are not a lot \nof pieces of legislation that need doing now.\n  The emergency supplemental to help family farmers passed the House, \nout of the Agriculture Committee. But are we on the bill? No. Why? \nBecause we are debating a motion to proceed. What is going on here, \nwhen we have to debate the motion to proceed to deal with an emergency \nbill to help family farmers?\n  There can't be a lot of thinking going on about this. Senator Daschle \nis trying to create an agenda that says let's get our work done and get \nit done soon. Everybody ought to have the opportunity for full debate. \nFor nearly 2 days last week, this Senate sat in session with nobody \ncoming over to offer substantive amendments, but an objection to going \nto third reading to pass the Transportation bill. Essentially, the \nSenate was shut down. We have all these things to do, and we have so \nmuch ahead of us, yet people think it is somehow to their advantage to \nslow this place down.\n  The Senate has never been accused of speeding, in the first place. \nThis is a deliberate body, the place where we deliberate for long \nperiods of time. There\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\nis no excuse under any condition to force us to have to debate a motion \nto proceed. That is unthinkable, in my view.\n  In addition, when we get this done, we have to finish the Department \nof Transportation bill, the VA-HUD and independent agencies bill; and \nif we get all that done, we will still come up far short of what we \nneed to do. It is not because Senator Daschle has not said here is what \nwe need to do, it is because we have some people sitting on the back \nseat of this bicycle built for two and putting the brakes on. All we \nwant is a little cooperation.\n  The Senator asks me what is happening here in the Senate. \nRegrettably, not much. This afternoon, nothing. We are debating the \nmotion to proceed on an emergency bill. I have never seen the likes of \nthis.\n  So my hope is that those who are stalling, those who are holding this \nup will come to the floor and say, all right, we won't hold it up \nanymore. Let's go have our votes and get these pieces of legislation \npassed. The Senate can do better than this.\n  Mr. President, I reserve time for others who want to speak on this \nbill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in due course we will be debating a very \nimportant bill for American agriculture. As the distinguished chairman \nof our committee, Senator Harkin, has pointed out, the needs of farmers \nthroughout our country are evident to most Senators. In fact, all \nSenators, I suspect, share an empathy for attempting to do what we can \nto help.\n  I want to take these moments, before we get into the substance of the \ndebate, to describe the problem as I see it; the reason the Ag \nCommittee and the Senate and our compatriots in the House of \nRepresentatives have taken this up.\n  To begin with, however, I simply want to make a comment with regard \nto the colloquy I heard in the Chamber a short time ago suggesting \ndelay with regard to the agriculture situation. The comments of our \ndistinguished colleagues really related to more than agriculture, and \nother bills certainly have a different track, but in the case of this \nsupplemental bill to help American farmers, the House of \nRepresentatives passed legislation on June 26. It was not until July 25 \nthat legislation came before our Agriculture Committee. There was \nalmost a month intervening.\n  I do not charge delay. There are many things in the lives of \nSenators, many activities in the life of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, but I simply point out that at any time from June 26 on we \ncould have acted, even if we were to adopt, for example, the House \nbill, obviating a conference, and to move on to assist farmers within \nthis fiscal year.\n  As the distinguished majority leader pointed out last Friday evening \nat the termination of debate, there is a technical problem of cutting \nthe checks physically and getting the money to farmers by September 30, \nand that is one reason that the urgency of this bill is apparent to \nmost of us. My own guess is as we approach the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed at 5:30 this evening, there will be surely almost a \nunanimous vote, if not a unanimous vote, to proceed. I think we all \nunderstand that.\n  To suggest on our side we have been delaying action for agriculture \nwould be inaccurate. Perhaps that was not even implied. Putting that \naside, the fact is we have had packages of this variety now for the \nlast 3 years.\n  I just want to review, for the benefit of Senators as well as for the \nAmerican people, some of the assumptions behind these supplemental \npackages that arrive at this point in time or sometimes even earlier in \nthe year.\n  Essentially, we had a very good year in American agriculture in 1996. \nFor a variety of reasons, a lot of income that may have been delayed by \nevents in the world and other circumstances that led to very strong \nexport markets led to a net farm income in 1996 of $54.9 billion.\n  If we look at the year before in 1995, it was only $37 billion. An \naverage of those 2 years would lead to something between $45 billion \nand $46 billion. Nevertheless, in 1996, often mentioned in debates \nbecause it was an extraordinary year, it was also the year we passed a \nfarm bill. The thoughts are perhaps we were carried away by the \neuphoria of that situation. I doubt whether anyone was carried away, \nbut nevertheless it was a good year.\n  Generally, the years came into something else. In 1997, net farm \nincome was $48.6 billion, down well over $6 billion really from the \nprevious year; then in 1998, $44.7 billion; and in 1999, $43.4 billion.\n\n  In those last 2 years, the $44.7 and the $43.4 billion, these figures \nwould have been lower still except for the fact we plugged in some \nincome, a supplemental bill just like the one we are discussing now. \nThose monies brought things to about a $45 billion level.\n  We can ask, why $45 billion? Because that seemed to be a general \naverage. Those observing the debate should say: Are we saying this is a \nplus-$45 billion, American agriculture made $45 million? I am saying \nthat. This was always a plus, never a deficit. In no year was there a \nnet farm loss. It was always a net farm gain, and it was substantial.\n  As we started this particular year, as a matter of fact, even the \nlatest estimate by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is that without \naction by this body the net farm income in 2001 would be $42.4 billion. \nThat is roughly the same figure the Budget Committees of the Senate and \nthe House had earlier in the year when they had an extended budget \ndebate. They knew that somewhere in the $41 billion to $42 billion \nlevel net farm income would come out about that way for 2001.\n  They knew we had taken action in the past to bring things up \nsomewhere in the $45 billion area, comparable to the years before. We \ndid not quite succeed in 1999 at $43.4 billion, but we did succeed in \n2000 at $45.3 billion.\n  They came to a figure by their deliberations in debate in the Budget \nCommittee that $5.5 billion was about the right size to plug the gap. \nIf this, in fact, were adopted, the $42.4 billion estimated plus the \n$5.5 billion should come out somewhere around $47.9 billion. That would \nbe about $2.5 billion more than 2000. It would turn out, in effect, to \nbe about $4.5 billion more than 1999. As a matter of fact, it would be \nvery close to the $48.6 billion in 1997, really exceeded only by the \nbanner year of 1996 which, if averaged with the year before that, came \nout somewhere in the $45 billion to $46 billion level.\n  Americans outside of agriculture looking into this would say: Is this \ndone for people in the electronics industry or retail stores generally \nin America, or struggling manufacturing firms, or anybody? The answer \nis: No, there is no other business in America that takes a look at net \nincome for the whole group of people doing it, every entity collected \nin these figures, and says we want to make you whole, at least whole at \na level of a multiyear picture.\n  This is the only situation of that sort. It is not by chance. Those \nof us who are involved in farming, and I have been one of them--my \nfamily has been involved for generations. I think it is fair to say \nthat in terms of the truth and being upfront about this bill and this \nadvocacy. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and \nhis family have a farm in Iowa. When he served on the Agriculture \nCommittee, he and I, I believe were the only two involved in these farm \nprograms to keep the books, to make the marketing decisions, to either \nhave to borrow money and repay it or distribute whatever profits there \nare to our family members. This bill is one that my farm, 604 acres in \nMarion County, IN, will have to live with, or benefit from, as the case \nmay be.\n\n  I understand intimately what these figures mean. I am not an advocate \nfor clients or just trying to do good for the farmers I have met in my \nStates. I am one of them, a member of the Farm Bureau, a regular at \nwhatever meeting farmers call.\n  I am sympathetic with the thought that if we are truly interested in \nfamily farmers, in retaining farmers in agriculture, we ought to move \non this legislation. I will vote for cloture so we\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\ncan proceed. I will try to work with my distinguished friend, Tom \nHarkin, chairman of our committee, to come to a constructive result in \nthis debate. It is important. It is timely.\n  Having said that, it is also unique. What has occurred in the \nevolution of the current farm bill is a quest on the part of the Senate \nand the House and the President to save every family farmer, every \nsingle entity in American agriculture. That is the purpose of filling \nthe gap, of making certain net farm income stays at a level comparable \nto years before.\n  To a great extent we have succeeded. One of the interesting aspects \nof the same agricultural report that has net farm income is a \ndiscussion of farm equity. By that, I mean the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has pulled together the total assets of all of American \nagriculture and the total liabilities and has come to a conclusion in \nthis year of 2001. As it stands, total farm equity, net worth, all the \nfarms in America, will be $954 billion. That will be up from $941 \nbillion in 2000. That was higher than $940 billion in 1999, or $912 \nbillion in 1998, or $887 billion in 1997, or $848 billion clear back in \nthe golden year of 1996. In fact, the annual increase in the equity of \nAmerican agriculture has been 3.2 percent over the period of 1995 to \nthe year 2000.\n  If one asked, how can that be, given the stories of failing farms, of \ndesperate people all over our country, how is it conceivable that given \na whole group of farmers, whatever they are doing, in livestock or \ngrain or the specialty crops, so far there has been a gain in equity. \nThis is true in large part because through our policies, through the \nsupplemental bills, we have almost guaranteed an income for agriculture \nin America, and at a fairly high level.\n  One of the dilemmas of this is because of this prosperity--and I say \nthat advisedly, at a 3.2-percent increase in equity over the course of \ntime; in fact, the land prices in that same period have risen on \naverage of 4.6 percent a year countrywide--there is not a region of the \ncountry that did not have an overall percentage change in land values \nthat was positive between 1996 and the year 2000--every single part of \nour country, some a little stronger than others. I note, for example, \nstrangely enough, in the Appalachian region, a 6.3-percent gain in land \nvalues on an annual basis throughout that period of time. In the Lake \nStates, an 8-percent change. In the Northeast, only a 2.8-percent \nchange in agricultural lands. But everyone gained.\n  The dilemma, having said that, and this is why I coupled these two \nfigures--net farm income, roughly $45 billion on an average; net worth \nof American agriculture, about $954 billion, more or less--if you take \nthose figures, you come out with a figure of roughly 4.5 to 5 percent \nas the return on invested capital, the invested capital being the net \nworth, the equity, the net income being the 45, and maybe this year 48 \nas it turns out.\n\n  When I have talked to farm bureau meetings, on occasion the question \nhas arisen: Lugar, what kind of return do you get on your farm? Why are \nyou still involved in this? I have recited that over the 45 years I \nhave managed our farm, 1956 to the present, we have had roughly a net \ngain on worth of 4 percent a year on the value of the farm. We have not \nalways gotten 4 percent every year, but nevertheless we made money in \nall 45 years, and the average return has been 4 percent.\n  Many say that sounds a little too high to me; I have not been getting \n4 percent. I said, we have been fortunate, perhaps. That is not out of \nline with what appears to be the case with American agriculture across \nthe board--apparently, a return on net worth of about 4.5 to 5 percent.\n  Outside of agriculture meetings, people say, well, something is \nmissing; you could have gotten 6 or 7 percent on 30-year Treasury bonds \nthroughout this whole period of time and not taken any risk with regard \nto the weather, exports, or the vagaries of Congress or whatever else \nmight have happened. That is true. In fact, for most people involved in \ninvestment, a return over a long period of time of 4 to 5 percent does \nnot appear to be particularly attractive. That is why we are always \nlikely to have agricultural debates with regard to money.\n  The difficult secret of this is the business does not pay very much. \nIf you are an entrepreneur and you want to go into electronics or into \na dot-com situation or whatever venture capital has taken a look at in \nrecent years, the odds are you looked for a much more attractive rate \nof making your money grow faster.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I plead guilty to 45 years of staying with \nthis because I like it. That is why people farm. They want to do it. \nThey love the land. They love the lifestyle. They have some reverence \nfor their dads, their grandfathers, the people involved in it. They \nwant to save it, perpetuate that. We know that in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee or the House Agriculture Committee. That is why \nwe have the debates without apology and we try to make certain that \nheritage might flow.\n  All of these debates have to have some proportion to them. I started \nout by pointing out a $5.5 billion supplemental will elevate income \nthis year somewhere into the $47, $48 billion net as opposed to the $45 \nwe were aiming at. There is no magic about 5.5. The Budget Committee \nmust have gone backward and forward on that subject for some time. But \nit gets the job done.\n  I conclude this particular thought by saying the Agriculture \nCommittee of the Senate came forward with a package of expenditures \nthat exceeds $7.4 billion. The distinguished chairman of the committee, \nI am certain, will have more to say as to how the components were put \ntogether. Let me just say from my own experience, not from his--he will \nhave to explain how it happened this year--but as chairman of the \ncommittee for the previous 6 years, I was responsible for at least \nthree of these situations. Essentially, you visit with members of the \ncommittee. They make suggestions for what ought to be a part of the \npackage.\n\n  When we started these packages we were dealing with the traditions of \nagricultural farm bills which dealt with so-called program crops, \nprograms that have gone on for a long time, since the 1930s and \nFranklin Roosevelt. The big four in this respect were corn and wheat \nand cotton and rice. They were programs because, in the 1930s, my dad \nand others were asked to destroy crops and hogs. At least that occurred \non our farm. This was supply management with a vengeance. It was not \njust planning for the future, it was actual destruction of crops, and \nrows that were in the fields, and actual livestock at that point.\n  The philosophy was if you let farmers plant as much as they wanted to \nplant, inevitably they would plant too much. They simply would use \ntheir ingenuity, their land, their resources, and we would have an \noversupply and depression of prices. Prices were very low during the \nbeginning of the New Deal period. So the thought was supply management, \nbut a program would come along with that. In other words, you became a \nmember of the program. You worked so many acres, whatever the quantity \nwas that you were dealing with, in return for assurance of payments, \ntherefore a sustenance of your income. There is no reason why this \nshould have gone on for over 60 years, but it did. It was an attractive \nidea.\n  In 1996, with this farm bill, we changed and we fulfilled perhaps the \nworst fears of those in the 1930s because we said Freedom to Farm means \nfreedom to plant whatever you want to on your land; use those resources \nwith your own ingenuity. A lot of farmers did. They made a variety of \nchoices. By and large, less wheat has been planted in some years, more \nsoybeans have been planted. That seemed to meet, really, world market \nconditions. People have been planting soybeans in different States more \nthan they had been before. I suppose that may be true of cotton, but by \nand large, less cotton, seemingly, has been produced and perhaps less \nrice. It is a close call because these are large farms and there are \nfixed costs and many people have continued on, whether it was a program \nor not.\n  When we talked about our supplemental payments, when we began to plug \nthese gaps, we went to the program crops because they have behind them \na list of farmers, names and addresses, people who are part of the \npicture. If you are attempting to get money to people rapidly, checks \ncould be cut to people who were known, with a name and address and a \nquantity behind their name in terms of planting expectations and \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\n  Some have come to the fore this year, and to some extent last year--\nreally, I think, for the first time. They said: What about us? We are \nnot in a program crop. As a matter of fact, we plant so-called \nspecialty crops. We have melons, we have apples on trees, we have \nstrawberries and raspberries--and we have problems. If you think people \nin rice country have problems, you ought to see our problems.\n  In the old days--and by that I mean, say, the last 10 years--\nessentially many of those problems were met by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. The appropriations subcommittee came along at \na time of year in which the weather disasters of the winter or spring \nor much of the summer, sometimes, were apparent. They made an appeal to \nthe Senate. They said there has been very bad luck in this State or \nthis district or with this crop and therefore we ought to do something \nabout it in an emergency, compassionate sense. Each of us have been \nvoting for these programs for years. I cannot recall those pleas being \nrejected.\n\n  But the so-called specialty situations were enveloped in this. Why? \nBecause it was very difficult to find out the crop histories of people \nwho were involved in melons, for example, or in raspberries. Is there \nanywhere a 5-year idea or any idea of support payments or so forth? The \nanswer in most cases was no. This means, if you get into melons, the \nUSDA has to formulate a new program. It has to determine who really is \neligible. That takes time.\n  We found that out last year. We had a supplemental. It came along as \na part of legislation to strengthen and reform the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program. That was not totally inadvertent. Agriculture \nusually has sort of one shot on the floor each year and we had been \nworking on crop insurance reform for some time. It was contentious all \nby itself, among various groups, as well as the total amount.\n  Senators, I think, have been advised--they probably understand--that \nthe crop insurance program we strengthened as a result of last year's \nlegislation is a generous one. It was a safety net. It will probably \ncost an average of $2.9 to $3 billion. That is not a supplemental, it \nis just there. It will go on permanently.\n  I would say from personal experience, I have purchased the 85-percent \nlevel of insurance coverage on the income of my corn and on my \nsoybeans. Many people in Indiana, I have found, have not gone to the 85 \npercent because either they have not discovered it or they do not \nreally understand why that is such a good deal. But I would say \narithmetically this is a remarkable way of ensuring income, even \nwithout the supplemental.\n  Without getting into an advertisement for crop insurance, \nnevertheless it is there, and it is important, but not everybody in the \nSenate sought crop insurance as a priority item. They understood the \npleas of those of us from the Midwest and the plains States. They saw \nsome of the difficulties in the South with the program crops. But they \nsaid we are from New England--for example. Or we are from States which \nhave never been involved in program crops. What are you going to do for \nus?\n  As a result, we had, in addition to crop insurance, the supplemental. \nThe supplemental last year included, for the first time, a number of \ncrops at least that I do not recall being a part of these emergency \nactions before. As predicted, the checks went out right on time to the \nso-called AMTA payment recipients--the program crop people. That is \nquite a number, probably a majority of farmers in our country, in terms \nof income and acreage. So that was not inconsequential.\n  We have had testimony, as the Chair knows, in our committee, the Ag \nCommittee, from farmers who said the check got there just in time. So \ndid the country banker testify that it got there in time. The farmer \nmet the banker, repaid the planting loan, was in business again to try \nagain in the year 2001. What seemed to be a potential crisis was \nalleviated just in time. But with the rest of the group who were not \nprogram people, the checks did not come quite so fast. USDA really had \nto work out the details of a good number of complex programs.\n  As a matter of fact, in February, March, even April of this year, \nthose qualified were finally being identified. Weeks later, in some \ncases, the checks finally came that were being sent to them. In many \ncases, that is being cited with regard to the bill we passed in the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n\n  There is a large component, once again, either in the bill for which \nthe distinguished chairman from Iowa and I were present, which was \nadopted 12-9 in the committee, or in the amendment that I offered, \nwhich had a $5.5 billion limit, which was rejected by this 12-9 vote. \nBoth of us had a fairly large component of that in the so-called \nprogram crops. In large part, if we are talking about money being \ndispensed in this calendar year, this is about the only group of people \nlikely to see a check because they can be identified as they were the \nyear before and the year before that.\n  In the event people come along then and suggest there are other \nsituations, this means they spill over. This is a part of the debate \nover the additional $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Some would say that is \nall the spillover from the year before because they were busy \nattempting to do these things. This year the Budget Committee of the \nSenate mentioned $5.5 billion. The Office of Management and Budget, \nthrough its Director, Mr. Daniels, more pointedly mentioned $5.5 \nbillion in his correspondence with the House committee. Who took that \nseriously? The distinguished chairman of the committee offered a \npackage of $6.5 billion, but the members of the committee, led, as it \nturned out, by the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Stenholm, from \nTexas and Mr. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, and others reversed that \ndecision. They came out at $5.5 billion, and the House, as a whole, \nadopted that without rigorous dissent.\n  All of this could have been adopted by the Senate a month ago. But it \nwas not adopted. A month has transpired in the meanwhile, and in the \nsame way that I collected sentiments a year ago, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee has collected those sentiments again this \nyear. They add up to $7.4 billion. There is no magic in that figure, \nand one would say no magic in the $5.5 billion. The whole exercise was \nattempting to plug a gap between the $42.4 billion in net farm income \nthat was estimated this year and the $45 billion average we have \nachieved in recent years. The $5.5 billion will get us there. It gets \nup close to $48 billion, as a matter of fact. The Director of the OMB, \nMr. Daniels, has written that. He pointed out, and he even offered some \ncharts in his letter to the chairman of the committee, to me, to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, to the ranking member, to Senator \nDaschle, and to Senator Lott. To the extent we have shared that \ncorrespondence with Members, they know the argument of the \nadministration.\n  We could say after all that the administration has their view and we \nhave ours. Honest people can differ. We are all trying to do the best \nwe can for agriculture.\n  I made the comment--it has been repeated in the press--about our \npublic deliberations the other day in the Agriculture Committee. Is it \nreally the intent of our committee of the Senate to taunt the \nPresident, and say, Mr. President, regardless of what you and your OMB \nDirector and others may have to say about this, we want to do more than \nyou want to do? We really feel more deeply about the farmers than you \ndo. So, by golly, even though it is pretty clear that all of this may \nlead to zero at the end of the trail, we are going to have a go at it. \nWe really do not believe you will veto it. We think when it comes to \nagriculture that your heart is in the right place. So is that of the \nAmerican people generally. So whether the figure is $5.5 billion, $6.1 \nbillion, or $7.1 billion, maybe, for all I know, in conference there \nwill be a larger figure. That is the way these things go. They never \nhave too much discipline or form to them. They just sort of add up so \nyou can get enough people on board to get a majority, and hopefully, in \nfact, the big majority. Maybe that was the intent, but I doubt it. I \nthink the intent of our committee in the Senate and the House committee \nis, in fact, to get money to farmers by September 30 so that they will \nhave successful meetings with the country bankers; so that our intent \nthat no family farm should fail will, in fact, happen and they, in \nfact, stay\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\nalive and stay in business even in difficult times.\n\n  Meanwhile, both Houses think about larger farm bills which may go on \nfor many years. The House of Representatives' committee acted on one \nlast Friday, which was a significant bill. The House will still need to \ndebate that. Obviously, our debate lies ahead.\n  These are important times not to be confused with the supplemental \nbill that we have at the present for emergency activity for money to be \ndispensed by September 30. But I take the time of the Chair and my \ncolleagues this afternoon to recite all of this to give at least, as I \nsee it, some background for this enterprise, why we are involved in it \nat all, to what extent the effects are, if you add up the figures, and \nwhat I perceive to be the dynamics of the political situation, if there \nis one in this.\n  My hope is that at the end of the debate--I hope we will have one, \nand, as I indicated when I started, I will certainly vote for cloture \non the motion to proceed so we can proceed--the leaders will formulate \na program for that process. I am hopeful that I will be recognized \nfairly early in the debate to offer what I believe to be a constructive \namendment that I think will lead to rapid resolution and reconciliation \nwith the House of Representatives and some hope for farmers out there \nthat this is not going to be an interesting debate among Senators but \nrather a kickoff of activity in a week that some Senators characterize \nas the fairly slow beginning given the urgency of a number of topics \nthat we need to discuss.\n  I am optimistic as always. I am sure the Chair shares that optimism \nand desire for constructive activity. During this rather calm hiatus \nbefore the debate really begins, technically, as the Chair knows, we \nare discussing really whether to proceed. I come out in favor of that. \nI hope my colleagues will, too. But, after we have proceeded, we need \nto have at least some framework I believe of how to manage this \nsituation. I look forward to those hours ahead and a constructive \nresult.\n  I do not see other Senators. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to address the Agriculture \nsupplemental assistance bill and to answer some of the critics I have \nheard from the other side with respect to this legislation.\n  As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I follow the budget \nissues very closely and have the responsibility for determining if a \nbudget point of order exists against any legislation. We have heard \nfrom a number of our colleagues that the legislation before us somehow \nbusts the budget. That is just wrong. That is not true. This \nlegislation does not bust the budget. It is entirely in keeping with \nthe budget resolution. There is no budget point of order that exists \nagainst this bill. Those are all facts.\n  Mr. President, if we look at the legislation before us, it provides \n$5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001. That is exactly what is provided for \nin the budget resolution. In fiscal year 2002, this legislation \nprovides $1.9 billion. The committee is actually authorized $7.35 \nbillion. So there still remains $5.45 billion available to the \ncommittee, available to the Congress, next year.\n  Mr. President, the fact is, this legislation is entirely in keeping \nwith the budget resolution. There is no budget point of order against \nit. This does not bust the budget, this is in keeping with the budget. \nThose are the facts. I challenge anyone who has a different view to \ncome out here and raise a budget point of order against this \nlegislation. If they really believe what they have been saying, come \nout here and raise a budget point of order against this bill because \nthere is no budget point of order--none. This bill is entirely within \nthe budget resolution. It is entirely within the budget, and there is \nno budget point of order against this bill.\n  Mr. President, if one has any questions about the design of this \nbill, I suggest they go to the resolution on the budget that was passed \nhere in the Congress. This is the conference report. This is what came \nout of the conference between the House and the Senate in the final \nbudget resolution. When you go to the part of that report that deals \nwith the issue before us, it says--and I have highlighted it--it says:\n  It is assumed that the additional funds for 2001 and 2002 will \naddress low-income concerns in the agriculture sector today.\n  Not in the sweet by and by--today. That is what this bill does. It \ndeals with the collapse of farm income that is happening today. I must \nsay, when I hear some colleagues stand on the floor and say things are \ngetting better in agriculture, I don't know what agriculture they are \ntalking about. Maybe they are taking about Argentina or China. They are \nnot talking about America because if you ask the American farmer what \nis happening today, they will tell you what is happening is a \ndisaster--a disaster of collapsing incomes that threatens to force tens \nof thousands of farm families off of the land. That is what is \nhappening.\n  This idea that somehow prices are escalating dramatically and all of \na sudden there are good times ahead is just plain wrong. What are they \ntalking about? They aren't talking about agriculture in my State. Go to \nthe grain elevator in North Dakota and see what wheat is selling for. \nHas it gone up a little bit? Yes, it has gone up a little bit. Is it \nanywhere close to the cost of production? No. I mean, it is almost \nfarcical. Have prices gone up a little? Yes, they have. Are they still \nso far underwater you can't possibly make a farm operation add up? \nAbsolutely. We all know it is true, any of us who represents \nagricultural America; and I must say the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, the Senator from Minnesota, knows exactly what I am talking \nabout.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, has had a chance to go town \nto town, community to community, farm to farm, and he knows what I am \nsaying is true because farmers all across the Dakotas, across \nMinnesota, tell us the same thing: These are as tough a times as they \nhave ever faced. They tell us weekend after weekend, break period after \nbreak period: If you guys don't do something in Washington, we are all \ngoing to go bust. We are going to be broke. We are going to be forced \noff the land because this doesn't add up.\n  When you look at the cost of the things that they buy versus the \nprices they get when they sell, there is no way of making it add up. \nThat is what this bill is about. This bill is to provide emergency \nassistance for farmers who are struggling. It does it just in line with \nwhat the budget resolution called for.\n\n       It is assumed that the additional funds for 2001 and 2002 \n     will address low-income concerns in the agricultural sector \n     today.\n\n  That is the wording of the budget resolution. It goes on to say:\n\n       Fiscal year 2003 monies may be made available for 2002 crop \n     year support.\n\n  That is a very important thing to understand. Why is it that we have \na circumstance in which in this bill we pass in 2001, that we not only \ndeal with 2001 expenditures, but we also deal with 2002 expenditures? \nWhy do we do that? Very simply because there is a difference between \nthe fiscal year and a crop-year. Every farmer knows it. Every member of \nthe Agriculture Committee knows it. Others may not know it. So it is \neasier to confuse the circumstance. But we have always, in every \ndisaster bill since I have been a Member of this body--and I am in my \nfifteenth year--when we have dealt with an agricultural disaster, some \nof the assistance comes from one fiscal year and some comes in the next \nfiscal year because that is the way crop-years work. Crop-years don't \njust neatly fall in the same fiscal year. That isn't the way it works.\n  When there is a disaster, it doesn't just have an effect until \nSeptember 30 of a year. That is when our Federal fiscal year ends. It \naffects before September 30. That is why we have some money in fiscal \n2001, and some of it has an effect after September 30, as harvest is \ncompleted, and that is why we have some of the money in fiscal 2002.\n  Lest anybody have any misunderstanding, that is exactly what the \nbudget resolution recognizes. It says it about as clearly as it can be \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\n\n       Fiscal year 2003 monies may be made available for 2002 crop \n     year support.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing with 2002 and 2001. Some of the \nmoney is in Federal fiscal year 2001; some is in Federal fiscal year \n2002, just as you would anticipate. That is exactly what this \nlegislation provides.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to go back to the fundamental and basic \npoint for any of our colleagues who are listening and wondering about \nthe critiques they have heard. Is it true that this busts the budget? \nAbsolutely not. The budget says $5.5 billion is available to the \nAgriculture Committee under their allocation. And the funding that is \nprovided in this assistance package for fiscal year 2001 is $5.5 \nbillion--exactly what is provided for in the budget. For fiscal year \n2002, the Agriculture Committee has been allocated $7.35 billion.\n  This legislation, quite appropriately, uses $1.9 billion of that \namount. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what is being done here. \nIt does not bust the budget. It does not add $2 billion to the overall \ncost of the agricultural budget that has been provided for in the next \n2 years. It does not add one thin dime to what was provided for in the \nbudget resolution. It does not add a penny to what was provided for in \nthe budget resolution. It is exactly what the budget resolution calls \nfor: $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001.\n  This costs $5.5 billion. In 2002, the budget resolution provides \n$7.35 billion. Of that, $1.9 billion is used, leaving $5.45 billion \nnext year. That is not going to be a problem.\n  Why is it not going to be a problem? Very simply, because of the \ndifference between fiscal years and crop years. We are going to have a \nvery short period of time that has to be covered in the next fiscal \nyear because of the difference between a fiscal year and a crop year \nand the fact that we are writing a new Federal farm bill.\n  It is very clear in the budget resolution, for anybody who bothers to \nread it: ``Fiscal year 2003 monies may be made available for 2002 crop \nyear support.'' By doing what we are doing, using the money allocated \nfor 2001 as provided for in the budget resolution and using some of the \nmoney that is available in 2002 for 2002, with the anticipation we can \nuse 2003 fiscal year money to deal with the 2002 crop year, that is \nexactly what is being done in this legislation. No harm, no foul. That \nis exactly what we have here. There is no harm. There is no foul.\n  This is completely in keeping with the budget resolution. There is no \nbudget point of order against this legislation. If anybody challenges \nthat, they have an opportunity. They can come out and raise a budget \npoint of order and see what the Parliamentarian says. The \nParliamentarian will tell them there is no budget point of order \nagainst this bill--none, zero--because it is entirely in keeping with \nthe budget resolution.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concerns about this \nAgricultural supplemental appropriations bill. I believe reaching \nforward into next year to spend an additional $2 billion is fiscally \nirresponsible and, frankly, unnecessary. Even though some of that $2 \nbillion in additional spending will benefit farmers in my State, I do \nnot believe at a time when we are debating issues of great importance--\nMedicare prescription drugs, Social Security, other issues such as \nthat, where we are going to be needing resources to solve those \nproblems--reaching forward to next year, when we are going to be doing \na farm bill next year, to allocate those resources is the wise course \nto take.\n  I do not want you to take my word for it. We have just received a \nStatement of Administration Policy about this legislation. I want to \nquote from it:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 1246 as reported by \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry because \n     spending authorized by the bill would exceed $5.5 billion, \n     the amount provided in the budget resolution and the amount \n     adopted by the House. If S. 1246 is presented to the \n     President at a level higher than $5.5 billion, the \n     President's senior advisers will recommend he veto the bill.\n\n  We are about to engage here in a motion to proceed. If this scenario \nplays out, with the objections that I intend to have to this bill and I \nknow others on this side will have, we will not get around in any way, \nshape, or form to final passage of this bill until Friday, Saturday, \nsometime Sunday.\n  It can all go away. From my perspective, it can all go away. If we \nstop this overreaching and get back to the budget number of $5.5 \nbillion and we get to the House number of $5.5 billion, we can pass a \nbill here and, I hope, in a relatively expeditious time. Certainly from \nmy perspective I will not have objections to moving forward. There may \nbe amendments offered, and I certainly want to reserve my right to \nobject if there are amendments offered, but the idea we are going to \nspend all week here, probably past the time the House of \nRepresentatives will even be in session, and pass a bill that the House \nwill not even be here to deal with--it may not even get to the \nPresident--and we get no ag assistance at this point in time is \nirresponsible. To overreach to the point we get nothing at a time when \ncertainly there are some ag needs out there, that is, in my view, an \nirresponsible action.\n  I am hopeful with this word from the President, with I think a very \nstrong conviction of many of us on this side of the aisle that this \nadditional spending is not only unnecessary but unwise, we can get this \nbill done in a rapid, orderly fashion and get it done to a level that \nhas been approved by the Budget Committee and the authorizing committee \nand move forward and get ag assistance out before the House of \nRepresentatives leaves and get a bill that will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  If we go to the $7.5 billion level, I tell you we will be here all \nweek. We will be here past the time the House of Representatives will \nbe in session. And it will be met with a veto by the President.\n  I am willing to do that. But we are not going to get any ag \nassistance to people anytime soon if we do that.\n\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I am sorry the Senator \nis still not a member of the Agriculture Committee. He was a very \nvaluable member.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am sorry, too. It is the cost of leadership on our \nside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry he is not there because he comes from a very \nimportant agricultural State.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I have tried to make it clear, \nagain, this Agriculture Committee, in accordance with the budget, spent \n$5.5 billion this fiscal year, before September 30. The Budget \nCommittee allows the Agriculture Committee to spend up to $7.35 billion \nin fiscal year 2002, which begins on October 1. There are no \ninstructions in the Budget Committee that say we cannot meet until \nafter that to decide how to spend that $7.35 billion.\n  There is no reaching forward. There is no moving money from one \nfiscal year to another, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania. This \ncommittee recognized that fiscal years and crop-years do not coincide. \nSo what the committee did, because of the press of business, what is \nhappening this fall, since we don't know when the next farm bill is \ngoing to be done, and in accordance with the budget resolution, was to \nobligate $2 billion of the $7.35 billion for next year to be spent in \n2002. So the money is coming out of the $7.35 billion for fiscal year \n2002. It is not being forward funded. There is no moving money from one \nfiscal year to the other. It was just a recognition that many of the \nproblems that farmers face this fall, in November or December or \nJanuary, are the result of the crop-year that came before it and the \ncrop-years and the fiscal years do not coincide on the same date. I \njust say that to my friend.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  A couple of comments:\n  No. 1, the President's advisers have advised the President to veto \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\nbecause of the obligation of this 2002 money and this additional $2 \nbillion of obligations. We received this a few minutes ago. I will read \nit to you again.\n\n       The administration strongly opposes S. 1246 as reported by \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n     because spending authorized by the bill would exceed $5.5 \n     billion, the amount provided in the budget resolution and the \n     amount adopted by the House. If S. 1246 is presented to the \n     President at a level higher than $5.5 billion, the \n     President's senior advisers will recommend that he veto the \n     bill.\n\n  I understand the idea of reaching forward and obligating money. The \nproblem I have is we are now obligating money that is going to start to \nbe spent October 1.\n  I have been around here long enough to know that we will be here next \nyear, and we will have another emergency. And the $5 billion left over \nisn't going to be enough and we will either try to bump that up or \nreach for the next year and try to draw out some money.\n  If I can have assurances that this isn't just a continual practice--\nwhich I know it will be, if we allow this to occur and we will just in \na sense begin reaching more and more into the following year to make up \nfor it in this crop-year. That is not what the Budget Committee \nsuggested. They said we want $5.5 billion. If we have a farm bill \ncoming up next year, we have authorization for $7.3 billion, let's go \nthrough the working process of doing that in the fiscal year in which \nwe intend to do it. But to reach and grab, if you want to obligate, why \nnot obligate the whole $7.3 billion, if there is no big deal about it. \nThe fact is, we have a responsibility under the farm bill to change \nfarm policy. Use that $7.3 billion to implement that change. There will \nbe some changes, as I am sure the Senator knows, in farm policy. What \nwe have done now is to limit our ability to make that happen. I do not \nthink that is wise. Whether I think it is wise or not is somewhat \nrelevant in this body, but what is more relevant is the fact that the \nPresident's advisers will recommend that he veto this bill.\n  If we don't get aid to the farm country right now in this fiscal \nyear, the best course of business is to scale this bill back and put \nthe $5.5 billion out to the farm country. We either adopt the House \nbill or we pass $5.5 billion here in conference. There may be some \npolicy differences that we may want to work out. That is the best way \nto do it.\n  There would be much more cooperation from many of us on this side of \nthe aisle who would like to see some agricultural assistance. If I \ncould read further from the Statement of Administration Policy, it \nsays:\n\n       The budget resolution provides $5.5 billion for 2001, an \n     amount that the Administration strongly believes is more than \n     adequate for this crop year. Moreover, improvements in \n     agricultural markets and stronger livestock and crop prices \n     means that the need for additional federal assistance \n     continues to diminish. An additional $5.5 billion in federal \n     assistance will boast expected real U.S. farm net-cash income \n     to $53.6 billion in 1996 dollars, a level of income \n     significantly above the previous two years.\n\n  Having been on the Agriculture Committee, I remember when we had this \ndiscussion. Our objective was to keep net-cash farm income at the 1996 \nlevel of $45 billion.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa if he remembers that also. But the number \nwe had always targeted was $45 billion in net-cash farm income.\n  Here we are with this supplemental at $53.6 billion. We are talking \nabout 20 percent above what we thought was the projected level of \nincome that we wanted to set as a floor. Now above that we want to \nthrow on another $2 billion.\n  All I am asking is when is enough enough? I think $5.5 billion is \nmore than generous. It is not the way I would want to spend it. That is \nwhy I hope we can maybe do some amendments to this bill. Almost 99 \npercent of the $5.5 billion is spent this year on AMTA payments. I \nunderstand that is an easy way to get out the money. But it isn't \nnecessarily a regionally fair way to get out the money.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont. The Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania consider agriculture pretty important to our \nStates. It is the No. 1 industry in my State. It is either No. 1 or No. \n2 in his State. But I will guarantee that the level of AMTA payments in \nour State is probably a third or less of what it is in Iowa, and \ncertainly North Dakota and a lot of other Midwestern row-crop States. \nPutting all of that money in AMTA doesn't help us much. It doesn't help \nthe Senator from Vermont or the Senator from Pennsylvania. It doesn't \nhelp the Senator from Massachusetts or anybody else who has farmers who \naren't in the big row crops.\n  I suggest that we step back and try to put together a bill that is \nregionally fair and that meets the budget target we set out. Then we \ncan get a bill that I think can pass in a bipartisan fashion that will \nbe signed by this President and really do something about the need in \nsome areas of farm country to help stabilize that economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to have a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to, again, respond to my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania and to a Statement of Administration Policy that we \nhave just received. It is not from the President. I don't really know \nwhat to make of this letter. It said they opposed the bill that we have \nbefore us because spending authorized by the bill would exceed $5.5 \nbillion, the amount provided in the budget resolution and the amount \nadopted by the House. It is the amount adopted by the House, but it is \nnot the amount provided in the budget resolution. The budget resolution \nprovided two amounts: $5.5 billion this year and $7.35 billion next \nyear. We stayed within the $5.5 billion for this year. Then we had \n$7.35 billion for next year.\n  The administration is saying we can't spend what the budget \nresolution provides. The administration has nothing to do with this. \nThis is something that is internal to the Congress.\n  If we are meeting our budget obligations, why should the \nadministration care? Evidently, the administration must be opposed to \nhow we are spending the money. How are we spending the money? In the \nnext fiscal year we are spending money on a lot of our specialty crops \nsuch as apples.\n  I mentioned in my earlier talk about how our apple farmers are being \nhurt. We heard that the livestock sector is rebounding. But that \ndoesn't mean the crop sector is rebounding. Far from it. We have \nspecialty crops in peas and lentils. I mentioned apples. We have a lot \nof other specialty crops that are in dire need of assistance all over \nthis country.\n  This bill is much fairer region to region than the House bill. The \nHouse bill focused on a few crops but not on the entire country. That \nis why I do not understand the administration's objection to this. They \nsay the bill provides funding for a number of programs that have \nnothing to do with farmers' 2001 incomes. It sure as heck does. Ask all \nthe apple farmers in Washington State, in Maine, in Pennsylvania, in \nNew York, and in Massachusetts. It has a lot to do with the 2001 \nincome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is recognized for 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to address the point of the \nSenator from Iowa. At least three components of this bill have nothing \nto do with farm income. One establishes a scientific research unit in \nUSDA. It provides additional funding for business and industry. It \nprovides that U.S. cities with populations not exceeding 50,000 will be \neligible for guaranteed community facility costs.\n  That has nothing to do with emergency farm income this year. This is \njust another vehicle to try to do some more agricultural authorization. \nI am\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nnot against doing agricultural authorization. I loved being on the \nAgriculture Committee. But we should do it in a farm bill and not in an \nemergency supplemental bill for agriculture. No. 2, the fact is, I \nthink the Senator has received letters from the White House and \nprevious administrations where they said: Senior advisers will \nrecommend that the President veto the bill. Unfortunately, we get those \nall too often around here.\n\n  I think it is very clear that the President and his advisers do not \nlike the way this bill was constructed and would prefer to see us live \nwithin the requirements of the budget agreement for the year 2001. I \nthink we can do that, and we should do that. It is the only way I \nbelieve we will actually get a bill done this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 102, S. 1246, a bill to respond to \n     the continuing economic crisis adversely affecting American \n     farmers:\n         Tom Harkin, Harry Reid, Jon S.

Madam President, let me thank the distinguished ranking \nmember and the chairman for their excellent work in getting the Senate \nto this point. I appreciate very much Senator Lugar's interest in \npursuing this amendment. We will have a good debate on it. We don't \nknow how long the debate will last, but we will certainly leave it to \nhim to make some decision in that regard tomorrow morning.\n  Tomorrow is Tuesday. We have 4 days within which to do a tremendous \namount of work. I ask the cooperation of all of our colleagues. We need \nto finish this bill, and that will entail, of course, working through \nsome very difficult questions not only with regard to the level of \nfunding but also perhaps the dairy issue and other questions about \nwhich I know Senators are concerned. We also have to finish the \nTransportation bill, and of course, the Export Administration Act \nexpires in August. The distinguished Presiding Officer addressed that \npoint last week. We would like to do HUD-VA. There is a lot to be done.\n  Tomorrow night our Republican colleagues have an event and we will \nattempt to accommodate that event tomorrow night. I appreciate very \nmuch the minority leader's cooperation in allowing us to move to the \nbill as quickly as we have. That will at least accelerate the \nopportunity for debate and hopefully allow us to address some of these \nquestions as quickly as possible. It will be a busy week.\n  I will say now, so there is no surprise if we are not finished at \nleast with the Export Administration Act, the Transportation bill and \nthe Agriculture supplemental bill by Friday, we will need the weekend \nand we will need additional days. That is an unfortunate but certainly \naccurate statement. I am hopeful that will not be necessary, but I want \nSenators who have traveling plans to take that into account because \nthis work must be done.

This weekend, the New York Times Sunday edition had a \nfront\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\npage story on a proposal by two Members of the House of Representatives \nconcerning the future of Social Security. It is an interesting proposal \nbecause the two, Jim Kolbe of Arizona and Charlie Stenholm of Texas, a \nRepublican and Democrat, support the notion of privatizing Social \nSecurity, giving people an opportunity to invest some part of their \nSocial Security payroll deduction into some sort of private account.\n  It is interesting that the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal for privatization \nis the first complete package I have seen because in that package they \nhave to tell you how they will pay for it. If they want to take 2 \npercent of the payroll deduction and put it into a private investment, \nit will have a dramatic impact. Two percent does not sound like much, \nbut it turns out to be a substantial portion of the amount that is \ndedicated to Social Security. Since Social Security is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem, if you are going to dedicate the 2 percent to private \ninvestment, you run the risk, or at least have the opportunity to take \na look at a lot of other things that need to be done in order to \nachieve this 2-percent privatization investment.\n  When you look at the Kolbe and Stenholm proposal and Social Security, \na number of things come out very clearly. In order to achieve this \nprivatization, they are calling for an increase in the payroll tax for \nSocial Security, a reduction in the benefits paid for Social Security, \nan acceleration of the age of 67 years for retirement under Social \nSecurity, and a variety of other changes, which means that the Social \nSecurity system as we know it will be dramatically changed.\n\n  Some critics of the Democrats have said even though you are critical \nof this commission on Social Security, you have to accept the reality \nthat Social Security is not going to last forever. That is true. Left \nuntouched, Social Security is going to run out of funds. There is no \ndoubt about it.\n  The report that was given by the President's commission suggests that \nSocial Security would run out of funds in the year 2016. That is not \naccurate. The right year is 2038. The obvious question is, Should we be \nconcerned today about a system that will run out of funds 37 years from \nnow? I think the answer is yes. The answer is obvious because there are \npeople paying into Social Security today who will need that system 37 \nyears from now, and we should be making changes that we can \nrealistically make, honestly make, that will save Social Security to \nmake certain that it has a longer life.\n  Each of those changes will involve some pain. There is no doubt about \nit. But to make those changes today in anticipation of 2038 is a lot \nmore sensible and I think would be more reasonable in terms of its \napproach. It is painful, too, I might add, politically. But to couple \nthose changes to save and prolong Social Security with this idea of \nprivatization is what forces my colleagues in the House, Mr. Kolbe and \nMr. Stenholm, to make some drastic changes. They are, as I said, \nraising the payroll tax on Social Security, reducing the benefits paid, \nsaying to people they cannot claim their Social Security benefits until \nthey reach the age of 67--at an earlier date, I might add --and \nreducing the cost-of-living adjustment which is given each year under \nSocial Security.\n  I think what we need to do to go at this honestly is to separate the \ntwo issues. We should say to the American people: We are going to set a \ngoal for the life of Social Security. We want to make certain it is \nadequately funded and solvent for so many years to come. Right now it \nis to the year 2038. The question is, What do we want to prolong it \nto--2057, 2058? What would it be? Pick that date, and then say to both \nthe President's commission and those who would come at it from a \ndifferent perspective: Tell us what you think it would take for us to \nmake sure that Social Security is solvent that extra 20 years. Maybe \nthat is our goal, 20 years beyond its current solvency. Then have each \nside make their proposal of what it would take to reach that.\n  Then if some want to come in and add the option of privatization of \nSocial Security, let them also explain how they would pay for that. \nWhere I think the President has made a mistake is creating a commission \nwhich is not designed and created to give a longer life to Social \nSecurity but is designed instead to create an item on the political \nagenda of privatization of Social Security.\n  It comes down to this as well. There is a difference of opinion as to \nwhat Social Security is all about. Some view it much like a retirement \nfund or an investment plan. It certainly has characteristics of that. \nBut more than that, it is an insurance policy. It is known as the \nsocial insurance policy for Americans. That puts it in a different \nperspective. We pay premiums throughout our life for basic insurance. \nIf we live to be 65, so long as we are alive, that payment, of course, \ngives us the safety net we need in our retirement. Some, though, think \nit should be viewed as a retirement fund. There have been times when \nyou can make more money in the stock market than the Social Security \nfund has made, and in that respect they are asking for the \nprivatization of the system. I think we ought to take care.\n\n  As appealing as it may be for us to consider the possibility of \nprivatization, you run the very real risk, if the stock market takes a \ndownturn at the time you want to retire, that everything you have saved \nfor is not there when you need it. So the insurance policy aspect of \nthat would be something you would welcome at that moment. Instead, you \nhave been caught in a bad investment.\n  Many American families, probably most who are listening and following \nthis debate, have had in the last year a bad experience in the stock \nmarket. There was a terrific good-time roll in our economy for about 9 \nor 10 years with the creation of 22 million new jobs, new housing \nstarts, new businesses, low inflation, a dramatic increase in the Dow \nJones index, and a great increase in personal savings from people who \nwere putting money away for retirement. Then at the beginning of last \nyear, a correction started to take place which we are still living \nthrough. During that correction, the retirement investment of a lot of \npeople diminished. So if they were counting on this increase in the \nvalue of their investment because of the growing stock market, then \nthey have had a rude awakening over the last year.\n  What if this were all that you had? What if you had made your \ninvestment in your fund for retirement, the private investment of your \nSocial Security funds, and the day came for your retirement and you \nwere caught at a bad moment on the stock market, when things were low? \nThat sort of thing worries me because this safety net is very basic. It \nis tough for a person to survive just on Social Security. To take even \na small part of it and to put it into private investment is to run the \nrisk that, while it may increase in value, it may decrease as well.\n  So I think the President's commission starts with a false assertion \nabout the Social Security trust, its funds, and its solvency. But it \nalso starts with the premise that you have to privatize it as part of \ngiving a longer life to Social Security. My challenge to the commission \nand to those as well who do not agree with privatization, including \nmyself, is to come up with a proposal to give a longer life to Social \nSecurity and put it on the table and say to the American people: This \nis what we need to do to give a longer life to Social Security. Let the \nPresident's commission do the same thing. Then, for those who want to \nprivatize, want to take more money out of Social Security, let them \nthen tell you what the add-on cost would be for privatization. Then \nlet's make the political judgment.\n  Today we are in this swirl of misinformation, some of it coming from \nthe commission and some of it coming from outside sources. There are \nsome people, of course, who have never liked Social Security. They \ncalled it socialism when Franklin Roosevelt came up with this idea. But \nI think we would all agree--at least I hope we would--that it has been \nthe single most successful social program in America, giving a lot of \nsenior citizens an opportunity they would never have otherwise to \nretire with dignity and to have a life with their families, to live for \na long time without fear they were going to be dependent on their \nchildren or the Government for some sort of dole or handout. I think \nthis generation has to meet its obligation for the future of Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\n  I concede changes must be made. The Democrats and Republicans should \ncome together to make those changes. I think when we take a look at the \nadd-on cost of privatization as Congressman Kolbe and Congressman \nStenholm say, and find out what it will cost in terms of reducing \nbenefits and raising payroll taxes on Social Security, that it will be \nquickly rejected. I hope we will do this in an honest and bipartisan \nfashion and that we address it very quickly. It is never an easy issue \nto address, but it is certainly one we have an obligation to address as \nquickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on July 30, 1619, in the church at \nJamestown, VA, the colonial Governor of Virginia, George Yeardley, \ncalled into session a meeting of twenty-two citizens called burgesses, \nfrom each of the eleven boroughs subdivisions, of colonial Virginia.\n  According to one of the participants, Mr. John Pory, ``all the \nBurgesses took their places . . . till a prayer was said by Mr. Burke, \nthe minister,'' who asked God to ``guide and sanctify'' the \n``proceedings to his own glory.''\n  The Speaker then addressed the members of the assembly on their \nduties as participants. ``Our intent,'' wrote Mr. Pory, was ``to \nestablish one equal and uniforme kinde of government over all \nVirginia.''\n  Thus began, 382 years ago this very day, the first representative, \nlegislative body in American history, the Virginia House of Burgesses.\n  I do find it ironic that today, when there is so much talk about \nseparation of church and state, that the very first legislative \nassembly in American history took place in a church. It seems very \nfitting that the legislative foundations of the world's greatest power, \nand the world's foremost proponent of liberty and, I might add, \nreligious freedom began in a church.\n  What a momentous day July 30, 1619 was, not only in American history, \nbut also in world history. Right there in that little church in \nJamestown, VA, a colony still struggling to survive, a colony that had \nbeen decimated by plagues, disease, hunger, and war, a significant step \nwas taken in the development of representative government.\n  Think about it, even with all the problems of simply staying alive, \nthese men, driven by that eternal desire to be free and to rule \nthemselves, to be free of the control of kings, emperors, czars, and \nother autocrats, had the intellect and the foresight to meet in that \nchurch and begin a journey that would eventually lead to the \nestablishment of our republic.\n  Independence was still more than 150 years away, but the seeds of \nAmerican democratic thought had been sown. It is probably no \ncoincidence that from the House of Burgesses would come some of the \nmost important champions of American liberty and greatest leaders of \nthe American Revolution, including Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, \nJohn Marshall, and Patrick Henry.\n  For this reason, I want to recognize this very important, if \noverlooked, day in our American heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8393-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

A 23-year-old man was near death from head \ninjuries suffered in an attack by members of a Seattle gang known as \nthe United Blood Nation. The attackers had been targeting gay couples \nduring the night.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance.

Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nan outstanding group of young people from my home State of South \nDakota. These fourteen extraordinary students were recently honored \nwith the Congressional Gold Award, a prestigious award given to a very \nselect group of dedicated young people from throughout the Nation.\n  The Congressional Award program was established by Congress in 1979 \nto recognize the initiative, achievement, and service of extraordinary \nyoung people from across the Nation. The Award was signed into law by \nPresident Jimmy Carter, and each president since Carter has renewed the \nauthorizing legislation.\n  To qualify for the Congressional Gold Award, an individual aged 14 to \n23 must complete at least 800 hours of goal-oriented work in four \nprogram areas: Volunteer Public Service, Personal Development, Physical \nFitness, and Expedition/Exploration. These program areas emphasize each \nperson's capacity to grow and develop as an individual, as well as how \neach person can selflessly contribute to the happiness and well-being \nof their community.\n  South Dakota Congressional Gold Award recipients chose to volunteer \ntheir time and talents in many different areas, where they made \ntremendous contributions. One recipient volunteered at the Veterans \nAffairs hospital in Ft. Meade, SD. Some awardees became mentors or Girl \nScout leaders, while others volunteered at childcare centers, athletic \nassociations, local schools, parks, and even in the South Dakota State \nPenitentiary. One individual actually established an annual volksmarch \nin their hometown.\n  For their outstanding commitment to physical fitness, personal \ndevelopment, exploration, and for committing their hearts and hands to \nvolunteering in their communities, I would like to congratulate the \nfollowing young South Dakotans for receiving the Congressional Gold \nAward: Kary Bullock of Ashton; Eric Davies of Whitewood; Nicole Hammer, \nJanelle Stahl, Kayla Stahl, and Michelle Jilek of Mellette; Ryun \nHaugaard and Norman Haugaard II of Milbank; Carrie Larson and Jessica \nLarson of Mitchell; Alexsis Malsam of Aberdeen; Andrea McComsey and \nTracey Smith of Conde; and Betsy Valnes of Sioux Falls.\n  I thank these outstanding young people for their immeasurable \ncontributions to their communities, the State of South Dakota, and our \nNation. It is because of individuals like these that I have great faith \nin the continued success and prosperity of our great Nation. These \nindividuals truly serve as an example for all young Americans.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8394-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n                            DR. CAROLYN REED\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nCarolyn Reed, director of the Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina. The Post and Courier newspaper in \nCharleston, SC recently published a profile of Dr. Reed in a special \nRemarkable Women section. I have the great pleasure of working with Dr. \nReed and can attest to the remarkable job she has done since taking the \nreins as director last year. She is a talented and compassionate \nsurgeon and effective administrator who easily blends these two roles \nin mapping the Cancer Center's future. Her commitment to offer all \nSouth Carolinians state-of-the-art cancer care is unwavering.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n\n            [From the Post and Courier (SC), July 25, 2001]\n\n                    Surgeon Is Head of Cancer Center\n\n                           (By Dottie Ashley)\n\n       You might think a pall would hang in the air when you enter \n     the office of Dr. Carolyn Reed. She must deal daily with \n     deadly disease in her dual roles as thoracic surgeon and \n     director of the Hollings Cancer Center at MUSC.\n       But, instead, you can't help but smile.\n       Occupying one shelf, alongside a volume titled ``Thoracic \n     Oncology,'' is a large green jar with the words ``Male \n     Sensitivity Pills'' printed on the label.\n       ``I doubt if that endears me to my male colleagues,'' says \n     Reed with a laugh. Wearing her white doctor's coat over a \n     lilac blouse, she buzzes around the office, filling it with \n     energy and optimism, even when she is viewing results from \n     radiology that reveal a patient has lung cancer.\n       The surgeon, now 50, who won a thoracic surgical oncology \n     fellowship to the venerable Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer \n     Center, doesn't beat around the bush.\n       She's a straight-talking Maine Yankee, and, on this \n     morning, speaking firmly into the telephone to a colleague, \n     says, ``This is absurd; the system is making us do \n     unnecessary procedures.''\n       Accustomed to changing the system and cracking glass \n     ceilings, Reed is one of 4,000 practicing cardio-thoracic \n     surgeons in the United States, of which only 2 percent are \n     female.\n       And she is the only female thoracic surgeon practicing in \n     South Carolina, according to state figures.\n       Although Reed, who is single, has cut back to a degree on \n     the number of surgeries she performs since taking over as \n     director of the Hollings Cancer Center last August, she is \n     still very involved with her first love. She worries that \n     more women don't enter the thoracic surgery arena.\n       ``It's true more women are getting into medicine, but not \n     really into surgery and especially thoracic surgery,'' she \n     says, noting that when she graduated from the University of \n     Rochester School of Medicine in 1977, only 10 percent of \n     those in medical school residencies were women. Today, that \n     figure is close to 50 percent. But she points out that only \n     about 5 percent of the residents-in-training in the field of \n     thoracic surgery are women.\n       ``It's clearly a male-dominated field,'' she says. ``For \n     example, I use the nurses' locker room at MUSC because there \n     is no locker room for female surgeons. But it doesn't bother \n     me a bit because I respect nurses and view them as \n     colleagues, not as handmaidens.''\n       ``The Heart is an Organ To Pump Blood to the Esophagus'' \n     are the words mounted on a plaque in Reed's office, \n     indicative of her fascination with the chest portion of the \n     human body.\n       ``I perform operations involving lung and esophageal \n     cancer,'' says Reed, who assumed the position of professor of \n     surgery at MUSC in 1985.\n       Always interested in science when attending high school in \n     rural Maine, Reed became aware of the devastating effects of \n     cancer when her father died of the disease when only in his \n     40s. At the time, she was a freshman at the University of \n     Maine, where she graduated in 1972 as valedictorian of the \n     class.\n       She then went on to the University of Rochester School of \n     Medicine, where she received her medical degree in 1977, \n     graduating with honors and distinction in research.\n       However, after working in research with her mentor who was \n     a specialist in leukemia, she learned that she vastly \n     preferred to work with patients than in a lab.\n       ``I love my patients,'' she says. ``It has been said that \n     doctors should keep a professional distance, but many of my \n     patients have become my friends. The day that I don't cry in \n     my car on the way home when I have lost a patient is the day \n     I will quit.''\n       And in the past, she encountered some who encouraged her to \n     quit.\n       When she was a resident in general surgery in 1982 at New \n     York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York City, Reed \n     was told by the center's leading teaching surgeon: ``Women \n     only belong in the kitchen and the bedroom.''\n       ``Do you think I liked operating with him after hearing \n     that?'' she asked rhetorically. ``I told him I didn't agree \n     with him, but then I went right ahead and learned every \n     single thing I could from him, because he was a brilliant \n     man.\n       ``And I think I eventually earned his respect because I \n     ended up being the chief resident that year.''\n       She also faced other adversities: When she first arrived at \n     New York Hospital, someone referred to her as ``that poor \n     intern,'' and she learned that was because normally the \n     thoracic surgery floor has two interns, but this time it \n     would have only one. She was expected to work every night, \n     often going two nights straight without sleep.\n       But the only time she almost gave up was when she had \n     returned to New York Hospital for two years of cardio-\n     thoracic surgery after working at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. \n     ``I lived across the street from the hospital where they had \n     apartments for the staff, and after i had worked two days \n     without sleep, I was finally sleeping in my scrubs. At 2 a.m. \n     the phone rang. I had to get over there. When I ran out into \n     that empty street I was crying because I thought I just can't \n     do it. I just can't.\n       ``But then I did it, and I saw what you can do when you are \n     dedicated, when you really love what you do. And to see the \n     immediate, positive results of surgery is my favorite thing \n     in the world,'' she says on this rainy morning as she \n     prepares to operate once more, hoping to give one more cancer \n     patient a chance at life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8394-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8394-S8395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AARP'S CELEBRATION OF MEDICARE'S 36TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join AARP, \nincluding South Dakota's nearly 85,000 members, today to celebrate the \n36th anniversary of the Medicare program.\n  I want to applaud the efforts of Don Vogt, Deb Fleming, and all the \nvolunteers of South Dakota AARP for the work they do in South Dakota \nand those AARP staff and volunteers around the country that provide \nimportant assistance to their over 34 million members nationwide.\n  As long as we are celebrating important dates in history, I want to \nalso recognize and celebrate the 43rd anniversary of AARP this year. \nSince its inception, AARP has had a vision, ``to excel as a dynamic \npresence in every community, shaping and enriching the experience of \naging for each member and for society.'' I think we can all agree that \ntoday's celebration is an example of making this vision a reality.\n  Most of us here today can remember what life was like prior to the \nMedicare program. While some people may reflect on the good old days of \nhousecalls and town doctors, the reality for most seniors was that \nthere was very little access to health care coverage. In fact, when the \nMedicare program was implemented in 1965, nearly 30 percent of elderly \nAmericans lived below the poverty line and could not afford medical \ninsurance coverage. As a result of Medicare's successes over the last \n36 years, the decrease in individual expenditures on health are allowed \nmany seniors to maintain their savings longer into their retirement \nyears, leading to a dramatic drop in the poverty level of seniors to \njust over 10 percent in recent years. This stark contrast to the number \nof seniors living in poverty prior to the Medicare program is a \ntestament to the program's long term success. In addition, elderly \nAmericans now maintain healthy, active lives well past the average life \nexpectancy of Americans during the first half of the 20th century.\n  I do, however, feel that no entitlement program is perfect and \nMedicare is no exception. While I believe that Medicare does an \noutstanding job of providing coverage for its nearly 44 million \nbeneficiaries, I think it is possible to improve upon this highly \neffective program. To use a phrase that coincides with the theme of \nthis year's Medicare birthday celebration, I believe it is possible to \nhave our cake and eat it too.\n  Prescription drugs played an extremely small role in health care when \nMedicare was first implemented. Today, prescription drugs play an \nintegral part in a wide variety of therapies for illnesses and diseases \nthat affect aging populations. But while our Medicare beneficiaries' \ndependence on prescription drugs grows, so has the price of acquiring \nthose important therapies. That is why I have introduced several pieces \nof legislation that provide common-sense solutions to the rising cost \nof prescription drugs. My Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors \nlegislation would allow seniors to purchase their prescriptions at the \nsame cost as is offered to senior citizens of other industrialized \nnations. Another version of the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors \nbill would require that seniors have access to the same prices that \nmost favored purchasers like HMOs\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\nhave. I believe it is wrong that our Nation's seniors are forced to pay \nthe highest prices in the world for their prescription drug needs, and \nboth of my plans could provide immediate financial relief for the \nnearly 119,000 Medicare beneficiaries in South Dakota and the 39 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries nationwide.\n  I have also introduced legislation that would guarantee greater \naccess to generic pharmaceuticals, which play an integral role in \nkeeping down the cost of pharmaceuticals. Many seniors have expressed \nto me that if they only had greater access to generics that they could \nget a better handle on their medication costs. This is another way we \ncan immediately address the price of prescription drugs without \nadditional bureaucratic red-tape.\n  There is no question, however, that a comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit would be a tremendous addition to the \nMedicare program. I have been an ardent supporter of efforts in recent \nyears to push forward with a strong, voluntary prescription drug plan \nthat gives seniors the option of prescription drugs through Medicare. I \nstrongly believe that we must ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have \naccess to needed drugs, access to their local pharmacy, and affordable \npremiums that make the program accessible to all. And, perhaps most \nimportantly, any benefit must ensure rural beneficiaries, like many on \nMedicare in South Dakota, are assured that they have universal access \nwherever they live.\n  I was pleased to join in AARP's ``Medicare Monday'' celebration. \nProviding Medicare prescription drug benefits is a goal that I share \nwith Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, and I will continue my fight \nfor lower prescription drug costs until we reach that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8395-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2601.

A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, \nfor the purpose of facilitating compliance by small business concerns \nwith certain Federal paperwork requirements, to establish a task force \nto examine the feasibility of streamlining paperwork requirements \napplicable to small business concerns, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2001, that will \nhelp lift the burden of confusing regulation on small businesses by \nhelping them to be better able to understand and comply with Federal \npaperwork mandates. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend Senator \nBlanche Lincoln in putting forth this ``good government'' bill which \ncontinues congressional efforts to streamline and reduce paperwork \nburdens on small businesses.\n  Ask any small business owner and he or she will tell you that Federal \npaperwork requirements on small businesses are impeding America's \nentrepreneurial growth. Indeed, the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) has estimated that the Federal paperwork burden is 7.2 billion \nhours annually, at a cost of $190 billion a year. The Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, estimates that the cost to small businesses are \nstaggering $5,100 per employee.\n  While many paperwork requirements are important and necessary, the \nhigh costs of understanding them and complying with them can sometimes \nprevent small businesses from being able to expand, remain in business, \nor deter them from opening in the first place.\n  Helping ease the burdens of regulation on small business has long \nbeen an interest of mine. As governor of Ohio, I pushed for passage of \nthe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act on behalf of our state governments and \nwas an original cosponsor of the Regulatory Improvement Act in the \n106th Congress. Last year, I worked to help pass the Congressional \nAccountability for Regulatory Information Act and the Regulatory Right \nto Know Act. Senator Lincoln and I introduced s. 1378, a bill similar \nto the one we introduce today, in the last Congress as well.\n  Many Federal regulations of business are important, since they help \nprotect our environment, workers' safety and the health of our \nfamilies. However, some of these regulations are unnecessarily \ndifficult for our businesses, particularly small businesses without \nlarge legal staffs, to understand. Our bill will help business owners \nunderstand and comply with federal regulations.\n  The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2001 would require each \nagency to establish a single point of contact to help answer questions \nand aid small business owners in complying with paperwork requirements. \nIn addition, our bill requires the Office of Management and Budget, \nOMB, to publish annually in the Federal Register and on the Internet a \nlist of each agency's Federal paperwork requirements applicable to \ntheir small businesses. Our bill also requires each agency to make \nfurther efforts to reduce paperwork requirements for small businesses \nwith fewer\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nthan 25 employees. Further, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of \n2001 establishes an interagency task force to study the streamlining of \npaperwork requirements for small businesses. Our legislation asks this \ntask force to consider having each agency consolidate its reporting \nrequirements for small businesses, resulting in reporting to the \nagency's single point of contact, in a single format or using a single \nelectronic reporting system, and on one date.\n  Our bill also will help make government more accountable and aid \ncongressional oversight of Federal agencies by requiring that each \nagency maintain information on the number of enforcement actions in \nwhich civil penalties were assessed; the number of such actions against \nsmall businesses; the number of such actions in which civil penalties \nwere reduced or waived; and the monetary amount of these reductions or \nwaivers.\n\n  I believe any resulting burden on Federal agencies would be minimal, \nand would certainly be offset by the benefits to small businesses.\n  Small businesses are vital to the health of our Nation's economy. \nThey represent more than 90 percent of our Nation's employers, employ \n53 percent of the private workforce and create about 75 percent of this \ncountry's new jobs. In my own State of Ohio, there are more than \n300,000 full-time businesses. Of these, 96 percent employ fewer than \n100 people, and 75 percent employ fewer than 10 individuals. The \nNational Federation of Independent Business estimates that the majority \nof new jobs in the next decade in Ohio will be created by small \nbusinesses. Given the prevalence of small businesses in our Nation, I \nbelieve we should do all within our ability to ensure that small \nbusiness owners are not unfairly burdened, or simply overwhelmed, by \nfederal paperwork requirements.\n  Earlier this year, the House passed the companion bill, H.R. 327, \nunanimously, by a vote of 418-0, on March 15. I hope we can do the same \nin this body.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the following groups: American Farm \nBureau Federation, National Federation of Independent Business, The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Convention Stores, \nAmerican Feed Industry Association, National Association of \nManufacturers, National Tooling & Machining Association, National Pest \nManagement Association, Academy of General Dentistry, and American Road \n& Transportation Builders Association.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Lincoln and me in our \nefforts to help lessen the burden on small businesses, while helping \nthem to be able to comply with federal requirements, by cosponsoring \nand supporting the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2001.\n  I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse to be \nconstructed at 8th Avenue and Mill Street in Eugene. Oregon, as the \n``Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nname the Federal courthouse being built in downtown Eugene, OR after \none of Oregon's greatest heroes, my friend and mentor, Senator Wayne \nMorse. Naming the Eugene courthouse in the city that Wayne Morse loved \nand called home would be an appropriate way to honor the independence \nand integrity of our former Senate colleague.\n  I find it especially fitting to be here today to honor one of the \nSenate's great independents. Without going into too much detail of the \nlast few months of the Senate's history, the act of moving one's seat \non the Senate floor is not a new concept, and Wayne Morse may have done \nit most famously.\n  In January 1953, Senator Morse walked into this very Chamber carrying \na folding chair that he would place in the center of the aisle, thereby \nremoving himself from either major party as an Independent. Again in \n1956, he moved his chair to become a Democrat. He was subsequently \noverwhelmingly re-elected by the voters of Oregon. The independence \ndisplayed by Senator Morse throughout his 24-year service in the Senate \nwas always rewarded by Oregonians who showed their continuing faith in \nhis ability to truly represent their interests, no matter their party \nlabel.\n  It would benefit us all to follow the principles Wayne Morse lived by \nin politics today. Senator Morse would have had little sympathy for the \nworld of the sound byte. Wayne Morse did not just talk; he worked on \nthe issues that our citizens care about most: education; resources; \nhealth care; and justice for all. To paraphrase an old saying, he was \n``unbought and unbossed.'' He, instead, set the bar for integrity and \ntruly embodied the Oregon spirit. I can't imagine a better tribute to \nSenator Morse's independence and integrity than to name a United States \ncourthouse to honor his legacy.\n  Senator Morse never forgot where he came from. He could never wait to \nreturn to his house in Eugene, at 595 Crest Drive, an address I \nremember well because I worked as a campaign aide for two of his Senate \nCampaigns. It was during this time that he got me interested in working \nwith the elderly and started me in public service, which ultimately led \nme here to the Senate floor. I was given the high honor of being \nelected to serve in the Senate seat he had held more than 30 years \nafter he was last reelected by the people of Oregon.\n  Known as the ``Tiger of the Senate'' for his eloquently outspoken and \nvigorously independent views, Senator Morse worked diligently on the \nbehalf of the American family. He pushed the Senate to improve \neducation and create a better future for American children by passing \nthe New Frontier and Great Society bills, supporting federal aid to \npublic schools and universities, and implementing scholarship programs \nfor low-income students.\n  It is, therefore, only right that the Federal courthouse that we will \nbuild in Eugene, OR be named after Senator Morse. This courthouse will \nrepresent his respect for the law, his love for that city, and the \nfuture he envisaged for the people of his home State. Naming this \ncourthouse after Senator Wayne Morse will promote and honor the legacy \nof Oregon's illustrious, maverick leader.\n  I am especially pleased to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, in introducing this bipartisan legislation to designate \nthe new Eugene Federal courthouse as the Wayne Lyman Morse Federal \nCourthouse. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/30/senate-section/article/S8400-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1189.

from United States citizens and \n     permanent residents on unsubstantiated spying charges or \n     suspicions;\n       (E) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to consider releasing Liu Yaping on medical parole, as \n     provided for under Chinese law; and\n       (F) believes that human rights violations inflicted on \n     United States citizens and residents by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China will reduce opportunities for \n     United States-Chinese cooperation on a wide range of issues; \n     and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the President--\n       (A) should make the immediate release of Li Shaomin, Gao \n     Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng Chunyan a top \n     priority of United States foreign policy with the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China;\n       (B) should continue to make every effort to assist Li \n     Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng \n     Chunyan, and their families, while discussions of their \n     release are ongoing;\n       (C) should make it clear to the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China that the detention of United States \n     citizens and residents, and the infliction of human rights \n     violations upon United States citizens and residents, is not \n     in the interests of the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China because it will reduce opportunities for United \n     States-Chinese cooperation on other matters; and\n       (D) should immediately send a special, high ranking \n     representative to the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to reiterate the deep concern of the United States \n     regarding the continued imprisonment of Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan, \n     Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, Teng Chunyan, and Liu Yaping, and \n     to discuss their legal status and immediate humanitarian \n     needs.\n\n
