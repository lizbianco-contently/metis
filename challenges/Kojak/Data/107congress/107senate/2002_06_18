Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:45 a.m. shall be equally divided between the two managers.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \nat 9:50 a.m. rather than 9:45 a.m., and that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a banking bill. This is a bill that \ncame from the Banking Committee. It deals with a very important issue \nto the business community of this country. The Chamber of Commerce, for \nexample, is going to score this. Their 3 million members believe this \nis important, as do the members of the Business Roundtable.\n  We have the support of organizations that are as diverse as the \nTaxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association to the American Banking \nAssociation. This legislation is important to the financial well-being \nof this country. We have construction projects that are being stopped. \nWe have construction projects that can't start.\n  I say to my friends, no matter how strongly their beliefs may be \nrelating to cloning and therapeutic stem cell research, whatever we \nwant to term it, it has nothing to do with this legislation. If the \namendment becomes part of this legislation, the bill will be gone by \nthe time it hits that backdoor. It has nothing to do with the \nunderlying legislation, terrorism insurance, which is so badly needed.\n  I express my appreciation to those who have worked so hard to get to \nthis point. Senator Dodd has made statements on the floor time and time \nagain indicating how important this legislation is. When he speaks, he \nspeaks for the business community. Remember, the business community \nemploys working men and women. This is important to the country. It is \nsome of the most important legislation that has come before the Senate \nall year. We should invoke cloture, and we should do it when the vote \nstarts at 9:50 today.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time run \nequally against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Nevada, the \ndistinguished majority whip, for his assistance and support on this \nmatter, the terrorism insurance legislation.\n  In a few minutes we will be voting on cloture on this bill. I can't \nspeak for the leadership, obviously, but I do know that as of last \nFriday at least, my sense was there was a consensus between the two \nleaders, based on the comments made on the floor, that even though the \ndistinguished minority leader might under other circumstances be \nsomewhat reluctant to support a cloture motion, I certainly interpreted \nhis remarks to indicate that he understood why the majority leader was \nfiling a cloture motion and asking for such a vote.\n  Last week we started debating the terrorism insurance bill on \nThursday morning. By Friday, we had dealt with two amendments dealing \nwith the substance of the bill. I was dealing with every other issue \nbut terrorism insurance.\n  Now we have a cloning proposal before us. I have tried all weekend to \ndraw some nexus between cloning and terrorism insurance, and my \nimagination fails me here. I don't see the linkage at all. My hope is, \nwhile there are certainly a lot of strong views on cloning, the issue \nof terrorism insurance requires the attention of this body, it requires \nthis body to respond to this particular need and vote up or down on the \nmatter. If they want to vote against it, vote against it.\n  My fear is, if we don't invoke cloture, we will then move to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. After all the work that has \nbeen put into this effort over the last months, we may see the last of \nthe terrorism insurance proposal.\n  For those out there who believe this issue deserves to be considered \nand resolved one way or the other, I strongly urge them to vote to \ninvoke cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in this morning's Washington \nPost, ``Firms Warned on Terrorism Insurance,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 2002]\n\n                  Firms Warned on Terrorism Insurance\n\n                          (By Jackie Spinner)\n\n       GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corp., one of the nation's largest \n     lenders, is notifying its borrowers that they must have \n     terrorism insurance or risk defaulting on their loans, the \n     latest example of how a shortage of such coverage is hurting \n     commercial real estate financing.\n       David E. Creamer, chairman and chief executive of GMAC \n     Commercial Holding Corp., the mortgage company's corporate \n     parent, said 85 percent to 90 percent of the loan agreements \n     the company has reviewed this year are not in compliance \n     because the property owners are not insured against terrorism \n     when they renew their policies, putting the agreements in \n     technical default.\n       ``Almost every policy coming in doesn't have terrorism \n     coverage,'' Creamer said. He declined to specify how many of \n     GMAC's 40,000 mortgages have been reviewed so far as part of \n     a routine check of their insurance policies.\n       Creamer said GMAC does not plan to foreclose on the \n     properties that lack the coverage. But he said the company \n     will work with the borrowers to get terrorism insurance, a \n     course that some borrowers have avoided because of the high \n     price and difficulty of obtaining the coverage after the \n     Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n       In March, Simon Property Group Inc. sued GMAC for trying to \n     force the mall owner to obtain terrorism coverage for its \n     portfolio of shopping centers, including the Mall of America \n     near Minneapolis. The suit was settled after Simon purchased \n     two policies with $100 million limits.\n       According to the Bond Market Association, $7 billion worth \n     of commercial real estate loan activity has been suspended or \n     canceled because of a shortage of coverage.\n       Creamer said GMAC has turned down requests for more than $1 \n     billion in new loans this year because the projects were not \n     insured against terrorism.\n       ``The real problem is not your bread-and-butter \n     properties,'' Creamer said. ``It's your trophy properties in \n     metropolitan U.S.A.''\n       The difficulty in obtaining insurance has prompted a call \n     for federal action from insurers and business interests.\n       The Senate resumed debate yesterday on a bill that would \n     create a one-year federal backup to help pay the insurance \n     costs of a future terrorist attack. Under the terms of the \n     bill, insurance companies would have to pay a portion of \n     claims resulting from a terrorist attack. The amount would \n     vary according to each insurer's market share. The government \n     would then pay 80 percent of the remaining claims if the \n     attack cost less than $10 billion and 90 percent if claims \n     totaled more than $10 billion.\n       Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) plans to \n     force a vote today on a procedural issue that would end \n     debate on the bill. If he gets 60 votes, a final vote on the \n     bill could come later in the day or tomorrow.\n       The House passed a competing measure last year that would \n     require insurers to cover the first $1 billion in losses \n     arising from a terrorist attack. The government would pay 90 \n     percent of additional claims. The insurers and policyholders \n     eventually would have to repay the money.\n       ``There's a lot of lifting to be done yet,'' said Julie \n     Rochman, senior vice president for the American Insurance \n     Association, a trade group that supports a federal backup.\n       In the meantime, a growing number of lenders such as GMAC \n     are trying to assess their risks in lending money to \n     uninsured properties.\n       ``I'd be surprised if there was a lender in this country \n     that wasn't doing this,'' said Darrell Wheeler, a commercial \n     mortgage backed securities analyst at Salomon Smith Barney \n     Inc.\n       As lenders, ``it is their responsibility to make sure their \n     borrowers are in compliance with their loan documents,'' \n     Wheeler said. ``At the same time, if I'm a borrower, I'm \n     facing very expensive insurance premiums. Most borrowers are \n     trying to avoid that additional expense.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. This article makes the case that GMAC, the commercial \nmortgage corporation, one of the largest lenders, is notifying \nborrowers that they must have terrorism insurance or risk defaulting on \ntheir loans; again, making the point we made over and over that this \nissue of terrorism insurance is real.\n  I have talked about the problems occurring in the commercial \nmortgage-backed securities. We have had comments from the President, \nGovernors from across the country, and others who are involved in this \nissue. There is a list in the newspaper this morning of organizations \nas wide ranging as real estate and chambers of commerce to labor groups \ncalling on this body to vote this bill out and get to conference so we \ncan resolve the differences with the other body.\n  There is a list this morning: Vote for S. 2600, Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act of 2000. I will not bother at this point to read the \nnames, but there is a long list of groups and organizations that \nrepresent thousands and thousands of workers who, if we do not deal \nwith this bill, run the risk of losing their jobs.\n  The Chamber of Commerce has said that ``it is vital to pass this \nimportant legislation expeditiously,'' talking about the cloture vote.\n  From insurance agents and brokers:\n\n       Support cloture and oppose Gramm amendment to remove per \n     company retentions.\n\n  From the Real Estate Roundtable:\n\n       We are writing to urge you to vote affirmatively on cloture \n     and for final passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of \n     2002. These two votes will be scored as key votes for our \n     organization.\n\n  The American Insurance Association: The same message.\n  The National Association of Realtors. This is a ``key'' vote for \ncloture on S. 2600.\n  Mr. President, we made the case over and over for many months as we \nhave gone back and forth on this bill that each day that goes by, the \ncase grows more serious and demands our attention.\n  I have had letters from 30 of our colleagues, from 18 Governors \nacross the country, repeated letters and comments from the President of \nthe United States and the Secretary of the Treasury, and others who \nurge us to step to the plate and bring up amendments, which we were \nwilling to do last week without cloture. Now we have no other choice \nbecause we have received proposals, with all due respect to our \ncolleague from Kansas and others, to bring up matters that the Senate \nmay or may not grapple with in this Congress. To hurl these matters at \nthis bill as we are trying to wrap up business we think is a huge \nmistake.\n  This is probably the last chance. For those who think there is going \nto be another day in this Congress on terrorism insurance, I fear there \nwill not be. This is it. So in about 10 minutes, my colleagues will \nhave a chance to decide whether we give final consideration to this \nbill or move on to other matters.\n  For those who vote against cloture, understand if things do happen, \nthen the finger of culpability clearly gets pointed in the direction of \nthose who\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\ndenied us an opportunity to vote on this bill.\n  I urge support of the cloture motion, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I intend to vote against cloture. I urge my \ncolleagues to also vote against cloture.\n  This boils down now to two issues, and they are very real issues. No. \n1, the President has said he will not sign a bill that will make \nvictims of terrorism subject to attacks by plaintiff's attorneys and \nsubject to punitive damages. We think it is vitally important that we \nhave an opportunity to deal with this issue and to have at least one \nmore vote on it.\n  Secondly, we are in a situation now where this bill has evolved to \nthe point that the taxpayer is virtually the payor of first resort, not \nlast resort. When this bill was initially put together in a bipartisan \ncompromise, supported by the administration, we had in a terrorist \nattack $10 billion of costs that the insurance industry had to bear \nbefore the Federal Government came in to pick up the tab.\n  This was critical for two reasons. No. 1, it provided incentives for \ninsurance companies to syndicate, so no one insurance company insures \nthe Empire State Building. There may be a lead company and then they \nsyndicate to other companies to spread the risk.\n  No. 2, it was vitally important in terms of protecting the taxpayer. \nWhat has happened now, by going to a retention level by individual \ncompanies, is that we have reached a point where the taxpayer is put at \nexposure very early in the process. I think it circumvents what we are \ntrying to do.\n  My biggest concern is, if we adopt this bill in its current form, \nthat we are setting up sort of a hot-house plant that cannot exist and \ngrow and work without permanent Government involvement.\n  I remind my colleagues, our objective was to have a 2- or 3-year \nprogram to bridge this gap to create a situation where the reinsurance \nmarket would emerge, where syndication would become the norm in high \nprofile projects so that the Federal Government could get out of this \nindustry and so that the cost of terrorism in terms of risk would be \nbuilt into the term structure of interest rates.\n  The problem with this bill--and this bill made sense in December when \nwe had 3 weeks before 80 percent of the insurance premiums in America \nwere going to be due and the existing policies were going to expire, \nbut today much of that insurance has been written, premiums have been \ncollected, and to adopt a bill with retention rates as low as we have \nin this bill is to create economic windfalls and to destroy the \nincentive of the industry to do the things that need to be done to get \nthe Government out of this business.\n  I remind my colleagues that I have been among the earliest and \nstrongest supporters of having a bill, but what has happened now is the \nnature of this bill does not fit the reality of the world in which we \nlive, in the world at the end of June when policies have been sold, \npremiums have been collected based on no Government backup, and now we \nare coming in with retention levels that are so low that in some cases \nthe Federal Government is going to begin to pay when losses are in the \ntens of millions.\n  When we initially contemplated this bill, when the administration \nsigned off on a compromise, there was a $10 billion retention. Mr. \nPresident, $10 billion was made by the people who collected the \npremiums before the taxpayer paid. That has now been dramatically \nchanged with retention levels set on a company-by-company basis. I \nthink this encourages companies to take on full projects, I think it \nmoves us in exactly the wrong direction, and I think we have an \nopportunity to fix this. I believe it will be fixed if we deny cloture, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture and give us an \nopportunity to deal with punitive damages being imposed on victims of \nterrorism and give us an opportunity to have retention levels that \nprotect the taxpayer, that do not create windfall gains and retention \nlevels that encourage the development of reinsurance and syndication, \nsomething that is absolutely essential to get the Federal Government \nout of this business within 2 or 3 years. I yield the floor.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor for a \nmoment to express the hope that we can get cloture, that both \nRepublican and Democratic Members can vote for cloture this morning and \nmove on. I remind all of my colleagues that there will be 30 hours of \ndebate at least potentially available to Senators with germane \namendments. So there is absolutely no reason to vote against cloture.\n  I might just say for the record, prior to the time we take this vote, \nwe began negotiations on this matter months and months ago. We have \noffered virtually every conceivable proposal I can think of to be able \nto bring this bill to the floor under unanimous consent. We asked \nunanimous consent on many occasions and were unable to get that \nconsent. We even offered to bring up the House bill with a limit of \nfive relevant amendments on either side, and that was not successful.\n  I am at a loss for how we will proceed under these circumstances if \nwe are not able to get cloture today. My intention would be to put the \nbill back on the calendar and move directly to the Defense \nauthorization bill if we fail to get cloture today. Only after we would \nhave in writing the number of Senators required to bring the bill back \nwould I be able to reschedule this legislation. So this is our chance. \nThis is our window. This is our opportunity. Colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle have made it very clear it is important we take up the \nDefense authorization bill. So we are not going to extend the debate on \nthis legislation. We will either get cloture, deal with germane \namendments, and move on or we won't get cloture, and we will move on in \nany case.\n\n  So that is our option this morning, and I am very hopeful we can \nachieve that. I hope colleagues will understand we have been tolerant, \nwe have been patient, we have been innovative, and we have been \nimaginative. I can't think of anything else we can be in an effort to \nget this job done.\n  I know there is a great deal of interest in it. But the time has come \nfor us to bring this to closure if, indeed, Senators want a terrorism \ninsurance bill this work period.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under leader time. I \nknow it is time for us to vote, but I will be brief.\n  First of all, I believe we are close to finishing this bill. I \nunderstand there are very few remaining issues we would actually have \nto dispose of even though there were some 41 amendments filed on this \nlegislation: 14 on the Republican side of the aisle, 27 on the \nDemocratic side. I am not sure how many of them are germane or how many \nwould actually have to be offered. I know the manager of the \nlegislation filed 21 of them, and perhaps some of them have been \naccepted. I don't know how many of those have been worked through. But \nclearly there were some problems with this legislation that needed to \nbe addressed.\n  It is my hope we can complete this important legislation and get it \nto conference and then get a bill that we can accept and the President \ncan sign.\n  There is a little bit of revisionist history that has been going on \nhere. You remember last year in December very good work was done by \nmembers of the committee on both sides of the aisle, a bill that could \nprobably have whizzed right through here. But over a period of time, \nthe limits on liabilities were taken out, which is a concern of a \nnumber of Members on this side, and also the per-company limits were \nchanged, or they were put into place in the legislation at a very low \nlevel where Federal funding would actually get to kick in.\n  Those are two of the major problems that still exist. That could have \nbeen worked out if we had gone to the bill that was originally offered \nin committee or over these many months we have been trying to get an \nagreement of how to proceed.\n  We have been unable to debate this measure at much length, although I \nsaid last week that I understood why Senator Daschle filed cloture.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n  We have other issues we need to go on to, but I think in this case \ncloture may actually delay it a day. If we get cloture, it could take \nus sometime into tomorrow. It looks to me as if there is only four, \nmaybe five amendments that actually would have to be debated and \nconsidered and voted on.\n  I think we could probably get an agreement on the number of \namendments and get a time limit and actually get votes on those \namendments, perhaps not. But they are certainly relevant even though I \nam not sure whether they would be germane postcloture. I know Senator \nMcConnell has two or three, Senator Gramm has one, Senator Brownback \none; there may be two or three on that side. But I believe we could \nwork this out and actually get the legislation completed today.\n  I continue to hope that would be the result, and if cloture is not \ninvoked, I will try to get a consent that we just take up these three \nor four amendments and move to conclusion. So, obviously, we would like \nto get this work done, but it still has some problems and some \namendments that really do need to be considered.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have 2 remaining minutes, I believe; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield those 2 minutes to Senator McConnell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are very close to completing this \nbill. By invoking cloture we are going to be shut out of an opportunity \nto offer a few more amendments, just a handful as the Republican leader \nhas indicated, that need to be considered. On the liability question, \nwe have a clear letter from the administration indicating that if we \ndon't deal with that properly, this bill will not become law. I do not \nthink any of us believe, at this already late stage of the session, we \nought to be clogging up legislative days with exercises in futility. So \nthere are a couple more amendments on the liability issue that need to \nbe voted upon.\n  I strongly urge our colleagues to vote against cloture and then let \nthe Republican leader and the Democratic leader talk about how we can \nwrap this bill up in short order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much more time do we have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me address for that 1 minute the whole issue about \nretention. When we started this debate, the Federal Government was \ngoing to be the backup insurer. We were going to have substantial \nretention by the private companies that have sold policies and \ncollected premiums. They were going to pay up front, and in big losses \nthe taxpayer was going to pay. When we got into December and 80 percent \nof the insurance policies were expiring, there was a movement toward \nindividual company retentions to dramatically reduce the amount \ncompanies had to pay before the Government paid.\n  Now we are at the end of June. Companies have sold insurance \npolicies. They have collected premiums. To come in now with retention \nlevels in the tens of millions instead of tens of billions is to create \nan unintended, and I believe unwise and unfair wealth transfer but, \nmore importantly, it discourages the kind of risk sharing that we need \nto ultimately get the Government out of this business.\n  I believe if the bill became law as it is now written, we would end \nup with the Government permanently in the terrorism insurance business. \nI think that would be a bad thing.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 2 minutes of my leader time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, this is a 2-year bill. In \nfact, it is only a 1-year bill with the possibility of an extension of \nanother 12 months. We are going to have a chance to debate the Gramm \namendment if we get to cloture. If we don't have cloture, then, as the \nleader has indicated, we are going to move on to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. So if you want to have a debate about what \nmy colleague from Texas is proposing or my colleague from Kentucky, the \nonly way to do this is to invoke cloture.\n  We have been at this since last fall trying to resolve these matters. \nMy hope is we can. If we don't invoke cloture, then it is very \ndifficult to get to these matters. We have the cloning issue and others \nthat have been added to this debate, and it makes it very difficult to \ndeal with the underlying issue.\n  I have indicated earlier that from the AFL-CIO to major groups in the \ncountry that are dealing with commercial lending they tell you this is \nan important piece of legislation. Every day we waste is jobs lost and \nmore economic difficulty. So my hope is we can invoke cloture, debate \nthe Gramm amendment, debate the amendment of my friend from Kentucky \nand others, and resolve this matter. Either vote for this bill or vote \nagainst it, but let's get it completed.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have a markup with the members of the \nBanking Committee coming up. Given that last vote, it is not my \nintention to try to offer an amendment. The amendment I wanted to \noffer, which was a 3-year program, would not be germane postcloture \nbecause of the third year.\n  I want to sum up what I believe to be the chronology of this debate \nand express my concerns.\n  Senator McConnell and I will offer amendments if the House bill is \nbrought up in an effort to substitute this bill for it, and potentially \non the naming of conferees. But I think, in terms of today and this \nbill, it is clear where the votes are.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that in the wake of 9-11, there was great \nskepticism in Congress about the need for terrorism insurance. I think \nany checking of the Record will show that I was one of the early \nsupporters of an effort to have terrorism insurance. I believed then \nand I believe now that we need a bridge from our current situation \nwhere terrorism insurance is hard to get for high-profile projects, \nwhere it is expensive as we go through this process of rational \ninvestors determining what the real risks are.\n  I thought it was important we have a bridge program to give a Federal \nbackup for a fairly short period of time until the market could adjust \nto this new reality and the threat of terrorism could be built into the \nstructure of insurance premiums. I have to say, in the entire debate \nover the bill, the role of the Federal Government has been a role of a \nbackup, where the Federal Government paid only in cataclysmic kinds of \ncircumstances.\n  In the fall of last year, we reached a bipartisan compromise that was \nworked out among the leaders of the Banking Committee, the committee \nwith jurisdiction. That bill had a $10 billion retention the first year \nfor the insurance companies, $10 billion the second year, and then, if \nthe Secretary of the Treasury decided a third year was needed, we had a \n$20 billion retention.\n  What ``retention'' means is that the insurance companies would pay \nthe first $10 billion, and then the Federal Government would pay 90 \npercent of the $90 billion that might follow.\n  The argument that was made, from the very beginning really, boiled \ndown to two points: One, that the people who were collecting the \ninsurance premiums should have first liability and the Federal \nGovernment should be in a backup role.\n  The second argument was--and I think it was the more dominant \nargument; the more important argument, in my opinion--that our \nobjective here is not simply to insert the Federal Government \npermanently into the insurance industry.\n  I note to my colleagues that, unlike World War II, where, when the \nJapanese bombed Pearl Harbor, we knew that war would end someday, and \nwe knew we would prevail, and we knew there would be a formal ceremony \nending that war--and, in fact, there was on the deck of the Missouri--\nthis war, when it ends, will end with the dying gasp of some terrorist \nsomewhere, and we will not be sure that he is the last one, and there \nwill not be any formal agreement ending the hostilities.\n  So our objective here is to build a bridge to private coverage. That \nbill was agreed to in the fall by the Secretary of the Treasury on \nbehalf of the President and by the leadership of the Banking Committee.\n  We agreed in that to ban punitive damages against the victims of \nterrorism. We had a press conference. It looked as if we had come up \nwith a bipartisan consensus. Then there was objection to the ban on \npunitive damages against the victims of terrorism, and the bill did not \ngo forward.\n  Then in December, in a last ditch effort, in which I am proud to say \nI participated, we tried to write a bill that would deal with a \nsituation where, we were already halfway through December; 80 percent \nof the insurance policies in America--at least we were told at the \ntime--were expiring on January 1, and so there would not be time for \nreinsurance to develop. There would not be time for extensive \nsyndication, a basic procedure whereby an insurance company would \ninsure the Empire State Building but then perhaps would lay off the \nrisk to 20 other companies.\n  In December, a bill was worked on that had individual company \nretentions. For the largest companies in the industry, that retention \nis pretty substantial, over $1 billion. For small companies, that \nretention is quite small, in the tens of millions of dollars.\n  There are two problems with the bill before us which is based on the \nDecember draft. The first problem is, the situation is very different \ntoday than it was in December. Those policies did expire, and many were \nrenegotiated at substantially higher premiums. It is now 7 months \nlater. Insurance has been sold. Premiums have been collected. Those \npremiums are based on substantially higher risk with no government \nbackup. Now we are being asked to pass a bill that maintains those \nretention levels that might have made sense in December, when 80 \npercent of the policies in the country were expiring and there was no \ntime for reinsurance or syndication.\n  But in my opinion, to adopt this bill 7 months later when substantial \nnumbers of policies have been sold at substantially higher prices, and \nthose higher prices are part of the solution--I am not complaining \nabout them because risks are higher--the point is, we are dramatically \nchanging risk by having the Government pay 90 percent of the claim \nabove these retention levels.\n  I have offered a compromise which would split the difference, which \nwould have individual company retention the first year, for the first \n12 months after the bill is signed into law. Then it would go to a $10 \nbillion industry retention; and then if the President extended the \nprogram 1 more year, it would have a $20 billion retention.\n  Why is that important? It is important for two reasons. One is \nequity. These retention levels put the taxpayer at an unjustified risk. \nThese low retention levels we have in this bill create a situation \nwhere policies were sold; premiums were collected; expectations were \nthat there would not be a Federal backup. And now the Federal backup is \ncoming in at individual company retention levels which are \nsubstantially lower than the level we looked at in October of last \nyear.\n  This creates an unintended transfer of risk from the insurance \ncompanies to the taxpayer, where the insurance companies have collected \npremiums based on bearing that risk themselves.\n  That is an equity problem. We are putting the taxpayer at a level of \nexposure which is unjustified.\n  The second problem is of greater importance. If we simply are passing \na bill that transfers wealth from the taxpayer to insurance companies, \nit is inequitable, in my opinion, at the level we are doing it. But it \nis not the end of the world, nor is it the first or last time we would \nhave ever done any such thing. The problem is, the way the bill is now \nwritten, for the next 2 years, the incentive that insurance companies \nhave to develop reinsurance--and reinsurance is a system whereby I sell \na policy on a building, but then I share that risk through a \nreinsurance system which is developed. I share the profits, but I share \nthe risk. That way the risks\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nend up being dispersed not just among all the insurance companies in \nAmerica but literally all the insurance companies in the world.\n\n  As that market develops, there is another alternative called \nsyndication whereby companies insure an asset but then they syndicate \nby having other companies take a piece of it. They in essence become \nthe reinsurer.\n  Why is all this important? Why would anybody care about all these \nthings? Why I care about it is because if we don't have substantial \nindustry retention, we are dramatically reducing the incentive for the \nreinsurance market to develop. If we don't have substantial industry \nretention, we are creating an incentive for companies to take a larger \nshare of risk because they are not having to bear the risk.\n  They have their industry retention, which for smaller companies can \nbe in the tens of millions of dollars, and then the Federal Government \ncomes in and pays 90 percent of the cost.\n  If we don't develop reinsurance, if we don't develop syndication as \nthe norm, then we simply continue a system where the bulk of the risk \nis borne by the taxpayer. Two years from now, if we don't change this \nbill, we are going to be back here, and the same people who are saying \ntoday we have to have this bill are going to say: You have to extend \nthis bill for another 2 years, another 10 years, forever.\n  The problem with the structure of the bill is that it acts as a \ndisincentive to do the things the industry has to do in order to get \nthe Federal Government out of the insurance business.\n  I am not yelling; I am not complaining about the insurance companies. \nI am not trying to put them in a position where I am vilifying them. I \nwould say when we came out with our bill last October, there was great \njoy and celebration in that the insurance industry was going to have to \nbare a $10 billion retention, but the Federal Government was going to \npay 90 percent of anything above that.\n  It was my perception, in talking to people, listening to people, that \npeople thought that could be made to work. Granted, there were people \nwho wanted the Government to bear more of the risk. The point is, there \nwas a perception that this was something that could be made to work.\n  Now we have a situation where the retention level has been reduced \ndramatically. If I were running an insurance company, I would want the \nretention level to be zero. If I were running an insurance company, I \nwould want to sell the insurance, collect the premium, and I would want \nthe Government to pay the claims. So I never expect people to do what \nis not in their interest. If you do that, you are going to be \ndisappointed.\n  But what has literally happened here is that we wrote a bill in \nDecember for an emergency situation where it was going to go into \neffect in less than 3 weeks. There was no time for reinsurance pools to \ndevelop; 80 percent of the policies in the country were going to expire \non January 1. So in order to try to accommodate that short timeframe, \nwe agreed, or at least many were willing to agree--the body never \nagreed--to retention levels that were dramatically lower.\n  I know nobody knows what ``retention'' means. It means the Government \npays sooner and more.\n  That may have made sense in January, but it does not make any sense \nat the end of June when insurance policies have been sold and premiums \nhave been collected based on no Government backup. So the whole reason \nfor the lower retention levels in December has now passed.\n  What happened was, quite frankly, the industry saw these lower \nretention levels in December and said: That is what we want; we do not \nwant those higher retention levels we agreed to in October; we want the \nlower retention levels.\n  The problem is they only made sense in January. They do not make \nsense in June. My lament--and that is all it is at this point because \nit is clear from the last vote that we are going to pass this bill--is \nthat we are going to put the taxpayer at a much greater risk than is \njustified.\n  It is amazing to me that in October, the very people who thought the \nretention level at $10 billion was too low now are supporting retention \nlevels that are a small fraction of the $10 billion retention we had \nagreed to in October. This creates tremendous inequity for the \ntaxpayer. It creates an unintended wealth transfer. I think it is a \nproblem, and I believe it should be fixed.\n  The second problem is much greater, however, and that is we are \nreducing, not eliminating, the incentive of the industry to syndicate \nand to develop reinsurance, and in the process, I believe we are taking \na step toward having Government permanently in the insurance industry.\n  I am not going to convince anyone else--I think I have convinced \nabout 35 Members of that, and I think that is probably the high water \nmark. I am not going to try to offer an amendment. I am ready to let \nthis bill pass. But I will say that I still believe we are making a \nmistake. I still believe we need to find something--we should go back \nto the October retentions, but at the least we need something between \nthe two.\n  We will have an opportunity, if the House bill is brought up to amend \nit with this bill, to vote on punitive damages. The President has said \nhe will not sign a bill unless we deal with punitive damages. We will \nhave an opportunity at some point to address these issues again. But to \ncontinue to debate it today uses up Senate time.\n  We should get on with the Defense authorization bill. I have a markup \nin 5 minutes on another issue of equal importance. As a result, I do \nnot intend to try to use up the Senate's time. The Senate spoke on the \ncloture motion, and I am ready to pass the bill and address these \nissues some other day as we proceed in the process that ultimately \nleads toward a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas and I, despite our \ndisagreement at this particular moment, are very good friends. We both \nserve on the Banking Committee, and there is, as he points out, a very \nimportant markup occurring.\n  So I might get an understanding of where we are, are there amendments \nthat will be offered to this bill, or can we go to third reading?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am ready to go to third reading on the bill. I do not \nthink we are going to achieve anything by offering amendments. I cannot \noffer the amendment I would like to because it brings in the third \nyear, and it would not be germane. At this point to offer an amendment \nwould be to simply delay something rather than to seek a constructive \nchange. The thing to do is to go to third reading and pass the bill. I \nwould be willing to do it on a voice vote. Then we will take it from \nthere.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take some time to respond to the \ncomments of my colleague from Texas, and he raises not illegitimate \nconcerns.\n  I say to my colleague from Texas, we have always known we were \nsailing in uncharted waters. We have never done anything like this. I \nwould be the last one to stand before my colleagues and say with \nabsolute certainty what we proposed is going to work as perfectly as we \nwould like it to work.\n  My colleague from Texas raises some legitimate questions, questions I \nreally cannot answer because we do not absolutely know what is likely \nto occur over the next 12 months or 24 months if the bill is extended. \nI am not at this moment going to challenge it, in fact, even on these \nassertions he has made. At some point, I will respond to it in a way \nthat raises some concerns if we do not have retention caps, and it is a \ncomplicated matter for most Members to understand what happens in light \nof smaller companies that cannot necessarily withstand the kind of hits \nthat could come with a major terrorist attack. There is an argument on \nthe other side of retaining what we have in the bill.\n  I also make the point to my colleague, which I have made repeatedly, \nwe are going to go to conference with the House. They have a different \nbill. These are matters, clearly, that need to be brought up and \nthought about more, and we need to bring in people who spend their \nlives working in this area who can share with us responses to these \nkinds of questions. Senators deal on a matter such as this for a few \nhours, and we do not really understand--at least I do not, despite the \nfact I represent a State with a large insurance industry. These are \nvery complicated and arcane insurance matters.\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nThe Presiding Officer was an insurance commissioner in his State. He \nknows the matter, but even he has to say these are complicated matters \nin light of what has happened.\n  I appreciate the spirit in which my friend from Texas has made the \nsuggestion we get past this bill and go to conference, but he has my \ncommitment, Mr. President, and my word that I do not consider this to \nbe the final word; that we have work to do before we come back. My \ncolleague has made the point, and I have made the point that I do not \nwant to see this go on. I do not want the Federal Government to be in \nthe insurance business. I want to make sure we get off this as fast as \nwe can.\n  I, like him, am concerned that 2 years may be unrealistic, but I also \nunderstand the tolerance level of my colleagues. That number was chosen \nas much for political reasons about how much our institution would be \nwilling to bear politically as it was over the realities of what the \nmarketplace is like in trying to cost this kind of a product.\n\n  Getting to conference is helpful. We will work on these matters and \nhopefully bring back a bill that is even improved from what we have \nbefore us today.\n  With that, I am going to yield to the distinguished majority whip and \nthe leadership to determine what they want to do. My colleague from New \nYork is here as well and may want to make comments, and then we can \nfigure out whether to have a recorded vote or take a voice vote on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first ask a question of my friend from \nTexas without losing my right to the floor, and that is, the Senator \nfrom Texas would not in any way object to the appointment of conferees?\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are not ready, Mr. President, to name conferees. I have \nto sit down with our people who have been involved in this debate and \ntalk about how we want to go about it. I would be willing to step aside \ntoday and let the bill be passed, but in terms of bringing up a House \nbill or substituting this bill for it or naming conferees, we are going \nto have to have some meetings.\n  Part of our problem this morning--and I understand in trying to run \nthe railroad that you have to set a time schedule--we did not get an \nopportunity to meet this morning--we being Republicans--before we had \nthis vote. It is just going to be essential that I have an opportunity \nto sit down with our people.\n  My suggestion is we go ahead and pass the bill, and then we will have \nan opportunity to go to the Defense authorization bill, and then we \nwill have an opportunity to sit down and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will have an opportunity to sit down and maybe \nsomething can be worked out.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are some amendments, technical in \nnature, that the Senator from Connecticut will take a little time to \ndo. I hope during the next few minutes we can work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement to have a vote on this bill sometime this afternoon, \nperhaps allowing the Senator from Connecticut to do the housekeeping \nchores he has and to make sure there are no other amendments people \nwish to offer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3844\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the pending business on this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Ensign second-\ndegree amendment to the Brownback first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Brownback \namendment No. 3843 is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. REID. And with it falls the Ensign amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield whatever time my colleague from New \nYork may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Texas for at least at \nthis point--one never knows--seeing the handwriting on the wall. \nSometimes that handwriting seems to become an invisible ink, but at \nleast at this point we have seen that.\n  I wish to make a couple of points.\n  The Senator from Texas sees the bill one way, and I respect that, and \nthat is the balance between private industry and Government. Obviously, \nhe has built a whole career on minimizing the Federal Government role \nin every walk of life. It is a philosophy he espouses with a great deal \nof integrity, intelligence, and fervor, and he has been mighty \nsuccessful at it, a little too successful over the last 20 years.\n  However, there is another way to look at this bill, and that is in \nour post 9-11 world. We are so uncertain of what will be happening \nnext: will there be other terrorist incidents? How will they affect us? \nHow many lives will be lost? What should we do to protect ourselves now \nthat we are in a totally brave new world?\n  The bottom line is a simple one, I say to my colleagues, and that is, \nour No. 1 one goal should be keeping the economy on track during this \nbrave new world. If that means altering the balance between Government \ninvolvement and private involvement, so be it.\n  I do not want to see the insurance industry make unnecessary or \nexcessive profit; no question about it. Under the present situation, \ntheir profits are quite large, and how much of that is due to terrorism \ninsurance and how much of that is due to just the natural ebb and flow \nwith the investments they make going down, so their rates go up--the \nopposite happened in the late nineties--we do not know.\n  The bottom line for me is this: That under the present situation, \nbillions of dollars of projects are not going forward, particularly in \nlarge economic concentrations, particularly in large cities, none \nsuffering more than my own.\n  The bottom line is this: Further billions of dollars of refinancing \nis not occurring, all because the uncertainty means that for an insured \nto offer a policy at all, they err on the side of caution and charge \nsuch high rates that there is a huge crimp on economic policy.\n  If this happened because of some market phenomena, so be it; that is \nthe market. This is happening because of an untold, if you will, \ngeopolitical phenomenon: This new world of terrorism in which we live. \nTherefore, to look simply from the prism of how much Government \ninvolvement there ought to be, without looking at the larger effects on \nthe economy that our problems since 9-11 have caused the insurance \nindustry--and it has ricocheted to the economy as a whole. The fact is \nthat the insurance industry was not clamoring for this bill at all. \nThey were sort of happy to let the present situation continue for a \nwhile.\n  It was really the banking industry and, above all, the real estate \nindustry which saw so many new projects go by the wayside that put \npressure to make this bill happen. The insurance industry, wisely, is \ngoing along with this, but they were not the impetus post-January 1 \nwhen they learned that they could continue to be viable in terms of \ntheir responsibilities to their shareholders but perhaps not be viable \nin terms of the broader responsibility to keep our economy going and \nnot give the terrorists a victory.\n  Therefore, yes, there is the age-old conflict between government and \nthe private sector. But something transcends that. That is the fear, \nthe uncertainty, that we all have. Those are the classic times when \nFederal Government involvement is more called for. In wartime, \nnaturally, the Federal Government has more say over our economy. No one \nhas ever fought that notion. We are in wartime, whether we have \ndeclared war or not. We all know it. Every time we hear a loud \nexplosion, even a car backfiring, people turn around and ask, What is \nthis? We are in a different world. That happens economically speaking, \nas well.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, this is not simply the question, \nShould it be the Government at 10 percent and private sector at 90 \npercent? Certainly under these circumstances, the less Government \ninvolvement, the better, does not apply because there are external \nramifications that go far beyond the insurance industry itself. My \nfriend from Texas said we knew World War II was over and that is why \nthe Government would step in. They did not know a week after Pearl \nHarbor was bombed that World War II would be over in 1945--the Japanese \nwere overrunning\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nthe Pacific, and the Germans controlled the European continent. All \nthey knew was, for this country to survive in a war setting, the \nGovernment would have to be fully involved.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this on the merits, to not let a \npredisposition of an ideological notion blur the view of what we have \nto do. I hope we will move this bill quickly.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas, again, for understanding this bill \nshould move forward, even if he vehemently disagrees with it. I thank \nall of my colleagues, including the Senator from Connecticut, who has \nworked long and hard, along with the chairman of our committee, Senator \nCorzine, as well as my 17 Republican colleagues who made it clear they \nwere going to put the prosperity of our economy above any ideological \nnotion or notion of party.\n  We are finally beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. \nWe have a way to go. The Senator from Texas is one of the most skilled \nparliamentarians around, and I guess he will have a few other tricks up \nhis sleeve. For the moment, I hope the bipartisan coalition we put \ntogether which says if we do not do something and, frankly, if we do \nnot increase the Federal role, not only will the insurance industry \nfalter--it may not; it is doing well--but, more importantly, our \neconomy will stumble. That is something we cannot afford. That will be \na victory for the terrorists themselves.\n  I look forward to moving this bill, to come to a conference where we \ncan solve this problem, not just looking at the balance between \nGovernment and the insurance industry but, rather, the broader effects \non the whole wide economy, and get something on the President's desk to \nhelp those who lost their jobs in the construction industry, those in \nthe projects that are not going forward, with all the uncertainty in \nthe economy. Money is being sucked out because insurance rates are \ngoing through the roof. So many in my city and other cities need this \nbill quickly.\n  Yes, the Senate has spoken. I hope it will be allowed to speak by \nhelping move legislation into law quickly. For our economic viability, \nwe need it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my colleague from New York leaves--and we are \nheading in the same direction to the Banking Committee to deal with \naccounting reform which is being marked up today--I express my \ngratitude to him and to Senator Corzine, as well.\n  Obviously, the Senator from New York speaks about this issue of \nterrorism insurance with a voice that adds a bit more clarity, if I may \nsay so, than other Members. I am from a neighboring State. We lost \npeople in Connecticut, as were lost in the Pentagon and the airline \nthat went down in Pennsylvania, but particularly for the people of New \nYork and particularly the people of New York City, the events of \nSeptember 11 have a poignancy that the rest of the country understands.\n  We deal with this issue of terrorism insurance, and there is a \ntendency to get lost in the trees, be arguing about whether the \nGovernment will be an insurance company and how this will work. Those \nare not insignificant questions. I know my colleagues believe those are \nimportant issues. Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that there is an \neconomic slowdown occurring and people have a heightened sense of \nanxiety because of the events of September that we did not have before.\n  We may talk about the failure of the intelligence community and the \nlike, that may or may not be true, but certainly what was true was a \nfailure almost of imagination that something such as this could happen \non our own shores. What we are trying to do with this bill, and why the \nSenator from New York was so critically important in helping to put \nthis together, is to see if we can get back on our feet to offer our \nconstituents a sense of confidence that, despite the events of \nSeptember 11, we are coming back and trying to do that in so many \ndifferent areas.\n  One critical area is the economy because, in addition to what this \nmay cost--God forbid our country is attacked again--in terms of lives \nlost and hardship suffered, is the cost in terms of the price of \npremiums on insurance policies. Our Presiding Officer has raised \nlegitimate concerns about that. We know that in the absence of this \nbill, the prices are apt to go much higher. In fact, I am confident \nthey would.\n\n  One of the goals of this bill is to try to dampen down that demand \nfor the increased price of these premiums so our consumers, the owners \nof these buildings, the people who rent, the people who work in these \nbuildings, the people who rent to open up shops and the like, are going \nto have less of a cost than they might have otherwise.\n  We have tried to fashion this in a way that will make it possible to \noccur without just setting a premium cost that would be outrageous. And \nso I am grateful to the Senator from New York and others who have made \nat least getting the bill out of the Senate possible, and I second his \nconcerns about whether or not we can actually finish this up and get a \nbill to the President that will allow us to complete this work.\n  As he has said, and I repeat, this is about a 1-year bill, maybe a 2-\nyear bill. It is conceivable someone may argue we need a third year, 36 \nmonths, and I would not argue too strenuously against that for all the \nobvious reasons.\n  This is a very limited proposal to try to jump-start this critically \nimportant element in our economy. The longer we delay, the harder it is \nto do that. So my hope is the Senator from Texas and others would allow \nus to go forward, get a conference done, get a bill to the President, \nand see if we can't make a difference for this bottleneck that has \noccurred in our economy that makes it possible for the flow of commerce \nto occur as easily as it should as we try to get back on our feet as a \nnation.\n  So, again, I will respond more directly at another time to the \nconcerns raised by the Senator from Texas about the retention rates and \nthe fear I would have that, if we didn't have some individual company \nretention rate caps, what that could do to the ability of smaller \ncompanies to actually be in the marketplace. This could end up being \njust a bill that is good for four or five insurance companies, and \nthere are many out there that are not big but would like to be in this \nmarket, need to be in this market that could not afford to be in this \nmarket without having some realistic caps on an individual company-wide \nbasis. So there is a strong argument for that approach that should not \nbe lost on our colleagues when that debate occurs.\n  When that does occur, we will make the case and hopefully finish this \nbill. Again, I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will briefly yield, again, I thank him, \nas I have before, for his leadership, for his steadfastness. This is \nnot an easy issue. This is not one where you can go home and make a \nstem-winder of a speech. It is not a crowd pleaser, but it is \nnecessary. His leadership on this has been top of the line, and I thank \nhim for it and hopefully we can work together and get a law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I understand it, just to inform the \nPresiding Officer, there will be a vote on this bill sometime a little \nlater today. I know there are some technical amendments that are being \nworked on right now to resolve those if we can. And then the leadership \nwill set the time and the circumstances when that vote would occur. But \nmy guess is it will be a little later in the day. In the meantime, I \nknow there is some consideration about laying this bill aside \ntemporarily and moving to another matter, possibly the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. But I leave it for the distinguished \nmajority whip and the majority leader to make the announcements as to \nhow we will proceed. But at this point I would assume that debate on \nthis bill, at least for the present, is over and we will have a \nrecorded vote on the underlying Senate bill sometime later this \nafternoon.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5651-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5651-S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n                           HISPANIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we speak frequently of America's security \nneeds and we do it with understanding. It is important to understand, \nthough, that the strength and security of our Nation requires more than \nbombs and bullets and our brave men and women in uniform. The future of \nour great country will be determined by our children and our \ngrandchildren, and their futures in turn will be shaped by the \neducation they receive today.\n  So what is a higher priority for America than educating our children \nand making sure all children have the tools and opportunity to succeed?\n  In the future, classrooms and communities all across America will \nresemble those we already see in the State of Nevada where students \nfrom racial and ethnic minorities comprise an increasing percentage of \nthe school population. The Presiding Officer knows about which I speak, \nbeing from the State of Florida which is diverse in nationalities, \nethnic groups, religions. It is a State of great diversity, as is \nNevada.\n  This is new in Nevada. It has been longstanding in Florida. Nevada's \nschools now serve a large and rapidly growing number of Latino \nstudents, including many with limited English language proficiency. The \nClark County School District, Las Vegas, is the sixth largest school \ndistrict in America, with about 240,000 students. Over 25 percent of \nthose students are Hispanic, and we support programs that provide all \nstudents the resources they need. Therefore, we must keep in mind the \neducational needs of Hispanic children. They have special needs in many \ninstances.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I will host our third annual Hispanic \nLeadership Summit this week. We have invited 100 Hispanic leaders from \nacross the country to share their ideas and work together on key issues \nfacing the Hispanic community. Certainly education will continue to be \na top priority for the Democratic caucus.\n\n  Health care, jobs, the economy, immigration, and civil rights will \nalso be among the priorities on our agenda, and we will speak about \nthese subjects with Hispanic leaders who will come to Washington this \nweek.\n  Though education is viewed as a local issue because most decisions \nare made by local leaders, school boards, principals, teachers and \nparents, the Federal Government should and does play an important role \nin helping to educate our youth.\n  Congress and President Bush agreed last year to work together to \nimprove the quality of education in America's public schools. We worked \nin a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and passed a strong educational reform program that \nrequires States to set high standards for every student and strengthen \nFederal incentives to boost low-performing schools and significantly \nimprove educational achievement.\n  The legislation even had a catchy name: The No Child Left Behind Act. \nUnfortunately, though, President Bush has not backed up his rhetoric \nwith the resources our children need. Just 1 month after signing \neducational reform into law, the so-called No Child Left Behind Act, he \nproposed a budget to cut almost $100 million in funding for the No \nChild Left Behind Act. To highlight the impact of the Federal budget, \nfor example, on Nevada's schools, I hosted an Appropriations Committee \nfield hearing in Las Vegas this spring. We heard compelling testimony \nabout programs that have worked and passionate appeals for continued \nsupport.\n  I, for one, will do all I can to restore funding for successful \neducational programs that President Bush wants to cut. My Democratic \ncolleagues will join with me in this effort.\n\n  The Secretary of Education conducted townhall meetings in Las Vegas \nshortly after our hearing--actually north of Las Vegas--as part of the \nPresident's Commission on Education Excellence for Hispanic Americans.\n  I am pleased Secretary Paige visited Las Vegas so he could learn \nabout the challenges that teachers and students face. While the entire \nNation is struggling with overcrowded classrooms and teacher shortages, \nthese problems are particularly severe in Nevada, the fastest growing \nState in the country.\n  At the hearing that I held, one of the witnesses was a young man by \nthe name of Alberto Maldonado. This was a hearing of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Alberto was born in Mexico City and moved to Las Vegas when \nhe was 15 years old. At age 15, he did not speak a word of English, and \nhe was mainstreamed into the schools. He enrolled in the 10th grade at \nLas Vegas High School.\n  On the first day of school, Alberto was terrified. He walked into the \nschool not understanding a word of English or certainly much of our \nculture. He now recalls with gratitude, he testified, the names of his \nteachers in his English Language Learners Program and how they \ninfluenced his life. Ms. Hernandez and Ms. Williams taught him English \nwords and sentence construction. Mr. Luna helped him learn about \nEnglish culture, and Ms. Monroy helped him learn to write English and \nto read advanced materials.\n  Just 1 year after this young man, who could not speak a word of \nEnglish, enrolled in his new school, he passed the Nevada High School \nProficiency Examination in reading, writing, and mathematics. In his \nsenior year, he served as vice president of the Student Organization of \nLatinos. After graduating from Las Vegas High School, Alberto attended \ncommunity college and went on to work with mentally and physically \nchallenged children.\n  He is a bright young man, and the reason I am sharing his story today \nis because right now, there are tens of thousands just like Alberto in \nClark County--students who need to participate in the English Language \nLearners Program if they are to have any hope of achieving the American \ndream.\n  It is estimated there are 40,000 students just like Alberto. By the \n2004-2005 school year, there will be almost 90,000 who will need these \nservices. I cannot understand why, at a time when our Nation needs to \nsupport education more than ever, our President wants to freeze funding \nfor English Language Acquisition and Bilingual Education Programs.\n  Nevada also has the Nation's highest dropout rate. It is nothing I am \nproud of, but it is a fact. One out of every 10 high school seniors in \nNevada drops out of school. This does not count those who dropped out \nbefore they even got to high school.\n  The Dropout Prevention Program, which was authorized as part of the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, which was pushed strongly by Senator Bingaman \nand me, is the only Federal educational program specifically targeted \nto dropouts. The Hispanic community suffers from a persistently high \ndropout rate, higher than any other ethnic group. Yet the President \nwants to eliminate this dropout prevention program.\n  It is the only program, I repeat, that deals with dropouts. I hope he \nwill reconsider the administration's plans to eliminate a program of \nsuch great importance for youth across America, including Hispanic \nstudents who already have a high risk for dropping out of school.\n  There is another program called the GEAR UP program which supports \nearly college awareness for low-income youth starting in middle school \nand helps them complete high school and enter college. Over one-third \nof the students in the GEAR UP program are Hispanic.\n  This program is critical for Hispanic students who are more likely \nthan any other students to drop out of high school and, consequently, \nless likely than others to attend and complete college. Again, I have a \nhard time understanding how, as our Latino population continues to \nincrease, the President wants to freeze funding for yet another program \nthat is critical to the long-term success of Hispanic Americans. But \nthis is yet another example of saying the right thing without paying \nfor it.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act provides a blueprint for educational \nreform. Real reform cannot occur without real resources. Without \nadequate funding, it is reform in name only. That is not enough. We can \ndo better. We must do better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to say a few words about the \nresponsibilities of lawyers in corporate America.\n  In recent weeks we have learned about high-flying corporations that \ncame crashing to the ground after top executives played fast and loose \nwith the law. And we have heard how ordinary employees and shareholders \ncan lose their life savings when millionaire managers break the rules.\n  For the most part, the public has focused on the role of the managers \nand the accountants in allowing this kind of misconduct to happen, and \nof course that is critical.\n  But the truth is that executives and accountants do not work alone. \nWherever executives or accountants are at work in America today, \nlawyers are looking over their shoulders. And if the executives and \naccountants are breaking the law, you can be sure part of the problem \nis that the lawyers aren't doing their jobs. The findings of the jury \nin the Andersen case only highlight the role of lawyers in American \nbusiness today.\n  I know from personal experience what the responsibility of a lawyer \nis. I was proud to practice law for 20 years. I was proud to fight for \nmy clients, regular people who had been wronged by powerful interests. \nWhen I took on a client, I recognized my duty to that client: to \nrepresent him or her zealously, but to do so within the limits of the \nlaw.\n  The lawyers for a corporation--the lawyers at an Enron, for example--\nthey have different kinds of clients from the clients I had. But they \nhave the same basic responsibility: to represent their clients \nzealously, and to represent them within the limits of the law.\n  My concern today is that some corporate lawyers--not all, but some--\nare forgetting that responsibility.\n  Let me get a little more specific. If you are a lawyer for a \ncorporation, your client is the corporation. You work for the \ncorporation and for the ordinary shareholders who own the corporation. \nThat is who you owe your loyalty to. That is who you owe your zealous \nadvocacy to.\n  What we see lawyers doing today is sometimes very different. \nCorporate lawyers sometimes forget they are working for the corporation \nand the shareholders who own it.\n  Instead, they decide they are working for the chief executive officer \nor the chief operating officer who hired them. They get to thinking \nthat playing squash with the CEO every week is more important than \nkeeping faith with the shareholders every day. So the lawyers may not \ndo their duty to say to their pal, the CEO, ``No, you cannot break the \nlaw.''\n  In my view, it is time to remind corporate lawyers of their legal and \nmoral obligations--as members of the bar, as officers of the courts, as \ncitizens of this country.\n  The American Bar Association ought to take a leading role here, \nsomething they have not done thus far.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission has an essential part to play \nas well. For some time, the SEC promoted the basic responsibility of \nlawyers to take steps in order to stop corporate managers from breaking \nthe law. The rule for lawyers that the SEC promoted was simple: If you \nfind out managers are breaking the law, you tell them to stop. And if \nthey won't stop, you go to the board of directors, the people who \nrepresent the shareholders, and you tell them what is going on.\n  After promoting the simple principle that lawyers must ``go up the \nladder'' when they learn about misconduct, the SEC gave up the fight. \nThey gave up the fight in part because the American Bar Association \nopposed their efforts.\n  In my view, it is time for the ABA and SEC to change their tune. \nToday I am sending a letter to the Chairman of the SEC, Harvey Pitt, \nasking him to renew the SEC's enforcement of corporate lawyers' ethical \nresponsibility to go up the ladder.\n  In answer to a petition from 40 leading legal scholars, the SEC has \nalready signaled that it probably will not take up the challenge I am \ntalking about. I believe that is wrong. If Mr. Pitt responds to my \ninquiry by saying that the SEC plans to do nothing, then I believe we \nwill probably need to move in this body to impose the limited \nresponsibility I have discussed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my letter to Mr. Pitt \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Harvey Pitt,\n     Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pitt: I am writing to you about the \n     responsibilities of lawyers under the federal securities \n     laws.\n       In the wake of the Enron scandal, the public has focused on \n     the role of accountants in maintaining the integrity of our \n     free market system. In my view, it is time to scrutinize the \n     role of lawyers as well. When corporate managers are engaged \n     in damaging illegal conduct, the lawyers who represent the \n     corporation can sometimes stop that conduct simply by \n     reporting it to the corporate board of directors. Yet lawyers \n     do not always engage in such reporting, in part because the \n     lawyers' duties are frequently unclear. While the lawyers' \n     inaction may be good for the inside managers, it can be \n     devastating to the ordinary shareholders who own the \n     corporation.\n       The American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional \n     Responsibility have not recognized mandatory and unambiguous \n     rules of professional conduct for corporate practitioners, \n     and rules at the state level are varied and often unenforced. \n     During the 1970s and 1980s, as you know, the SEC instituted \n     proceedings under Rule 2(e) (now rule 102(e)) to enforce \n     minimum ethical standards for the practice of federal \n     securities law. The SEC has since stopped bringing these \n     types of actions. On March 7, 2002, forty legal scholars \n     wrote a letter to you suggesting, among other things, that \n     the Commission require a lawyer representing a corporation in \n     securities practice to inform the corporation's board of \n     directors if the lawyer knows the corporation is violating \n     the Federal securities laws and management has been notified \n     of the violation and has not acted promptly to rectify it. In \n     a March 28, letter, your then-general counsel, David M. \n     Becker,\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n     indicated that, absent congressional action, the SEC would \n     leave this matter to state authorities.\n       It seems to me that a lawyer with knowledge of managers' \n     serious, material, and unremedied violations of federal \n     securities law should have an obligation to inform the board \n     of those violations. Particularly in view of the uncertainty \n     surrounding current ABA and state rules, my view is that this \n     obligation should be imposed as a matter of federal law or \n     regulation. Recognition and enforcement of this important but \n     limited obligation could prevent substantial harms to \n     shareholders and the public.\n       I would appreciate receiving your answers to the following \n     two questions at your earliest convenience:\n       1. Absent further congressional action, does the SEC plan \n     to act to enforce a minimum standard of professional conduct \n     for lawyers in securities practice along the lines I have \n     suggested?\n       2.

RICHARD J. WYATT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to remember a man who played such an important role in mental \nhealth. I would like to make a few remarks to honor Dr. Richard J. \nWyatt, a friend of mine and my wife and my family and a distinguished \nadvocate for the mentally ill.\n  On Friday, June 7, 2002, the mental health community lost an \ninspirational researcher and leader in the field of mental health to a \nlong battle with cancer. Throughout his career, Dr. Wyatt received \nnumerous awards and honors and was highly respected among his \ncolleagues. He served as the chief of the Neuropsychiatry Branch at the \nNational Institutes of Mental Health.\n  For 33 years, Richard played a leading role in understanding the \nbiological basis of mental illness. His work pioneered the view that \nSchizophrenia is not the result of bad parenting or frailty of \ncharacter, but it is due to a diagnosable and treatable disorder of the \nbrain. This creative understanding of the basis of brain disease led to \nnew treatments with antipsychotic medicines easing the burden of the \ndisease.\n  In addition, Richard and his wife, Dr. Kay Jamison, worked to end the \nstigma attached to mental diseases. Richard focused on research and the \nbiological effects of Schizophrenia. Kay wrote books about her personal \nstruggles with depression and how to overcome it. Together, they co-\nproduced a series of public television programs that provided \ninformation on manic depression. All of their efforts helped to raise \npublic awareness of brain disorders.\n  Not only did Dr. Wyatt receive praise for his work on mental health, \nbut he was a strong and courageous individual who fought a lifelong \nbattle with cancer. In a letter to a friend diagnosed with cancer, Dr. \nWyatt candidly discussed his experiences and shared his insights into \novercoming this disease.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the February 13, \n2001, Washington Post article entitled, ``Words to Live By'' be printed \nin the Record following my remarks. I believe this article is truly \ninspiring and exemplifies the qualities of this extraordinary \nindividual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From myself and my wife, Nancy, we wish to express our \nheartfelt condolences to Richard's friends and family. To his wife, \nKay, we send our greatest sympathies for the loss of your husband, and \nwe thank you for your work as well. Dr. Wyatt's strength of character, \nand his compassion and work on behalf of the mentally ill will truly be \nmissed.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 2001]\n\n                            Words To Live By\n\n       Drawing on knowledge born of hard experience, Washington \n     psychiatrist Richard J. Wyatt penned this personal note of \n     advice after a close friend and fellow physician was \n     diagnosed with cancer. A cancer veteran himself, he underwent \n     two years of aggressive radiation and chemotherapy to fight \n     Hodgkin's disease in his thirties. When at age 60 he was \n     diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma, he withstood another \n     course of chemo and a bone marrow transplant. Since he wrote \n     the letter, he's begun a third fight--this time against lung \n     cancer. In the letter's introduction, he voices the hope that \n     the ``battle-won knowledge'' he offers here ``will help \n     others facing this difficult journey.''\n\n       Dear Jim, I wouldn't have the audacity to write this if I \n     hadn't fought cancer three times myself. But maybe you'll \n     find the following advice helpful. I also offer the \n     comforting and indisputable fact that I am here today to \n     offer it.\n       Try not to sweat the big things. Once you have made the \n     decision to put yourself in the hands of a good oncologist, \n     it is his or her job to fret. If you find that you are \n     second-guessing him on big issues, you have the wrong person. \n     Your job is to concern yourself with the small things. It \n     also helps to find a treatment facility that makes you feel \n     secure. I was treated at Johns Hopkins. The doctors, as I \n     expected, were superb. And one cannot say enough about the \n     quality of the nursing care at Hopkins. Everyone, including \n     the housekeepers, takes pride in their work.\n       Finally, as you know from the adage, a doctor who is his \n     own doctor has a fool for a patient. In short, despite the \n     temptation, do not try to compete with your doctor. How to \n     choose an oncologist: Carefully. Most people have no basis \n     for choosing a specialist other than the recommendation of \n     their internist or family physician. In most cases this works \n     well. My internists are superb, and they could not have been \n     more helpful at a number of important stages of my care. But \n     they have only a limited number of people they know well \n     enough to make referrals to.\n       The local oncologist is unlikely to have treated Burkitt's \n     lymphoma or other unusual cancers, and even if he has some \n     experience, it is likely to be slim. And he won't have the \n     support team to deal with the many complexities that will \n     arise.\n       You want to be at an academic center where there is a great \n     deal of experience, and where nobody does anything without it \n     being questioned. The local oncologist can work with the \n     academic oncologist, particularly if there is a geographic \n     distance involved. The question I would ask, probably of the \n     local oncologist, is, ``Who would you ask to treat your \n     family member if he or she could go anywhere in the \n     country?''\n       Do not be shy about this, and do not worry about offending \n     your doctors by asking such questions. This may be among the \n     most important questions you ever ask.\n       As an aside, when I went out to Stanford for my Hodgkin's \n     treatment, the radiation oncologist there said he could do \n     better than the other people I was considering when I asked \n     him this question. The other oncologists I was considering \n     were as good as they get. But the Stanford doc turned out to \n     be one of the best physicians I have come across. His well-\n     placed self-assurance probably saved my life.\n       Protect your veins. This is one of those small things I \n     told you that you should worry about. Think of every \n     venipuncture as a nosebleed where you must apply continuous \n     pressure to the puncture wound for five minutes, even though \n     the person drawing your blood will want to just put a bandage \n     on it. Your arm will soon enough look like a maple tree in \n     the fall, but there is no need to hurry the seasons. Try to \n     get as much out of a single needle stick as possible. If you \n     are going to need blood drawn twice in the same day, a device \n     (a heparin lock) can be left in your arm which will prevent \n     the need for a second sick. And start squeezing rubber balls. \n     My arm veins have never been better.\n       A bad hair year. I have noticed that neither of us has \n     high-maintenance hair. As far as I'm concerned, the only \n     reason for having hair is to keep our heads warm. (If I were \n     a woman, I might feel differently.) You have the wisdom to \n     live in a warm climate, but when it does get cold, wear a \n     hat. One of my fellow patients tied a bandanna around his \n     head, which I thought looked pretty snazzy, but because of \n     some medication-induced numbness and tingling in my hands, I \n     was having enough trouble with buttons and shoelaces.\n       And there are some major benefits to hair loss. If all goes \n     well, you have many months of not shaving. Just think of Yul \n     Brenner and Michael Jordan. And James Carville. You will not \n     be experiencing the radiation I\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n     received for Hodgkin's disease. It burned up a lot of me. \n     Twenty-seven years after my radiation treatments, I still do \n     not have any inconvenient sweat glands. I can wear my shirts \n     for weeks without any telltale signs. And since both of us \n     are academics, not one will notice the wrinkles.\n       Get your finances in order. Make sure everything is in one \n     place where your wife can find it, and in a form she can \n     understand. I note that the night before Sen. John McCain had \n     surgery for his melanoma, he said that his wife, Cindy, was \n     going through their insurance policies. It got a laugh, but \n     she was right. I have all my financial papers in a black \n     three-ring notebook in plain sight, and I update it pretty \n     often. Visit your accountant to see if you are over the \n     limits you can leave a spouse and kids without it being \n     taxed. Wills, powers of attorney and so forth are a must. Do \n     not forget your friends.\n       Nausea and vomiting. This time the chemotherapy is mild and \n     fairly innocuous. Even a year ago, despite undergoing rather \n     rigorous treatment, I had very little nausea or vomiting--a \n     big difference from 27 years ago. Today there are good \n     medications to prevent nausea and vomiting. Most of the time \n     last year I got an IV dose a few minutes before receiving \n     the day's medications. The pill form also worked well, \n     even when they were dumping Drano directly into my \n     cerebral spinal fluid. Burkitt's cells are apparently \n     scoundrels: If there allowed to, they hide in the brain.\n       I think you will want to start the pill form of anti-nausea \n     medication about an hour before treatment, and take it about \n     every eight hours for the next 24 hours. Your anti-cancer \n     drugs may sit in the body longer than the ones I received, \n     but I think most of them set on their target receptors within \n     a few minutes.\n       An aside about spinal taps: If you need to have one, to \n     prevent headaches, remember to lie on your back for two or \n     more hours after each tap. Out of nine spinal taps, I had \n     only one mild headache, but it did last about a week.\n       Although by previous standards there was essentially no \n     nausea or vomiting, I recommend carrying a purple surgeon's \n     glove in your pocket at all times, just in case. I am not \n     sure why all the gloves have suddenly become purple, but \n     Barney seems to have had a pervasive influence. I had to use \n     the glove only once, but it saved my wife's car from that \n     indelible stink. Since you have had much less practice and \n     therefore probably do not have my Olympic-quality aim, you \n     might want something larger than a surgeon's glove. Think \n     leaf bag.\n       Tastes and foods. I developed strong aversions to many \n     foods and tastes I normally like. One of the most surprising \n     was my sudden dislike of chocolate. I have since learned that \n     this reaction is quite individualized. I think I almost drove \n     my wife to murder demanding that my food be prepared in \n     specific ways and then rejecting it. Nor is this something \n     that suddenly goes away. Fortunately, it appears to be in \n     women's genes to be patient with us.\n       A year later, my appetite has yet to return. But then again \n     there are not many men our age without a potbelly. You would \n     be surprised by the number of friends who are slightly \n     heavier than they would like, and who would be pleased to \n     merge with you or offer to provide a transplant of their \n     extra tonnage. They, and others, have offered many \n     suggestions for increasing my appetite. One of my more \n     endearing nurses advised me to have a beer before meals. \n     Ensure, a ``Sun Chip and Benecol [a special kind of \n     margarine] diet,'' Remeron [an antidepressant], Megace [a \n     hormone] and marijuana have all been strongly encouraged. Of \n     these, I like the idea of marijuana the best, but it is \n     illegal and, despite a real effort under a porch when I was \n     14, I never learned to inhale. No matter what I have tried, I \n     find I am as good at pushing food around a plate as I was \n     when I was a child.\n       Dry mouth. You will have it. Ice chips work well. A great \n     gift was a Chap Stick. I have used it to its nubbins and it \n     is the only one I never lost.\n       Amusement. Get a comfortable lounge chair for home, a high \n     wattage light for reading and a good TV videotapes. These \n     should not be in the bedroom (see below). The best gifts I \n     received during this time were books on tape, so you will \n     want a good headset and tape player. If you have not already \n     done so, start with Harry Potter.\n       Apparently, flowers attack you when your immune system is \n     down, so somehow you have to figure out a way to discourage \n     friends from sending those large ``get well soon'' bouquets. \n     Our cleaning lady got a lot of beautiful hand-me-down roses \n     in the last year. They come pretty much only in the \n     beginning, so she has no conflict of interest in seeing me \n     get better.\n       Chivalry, sex and movies. Have a place you can go at 2 a.m. \n     when you cannot sleep and do not want to disturb your wife. \n     You may want to subscribe to an extra movie channel. In the \n     early hours of the morning, you can never be sure what will \n     pop up on cable TV, but the porn flicks went to waste--I, at \n     least, lost any libido I might have had left.\n       My wife has been great about renting movies, and we usually \n     have a large stack at anyone time. Make the most of whatever \n     you can of political coverage and hope for a good scandal. My \n     bout with Hodgkin's coincided with the Watergate hearings. \n     Few people appreciate Richard Nixon like I do. A year ago I \n     had John McCain and his exciting campaign. Actually, I \n     suggest starting some sort (any sort) of rumor about one of \n     our current or former Washington luminaries. How about \n     something involving a randy act with one of the baby pandas \n     at the zoo? Root for the absurdities of another Ken Starr, \n     Bob Barr . . . the list is long.\n       Sleep. With the permission of your doctor, have a supply of \n     sleeping pills on hand. I have always used Valium because it \n     has been around the longest. Because it is now off patent, it \n     is also cheap. I buy one large bottle every 10 years. I think \n     you said you like Ambien. Let me warn you that in the last \n     few years I have seen two people, although older than us, \n     become pretty goofy on Ambien. You might warn your wife about \n     your potential for goofiness, because it is a little hard to \n     assess on your own.\n       Thinking. By the way, I am not sure most oncologists \n     realize the extent of it, but the anti-cancer drugs affect \n     one's cognition. The change is subtle and you will probably \n     be the only one who knows it has occurred. This is not the \n     time to expand your ideas on superstring theory.\n       While in the hospital with the bone marrow transplant, I \n     received a great many medications. Just before they \n     discharged me, I had a fever of unknown origin and one night \n     became delirious. My wife and I are still arguing whether it \n     lasted for a few hours or may more. You know which side she \n     is on. My oncologist, who is generally pretty blunt, says he \n     was not there and has refused to get involved in the \n     discussion. In a more tactful manner than is usual for him, \n     he did say that such deliriums usually last for days or \n     weeks. The delirium did go away and has nothing to do with \n     the more subtle cognitive change mentioned above.\n       Pain and enemas. I had some bone pain with the Hodgkin's \n     and used small amounts of codeine with aspirin. When the pain \n     was at its worst, I used Valium as well. My treatment last \n     year was fairly pain-free. The problem with opiates, which I \n     enjoy otherwise (do not pass up a shot of Demerol if you are \n     going to need a biopsy or surgery), is that they are \n     constipating. Do not allow yourself to get constipated. \n     Colace and sena work pretty well, but if you start getting \n     bottled up, enemas (yuck!) have worked well for me. Fleet's \n     or its generic equivalent has done the trick on a number of \n     occasions. It's probably a good idea to have several around \n     the house. Just don't leave them in the living room or where \n     the dog can get at them.\n       Invisible shield. After chemotherapy, your chance of \n     developing shingles will be pretty high (assuming, of course, \n     that like most people our age, you have had chickenpox). \n     There are now several antiviral agents available which, if \n     started with the first symptoms, can greatly reduce the \n     amount you will suffer from this scourge. Unfortunately, by \n     the time you recognize the symptoms, describe them to your \n     doctor, get a prescription, have that prescription approved \n     by your HMO or insurance company and get the drug at your \n     pharmacy, several days or more will have passed.\n       Aware of this problem, I asked my physician to write a \n     prescription before the symptoms developed. My insurance \n     company has been fairly generous throughout my illness, but \n     it took more than two weeks for them to send the drug. It \n     came a week before my symptoms developed.\n       If you want to know how worthwhile this exercise was, \n     consider this. When I had Hodgkin's disease, shingles got the \n     better of me for many weeks; it was on both sides of my body \n     and spread vertically across all my ribs. I still get pain in \n     these areas every winter when I go out into the cold. But \n     this time, just one rib was involved. And it itched more than \n     it hurt. I think I may be left with a small residual seven \n     months later, but it is trivial. I have read that adding \n     small doses of the antidepressant amitriptyline [Elavil] to \n     the antiviral agents helps prevent the post-shingles pain.\n       The sporting life. To the degree you can, exercise. It may \n     not be possible at first. But as soon as you feel up to it, \n     give it a try, even if you only walk around the block. \n     (Believe me, the first time you complete this herculean task, \n     you will be very impressed with your physical prowess.)\n       I still try to get on the treadmill every day, as I have \n     done most of my life, even if the workout isn't what you \n     would call herculean. The only time I missed it recently was \n     a two-week period last month when I contracted pneumonia and \n     hadn't yet responded to antibiotics.\n       Before my latest cancer diagnosis, I got shoved out of bed \n     every morning to be at the gym by 6:15. Mostly, while there, \n     I was too out of breath and my pulse too rapid to do anything \n     but read the newspaper, but I got on the treadmill every day \n     even if I had to hold onto the rails for balance. I think the \n     balance problem is related to weakness, but it could also \n     have been the Drano.\n       Cancer talk. This issue is one that may be left over from \n     our parents' generation. They did not talk much about cancer, \n     but I have always been willing to talk about mine. This is a \n     secret I did not want to try to keep. And just how do you \n     explain sudden baldness, needle tracks and a great imitation \n     of Casper the Ghost?\n       Some of my best discussions have been in oncologists' \n     waiting rooms. There is almost always a wait, so there is \n     plenty of time to meet others going through more or less the \n     same thing. At least for me and my wife, the time spent in \n     oncologists' waiting rooms has been an unofficial form of \n     group therapy, and I have never met a person there I did not \n     like. It is rather remarkable how being in\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\n     the same boat on a rather rough sea pulls people together. I \n     believe all those studies that say that group psychotherapy \n     improves the survival time of patients with cancer. My \n     experience is that such therapy doesn't have to be formal; it \n     develops spontaneously.\n       Spiritual issues. This has not been my strong suit, but \n     despite living in a somewhat cynical society, you and I both \n     have many friends who pray. For the most part they do so in \n     private. Few have Joseph Lieberman's exuberance. As you will \n     find out, however, when they perceive you need them, they let \n     you know they are there for you.\n       And you will find that those friends who don't pray will \n     also find wonderful ways of encouraging you.\n       One more thing. In case you have ever wondered why you got \n     married and had kids, this is it. This is your best chance \n     ever to get a lot of attention. Breakfast in bed is a good \n     start.\n           Love,\n     Richard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5655-S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nspecial distinction of Las Vegas, NM, as recently highlighted by the \nLos Angeles Times. Perhaps more faithfully than any other community in \nthe Southwest, this charming city continues to hold fast to its rich \nHispanic and European heritage, and colorful ``Wild West'' history.\n  Firmly rooted in Hispanic traditions, Las Vegas was christened \n``Nuestra Senora de los Dolores de Las Vegas Grandes,'' or ``Our Lady \nof the Sorrows of the Great Meadows,'' by sheep and cattle ranchers of \nSpanish heritage who settled there in 1835. Las Vegas prospered as a \nmajor trading point on the Santa Fe Trail, giving rise to a great \nproliferation of adobe homes and commercial buildings. As trade \nburgeoned, the trail and the nearby Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe \nRailroad brought in a larger variety of settlers and architecture, \nincluding other European influences, and the town grew to include a \nlarge number of Victorian buildings. As the Los Angeles Times points \nout, Las Vegas currently boasts over 900 structures listed on U.S. and \nNew Mexico registries of historic buildings, an outstanding number of \nmonuments to the varied cultural influences that have shaped the town \nfor more than a century and a half.\n  The Los Angeles Times also noted that ``this Las Vegas, in fact, has \nso much history, the town's not sure what to do with it all.'' Las \nVegas has played host to both illustrious guests and infamous Wild West \npersonalities. Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders convened there \nfor a reunion in 1899, a year after they stormed San Juan Hill. Both \nUlysses S. Grant and Emperor Hirohito of Japan took advantage of the \nMontezuma Castle hot mineral springs resort outside town. The same \nvibrant traffic that made the town boom brought in some of the most \ncolorful characters of the Old West: outlaw Billy the Kid and bank \nrobber Jesse James made appearances in Las Vegas, and controversial \ngunman ``Doc'' Holliday performed a stint as the town's dentist.\n  Though the town was established by a land grant from the Mexican \ngovernment to several Spanish families, Gen. Stephen Kearny of the U.S. \nArmy arrived on the scene in 1846 by way of the Santa Fe trail and \nsparked the Mexican American War by declaring the town's residents to \nbe citizens of the United States. Henceforth, the town clung \ntenaciously to its roots, resulting in a vibrant and authentic Hispanic \ncommunity unlike any other in the Southwest.\n  Although the boom begun by the railroad left Las Vegas behind, and \nstagnation sometimes haunted the town's economy, Las Vegas continued to \nembrace its home-grown values and place an emphasis on preservation as \nit sought other means of development. I believe Las Vegas, with its \nhistory and charm, is poised for a 21st century renaissance. It has the \ningredients--a ready workforce, access to transportation and \nmetropolitan services, a higher- education base, and the desire to be a \nprosperous and growing community. I have worked through my Rural Payday \ninitiative to help bring new telecommunications-related jobs to Las \nVegas, and we are working on other projects to bring more jobs to the \narea. The socalled information superhighway, like the railroads of the \n1800s, can be the region's next conduit for growth.\n  The people of Las Vegas and San Miguel County hold a very special \nplace in my heart. They make New Mexico particularly proud for staying \ntrue to their values and heritage. Possibly no other locale that so \npurely embodies the real historic and cultural elements that \ndistinguish our state from any other. I commend Las Vegas' residents \nfor their active preservation efforts, and congratulate this community \non its remarkable place in New Mexico's cultural life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Los \nAngeles Times article from June 16, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles, Times, June 16, 2002]\n\n            No Sin City, This Vegas Savors Its Rich Heritage\n\n\nThe small community in northern New Mexico treasures its old buildings, \n           unlike its glittery namesake in the Nevada desert\n\n                            (By Tom Gorman)\n\n       This is the other Las Vegas--not where 40-years-old casinos \n     are imploded because they're no longer fashionable, but where \n     140-year-old storefronts still have purpose.\n       The mob missed this place, but not the ruthless Billy the \n     Kid, who was run out of town after pistol-whipping the \n     sheriff, and bank robber Jesse James, who relaxed in its hot \n     mineral baths. Probably neither visited the town dentist, \n     ``Doc'' Holiday.\n       Nevada's Las Vegas may have its conventions, but it was \n     here where Theodore Roosevelt and his Roughriders held a \n     reunion, attracting 10,000 admirers, a year after they \n     stormed San Juan Hill in 1898. Hotel guests in Nevada's Vegas \n     include flash-in-the-pan celebrities, but the old Montezuma \n     Castle mineral springs resort here played host to Ulysses S. \n     Grant and Emperor Hirohito of Japan.\n       This Las Vegas, in fact, has so much history, the town's \n     not sure what to do with it all.\n       More than 900 buildings in this city of 15,700 are listed \n     on New Mexico and U.S. registries of historic buildings. Most \n     are clustered downtown, still used as homes, offices and \n     storefronts, just as they were more than a century ago when \n     this was New Mexico's boomtown.\n       But more buildings were constructed here from 1880 to 1900 \n     than can be used today.\n       ``In other cities, old buildings are torn down in the name \n     of progress and are replaced with big new buildings,'' Mayor \n     Henry Sanchez said. ``But we were too poor to tear our \n     buildings down poverty saved our History''.\n       Now the city treasures its old buildings, and it has \n     created a handful of preservation districts where the \n     demolition of historic structures is banned.\n       The city is struggling to find tenants for the few dozen \n     empty ones, in part because investors wary of water \n     restrictions in the drought-ridden Southwest are afraid to \n     launch businesses here and because of the cost of renovation.\n       Civic leaders also say they want to preserve the town's \n     heritage and don't want to become another Santa Fe, 64 miles \n     to the west, which is chided by Las Vegans as having forsaken \n     its roots in favor of becoming a tony arts colony.\n       ``Santa Fe is no longer a practicing Hispanic community,'' \n     said Bob Mischler, an anthropology professor at New Mexico \n     Highlands University here. ``Santa Fe has been taken over by \n     outsiders who have created a whole new environment. We don't \n     want to do that.''\n       The challenge here, Mischler said, is to preserve and \n     capitalize on Las Vegas' Latino and European heritage.\n       Las Vegas was settled by Mexican sheep and cattle ranchers \n     in 1835, attracted by the lush green meadows that gave the \n     town its Spanish name.\n       Army Gen. Stephen Kearny, following the Santa Fe Trail, \n     arrived here in 1846 and started the Mexican American War by \n     proclaiming the town's residents to be American citizens. No \n     shots were fired, and in time town commerce flourished by \n     trading with nearby Ft. Union.\n       The economy that traders generated along the Santa Fe Trail \n     through Las Vegas further enriched the town's merchants but \n     was nothing compared to the arrival of the railroad in 1879, \n     fostering 20 years of heated growth.\n       The town grew as two distinct halves--Latinos around the \n     historic plaza, Easterners and Europeans around the rail \n     district. Entrepreneurs from both cultures profited, and Las \n     Vegas presented a confluence of architectural styles--from \n     adobe and California mission to Queen Anne and Italianate--\n     that grace the town to this day.\n       ``Las Vegas has very few rivals in the West for frontier \n     boomtown architecture,'' said Elmo Baca, until recently New \n     Mexico's historic preservation officer.\n       But after the turn of the century, Las Vegas' fortunes \n     waned as railroads expanded their reach to Albuquerque and \n     other Western towns. Baca, a Las Vegas native, said the town \n     still embraced its home-grown values.\n       ``Ever since Kearny came here, we've had a healthy \n     suspicion of outsiders,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\n     ``We've held on dearly to our cultural heritage, perhaps at \n     the expense of economic development.''\n       The frontier buildings were neither razed nor improved as \n     the city's economy stagnated during the last century. Few \n     businesses moved here; a factory made parachutes during World \n     War II, and today the biggest employer is the government.\n       Not that progress isn't being made.\n       The city is renovating the railroad depot, at a cost of \n     $500,000; the Montezuma Castle resort was renovated and is \n     now used as one of 10 Armand Hammer United World College \n     campuses around the world.\n       And the citizens committee for historic preservation \n     purchased an 1895 mercantile building for its own use, \n     investing about $500,000 to turn it into a Santa Fe Trail \n     interpretive center.\n       Slowly, building owners are renovating their structures, \n     although some remain empty. Among them: two century-old \n     storefronts owned by the Maloof family, which settled here in \n     1892 and became wealthy New Mexico business owners and \n     bankers. Today, one branch of the family owns the Sacramento \n     Kings professional basketball team and a Las Vegas, Nev., \n     casino hotel.\n       Among the town's boosters is Anne Bradford, who moved here \n     from Carlsbad, Calif., nine years ago and spent $150,000 to \n     turn a 109-year-old home into a bed-and-breakfast inn.\n       Her guests, she said, enjoyed this Las Vegas for what it \n     is. ``People will always recognize our Las Vegas,'' she said. \n     ``It'll always be a little bit behind. That's part of its \n     charm.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5656-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PAYING TRIBUTE TO DR. FRANK C. HIBBEN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Frank \nC. Hibben who passed away this past Tuesday, June 11, in my State.\n  Dr. Hibben was a world-renowned archeologist, anthropologist, big-\ngame hunter, author, and philanthropist. He also held the title of \nProfessor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico.\n  As a lifelong hunter and conservationist, Dr. Hibben played a key \nrole in many of New Mexico's conservation and restoration programs. For \n30 years, Dr. Hibben served on the New Mexico Fish and Game commission, \nincluding 28 years as chairman. In this capacity, he spearheaded \nefforts to introduce endangered, and exotic new species to the State of \nNew Mexico in an effort to protect these dwindling game herds from \naround the world.\n  As a archeologist and professor, Dr. Hibben wrote numerous articles \nand books with an emphasis on big-game hunting and the American \nSouthwest. For his work, he was awarded the University of New Mexico's \nZimmerman award, a notable award given by the university to honor an \nalumnus who has contributed significantly to the university and the \nworld at large.\n  However, in spite of his many achievements in archeology and \nconservation, I believe Dr. Hibben will be most remembered for his \nphilanthropy. He was the founding Director of the UNM Maxwell Museum of \nAnthropology and played a key role in its development. In addition, he \nhas been the lead advocate for the development of the Hibben \nArchaeological Research Center which is currently in development. Dr. \nHibben donated $4 million of his own funds to construct this new center \nwhich would showcase the 1.5 million artifacts from the Chaco Culture \nNational Historic Park.\n  New Mexico has lost an invaluable treasure in a man who's \naccomplishments cannot be overstated in their importance both to UNM \nand the State of New Mexico. I join with his friends and family in \nmourning their loss.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Aiding and facilitating a terrorist incident.'.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, last week I voted against tabling the \nMcConnell amendment which would have conditioned punitive damages for \nprivate parties arising out of a terrorist attack to situations where \nthere had been a criminal conviction establishing malicious conduct. \nHad the McConnell amendment not been tabled, I intended to offer a \nsecond-degree amendment which I am now discussing. Since the McConnell \namendment was tabled, I am now calling my amendment up as a first-\ndegree amendment.\n  This amendment establishes a crime for anyone acting with willful and \nmalicious disregard for the life or safety of others, and by such \naction leads to, aggravates, or is a cause of, property damage, \npersonal injury, or death resulting from an act of terrorism.\n  This amendment further provides for a private right of action as \nfollows: Any person may request the Attorney General to initiate a \ncriminal prosecution of the criminal offense I just described. In the \nevent the Attorney General refuses or fails to initiate such a criminal \nprosecution within 90 days, upon petition by any person, the \nappropriate U.S. district court shall appoint an Assistant United \nStates Attorney pro tempore to prosecute the criminal offense if the \ncourt finds that the Attorney General abused his or her discretion by \nrefusing or failing to prosecute.\n  In considering legislation to provide for Federal Government \nassumption of some of the losses resulting from terrorist attacks in \norder to provide insurance coverage, there has been considerable \nsentiment to curtail punitive damages. Understandably, the bill \nprecludes punitive damages against the Federal Government.\n  In one sense, there is no more reason to preclude punitive damages \nagainst private defendants in this situation than in any other. For \nexample, if a building owner chain-locked emergency exits, why should \nhe or she be exempted from punitive damages because people are injured \nor killed by terrorist attack instead of by fire? Perhaps this is just \nanother chapter in the continuing effort to reduce civil remedies for \ntortious conduct.\n  There is another sense that everyone should make some concessions in \ndealing with terrorists. In any event, this situation presents an \nopportunity to deal in a more meaningful way with malicious conduct \ncausing injury or death.\n  It is my judgment that punitive damages have not been an effective \ndeterrent for malicious conduct. Punitive damages are consistently \nreversed or reduced. Cases involving automobiles such as the Ford Pinto \nand the Chevrolet Malibu illustrate the practice of knowingly \nsubjecting consumers to the risk of death or grievous bodily injury \nbecause it is cheaper to pay civil damages than to fix the deadly \ndefect.\n  In the case of ``Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company,'' 119 Cal. App. 3d \n757, the driver died and a passenger suffered permanently disfiguring \nburns on his face and entire body when the Pinto's gas tank exploded in \na rear-end collision. When attorneys got into Ford's records, it was \ndisclosed that the gas tank had not been relocated to a safe place \nbecause the correction would cost $11 per car while the calculation for \ndamages from civil suits was only $4.50.\n  So it is a dollars and cents calculation.\n  In the celebrated case ``Anderson v. General Motors,'' 1999 WL \n1466627, a Chevrolet Malibu fuel tank ruptured in a rear-end collision \ncausing six people to sustain serious burns. The design defect of the \ngas tank was not corrected because a cost-benefit analysis showed it \nwould have cost General Motors $8.59 to fix the fuel system compared to \n$2.40 to pay the civil damages. The Pinto case resulted in a punitive \ndamage award in the amount of $125 million, frequently cited as an \nexcessive punitive damage award. Very infrequently is it noted that the \ntrial court later reduced the award to $3.5 million.\n\n  Similarly, the Malibu verdict of $4.8 billion in punitive damages was \nreduced by the trial judge, with an appeal slashing it even more.\n  Punitive damage awards have resulted in virtually endless delays. In \none of the most celebrated punitive damage cases, ``In re the Exxon \nValdez,'' 270 F.3d 1215, started in 1989, the Ninth Circuit vacated \nsome 12 years later the previously decided, largest-in-history $5 \nbillion punitive damage award.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a memorandum be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my presentation. This memorandum \ndetails punitive damage awards which were reversed and the lengthy \nperiod of time, demonstrating what I am submitting is the \nineffectiveness of punitive damages in deterring malicious conduct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The principal problem with punitive damages or a \nprincipal problem with punitive damages, in addition to the long delays \nand the fact that the awards are reduced, is that if, at the end of the \nlong litigation process punitive damages are collected, they come from \nthe shareholders of the company. They come from General Motors. They \ncome from Ford, or they come from some major corporation. That is why \nit has been my view that an effective deterrent would be to hold the \nindividuals liable for their malicious conduct. And malicious conduct, \nas defined in this bill, is conduct which has a wanton disregard for \nthe life or safety of another person.\n  From my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, I know that \npeople are very concerned about going to jail, much more concerned than \nif at the end of a long litigation process there may be the requirement \nfor a corporation to pay punitive damages, especially in the context \nwhere we know from records from Ford Motor Company in the Pinto case \nthat they made a calculated decision that it was cheaper to pay the \ndamages.\n  Here you have an official locating a gas tank in the rear end of the \ncar resulting in death, resulting in serious bodily injury again and \nagain, and no deterrence, right back at it again and again.\n  A similar case, ``White v. Ford Motor Company,'' CV-N-95-279-DWH \n(PHA), involved a 3-year-old child who was run over, backed over by a \nFord truck with a defective brake. Here, again, in ``White v. Ford \nMotor Company,'' the calculation was made that it is cheaper to pay the \ndamages than it is to correct the defect.\n  That case resulted in a verdict of punitive damages of $150 million \nin a case tried in Reno, NV, and later reduced to $69 million. Years \nhave passed and the matter is still under appeal.\n  The effective way of dealing with this kind of malicious conduct is \nto provide a criminal penalty. A criminal penalty was provided in a \ncase involving Firestone tires, which were mounted on Ford vehicles \nwhich had disclosed numerous problems in 1998 and 1999. Some 88 deaths \nresulted when these tires gave way, the vehicles rolled over. Eighty-\neight people were killed, hundreds were injured, and there was a \ncalculation on the part of Ford and Firestone not to make that \ndisclosure, not to file it with the appropriate Federal officials.\n  An internal Ford memorandum on March 12, 1999, considered whether \ngovernmental officials in the United States ought to be notified and a \ndecision was made not to notify Federal officials, so they could keep \non selling\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nthe Firestone tires on the Ford cars. It is one of the really great \ntragedies. I had introduced legislation to make that conduct a crime.\n  With some modifications that provision was incorporated in Public Law \n106-414 on November 1, 2000, creating a 15-year sentence for officials \nwhere they withhold information on defective products from governmental \nregulators.\n  Mr. President, in offering the amendment which I am currently \ndiscussing, the effort is being made to substitute an effective remedy \nwhich would hold corporate officials liable for the damages which they \ncause as a result of malicious conduct.\n  The provisions which were offered by Senator McConnell in the \namendment which was tabled last week required that a criminal \nconviction be established before someone would be liable for punitive \ndamages, and that provision has been carried over to the amendment \nwhich I am offering today.\n  I have added to that amendment a provision for a private right of \naction. It is very difficult on some occasions to persuade the \nprosecuting attorney to initiate a criminal prosecution. That is a \nmatter which is customarily viewed as discretionary.\n  The prosecutor--and I have had a lot of experience with this myself \nhas many cases he has to try and may choose not to initiate the \nprosecution. So, in order to activate the provision for punitive \ndamages, where someone is convicted of a crime with the requisite \nmalicious conduct, my amendment provides that any person can ask the \nAttorney General of the United States to initiate a prosecution. If the \nAttorney General refuses to initiate the prosecution within 90 days, \nthen the individual may petition the court for leave to be appointed as \nan Assistant United States Attorney pro tempore. In other words, on a \nprivate prosecution there would have to be a showing that the \nprosecuting attorney had abused his or her discretion in failing or \nrefusing to initiate the prosecution. Such private actions are \ncommonplace in U.S. courts.\n\n  New York has such a procedure, Minnesota, North Dakota, Florida, \nArkansas, Iowa, Montana, Ohio, and Oklahoma. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a memorandum be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my oral \npresentation which summarizes the specifics of where private \nprosecutions have been initiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is worthy of note that this \nwas a subject of considerable interest to this Senator during my law \nschool days. I wrote a comment which appears at Yale Law Journal, \nvolume 65, page 209, ``Private Prosecution: A Remedy for Unwarranted \nDistrict Attorneys' Inaction.''\n  As this package was put together, I think it offers some guidance for \na way where there might be some relief from punitive damages; although, \nto repeat, I think they have resulted in very little by way of \nliability, for the reasons I have cited and the authorities I have \ncited.\n  I believe it is true the punitive damage possibility is a factor on \nleveraging settlement, but there have been enormous objections to \npunitive damages, and they have created quite a lot of public furor, as \none can see in the $5 billion punitive damage award I discussed \nearlier. The public thinks it is being paid with real money; whereas, \nin fact, when we trace them down, the funds are not paid.\n  I think we need a comprehensive analysis. There is none to my \nknowledge as to what has resulted when punitive damages are sought, \nwhere punitive damages are obtained on a verdict, and what happens, how \nmany of them are actually collected. It would be a good deal more \ndifficult to quantify the effect of punitive damages as leverage on \nsettlements, but I think that, too, would be worthy of study.\n  Most importantly, the justice system ought to be able to reach people \nwho are malicious. Wanton disregard for the safety of another \nconstitutes malice and supports a prosecution for murder in the second \ndegree, which can carry a term up to 20 years. This bill carries a \npenalty up to 15 years because in the Federal system, that is the \nequivalent of a life sentence. Following the precedent of the Ford-\nFirestone matter, the 15-year penalty was provided.\n  I know this amendment is subject to being stricken as being non-\ngermane. When the cloture motion was offered this morning, I voted in \nsupport of it, and it was agreed to. Sixty-five Senators voted in favor \nof it; 31 Senators voted against it. Voting in favor of the cloture \nmotion, I was well aware that were it to pass, this amendment would be \nprecluded, but I considered it much more important to get this bill \nmoving to a conference so that we can have the Government standing \nbehind certain insurance policies so we can move ahead with very \nimportant commercial transactions in this country which are now being \nheld up.\n  It may be that this format will be useful in the conference committee \nwhere I believe the House has stricken punitive damages.\n  This may be an accommodation where punitive damages would still be \navailable, but there would first have to be a criminal conviction. A \nmore important part of the provision would be that those who are \nmalicious and cause death or injury to other people would be held for a \nvery serious criminal sanction.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       The prototype case for the proposition that punitive \n     damages litigation is ``virtually endless'' is In re the \n     Exxon Valdez, the latest iteration of which is found at 270 \n     F.3d 1215, (9th Cir. 2001). In the 2001 decision, the 9th \n     Circuit vacated a previously-decided, largest-in-history, $5 \n     billion punitive damages award, and remanded the case to the \n     District Court to determine a lower award under standards \n     specified in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 \n     (1996)(substantive due process review of punitive damage \n     awards under the three ``guideposts'' of defendant \n     reprehensibility, ratio analysis, and criminal penalties \n     comparability), and Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman \n     Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001)(requiring de novo \n     review on appeal). Thus, litigation stemming from a March \n     1989 accident/oil spill continues into its 11th year--and, \n     essentially, is back to ``square one'' on the issue of \n     punitive damages. See also Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. \n     Haslip, 499 U.S. 1 (1991)(ten-year litigation stemming from \n     insurance agent's 1981 misappropriation of insurance premium \n     payments).\n       The key cases cited in Exxon Valdez, BMW of North America, \n     Inc. and Cooper Industries, Inc. themselves had lengthy \n     procedural histories--the BMW case running from 1990-1997, \n     and Cooper running from 1995 to the present. See also 2660 \n     Woodley Road Joint Venture v. ITT, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 439 \n     (D.Del., January 10, 2002)(granting motion for new trial on \n     the issue of the size of punitive damages awarded in a 1997 \n     commercial contract breach case); Dallas v. Goldberg, 2002 \n     U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8829 (SDNY, May 20, 2002)(ruling on the \n     admissibility of evidence in computing the amount of punitive \n     damages in ongoing Sec. 1983 action stemming from a 1994 \n     police incident); Silivanch v. Celebrity Cruise Inc., 2000 \n     U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12155 (August 23, 2000)(a procedural ruling \n     on allocation of punitive damages stemming from a 1994 cruise \n     exposure to ``Legionnaires' Disease''). State court cases are \n     at least as striking. See, e.g., Torres v. Automobile Club of \n     Southern Cal., 937 P.2d 290 (Cal. 1997)(remanding for a new \n     trial on all issues; litigation initially filed in 1986); \n     Moeller, et. al. v. American Guarantee Insurance Co., 707 So. \n     2d 1062 (Miss. 1996)(final decision in 1996 on case filed in \n     1982); Abramczyk, et. al. v. City of Southgate, 2000 Mich. \n     App. LEXIS 530 (2000)(reversing award of punitive damages and \n     remanding for new trial; litigation filed in 1996); Dixie \n     Insurance Company v. Mooneyhan, 684 So. 2d 574 (Miss. 1996) \n     (remanding for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages; \n     litigation filed in 1987).\n       To summarize, then, litigation on the issue of punitive \n     damage can--and does--stretch out over a period of years \n     (numerous appellate cases show a pattern of at least 4-6 \n     years and longer, as in the case of Exxon Valdez and Cooper \n     Industries). Recent trends have caused one commentator to \n     state as follows: ``The Supreme Court's . . . decision [in \n     Cooper], with its mandate of de novo appellate review of \n     punitive damages jury verdicts in all cases, may consign \n     state and federal courts to an endless round of institutional \n     second-guessing . . . .''\n       Cabraser, E.J.

Rev. 979, 986 \n     (2001)(emphasis added). Thus, the ``endless'' nature of \n     punitive damages litigation will--at least according to this \n     commentator (a tobacco litigation plaintiffs' attorney)--only \n     get worse.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n       There are several states that through statute or care \n     precedent allow a court to appoint a special prosecutor in \n     the event that the district attorney is unable or unwilling \n     to prosecute a case. The following is a summary of the \n     applicable statute or case law in several states authorizing \n     the replacement of prosecutors.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n                                statute\n\n       New York--NY CLS County Sec. 701 provides that when a \n     district attorney cannot attend in a court in which he or she \n     is required by law to attend or is disqualified from acting \n     in a particular case, the criminal court may appoint another \n     attorney to act as special district attorney ``during the \n     absence, inability or disqualification of the district \n     attorney.''\n       Pennsylvania--71 P.S. Sec. 732-205 provides that the \n     Attorney General shall have the power to prosecute in any \n     county criminal court upon the request of a district attorney \n     who lacks the resources to conduct an adequate investigation \n     or prosecution or if there is actual or apparent conflict of \n     interest. Also, the Attorney General may petition the court \n     to permit him or her to supersede the district attorney in \n     order to prosecute a criminal action if he or she can prove \n     by a preponderance of the evidence that the district attorney \n     has failed or refused to prosecute and such failure or \n     refusal constitutes an abuse of discretion.\n       Minnesota--Minn. Stat. Sec. 388.12 provides that a judge \n     may appoint an attorney to act as or in the place of the \n     county attorney either before the court or the grand jury.\n       North Dakota--If a judge finds that the state's attorney is \n     absent or unable to attend the state's attorney's duties, or \n     that the state's attorney has refused to perform or neglected \n     to perform any of his duties to institute a civil suit to \n     which the state or county is a party and it is necessary that \n     the state's attorney act, the judge shall (1) request that \n     the district attorney take charge or the prosecution or (2) \n     appoint an attorney to take charge of the prosecution.\n       Tennessee--Tenn. Const. art. VI, Sec. 6 provides that in \n     all cases where the Attorney for any district fails or \n     refuses to attend and prosecute according to law, the Court \n     shall have power to appoint an Attorney pro tempore.\n\n\n                                case law\n\n       Florida--Taylor v. Florida, 49 Fla. 69 (1905)--The Supreme \n     Court of Florida held that absent an express legislative \n     statement prohibiting a court from doing so, in the event the \n     state attorney refuses to represent the state, that a court \n     has the inherent power to appoint another attorney.\n       Arkansas--Owen v. State, 263 Ark 493 (1978)--The Supreme \n     Court of Arkansas held that ``[i]t is well settled that the \n     circuit judge had the power to appoint a special prosecuting \n     attorney.'' Various other state courts have embraced the \n     inherent power concept of a court to appoint a special \n     prosecutor in a criminal case. See White v. Polk County, 17 \n     Iowa 413 (1864); Territory v. Harding, 6 Mont. (1887); State \n     v. Henderson, 123 Ohio St. 474 (1931); Hisaw v. State, 13 \n     Okla. Crim. 484 (1917).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to note for the record two \nprevious statements I made on this subject, one on September 7, 2000, \nappearing in the Congressional Record beginning at page S-8188, and \nalso a statement on September 15, 2000, appearing in the Congressional \nRecord on page S-8625. I would note that my statement of September 7, \n2000, provides some more detailed facts concerning the Ford-Firestone \nissue and discusses several other cases involving punitive damages.\n  I note one other consideration, and that is, I am aware that in \nsubscribing to the requirement that there is a criminal prosecution as \na basis for an award of punitive damages, that does require proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. On punitive damages, there have been varying \nstandards applied, for example, clear and convincing evidence. And \nwhile proof beyond a reasonable doubt is obviously more than a \npreponderance of the evidence, it is my view that where you deal with \nthese horrendous kinds of cases--the Pinto, where there is a \ncalculation regarding the gas tank in the rear of the car, or the Ford-\nFirestone case--in these kinds of cases where we are really looking to \nmake an example, that the proof will be there for proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\n  Having had some considerable experience prosecuting criminal cases, \nit has been my view that in most situations the vagaries of burdens of \nproof--beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing evidence, \npreponderance of the evidence--really are not the ultimate \ndeterminants. But to the extent that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is \nan additional burden, I think the gain in moving in this direction to \nimpose criminal liability is certainly worth it from the point of view \nof public policy.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I understand we are going to be voting \non a very important bill at about 3:45, in just 20, 25 minutes. I \nsupport the bill on terrorism insurance creating a mechanism for us to \ncreate a system in this country for a new kind of insurance, \nunfortunately, one for which there has become an apparent need since \nSeptember 11, and without which there would be a great hardship for our \nbanking and financial industries and also for our real estate \ndevelopers. Frankly, all businesses--many in Louisiana--are affected \nacross our Nation.\n  So I am going to be supportive of this terrorism insurance bill, and \nhave been supportive of it in the process of trying to bring it to the \nfloor for a final vote.\n  But I want to take a few minutes, before we actually vote on that \nbill, to speak on an issue that is not directly before the Senate but \nis something in which many of us are involved, and for which we are \ntrying to come up with some solutions. This is the very important issue \ninvolving the subject of cloning. It involves issues related to \npotential research in cloning.\n  We believe this is a subject the Senate and Congress is going to have \nto address, and we are attempting to address it. There are various \ndifferences of opinion about how to do that. So I come to the floor to \nspeak for a minute while we have some time.\n  First of all, as you know, Madam President, and as many of my \ncolleagues know, I am working with Senator Brownback and Senator Frist \nand others to try to fashion a position on this bill that would \nbasically create a moratorium of some type--either long term, short \nterm, or intermediate term--because we believe this is an issue with \nserious ethical considerations and one that we, as a Congress, and as \nleaders, should have to give very careful consideration to before we \nwould go forward.\n  That has been the essence of our approach, just trying to slow things \ndown so that perhaps we could get enough information to say that we \nshould not, at any time, under any circumstance, go forward with human \ncloning. But the basis of our approach has been a moratorium to give us \nmore time to get some of this important information out to the public.\n  This is an issue of great concern to the public. Generally, I think \npeople want to be supportive of ethical kinds of research, particularly \nfor the development of cures for diseases. Juvenile diabetes comes to \nmind; also cures for cancer and spinal cord injuries.\n  We want to be very supportive of ethical approaches to research to \nprovide cures for people who are suffering: children, adults, older \npeople. I think this Senate has gone on record, in a truly bipartisan \nfashion, supporting the increase in funding for the National Institutes \nof Health, and it has been a remarkable increase in funding. I, for \none, have been very strongly supportive of that funding and want it to \ncontinue.\n  But I want to spend a moment talking about some of the problems--\nethical and otherwise--associated with the process of human cloning and \nto suggest that the Feinstein-Kennedy approach, which basically would \nbe asking the Senate, if you will--and why I am not supporting that \napproach--and Congress to consider, for the first time, sanctioning or \nlegalizing human cloning.\n  I do not think there is enough information for us to make that \ndecision. Let me give you a couple of reasons.\n  First of all, some of the proponents of human cloning--people who say \nwe should go forward with human cloning--try to make a distinction \nbetween human cloning and therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning \nor nuclear transfer.\n  One of the points I want to make is that human cloning is human \ncloning\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nis human cloning. It is just a matter of where you stop the process. \nThe process is exactly the same. Terms have been used to describe it in \na variety of different ways. There may be many terms, but there is just \none process. There may be many names, but there is one process.\n  As shown on this chart, it is the one process that we are talking \nabout. There are not two or three or four processes; there is one \nprocess. That process involves an unfertilized egg and a cell from an \nadult stem cell. The nucleus is removed and put into this unfertilized \negg, and it becomes basically an embryo.\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy-Specter approach says that we should basically \nauthorize this for the first time, say it is legal, authorize it, and \nengage in the creation of a human embryo--not a plant, not an animal, \nbut a human embryo; and then just say at a certain point--whether it is \n12 days or 14 days or 16 days--that embryo would then be destroyed, \nbasically before it is implanted. That is the Feinstein-Kennedy-\nSpecter approach.\n\n  Senator Brownback and I--because of many similar concerns and some \ndifferent concerns--and Senator Frist believe the line should be drawn \nat this point until we can make a better determination about the risks \nand benefits associated with human cloning; that is, to stop the \nprocess before it begins.\n  One of the reasons we believe this--although the law might try to \ndraw a line here after the embryo has been created--is because it is \ngoing to be very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce this line \nbecause somewhere, some time, that line is going to be pierced and we \nwill end up having a cloned embryo implanted. Then the question is, \nWhat do you do then?\n  The possibilities of passing any kind of so-called compromise that \nwould legalize and authorize human cloning for the first time in our \nNation's history could get us on to a very slippery slope. That is why \nsome of us are urging to slow it down, have more study, and have a \nshort-term moratorium, which even President Clinton, in his term as \nPresident, said--of course, when Dolly, the sheep, was created--that is \nexactly what we should do until we get more information about the \nbenefits and risks associated with cloning.\n  So it is not only President Bush who is urging us to slow down, but \nboth Democrat and Republican administrations. And you can understand \nwhy. It puts us on a very slippery slope if we--and I hope we do not; \nand I am going to fight to make sure we do not--start with the premise \nthat we can legalize human cloning, authorize it, potentially even fund \nit with Government funding; that we at least legalize it so that \nmillions of private dollars flow into the research on human cloning, \nharvesting, creating these millions of embryos in labs all around the \ncountry and supporting their development in labs all around the world--\nharvesting them and destroying them, harvesting them and destroying \nthem, harvesting them and destroying them.\n  Then, at some point, because these are not Government-run labs, these \nare private sector labs, these are people who will be working--to give \neverybody the benefit of the doubt, let's say most people are working \non some potential cures for diseases, although they may be far in the \ndistance, but it is not inconceivable, and it is common sense to \nbelieve that at some point somebody--a scientist, a patient, a woman, a \ncouple--is going to push the envelope, implant what is a legal clone, \nand then look at us or go call a press conference and say: Now what? It \nis a clone that has been created because we have legalized it. It is a \nclone. We will have legalized it, if we pass a bill that does legalize \nit. And then the question is, What are you going to do about it?\n  Once a clone is implanted, what do we do if it is delivered or born \nhealthy? That is one issue. What if it is born grossly mutilated, which \nis probably, based on the Dolly, the sheep, experiment and research, \ngoing to happen because 275 embryo trials were used to create Dolly, \nthe sheep. All of them ended in death or destruction to the creature, \nthe clone being created, and then finally a clone was successfully \ndelivered.\n  For us to think that this is the time--there has been only one \nhearing in a Senate committee on this subject, at least in recent \nyears; perhaps there were some many years ago, but I don't think so--to \nmove forward with a bill that would authorize human cloning is at best \npremature and, frankly, in my opinion, at this particular point, wholly \nunproven technology with tremendous ethical questions and great \ndifficulty in trying to police what would basically be an authorized \nlegal process of creating for the first time in America human clones.\n  That is as simple as I can state it. There is not a difference \nbetween therapeutic cloning or nuclear transfer. There are many names \nfor it, but it is one process. It is the same process. The issue is, \nshould we start that process and, if so, where should we stop it. \nAnother question is, Could you really stop it once it is started?\n  The other reason I am suggesting a pause, a moratorium of some \nnature, maybe 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, enough time for us to develop \na blue ribbon panel of scientists, not with preordained notions but \ntruly a group of scientists who can help us as a nation figure out what \nwould be, if any, benefits of human cloning, we have to realize that \nright now in the body of the law we are not even engaging in the full \nrange of stem cell research that holds tremendous potential for the \ndiscovery of cures for many of these diseases.\n  We have very limited research on stem cells going on in this country, \neither adult or embryonic stem cells. Why? Because we have not even \ncome to a consensus on that. Human cloning takes us many steps past \nthat issue. We can work on nonclones. We can work on noncloned embryos \nand still get a tremendous amount of benefit without the terrible \nethical consideration this raises.\n  The third issue is, if you think about it, even in a macro sense, \neven those of us who are not trained as doctors or scientists could \nunderstand that one issue that might compel a person, a family, a \ngrieving parent over a fatally ill child or a spouse over another \nfatally ill spouse would be if the research or the benefits could not \nbe derived from regular embryos or from stem cells on nonclones, and \nthe only way to cure this person's particular disease would be to get \nsomething harvested from a clone. That is the rejection issue.\n  If everything else has been exhausted, none of the other methods or \nprocedures is working in other areas, then perhaps we would have to get \ntissue or research or some piece of a cell from a cloned embryo. We are \nso far from making that determination. I have not read one scientific \nstudy, one legitimate group of scientists anywhere, not any prize \nwinners, not any research has been done or even theorized that that \nwould be the only way, the rejection issue, to overcome the objections \nto cloning.\n  Those of us who are urging a moratorium are not against research. We \nare strongly--many of us--supportive of stem cell research. But to rush \nheadlong into a process that will for the first time legalize human \ncloning because there might be a slight benefit, which is totally \nunproven, to get over a rejection issue by using a human clone is a \nreal stretch, and it is very premature.\n\n  What I am hoping is that we can continue this debate for Members to \ncome to the floor and speak about some of these issues at the \nappropriate time. We don't want to hold up other important bills. But \nthis is a very important bill for our Nation. It will set a pace, a \ndirection for our research.\n  I am hoping in the next several days and weeks we can come up with a \ncompromise on this issue that will not authorize the creation of clones \nbut that will allow us some more time to study the benefits of human \ncloning, if there are any, if it can be proven, and if those benefits \noutweigh the grave risk, the tremendous risk associated with legalizing \nhuman cloning, and then trying to stop the implantation of the clones. \nI think it puts our society at a great risk, at a great disadvantage, \nto try to regulate something we have never tried to regulate before.\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy approach is not a ban on human cloning; it is \nan exception to the ban on human cloning. It would authorize and \nlegalize human cloning for the first time in our Nation's history. We \nhave to be very careful before we open what could be a Pandora's box or \nat least get us on a slippery slope towards a system where we\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nhave actually legalized and authorized the development of human clones.\n  If this study comes out and the research suggests the only way to \nfind cures for this disease for this particular individual might be to \nexplore the benefits or to explore the opportunities in a clone, maybe \nsome ethical considerations would be outweighed if a life could be \nsaved or if this is the only way to save a life. But we are not \nanywhere near that.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a very close look at what Senator \nBrownback and Senator Frist and I will suggest as a compromise to get \nus through these next years, using our good values and our common sense \nand our ethics, always promoting good research and good science, but \nnot getting ourselves in a direction where we cannot pull back and \ncausing our population to have to deal with the birth of a first human \nclone.\n  To then have to ask ourselves, why didn't we do something more to \nstop this and what do we do now that we have the first clone alive and \nin the world--we have to think about it.\n  I hope we can come to terms with this issue. That is why I wanted to \nspend some time speaking about it.\n  It is a very exciting time in science. We are exploring and inventing \nand discovering things people even 25 or 30 or 40 years ago thought \ncould never possibly be. There are some wonderful things about science \nand discovery, but there are limits that sometimes need to be placed. \nWe have now for the first time in human history come to terms with the \nfact that we can create not a plant clone, not an animal clone, but the \npotential to create a human clone.\n  The question before the Congress is, Should we start that process? I \nam saying as simply as I can, before we start, we had better be sure of \nwhat we are going to do, when basically the line we draw is breached, \nas surely as it will be one day, and make sure we can draw a line and \nset a framework in place that minimizes the chances of a human clone \nbeing born in our lifetime or forever.\n  I think it is definitely worth debating and worth considering. I \nyield back the remainder of my time. I see my colleague from the great \nState of Connecticut is with us.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have two \narticles by Charles Krauthammer printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2002]\n\n                         Research Cloning? No.\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Proponents of research cloning would love to turn the \n     cloning debate into a Scopes monkey trial, a struggle between \n     religion and science. It is not.\n       Many do oppose research cloning because of deeply held \n     beliefs that destroying a human embryo at any stage violates \n     the sanctity of human life. I respect that view, but I do not \n     share it. I have no theology. I do not believe that \n     personhood begins at conception. I support stem cell \n     research. But I oppose research cloning.\n       It does no good to change the nomenclature. The Harry and \n     Louise ad asks, ``Is it cloning?'' and answers, ``No, it uses \n     an unfertilized egg and a skin cell.''\n       But fusing (the nucleus of) a ``somatic'' cell (such as \n     skin) with an enucleated egg cell is precisely how you clone. \n     That is how Dolly the sheep was created (with the cell taken \n     not from the skin but from the udder). And that is how pig, \n     goat, cow, mouse, cat and rabbit clones are created.\n       The scientists pushing this research go Harry and Louise \n     one better. They want to substitute the beautifully sterile, \n     high-tech sounding term SCNT--``somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer''--for cloning. Indeed, the nucleus of a somatic \n     cell is transferred into an egg cell to produce a clone. But \n     to say that is not cloning is like saying: ``No, that is not \n     sex. It is just penile vaginal intromission.'' Describing the \n     technique does not change the nature of the enterprise.\n       Cloning it is. And it is research cloning rather than \n     reproductive cloning because the intention is not to produce \n     a cloned child but to grow the embryo long enough to \n     dismember it for its useful scientific parts.\n       And that is where the secularists have their objection. \n     What makes research cloning different from stem cell \n     research--what pushes us over a moral frontier--is that for \n     the first time it sanctions the creation of a human embryo \n     for the sole purpose of using it for its parts. Indeed, it \n     will sanction the creation of an entire industry of embryo \n     manufacture whose explicit purpose is not creation of \n     children but dismemberment for research.\n       It is the ultimate commodification of the human embryo. And \n     it is a bridge too far. Reducing the human embryo to nothing \n     more than a manufactured thing sets a fearsome desensitizing \n     precedent that jeopardizes all the other ethical barriers we \n     have constructed around embryonic research.\n       This is not just my view. This was the view just months ago \n     of those who, like me, supported federally funded stem cell \n     research.\n       The clinching argument then was this: Look, we are simply \n     trying to bring some good from embryos that would otherwise \n     be discarded in IVF clinics. This is no slippery slope. We \n     are going to put all kinds of safeguards around stem cell \n     research. We are not about to start creating human embryos \n     for such research. No way.\n       Thus when Senators Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter were \n     pushing legislation promoting stem cell research in 2000, \n     they stipulated that ``the stem cells used by scientists can \n     only be derived from spare embryos that would otherwise be \n     discarded by in vitro fertilization clinics.'' Lest there be \n     any ambiguity, they added: ``Under our legislation, strict \n     federal guidelines would ensure [that] no human embryos will \n     be created for research purposes.''\n       Yet two years later, Harkin and Specter are two of the most \n     enthusiastic Senate proponents of creating cloned human \n     embryos for research purposes.\n       In testimony less than 10 months ago, Senator Orrin Hatch \n     found ``extremely troubling'' the just-reported work of the \n     Jones Institute, ``which is creating embryos in order to \n     conduct stem cell research.''\n       The stem cell legislation Hatch was then supporting--with \n     its ``federal funding with strict research guidelines,'' he \n     assured us--was needed precisely to prevent such ``extremely \n     troubling'' procedures.\n       That was then. Hatch has just come out for research cloning \n     whose entire purpose is ``creating embryos in order to \n     conduct stem cell research.''\n       Yesterday it was yes to stem cells with solemn assurances \n     that there would be no embryo manufacture. Today we are told: \n     Forget what we said about embryo manufacture; we now solemnly \n     pledge that we will experiment on only the tiniest cloned \n     embryo, and never grow it--and use it--beyond that early \n     ``blastocyst'' stage.\n       What confidence can one possibly have in these new \n     assurances? This is not a slide down the slippery slope. This \n     is downhill skiing. And the way to stop it is to draw the \n     line right now at the embryo manufacture that is cloning--not \n     just because that line is right, but because the very notion \n     of drawing lines is at stake.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 27, 2001]\n\n                         A Nightmare of a Bill\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Hadn't we all agreed--we supporters of stem cell research--\n     that it was morally okay to destroy a tiny human embryo for \n     its possibility curative stem cells because these embryos \n     from fertility clinics were going to be discarded anyway? \n     Hadn't we also agreed that human embryos should not be \n     created solely for the purpose of being dismembered and then \n     destroyed for the benefit of others?\n       Indeed, when Senator Bill Frist made that brilliant \n     presentation on the floor of the Senate supporting stem cell \n     research, he included among his conditions a total ban on \n     creating human embryos just to be stem cell farms. Why, then, \n     are so many stem cell supporters in Congress lining up behind \n     a supposedly ``anti-cloning bill'' that would, in fact, \n     legalize the creation of cloned human embryos solely for \n     purposes of research and destruction?\n       Sound surreal? It is.\n       There are two bills in Congress regarding cloning. The \n     Weldon bill bans the creation of cloned human embryos for any \n     purpose, whether for growing them into cloned human children \n     or for using them for research or for their parts and then \n     destroying them.\n       The competing Greenwood ``Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001'' \n     prohibits only the creation of a cloned child. It protects \n     and indeed codifies the creation of cloned human embryos for \n     industrial and research purposes.\n       Under Greenwood, points out the distinguished bioethicist \n     Leon Kass, ``embryo production is explicitly licensed and \n     treated like drug manufacture.'' It becomes an industry, \n     complete with industrial secrecy protections. Greenwood, he \n     says correctly, should really be called the ``Human Embryo \n     Cloning Registration and Industry Facilitation and Protection \n     Act of 2001.''\n       Greenwood is a nightmare and an abomination. First of all, \n     once the industry of cloning human embryos has begun and \n     thousands are being created, grown, bought and sold, who is \n     going to prevent them from being implanted in a woman and \n     developed into a cloned child?\n       Even more perversely, when that inevitably occurs, what is \n     the federal government going to do: Force that woman to abort \n     the clone?\n       Greenwood sanctions licenses and protects the launching of \n     the most ghoulish and dangerous enterprise in modern \n     scientific history: the creation of nascent cloned human life \n     for the sole purpose of its exploitation and destruction.\n       What does one say to stem cell opponents? They warned about \n     the slippery slope. They said: Once you start using discarded \n     embryos, the next step is creating embryos for their parts. \n     Frist and I and others have argued: No, we can draw the line.\n       Why should anyone believe us? Even before the President has \n     decided on federal support\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n     for stem cell research, we find stem cell supporters and \n     their biotech industry allies trying to pass a bill that \n     would cross the line--not in some slippery-slope future, but \n     right now.\n       Apologists for Greenwood will say: Science will march on \n     anyway. Human cloning will be performed. Might as well give \n     in and just regulate it, because a full ban will fail in any \n     event.\n       Wrong. Very wrong. Why? Simple: You're a brilliant young \n     scientist graduating from medical school. You have a glowing \n     future in biotechnology, where peer recognition, \n     publications, honors, financial rewards, maybe even a Nobel \n     Prize await you. Where are you going to spend your life? \n     Working on an outlawed procedure? If cloning is outlawed, \n     procedure? If cloning is outlawed, will you devote yourself \n     to research that cannot see the light of day, that will leave \n     you ostracized and working in shadow, that will render you \n     liable to arrest, prosecution and disgrace?\n       True, some will make that choice. Every generation has its \n     Kevorkian. But they will be very small in number. And like \n     Kevorkian, they will not be very bright.\n       The movies have it wrong. The mad scientists is no genius. \n     Dr. Frankensteins invariably produce lousy science. What is \n     Kevorkian's great contribution to science? A suicide machine \n     that your average Hitler Youth could have turned out as a \n     summer camp project.\n       Of course you cannot stop cloning completely. But make it \n     illegal and you will have robbed it of its most important \n     resource: great young minds. If we act now by passing Weldon, \n     we can retard this monstrosity by decades. Enough time to \n     regain our moral equilibrium--and the recognition that the \n     human embryo, cloned or not, is not to be created for the \n     sole purpose of being poked and prodded, strip-mined for \n     parts and then destroyed.\n       If Weldon is stopped, the game is up. If Congress cannot \n     pass the Weldon ban on cloning, then stem cell research \n     itself must not be supported either--because then all the \n     vaunted promises about not permitting the creation of human \n     embryos solely for their exploitation and destruction will \n     have been shown in advance to be a fraud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5662-S5663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I rise to speak in \nfavor of S. 2600, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Before I \nget to the substance of the measure, I thank and praise my colleague \nand friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for his extraordinary work \nin drafting a practical, effective solution to the terror insurance \ncrisis.\n  As we all know, this has been an arduous and, at times, frustrating \nprocess. Senator Dodd has proven to be not only tenacious but almost \ndivinely patient in pursuit of this legislation. I congratulate him and \nthank him for the success that I am confident this bill will enjoy when \nit is voted on a little more than an hour from now.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about why this is so important, perhaps \nas a summary as we approach the vote.\n  Property and casualty insurance is not an optional matter for \nbusinesses in our country. Nearly every business I know of buys \ninsurance to protect its equipment, its property, its stock, to guard \nagainst liability, and to safeguard its employees, for instance, under \nState workers compensation laws. Property and casualty insurance is \nrequired by investors and shareholders. Of course, it is required by \nbanks that lend for construction of new buildings or other projects.\n  In the event property and casualty insurance for major causes of loss \nis not available or is prohibitively expensive, businesses face very \npainful choices and, in fact, will probably end up being paralyzed. \nConstruction projects will come to a halt, and banks will not lend. If \none multiplies this across an economy, the impact will be quite severe \nand particularly difficult and painful at this time as our economy \nremains uncertain and flat.\n  We are here today because the ability of businesses to continue \nbuying insurance will be placed at severe risk if we fail to address \nthe way life and risk have changed since the attacks on America of \nSeptember 11. Underwriting an insurance policy obviously requires \ncompanies to assess that risk and to estimate damages in a way that is \nmuch more tangible than most of us have done, although we know our \nlives and our history were changed on September 11.\n  For those in business and in the business of insurance or \nreinsurance, this comes down to an attempt to evaluate that risk in \nterms of probabilities and ultimately dollars and cents.\n  In the case of claims for damages caused by terrorist attacks, there \nis obviously no easy way to do this. There are so many uncertainties, \nbut one thing is certain, and that is that losses from terrorist \nattacks, as we have already painfully seen and felt, can cost tens of \nbillions of dollars, and under worse case scenarios, possibly hundreds \nof billions of dollars.\n  Insurance is a very competitive industry, but what most Americans, \nalthough most have contact with some form of insurance, may not realize \nis that insurance companies need and buy their own insurance. In other \nwords, they are dependent on so-called reinsurers that help them spread \nthe risks that they assume when they sell insurance to us and cover \ntheir losses.\n  When reinsurers will not renew their contracts unless they contain \nterrorism exclusions or limitations, there are going to be an awful lot \nof insurance companies that will not be able to provide terrorism \ncoverage, in most cases not at any cost but in other cases only at a \nprohibitive cost. That is not just a possibility today; that is a very \nreal probability.\n  Across the country, insurers are in danger of losing their contracts \nwith reinsurers because of the reinsurers' unwillingness to accept the \nrisks of possible terrorist attacks. If this happens, and the insurers \nare not able to include terrorism exclusions or limitations, insurers \nmay not be able to offer any policy at any price.\n\n  This is not a matter of speculation anymore. Notices have effectively \ngone out, discussions have occurred, letters have been exchanged \nbetween reinsurers and insurers and those who are insured, as we read \nin the paper today.\n  That uncertainty on the part of the insurance industry has now come \nto the point where it is haunting consumers and will hurt consumers, \npurchasers of insurance, developers, businesses, and real estate \nowners. American businesses will not be able to get the policies they \nneed at a reasonable price. They will not be able to get the financial \nprotection they require.\n  There is nothing we can do in Congress within the limits of our \nConstitution, as I read it, to require by law that insurance companies \nwrite policies that they do not want to write because of what they \nevaluate to be a market and financial factor, but we can and must avoid \ncreating the conditions that force reinsurers to drop insurers and \ninsurers to drop American businesses or charge such exorbitant rates \nthat they may as well be dropping them off their rolls.\n  We have to intervene in this process to create a backup, to create \nenough security for reinsurers to reenter the market and for insurers \nto continue to insure American businesses and keep them going and \ngrowing hopefully at this stage in our economic history.\n  In recognition of this serious crisis, State regulators are already \nconsidering terrorism exclusions, as they must, consistent with their \nresponsibilities to oversee the solvency of the insurance industry, but \nState laws will only patch the problems and leave businesses without \nthe insurance they need to continue operating. They will not eliminate \nthe crisis. It is clear, therefore, that we in Congress must act, and \nthis sensible legislation is clearly the way to do it. This legislation \nwill provide businessowners with the opportunity to buy insurance \nagainst terrorism claims and to do so in the private market as well. It \nwould establish a temporary Federal backstop for insurance to cover \nagainst damages resulting from terrorist attacks, a program that would \nlast for a year and gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority to \nextend the program for another year.\n  This temporary backstop is intended to provide the insurance industry \nwith time to assess the dramatically changed risk of claims resulting \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  As the industry determines how to price the risk and determine \nappropriate premium levels for terrorism insurance, hopefully the need \nfor the Federal emergency backstop we are creating will lessen.\n  I do point out that what this legislation will accomplish is not \nunprecedented. In fact, the Federal Government has a history of \npartnering, if I can put it that way, with the insurance industry to \nprovide coverage for risks that are just too big or unpredictable\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nor uninsurable, literally, for the industry to handle alone. I cite as \nexamples the flood insurance programs, the crop insurance programs, or \nthe nuclear liability insurance programs that the Federal Government is \ninvolved in as a supplement or assist or backstop to private insurance \nindustries. Those risks are, in some ways, actually more insurable than \nterrorism, but in each case the Federal Government stepped in because \nwe understood the very real risk of people having their policies \ndropped and being left without basic protection.\n  In the interest of economic security and in some sense of \nconsistency, we now have to offer the American people a similar \nguarantee after September 11 that insurance coverage will be offered in \nthe case of terrorism.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Dodd and all those who have worked with \nhim, as well as members of the Banking Committee, and, not \nsurprisingly, because of the suffering endured in New York in human and \neconomic terms, our colleagues from New York, Senator Schumer and the \noccupant of the chair, Senator Clinton. I thank them all for their \nleadership. I thank everyone for the ultimate spirit of accommodation \nthat will, I am confident, allow this bill to pass. We need it to \nbecome law as soon as possible, and I am hopeful that today's action \nwill be to exactly that result before it is literally too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5663-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5663-S5664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FAIRDRUGPRICES.ORG\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from \nConnecticut speaking about the bill that is before us, and I certainly \nshare his beliefs about the need for terrorism insurance and hope we \nwill be passing this bill shortly. I found, though, that as I was \nlistening to him today, I was thinking about another kind of terror, \nand insurance we need to be providing, and that is the terror that too \nmany of our citizens, particularly our seniors, experience when they \nfind themselves in a situation with an illness and they cannot afford \nthe medications they need to be well.\n  I think of the terror a breast cancer patient feels when she is told \nshe needs tamoxifen and cannot afford the $136 a month, which it is in \nMichigan, to purchase that tamoxifen. I think of the terror a family \nwith a disabled child feels when they cannot get the medicine they \nneed, or the terror of a small business man or woman when they see \ntheir health care premiums rise 30 to 40 percent this year. They know \nthe majority of that is because of the explosion in the costs of \nprescription drugs. So there are a number of ways in which we need to \nbe addressing terror and fear in our country.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle in the \nSenate, to come together and support a comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, to support the bill that my colleagues, \nSenator Graham and Senator Miller, have introduced--I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of that bill--as a comprehensive response to the terror our \nseniors are experiencing when they are not able to get the desperately \nneeded medications they need to remain in their home, to remain \nhealthy, to be able to continue to live their lives.\n  I was very concerned to see over the weekend and to read today about \nthe actions the House Republicans are taking at this very moment. I was \nhoping, when we pointed out the inadequacies in the bills they have \nbeen talking about, they would make corrections so that we could move \ntogether on a comprehensive bill that is effective for our seniors and \nactually helps them.\n  I am very concerned, when I see the numbers, about what is happening. \nThe bills that are being put forward by the Republicans appear to have \nvery little positive effect and in some cases could even be argued to \nhurt the situation. Families USA has come up with an analysis, and I \nwill quote from their analysis, about the percentage of out-of-pocket \nexpenditures that seniors would have at various levels of their drug \ncosts under the House Republican plan. For a senior who needed to spend \n$1,000 a year, they would find they would still pay 81 percent of that \n$1,000 under the House plan. If they had a $2,000 bill per year, they \nwould still pay about 65 percent. If they had a $3,000 bill per year, \nthey would pay about 77 percent out of their pocket. If they had a \n$4,000 bill per year, they would be paying 83 percent of it. I cannot \nbelieve all of the effort by our colleagues in the House that is going \ninto passing this kind of prescription drug legislation for our \nseniors. That is not good enough. We can do better.\n  I am so pleased our leader has made a personal commitment to make \nsure we bring this bill up in July and we vote on this bill for \nMedicare prescription drug coverage. I am very pleased our bill would \nin fact provide real coverage of 60 percent, 70 percent, of the bill. \nWe would cover the majority of the prescription drug bill for our \nseniors.\n\n  So I am urging once again that our citizens across the country get \nengaged in this debate to make sure that what happens in the Congress \nis the right action. There are a number of consumer groups and senior \ngroups that have come together across the country to form a Web site, \nfairdrugprices.org. I urge people to go to this Web site, log on, and \nsign the petition that they have set up calling on all of us to create \na meaningful prescription drug benefit and lower prices for everyone: \nFor the senior, for the farmer, the small business, the large business, \nanyone who is paying the high prices of prescription drugs. If you go \nto fairdrugprices.org, you can get involved, sign a petition, \ncommunicate with us about what needs to be done. I urge everyone who is \nlistening today to do that.\n  I am very concerned that as we are debating the priorities of the \ncountry--and last week we were debating whether or not to extend a tax \ncut that we know goes overwhelmingly to those at the very top in terms \nof the estate tax and the extension of the tax cut that was put into \nplace for 10 years.\n  It bothers me when I see that in the year 2012, when this would be \nextended, the tax cut would cost $229 billion, which is three times \nmore than they want to dedicate in the House for prescription drug \nhelp, three times more than what they are willing to provide for our \nseniors and people who are disabled or families who have disabled \nchildren, three times more for a tax cut to the very wealthiest \nAmericans who, it is my guess, are not worried about whether or not \nthey can buy their medicine. They are not having to struggle and go \ninto the pharmacy, look at the bill after they give their prescription, \nand walk away with the pills still sitting on the counter because they \nwere not able to afford to pay for them.\n  My guess is that the folks who are being proposed for another tax cut \nare not deciding whether they are going to cut their pills in half or \ntake them every other day or not at all.\n  I support efforts on tax relief, and I support our family-owned \nbusinesses and farmers not having to pay the estate tax, but I also \nknow there is a way to set priorities that will make sure we are \nkeeping the promise of Medicare that was set up in 1965.\n  In 1965, one of the great American success stories was passed by this \nCongress, and that was the promise of health care coverage for our \nseniors and the disabled. But because we have changed the way we \nprovide health care today, people are not going into the hospital, \nprobably not going in for an operation; instead, they have the \nability--all of us do, and a blessed opportunity--to remain at home, to \nreceive prescriptions rather than having an operation. But Medicare \ndoes not cover those outpatient prescriptions.\n  So the great American success story that was passed in 1965 is no \nlonger providing the promise of health care. We are committed to making \nsure that we modernize Medicare, that we update it to cover the \nprescription drugs. I worry, as I see all of the effort going on in the \nother side of the building by our Republican colleagues, all of the \neffort of not only one committee but two committees, and two bills, and \nthen we look at what they are providing, and we see that on average \nthey are providing 20 percent of the costs of prescription drugs. That \nmeans 80 percent is being paid for out of the pockets of\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nour seniors. I suggest that is not the best priority for our country.\n\n  I am very concerned that this is a complicated system they are \nsetting up. There are gaps between $2,000 of out-of-pocket expenses a \nyear and $4,500 or $5,000--we are not sure which number they will end \nup with--but that gap leaves no help for a senior with a bill from \n$2,500 to $5,000. That gap between $2,000 and $5,000 is a gap leaving \nseniors to pay the premium while receiving no assistance.\n  There are serious problems. I am told half of Medicare beneficiaries \nwill receive no drug coverage for at least part of the year. Half of \nthe Medicare beneficiaries will receive no help for at least part of \nthe year under the proposal now being considered in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I am also concerned that rather than relying on the Part B premium as \nwe have provided health care to this point to a private sector/private \nsector-public sector working together on Medicare, they are discussing \nhaving private insurance companies create prescription drug-only \npolicies and relying on private insurance companies to provide this \ncoverage.\n  We hear the insurance companies do not want to write those policies. \nIf those were profitable policies, they would already be writing the \npolicies. It is not profitable to write prescription-only policies for \npeople who need prescriptions. The idea is to spread the risk between \nthose who are healthy and those who need care. Those who are likely to \nwant an insurance policy for prescription drugs probably are using \nprescription drugs. Insurance industry folks say they are not \ninterested.\n  What do our Republican colleagues do? They give dollars to the \ninsurance companies to provide this coverage rather than providing it \nunder Medicare. The Republican bill allows Medicare to pay insurance \ncompanies more in order to write these policies rather than just using \nthe Medicare process that has worked so well.\n  There are a lot of flaws. They are using a structure that does not \nwork with private insurance companies rather than having the clout of \n40 million seniors under Medicare, enabling a lowering of the prices, \nusing a system that is tried and true; they want to bring in a new \nsystem. The reality is there is no interest in the private sector to \nprovide this type of insurance.\n  We see on the other side of the aisle, and the other side of the \nbuilding, two committees working on legislation that, in fact, will do \nlittle to help our seniors, those with disabilities who need help with \nprescription drugs. We can do better. We have the opportunity to do \nbetter.\n  I share from this morning's New York Times a portion of a column by \nPaul Krugman, outlining what is happening. I encourage Members to read \nthis. He says:\n\n       . . . the Senate Democrats have a plan that can be \n     criticized but is definitely workable. The House Republicans, \n     by contrast, have a plan that would quickly turn into a \n     fiasco--but not, of course, until after the next election.\n\n  He then goes on to say:\n\n       . . . Senate Democrats have a plan that is sensible and \n     workable, but House Republicans surely won't agree to \n     anything resembling that plan. Senate Democrats might be \n     bullied into something resembling the House Republican plan, \n     but since that plan is completely unworkable, that's the same \n     as getting no drug plan at all--which, I suspect, is what the \n     Republican leaders really want in any case.\n\n  We are not going to be bullied into a plan that does not do the job. \nThere is no doubt in my mind. We have a commitment. Our seniors have \nheard for too long, too many election cycles, that Medicare will cover \nprescription drugs. I know a lot of seniors are saying nothing will \never change. Yet the prices keep going up, the need for care keeps \ngoing up, and the choices the seniors have to make keep getting bigger \nand bigger and bigger.\n  We can do better than that. We in the Senate are committed to doing \nbetter than that. I urge everyone listening today to engage in this \nfight with us. There are six drug company lobbyists for every one \nMember of the Senate. We need the people's voice. We are willing and \nable and determined to bring a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug \nbill to the floor of the Senate in July. We urge everyone to get \ninvolved in this debate.\n  There are substantive differences in plans and how they will affect \nseniors and families. We need to get through the smoke and mirrors and \ndown to the facts, look at comparisons, have honest critiques, and pass \na bill that works and makes sense. It is time to completely fulfill the \npromise of 1965 with the passage of Medicare, and 2002 is a great time \nto do it. It is long overdue.\n  I invite people to engage in this debate and make sure the best \nproposal passes and passes quickly. I suggest reviewing \nwww.fairdrugprices.org and get involved.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5664-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5664-S5673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that the time between the two \nSenators is equally divided.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are coming down to a vote at 4:45. I \nintend to vote no. I don't expect many other Members to vote no, nor am \nI encouraging people to vote no. But I want to try to explain the \nproblem I have and explain a little bit of the history of this bill so \npeople know where we are coming from.\n  I think we have about 14 minutes each. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has approximately 10 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when terrorism insurance was first \nproposed, the whole logic was that we were going to have the Federal \nGovernment step in to help provide insurance coverage and pay claims \nwhen there was a cataclysmic event.\n  When we first started debating this issue in the House of \nRepresentatives, insurance companies had to pay back money that was \npaid by the Federal Government over $1 billion. When we debated it in \nthe Senate, we concluded that if it had to be paid back, you were not \nproviding the assistance we sought, but we were sure when we initially \ndebated this subject we had a very substantial amount of money that the \ncompanies had to pay before the Federal Government got in the business \nof having to pay. The amount the companies have to pay before the \nFederal Government starts paying is called ``retention.''\n  When we first started to debate this issue, and when we reached an \ninitial bipartisan agreement in October, I believe it was that \ncompanies were required to pay $10 billion before the Federal \nGovernment came in to pay claims. Above that $10 billion, the Federal \nGovernment was to pay 90 percent of the next $90 billion. The logic of \nthe retention--the amount that the insurance companies had to pay--was \nbasically, No. 1, that the insurance companies are selling this \ninsurance and collecting premiums. The fact that they would cover the \ninitial cost was imminently logical.\n  No. 2, we wanted to protect the taxpayer unless there was a \ncataclysmic event.\n  Thirdly, the whole objective of our bill was to try to encourage the \ndevelopment of reinsurance and to encourage syndication so that no one \ninsurance company would write an insurance policy on the Empire State \nBuilding. There might be a lead insurance company that would write the \npolicy. But then they would syndicate and sell off part of the \ninsurance to other companies, or they would simply go into a \nreinsurance market and sell all or part of the policy--the idea being \nto distribute the risk not just throughout the United States but \nthroughout the world.\n  When we reached an agreement in October, the companies had to pay $10 \nbillion before the taxpayer got involved. Many Members of the Senate \nthought that was too low. We reached an agreement. We announced it, and \nthe White House signed off on it.\n  We also protected victims of terrorism from punitive damages and \npredatory losses.\n  In December, we still had not passed a bill. We were 3 weeks away \nfrom 80 percent of the insurance policies in America expiring. There \nwas a belief\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nthat if we did pass a bill right at the end of the session there would \nnot be enough time for syndication and reinsurance to develop. So the \nbill that was written at that time had an individual company retention \nbut not a $10 billion retention.\n\n  This is still very much confused by the media in writing on this \nsubject.\n  The net result is that the biggest insurance company in America--\nAIG--has a retention of about $1.6 billion. The smallest insurance \ncompanies in the country might have a retention that would be in the \ntens of millions. That means that is what they have to pay before the \ntaxpayer pays.\n  That has several problems.\n  No. 1, companies have already collected premiums. Premiums have gone \nup. They had to go up because risks have gone up. But premiums have \ngone up, and insurance companies have collected these premiums. When \nthey wrote the insurance policy, they had no taxpayer backup \nwhatsoever. Now we are coming along, and instead of having $10 billion \nthat the industry has to pay before the taxpayer pays, in some cases \nsome insurance companies will have to pay only millions of dollars \nbefore the taxpayer steps in and pays.\n  It doesn't take a great knowledge of economics or arithmetic to \nfigure out that when people wrote policies and collected premiums based \non having to pay the full cost if a claim was made and the Government \nis going to come in and pay 90 percent of the claim above only a few \nmillion dollars in the case of some insurance companies, that you are \ngoing to create a very substantial shifting of wealth from the \ntaxpayers to the people who have written the policies, if there is a \nmajor claim. And, at a minimum, you are shifting a substantial amount \nof risk from the insurance company to the Federal Government.\n  I am one of a handful of Members of the Senate who thought we ought \nto do a bill. In fact, at one point, I was one of the few people \nwilling to stand up and say so.\n  I have always believed if we were going to do a bill we had to have a \nsubstantial industry retention so the people collecting the premiums \npaid first, and also so that we had an incentive for industry to \nsyndicate to spread the risk, and an incentive to develop reinsurance.\n  I am very concerned that the bill, as it is now written, represents \nan unwarranted shift of risk from the insurance companies to the \ntaxpayer. If there is, God forbid, another attack, it will mean the \nshifting of billions of dollars from the taxpayer to the insurance \ncompanies.\n  But the biggest concern I have is not about taxpayer risk or about \nthe unintended shift of billions of dollars to private interests from \nthe taxpayer. The biggest concern I have is that by reducing the amount \nthat the companies have to pay before the Government pays, that we are \ngoing to reduce the incentive that companies will have to spread the \nrisk to syndicate, to develop reinsurance, and that 2 years from now, \nwhen the bill expires, none of these secondary markets will have \ndeveloped, the Government will have become the primary risk taker, and \nwe will end up extending this indefinitely.\n  In World War II we had a Government program, but we knew World War II \nwas going to end with the signing of a peace treaty. This war is going \nto end with the death of some terrorist, and we are not going to know \nhe was the last terrorist in the world.\n  So I am very concerned that unless we raise this retention level, \nunless we make companies that have collected the premiums pay a \nsubstantial amount of money before the taxpayer pays, that we are never \ngoing to get the Government out of this area of insurance.\n  Our whole focus from the beginning--in fact, I have never heard a \nDemocrat or Republican suggest otherwise--has been that this was a \nbridge to help us get through this period of great uncertainty so that \nultimately these risks could be built into insurance rates.\n  That is where we are. I think we are making a mistake by not \nrequiring the people who collected these premiums to pay a substantial \namount of money first. I think we are planting the seeds to get \nGovernment permanently in the insurance business.\n  Something happened, and it is perfectly reasonable that it would \nhappen. When we were talking about the industry having to pay $10 \nbillion before the taxpayer paid, the industry was delighted that they \nwere going to have the backup of the taxpayer. But in December it was \nsuggested that the industry could pay tens of millions of dollars \nbefore the taxpayer paid. And even though all those insurance policies \nexpired on January 1, many of them were rewritten at substantially \nhigher premiums. I am not complaining. Premiums have to go up because \nrisks have gone up. But now to suggest that we should not make the \nindustry pay up to $10 billion before the taxpayer pays, I think, is \nbasically going back on the deal in which we engaged.\n  I do not doubt that if I were in the insurance business I would \nprobably want the Government to pay the whole claim, and I would want \nto collect the policy, I would want to collect the premiums. But I \nthink we have a gross overreach here that puts the taxpayer at risk at \nan unjustifiable level.\n  Finally, and most importantly, I am concerned that the incentives we \nare creating here will induce companies not to syndicate, not to spread \nrisk as much as they would; and, as a result, the Government will pay \nsooner. I am worried that secondary markets will not develop and the \nGovernment will not be able to get out of the insurance business. And I \nam very much concerned that 2 years from now we will be right back \nhere, and the argument will be made that there is no syndication, that \nthere is no secondary market, and, therefore, the Government has to \nstay in the terrorism insurance business.\n  We can fix that by changing this bill. We have not done that. That is \nwhy I am opposed to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I want to engage, before some \nfinal comments, in a couple of housekeeping matters.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3862\n\n  First, Mr. President, what is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. President, let me point out, one of these amendments is an \namendment that was raised by our colleague from Florida, Senator Bill \nNelson. I thank him for his work on that amendment. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the Senator from Texas to agree to that change we made \nin the legislation.\n  Mr. President, if I may, I would like to speak on this bill in the \nfew remaining minutes we have before the vote. This bill has been 9 \nmonths in the process.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my good friend from Texas. We began \ntogether on this legislation a long time ago, a few weeks after the \ntragic events of September 11. In fact, I recall, very vividly, my \nfriend from Texas leaning over to me and saying we ought to do \nsomething in the area of terrorism insurance, not that we called it \nthat at that particular time, but it was the same idea that is \ncontained in the legislation before the Senate today.\n  So despite whatever differences we may have at this particular \nmoment, I would like to acknowledge his active involvement with this \nissue. He is one of the few people who was consistently interested in \ntrying to get something done here over these many months.\n  It has taken us a long time. This is an arcane subject matter. We are \nliterally doing something we have never done before, at least that I \nknow of.\n  Back in World War II, for acts of war, the Federal Government acted \nas an insurance company. But, obviously, we are not duplicating that \nhere. We are trying to provide a temporary backstop, if you will, to \nallow this market to redevelop over the coming months.\n  So I thank my colleague from Texas for his involvement, despite the \nfact he may disagree with the product we are going to be voting on in a \nfew short moments.\n  I would like to thank the leadership. I thank Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid who have been tremendously helpful in putting this bill \ntogether. I thank Senator Lott and others who understood the importance \nof raising this issue. I thank Senator Sarbanes, the Chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Corzine, who has been tremendously helpful on \nthis. Senator Schumer has also been tremendously helpful.\n  I would also like to thank the 17 members of the minority this \nmorning who voted to invoke cloture. Without their support, we would \nnot be voting on this measure today and moving this process along.\n  Additionally I would like to express my gratitude to President Bush \nand Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. They were very involved in the \nlast few days in getting support for this particular effort. So I thank \nall of them.\n  This is an important moment. This particular proposal or ideas like \nit have been sought by a very diverse group of people in the country. \nOrganized labor to real estate, insurance groups--small businesses and \nlarge--the list is very long of those insurance consumers who have \ndemanded that we act in this area.\n  And why? Very simply, there is a major problem continuing to grow out \nthere. We have seen it growing every day. There was a headline even \ntoday in the local newspaper here in Washington talking about a major \nproblem with the number of mortgage holders, the GMAC Corporation.\n  We heard the other day from the commercial mortgage-backed security \nindustry, and the some $7 billion in decline they have experienced in \nthe first quarter. We have a real bottleneck occurring in major \nconstruction projects, real estate, and development projects across the \ncountry in cities large and small.\n  Yesterday, in my home State of Connecticut, Simon Konover, a \nwonderful developer in my State, has a small hotel, not a large one, at \nBradley International Airport. And he can get no terrorism insurance. \nThat is not a major development project--it is a small hotel at a \nregional airport--and he cannot get terrorism insurance at any cost. So \nthis isn't just major development; it is also small projects where, at \nany cost, you cannot get this product. And if you can get it, it is \nvery costly, as my colleague from Texas has already stated. And I agree \nwith him.\n  This bill is designed to, one, free up that bottleneck, to get the \nprocess moving again.\n  We will know shortly whether or not what we have done is going to \nprovoke that response. We believe it will. This is a 12-month bill with \na possible 12-month extension. It is going to take a Herculean effort \nto get more than that. Our colleagues believe that 2 years is about \nwhat they are willing to try at this particular program. So remember, \nwe are talking about 12 months with a possible extension of 12 more in \norder to get this moving.\n  This legislation is critically important for American workers. We \nhope it\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\nwill dampen the tremendous increase that could occur, in the absence of \nthis bill being done, in premium costs. And it is going to make \navailable a product that we think is going to be critically important \nso that people such as Simon Konover in my State will be able to obtain \ninsurance against terrorist acts. It is going to mean that smaller \ninsurance companies can be involved in this, not just large insurers.\n  One of the reasons we put retention caps on individual companies is \nbecause without doing that you force insolvency upon smaller insurance \ncompanies. Consumers would have very limited choices where that product \nwas unavailable, God forbid we do have an event. The idea that insurers \nare going to go out and gouge their customer base for 1 year with the \nhopes then of retaining that customer base after this bill expires is \nunrealistic, in my view.\n  I have told my colleague from Texas that, as we go into conference, \nif we can get to conference, I am willing to try to work out something \nthat will at least deal with some of the issues he has raised with the \npotential problems he sees in the retention area.\n  On tort reform, the House has significant tort reform. We have some \ntort reform in this bill. All of us understand we are going to probably \ncome back with some additional limited tort reform. That is the way \nthings work out when you have a conference between the House and the \nSenate. I am confident that will be the case as well. I hope our \ncolleagues will support this effort.\n  As I say, it has been 7 months. We are hearing from various groups \nall across the country that believe this is an important issue to \naddress. We know we are trying to deal with homeland security to \nprotect our personal security from terrorist attack. We also need to be \ntalking about economic security and restoring confidence into this \nmarketplace, This is a product that consumers need and must be made \navailable by the private sector. If we perform our duties today and \nprovide this critical backstop, I believe that it will result in the \nindustry then stepping up to the plate and freeing up this bottleneck I \nhave described in the terrorism insurance area.\n  There is no guarantee it is going to happen. I can't promise \nabsolutely. But I know this much: If we do nothing, I guarantee you \nwill get skyrocketing premium costs. You may not get this product \navailable to those who need it, and those that are able to obtain the \nproduct will pay exorbitantly high premiums for minimal coverage.\n  We have to conference with the House to work out the differences. I \nhope at this hour, at this day, we will not walk away from this \nproblem. There are 100 of us here trying to craft legislation. We all \nbring different ideas to the table. It is not easy to come to a \ncompromise on this kind of an effort, but we have. My hope is that my \ncolleagues will support us, that we will get the bill done. We can send \nit to the President, and we will try to resolve the issue this problem \nhas posed for all of us.\n\n\n                            state preemption\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I recognize the need to move forward on \nthis terrorism insurance bill. I had filed an amendment regarding the \nstate preemption language in this bill. I will not offer that \namendment, but I wonder if the Senator from Connecticut will engage in \na colloquy with me about that provision.\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  This bill would preempt state law with regard to the prior approval \nor a waiting period of terrorism risk insurance. Specifically, section \n7 states, ``rates for terrorism risk insurance covered by this Act and \nfiled with any State shall not be subject to prior approval or a \nwaiting period, under any law of a State that would otherwise be \napplicable.''\n  This language would preempt the law of the State of California and 21 \nother States where prior approval mechanisms for increases in insurance \nrates have been put into place to keep insurance companies from gouging \nconsumers.\n  The bill before us does allow States to invalidate excessive rates \nafter the fact. But it will do nothing for consumers who have already \npaid too much. Prior approval mechanisms are the only way to protect \nconsumers before sky-high rates go into effect.\n  I understand that my colleagues who support this legislation want \nterrorism insurance made available as quickly as possible. And that is \nthe reason for his preemption--to speed up the process. I agree.\n  So to meet both the need for quick insurance availability and the \ndesire to allow states to review rates for at least some period before \nthey go into effect, I had proposed an amendment to replace the blanket \nState preemption language in the bill with more narrow language. My \namendment would have said that terrorism risk insurance would not be \nsubject to a waiting period greater than 60 days under any State law.\n  This would allow California and other States to retain oversight for \nprior approval over egregious increases in terrorism insurance rates \nwhile also making sure that the insurance is made available quickly.\n  Given the number of Americans involved, the taxpayer exposure to \nrisk, and the leverage that insurers will have over consumers, I \nbelieve we must allow States to protect consumers. I hope my colleague \nfrom Connecticut will be willing to work with me on this.\n  Mr. DODD. One of the guiding principles of this bill is that, to the \nextent possible, State insurance law should not be overridden. To that \nend, the bill respects the role of the State insurance commissioners as \nthe appropriate regulators of policy terms and rates.\n  Due to the urgency of the problems that currently exist in the \nmarketplace for terrorism coverage, however, the bill requires that \nonce the Federal program is in place, the States must allow rates for \nterrorism coverage to take effect immediately, without being subject to \na preapproval requirement or a waiting period. The States would, of \ncourse, retain full authority to disapprove any rates that violate \nState laws, which are inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or \nexcessive.\n  I understand that my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, has \nsome concerns about this provision and its effects. I appreciate her \ninterest in this issue, and I want to assure my colleague that I will \nwork with her as this bill moves to conference to try to address her \nconcerns, and to ensure that this provision is as narrowly crafted as \npossible.\n\n\n                 clarification of legislative language\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to correct the Record on a \npoint that I made during a brief floor discussion between myself and \nSenator Specter.\n  At the time, I was under the impression, given a previous \nunderstanding with the leadership, that my legislative language on the \nissue of human cloning had been provided to the majority leader. \nIncluded in my legislative language is a section that pertains to the \npatenting of human embryos.\n  I am now informed that apparently that legislative language was never \nexchanged.\n  I apologize for any confusion that this misunderstanding may have \ncaused.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nexpress my support for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.\n  Exposure to terrorism is not only a threat to our national security, \nbut is also a threat to the United States and global economies. The \nfull extent of insured losses from September 11 has been estimated at \n$70 billion.\n  There is no doubt that these terrorist attacks have resulted in the \nmost catastrophic loss in the history of property and casualty \ninsurance.\n  Even though the insurance industry committed to pay losses resulting \nfrom the attacks, they have indicated a reluctance to continue offering \nterrorism insurance because the risk of future losses is unknown.\n  I and my staff have heard from my constituents in California, who \nhave already suffered from this constriction of the terrorism insurance \nindustry.\n  Some are insurance providers, who have written to say that they are \nafraid that their companies will not survive if they are forced to \nendure another terrorist event without a Federal backstop for terrorism \nreinsurance.\n  Some are businesses whose premiums have risen so drastically in the \npast nine months that they too, risk insolvency.\n  San Francisco's own Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nDistrict, which manages the Golden Gate Bridge, recently had to renew \nits insurance policy. The new policy costs $1.1 million per year for \n$50 million in coverage which does not include terrorism coverage, \ndespite assertions by Governor Davis last year that the bridge was a \ntarget for the terrorist attacks.\n  Last year's policy cost $125,000 for $125 million in coverage, \nincluding coverage for damage due to a terrorist act.\n  This legislation will provide desperately needed stability to the \nterrorism insurance market.\n  It provides a Federal backstop so that the industry can have the \nconfidence to issue new policies, and it enables financial services \nproviders to again finance new commercial property acquisitions and \nconstruction projects.\n  This bill also has some important limits on Federal exposure to \nlosses.\n  First, it is designed to be temporary. The length of the program will \nbe one year, with the option for the Secretary of the Treasury to \nextend it an additional year.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that the Federal Government does not bear \nany responsibility for insurance losses due to punitive damage awards.\n  Punitive damages awards are issued when a defendant has acted in a \nwillful and malicious manner. I don't believe the American taxpayer \nshould be left holding the bag if such judgments are awarded.\n  It is my hope that the passage of this legislation will enable the \nGolden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District, as well as \nother, similarly affected, companies and organizations, in California \nand across the Nation, to obtain the terrorism insurance coverage they \nneed to adequately protect their patrons during these uncertain times.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a unanimous consent request, \nI ask unanimous consent that the time for the vote be extended for 3 \nminutes on this side and 3 minutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the point of order which was sustained as to Amendment No. \n3862, which was my amendment. I had been on the floor awaiting the \nmaking of such a point of order on germaneness. I wanted to make a very \nbrief comment; that is, that the amendment which I have provided was \ngermane when it was filed, which was pre-cloture. I understand that \npost-cloture it is not. I voted for cloture notwithstanding the fact \nthat I knew it would render my amendment non-germane because of my view \nof the importance of passing this bill.\n  I wanted to comment briefly on the amendment because it may yet \nsurface in the conference. Senator McConnell had offered an amendment \nwhich would have eliminated punitive damages unless there was a \ncriminal conviction. I supplemented that amendment by putting in a \nprovision that it would be a Federal crime for someone to be malicious \nand disregard the safety of others, contributing to damages or death in \nthe event of a terrorist attack, and also an additional provision for a \nprivate right of action so that in the event the prosecuting attorney \ndid not act, that a private citizen could petition the court on the \nfailure or refusal of the Attorney General to act so that would \nactivate a criminal prosecution and provide a basis for punitive \ndamages but, more importantly, to move to an area where there is real \nresponsibility for somebody who acts maliciously, resulting in the \ndeath of another person.\n  Punitive damages doesn't reach real responsibility. Punitive damages, \nas I amplified earlier today, are seldom granted but, where they are, \ncome out of the pockets of the shareholders. To hold someone liable to \ngo to jail where they are malicious, resulting in someone's death, that \nis a sanction which means something. That would provide the basis then \nfor a later punitive damage claim.\n  This may be the basis for action in conference. I wanted to take a \nbrief period of time to explain that provision. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before I yield to my colleague from New \nYork, I wish to thank several staff people as well--we don't do that \nenough here--Alex Sternhell and Jessica Byrnes from my own staff. Sarah \nKline, Aaron Klein, Steve Kroll, Wayne Abernathy, Stacie Thomas, Ed \nPagano, Jim Ryan, Jonathan Aldelstein, Jim Williams, Kate Scheeler, \nRoger Hollingsworth . I would also like to thank Laura Ayoud with \nSenate Legislative Counsel for her contribution to this process. We \nthank all of them for their efforts, the leadership staff as well for \ntheir support.\n  Is Senator Corzine going to seek any time at all? We have 4 minutes \nremaining on this side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from New York and then 1 \nminute to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me, once again, thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his leadership and steadfastness, his sensibleness. I also thank my \ncolleague from Texas who has been, even though he didn't get his way on \neverything, a very constructive force in moving this bill forward. I \nappreciate that.\n  I approach this in a few ways. I am delighted that the single company \ncap, so vital to making this legislation work, which I spent a lot of \ntime working on in the early days, has stayed in the bill. I am \nparticularly grateful that the city I represent, New York, and its \nmetropolitan area, will have this bill because terrorism has put a \ncrimp in our economy the way it has in no other city in terms of higher \ncosts, lost new projects, and delays in existing projects.\n  This legislation is probably as vital to New York as just about \nanything we will do with the exception maybe of the generosity that \nthis body and the other have shown to New York in terms of the funding \nwe have received.\n  Most importantly, this has been a test, a test of whether we can meet \nthe post 9-11 challenge. It will be like many tests in the future. \nFirst, government is going to have to play a larger role. The ideology \nthat anything the government does is bad and we must shrink it at all \ncost is over in many areas. The private sector could not solve this \nproblem alone, plain and simple. That is why we came to bipartisan \nagreement that the Federal Government's role should be increased. We \ncan quibble about how much and where, but it was definitely needed. \nThat will be repeated in years to come.\n  Second, this is a problem where the legislature stepped to the plate. \nThe bottom line is this: There was not clamoring from the average \ncitizen for this proposal. Yes, some real estate developers, some \nbankers, some insurance companies, but not much else. Given the \ndivision we had here, it would have been easy to forget it.\n  But we did step to the plate. We are passing what I consider to be \nnot the ideal bill--my ideal bill would have had the Federal Government \nwrite all terrorist insurance, something I worked on with Treasury \nSecretary O'Neill should, God forbid, the next attack occur--but it is \na good product, it is a reasonable product, and it does the job in the \nshort term.\n  Over and over, we are going to be asked as a government to step \nforward and solve a problem before it gets out of control without the \npublic importuning us to do it. That will occur on an issue such as \nnuclear security. That will occur on an issue such as making our health \nsupply system better. It is the kind of challenge we face in the post \n9-11 world: Real, but anticipatory, dealing with a problem that could \nget worse and spiral out of control if we do not act, and we have to \nshow the leadership because it will not be our constituents pushing us.\n  I salute the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from New Jersey, and all my colleagues who worked so hard on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I second the salute of the Senator from \nConnecticut. This is a tremendous step\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nforward in protecting our economy, not protecting insurance companies. \nThis is about jobs. It is about making sure we have economic growth \ngoing forward. It is a bridge. It is not a long-term creation of an \ninsurance function by the Government, but it is a response that the \nGovernment needs to build a bridge to a better marketplace and a more \nsecure economy. This will make a difference to all of America's \neconomic growth, not just regionally.\n  I am really quite pleased we are going to have a chance to vote in a \nminute to do something that will move our economy forward in the post-\nSeptember 11 period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader will be here shortly. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 252, H.R. 3210, the House-passed terrorism \ninsurance bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken; that \nthe text of S. 2600, as amended, if amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We might come to a point where we are ready to do this. We \nare not ready to do it now, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announced that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announced that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property and casualty insurance firms are important \n     financial institutions, the products of which allow \n     mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial \n     resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain \n     stability, while responding to a variety of economic, \n     political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of \n     disruption;\n       (2) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain \n     property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable \n     prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and \n     catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban \n     development, and the construction and maintenance of public \n     and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United \n     States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly \n     interconnected world;\n       (3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the \n     unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of \n     terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the \n     recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the \n     stability of the economy;\n       (4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and cost of future terrorist events, and \n     therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism;\n       (5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal \n     with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and \n     casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events, \n     or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for \n     risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could \n     seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property \n     acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic \n     increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity; \n     and\n       (6) the United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of \n     national crisis, while the financial services industry \n     develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs \n     necessary to create a viable financial services market for \n     private terrorism risk insurance.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent \n     system of shared public and private compensation for insured \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to--\n       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and \n     ensure the continued widespread availability and \n     affordability of property and casualty insurance for \n     terrorism risk; and\n       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets \n     to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build \n     capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State \n     insurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Act of terrorism.--\n       (A) Certification.--The term ``act of terrorism'' means any \n     act that is certified by the Secretary, in concurrence with \n     the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General of the \n     United States--\n       (i) to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to--\n\n       (I) human life;\n       (II) property; or\n       (III) infrastructure;\n\n       (ii) to have resulted in damage within the United States, \n     or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or \n     vessel described in paragraph (3)(A)(ii); and\n       (iii) to have been committed by an individual or \n     individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign \n     interest, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian \n     population of the United States or to influence the policy or \n     affect the conduct of the United States Government by \n     coercion.\n       (B) Limitation.--No act or event shall be certified by the \n     Secretary as an act of terrorism if--\n       (i) the act or event is committed in the course of a war \n     declared by the Congress; or\n       (ii) losses resulting from the act or event, in the \n     aggregate, do not exceed $5,000,000.\n       (C) Determinations final.--Any certification of, or \n     determination not to certify, an act or event as an act of \n     terrorism under this paragraph shall be final, and shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n       (2) Business interruption coverage.--The term ``business \n     interruption coverage''--\n       (A) means coverage of losses for temporary relocation \n     expenses and ongoing expenses, including ordinary wages, \n     where--\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\n       (i) there is physical damage to the business premises of \n     such magnitude that the business cannot open for business;\n       (ii) there is physical damage to other property that \n     totally prevents customers or employees from gaining access \n     to the business premises; or\n       (iii) the Federal, State, or local government shuts down an \n     area due to physical or environmental damage, thereby \n     preventing customers or employees from gaining access to the \n     business premises; and\n       (B) does not include lost profits, other than in the case \n     of a small business concern (as defined in section 3 of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and applicable regulations \n     thereunder) in any case described in clause (i), (ii), or \n     (iii) of subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Insured loss.--The term ``insured loss''--\n       (A) means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism that \n     is covered by primary property and casualty insurance, \n     including business interruption coverage, issued by a \n     participating insurance company, if such loss--\n       (i) occurs within the United States; or\n       (ii) occurs to an air carrier (as defined in section 40102 \n     of title 49, United States Code) or to a United States flag \n     vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, \n     on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance \n     coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), \n     regardless of where the loss occurs; and\n       (B) excludes coverage under any life or health insurance.\n       (4) Market share.--\n       (A) In general.--The ``market share'' of a participating \n     insurance company shall be calculated using the total amount \n     of direct written property and casualty insurance premiums \n     for the participating insurance company during the 2-year \n     period preceding the year in which the subject act of \n     terrorism occurred (or during such other period for which \n     adequate data are available, as determined by the Secretary), \n     as a percentage of the aggregate of all such property and \n     casualty insurance premiums industry-wide during that period.\n       (B) Adjustments.--The Secretary may adjust the market share \n     of a participating insurance company under subparagraph (A), \n     as necessary to reflect current market participation of that \n     participating insurance company.\n       (5) NAIC.--The term ``NAIC'' means the National Association \n     of Insurance Commissioners.\n       (6) Participating insurance company.--The term \n     ``participating insurance company'' means any insurance \n     company, including any subsidiary or affiliate thereof--\n       (A) that--\n       (i) is licensed or admitted to engage in the business of \n     providing primary insurance in any State, and was so licensed \n     or admitted on September 11, 2001;

TERMINATION OF PROGRAM; DISCRETIONARY EXTENSION.\n\n       (a) Termination of Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Program shall terminate 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, unless the Secretary--\n       (A) determines, after considering the report and finding \n     required by this section, that the Program should be extended \n     for one additional year, beginning on the day after the date \n     of expiration of the initial 1-year period of the Program; \n     and\n       (B) promptly notifies the Congress of such determination \n     and the reasons therefor.\n       (2) Determination final.--The determination of the \n     Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be final, and shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n       (3) Termination after extension.--If the Program is \n     extended under paragraph (1), the Program shall terminate 1 \n     year after the date of commencement of such extension period.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 9 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to Congress--\n       (1) regarding--\n       (A) the availability of insurance coverage for acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (B) the affordability of such coverage, including the \n     effect of such coverage on premiums; and\n       (C) the capacity of the insurance industry to absorb future \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, taking into account \n     the profitability of the insurance industry; and\n       (2) that considers--\n       (A) the impact of the Program on each of the factors \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (B) the probable impact on such factors and on the United \n     States economy if the Program terminates 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Finding Required.--A determination under subsection (a) \n     to extend the Program shall be based on a finding by the \n     Secretary that--\n       (1) widespread market uncertainties continue to disrupt the \n     ability of insurance companies to price insurance coverage \n     for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, thereby \n     resulting in the continuing unavailability of affordable \n     insurance for consumers; and\n       (2) extending the Program for an additional year would \n     likely encourage economic stabilization and facilitate a \n     transition to a viable market for private terrorism risk \n     insurance.\n       (d) Continuing Authority To Pay or Adjust Compensation.--\n     Following the termination of the Program under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary \n     to ensure payment, reimbursement, or adjustment of \n     compensation for insured losses arising out of any act of \n     terrorism occurring during the period in which the Program \n     was in effect under this Act, in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 4 and regulations promulgated \n     thereunder.\n       (e) Repeal; Savings Clause.--This Act is repealed at \n     midnight on the final termination date of the Program under \n     subsection (a), except that such repeal shall not be \n     construed--\n       (1) to prevent the Secretary from taking, or causing to be \n     taken, such actions under subsection (d) of this section and \n     sections 4(e)(4), 4(e)(5), 5(a)(1), 5(c), 5(d), and 5(e) (as \n     in effect on the day before the date of such repeal), and \n     applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, during any \n     period in which the authority of the Secretary under \n     subsection (d) of this section is in effect; or\n       (2) to prevent the availability of funding under section \n     9(b) during any period in which the authority of the \n     Secretary under subsection (d) of this section is in effect.\n       (f) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Secretary should make any determination under \n     subsection (a) in sufficient time to enable participating \n     insurance companies to include coverage for acts of terrorism \n     in their policies for the second year of the Program, if the \n     Program is extended in accordance with this section.\n       (g) Study and Report on Scope of the Program.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary, after consultation with the \n     NAIC, representatives of the insurance industry, and other \n     experts in the insurance field, shall conduct a study of the \n     potential effects of acts of terrorism on the availability of \n     life insurance and other lines of insurance coverage.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 9 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Congress on the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (h) Reports Regarding Terrorism Risk Insurance Premiums.--\n       (1) Report to the naic.--Beginning 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, each \n     participating insurance company shall submit a report to the \n     NAIC that states the premium rates charged by that \n     participating insurance company during the preceding 6-month \n     period for insured losses covered by\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\n     the Program, and includes an explanation of and justification \n     for those rates.\n       (2) Reports forwarded.--The NAIC shall promptly forward \n     copies of each report submitted under paragraph (1) to the \n     Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the \n     Federal Trade Commission, and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States.\n       (3) Agency reports to congress.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, \n     and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall submit \n     joint reports to Congress and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States summarizing and evaluating the reports \n     forwarded under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Timing.--The reports required under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be submitted--\n       (i) 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act;

PRESERVATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction or \n     regulatory authority of the insurance commissioner (or any \n     agency or office performing like functions) of any State over \n     any participating insurance company or other person--\n       (1) except as specifically provided in this Act; and\n       (2) except that--\n       (A) the definition of the term ``act of terrorism'' in \n     section 3 shall be the exclusive definition of that term for \n     purposes of compensation for insured losses under this Act, \n     and shall preempt any provision of State law that is \n     inconsistent with that definition, to the extent that such \n     provision of law would otherwise apply to any type of \n     insurance covered by this Act;\n       (B) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending at midnight on December 31, 2002, rates \n     for terrorism risk insurance covered by this Act and filed \n     with any State shall not be subject to prior approval or a \n     waiting period, under any law of a State that would otherwise \n     be applicable, except that nothing in this Act affects the \n     ability of any State to invalidate a rate as excessive, \n     inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory; and\n       (C) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and for so long as the Program is in effect, as \n     provided in section 6 (including any period during which the \n     authority of the Secretary under section 6(d) is in effect), \n     books and records of any participating insurance company that \n     are relevant to the Program shall be provided, or caused to \n     be provided, to the Secretary or the designee of the \n     Secretary, upon request by the Secretary or such designee, \n     notwithstanding any provision of the laws of any State \n     prohibiting or limiting such access.\n\n     SEC. 8. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING CAPACITY BUILDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the insurance industry \n     should build capacity and aggregate risk to provide \n     affordable property and casualty insurance coverage for \n     terrorism risk.\n\n     SEC. 9.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I voted today for passage of \nthe Dodd-Schumer terrorism insurance bill. While it is not perfect, it \nprovides temporary backstop to allow the private insurance marketplace \nto adjust to the new threat of terrorist attacks. Because I had serious \nconcerns about a lack of consumer protection in the original bill, I \noffered two amendments, one to guard against price gouging, the other \nrequiring the industry to separately disclose to policyholders the \namount of premium due to terrorism risk. The first amendment was \nrejected by the Senate June 13. But the disclosure provision was added \nto the bill today. This provision gives regulators an essential tool to \nsafeguard against excessive price hikes, and consumers more information \nupon which to base purchasing decisions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my appreciation to my colleague, Senator Dodd for his efforts \nto move this bill along. We have just completed the Banking Committee's \nmarkup of the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection \nAct of 2002, which the committee reported favorably by a vote of 17-4. \nReturning to the matter pending before us, I simply want to acknowledge \nthat the Senate has taken a considerable step forward in addressing the \nimportant issue of terrorism insurance.\n  The discussion over the last several days has clearly illustrated the \ndimensions of the problem. Many insurers are excluding coverage of \nterrorism from the policies they write. In those cases where terrorism \ninsurance is available, it is often unafforable, and very limited in \nthe scope and amount of coverage.\n  The fact that so many properties are uninsured or underinsured \nagainst the risk of terrorism could have a negative effect on our \neconomy and our recovery if there were to be another terrorist attack. \nInsurance plays a vital role in our economy, by allowing businesses and \nproperty owners to spread their risks. As the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice noted in a recent report, property owners on their own ``lack \nthe ability to spread such risks among themselves the way insurers \ndo.'' In the event of another attack, many properties would have to \nabsorb any losses themselves, without the support of insurance. As a \nresult, the GAO concluded, ``another terrorist attack similar to that \nexperienced on September 11 could have significant economic effects on \nthe marketplace and the public at large.'' The GAO noted that ``These \neffects could include bankrupticies, layoffs, and loan defaults.''\n  But even in the absence of another attack, the lack of insurance can \nhinder economic activity. In preparing its recent report, the GAO found \nthat there are examples of ``large projects canceling or experiencing \ndelays . . . with a lack of terrorism coverage being cited as a \nprincipal contriuting factor.'' This is a drag of economic activity \nthat we can ill afford.\n  Most industry observers are of the opinion that, given time, the \ninsurance industry will develop the capacity and the experience that \nwill allow them to underwrite the terrorist risk. However, those \nconditions do not exist today. In the interim, a Federal reinsurance \nbackstop of limited duration would give the insurance markets the \nnecessary time to stabilize.\n  I know that there are still many steps between now and final \nenactment of the legislation. We look forward to continuing to work \nwith the administration on this issue, as we have done since shortly \nafter the attacks. Again, I want to underscore the importance of this \nlegislation and of the actions that the Senate has taken today to move \nit forward.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, due to a longstanding commitment I \nwas necessarily absent for the vote on cloture on the Terrorism \nReinsurance bill, S. 2600, and on final passage of the terrorism \nreinsurance bill. Although my votes would not have affected the \noutcome, had I been present, I would have voted for cloture on the bill \nand for final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5673-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MARITIME TRANSPORTATION ANTITERRORISM ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Auction Reform Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n       (1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have \n     changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the \n     700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in \n     1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original \n     deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are \n     consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum \n     management principles.\n       (2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating \n     additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other \n     advanced communications services. The Federal Communications \n     Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies \n     in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.\n       (3) The study being conducted by the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration in \n     consultation with the Department of Defense to determine \n     whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish \n     additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other \n     advanced communications services will not be completed until \n     after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz \n     band, and long after the applications must be filed to \n     participate in the auction, thereby creating further \n     uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 \n     megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for \n     the benefit of consumers.\n       (4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the \n     process of determining how to resolve the interference \n     problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for \n     public safety. One option being considered for the 800 \n     megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The \n     Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before \n     the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a \n     tenable plan has been conceived.\n       (5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by \n     television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to \n     digital television is completed. This situation creates a \n     tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum \n     will be available and reduces the value placed on the \n     spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 \n     megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the \n     auction would be likely to produce and the probability that \n     the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued \n     the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most \n     productive use.\n       (6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms \n     for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations--\n       (A) produced no certainty that the band would be available \n     for advanced mobile communications services, public safety \n     operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the \n     existing statutory framework provides; and\n       (B) should advance the transition of digital television and \n     must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent \n     licensee.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 370, S. 2514, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill; that there be debate only on the bill during \ntoday's session; further, that the Senate resume consideration of the \nbill at 11 o'clock on Wednesday, June 19.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2514) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2003 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, for defense activities of \n     the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths \n     for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in behalf of the Armed Services Committee, \nI am pleased to bring the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2003 to the floor.\n  This bill would fully fund the fiscal year 2003 budget request of the \nadministration of $393.3 billion for the national security activities \nfor the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy.\n  In the first 41 days of congressional session this year, the Armed \nServices Committee held 41 hearings to examine the administration's \nbudget request and related issues. Last month, after meeting in markup \nfor 3 days, the committee approved S. 2514, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n  I thank all the members of committee for their hard work on this \nbill.\n  There were two close votes on two funding issues that caused a few of \nour members to vote against the bill at the end, which, of course, we \nregret. But except for those two issues, I think we probably would have \nhad a unanimous vote on our committee.\n  As we take up this bill, America's Armed Forces are engaged around \nthe world as never before. In the months since September 11, we have \ndispatched troops not only to Afghanistan but also to Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, the countries of central Asia and the Persian Gulf. We \ncalled up the National Guard to assist in contingency operations and to \nassist in safeguarding our borders and protecting our airports.\n  All of this has been done without relieving our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines of ongoing deployments in Korea, the Balkans, \nColombia, and elsewhere.\n  This year, as much as ever before, we owe it to our men and women in \nuniform to act on this bill with dispatch. The events following \nSeptember 11 have once again shown that the U.S. military is the most \ncapable fighting force in the world. The success of our forces in \nAfghanistan has been remarkable. Osama bin Laden--if he is alive--is on \nthe run and in hiding. Many of his al-Qaida terrorists have been \ncaptured or killed. The Taliban regime that harbored them is no more, \nand a new government is in place. Nations around the world have been \nput on notice: America is determined to protect itself from more \nattacks and to bring terrorists to justice.\n  From Europe to the Persian Gulf to the Korean Peninsula, the presence \nof U.S. military forces and their contributions to regional peace and \nsecurity continue to reassure our allies and deter potential \nadversaries. Over the last decade, U.S. forces have excelled in every \nmission assigned to them, including not only Operation Enduring \nFreedom, but also the 1999 NATO air campaign over Kosovo and ongoing \nenforcement of the no-fly zones over Iraq; humanitarian operations from \nCentral America to Africa; and peacekeeping operations from the Balkans \nto East Timor.\n  The excellence behind that success was not built in months. The \nsuccess of our forces in Afghanistan is a tribute to the men and women \nof the Armed Forces and the investments in national defense that \nCongress and the Department of Defense have made over many years. \nFuture success on the battlefield will likewise depend upon the success \nof Congress and the Department in preparing, training, and equipping \nour military for tomorrow's missions.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 builds on \nthe considerable strengths of our military forces and their record of \nsuccess. The Armed Services Committee identified five priorities to \nguide us in preparing this bill. These were to:\n  No. 1, continue the improvements in the compensation and quality of \nlife of the men and women in the Armed Forces, retirees and their \nfamilies;\n  No. 2, sustain the readiness of the military services to conduct the \nfull range of their assigned mission, including current and future \noperations against international terrorism;\n  No. 3, improve the efficiency of Defense Department programs and \noperations and apply the savings toward high-priority programs;\n  No. 4, improve the ability of the Armed Forces to meet nontraditional \nthreats, including terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; and\n  No. 5, promote the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet the \nthreats of the 21st century.\n  First, compensation and quality of life:\n  The bill reflects the committee's highest priority--ensuring that our \nmen and women in uniform, retirees and their families receive the \ncompensation and quality of life they deserve. Toward that end, we \nadded more than $1.2 billion to the budget request for pay and quality \nof life initiatives. Specifically, the bill includes a 4.1 percent \nacross-the-board pay raise for all military personnel, with an \nadditional targeted pay raise for the mid-career force; adds $640 \nmillion above the budget request to improve and replace facilities on \nmilitary installations; and authorizes a new assignment incentive pay \nof up to $1,500 per month to reward military members who agree to serve \nin difficult-to-fill assignments.\n  The bill would also begin to address a longstanding inequity in the \ncompensation of military retirees by authorizing the concurrent receipt \nof retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for military \nretirees with disabilities rated at 60% or more. During our markup, the \ncommittee approved a separate amendment that would authorize concurrent \nreceipt of retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for all \ndisabled military retirees for non-disability retirement. Senator \nWarner and I plan to offer this amendment on behalf of the committee at \nthe earliest possible point in the debate of this bill.\n  With regard to readiness, we propose to set aside $10 billion, as \nrequested by the administration, to fund ongoing operations in the war \nagainst international terrorism during fiscal year 2003. The President \nrequested that this money be reserved for the continuance of the war \nagainst international terrorism, and we believe that there is no more \nimportant purpose to which this funding could be dedicated.\n  However, the Department is not yet in a position to state how long \nthe war on terrorism will continue, or in what form, or to specify the \nspecific programs for which the requested funds would be used. For this \nreason, the provision recommended by the committee would authorize for \nappropriation the $10 billion requested by the President upon receipt \nof a budget request which: No. 1, designates the requested amount as \nbeing essential to the continued war on terrorism; and No. 2, specifies \nhow the administration proposes to use the requested funds, consistent \nwith the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, P.L. 107-40.\n  In addition, the bill would add funding to address shortfalls in a \nnumber of key readiness accounts and help lessen the burden on some of \nthe Department's high demand, low density assets.\n  These funding increases include $126 million to protect and enhance \nmilitary training ranges; $232 million for aircraft, ship, and Navy gun \ndepot maintenance; $176 million for improvements to Air Force and Army \nfacilities; $51 million for ammunition to meet new training \nrequirements and supplement war reserve stocks; $55 million to address \nthe Army's aviation training backlog; $110 million for the purchase of \nan additional EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft; and $114 million for \nmodifications to help improve the readiness of the EA-6B electronic \nwarfare aircraft fleet.\n  Relative to combating terrorism, the bill before us would take a \nsignificant step towards addressing nontraditional threats by providing \nin excess of $10 billion for combating terrorism initiatives, as \nrequested by the Department, including more than $2 billion for force \nprotection improvements to DOD installations around the world.\n  In addition, the bill would provide increases of $200 million to \nenhance the security of our nuclear materials and nuclear weapons in \nthe Department of Energy, $43 million in funding for the U.S. Special \nOperations Commands, and $30 million for defense against chemical and \nbiological weapons and other efforts to combat weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  We have also included two important legislative initiatives that \nwould require the Department of Defense to take a more comprehensive \napproach to installation preparedness for weapons of mass destruction \nattacks and authorize the Secretary of Defense to expand cooperative \nthreat reduction activities beyond the countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  Relative to transformation, the bill would provide significant funds \nto promote the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet the threats \nof the 21st century. In particular, the bill would add more than $1.1 \nbillion to the Navy's shipbuilding accounts to refuel a nuclear \nsubmarine and pay for advance procurement of an aircraft carrier, a \nVirginia-class submarine, a DDG-51 class destroyer, and an LPD-17 class \namphibious transport dock.\n  Our bill would add $105 million for funding for research and \ndevelopment on the Army's Future Combat System and more than $100 \nmillion for science and technology needed to help the Army achieve its \nObjective Force.\n  It would fully fund the $5.2 billion requested by the Department for \nthe F-\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\n22, the $3.5 billion requested for continued research and development \non the Joint Strike Fighter, and more than $600 million requested for \nAir Force unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  It would add more than $300 million to the Department's science and \ntechnology budget, bringing the Department closer to the Secretary's \ngoal of devoting 3 percent of all defense funds to the programs that \npromise to bring us the revolutionary technologies that will be needed \nto prevail in future conflicts.\n  Relative to the Crusader Artillery System, in the middle of our \ncommittee markup of this bill the Secretary of Defense announced that \nhe intended to terminate the Crusader Artillery System. This is a \nsystem which the Department of Defense had strongly supported until \njust a few days earlier. Because the committee had no opportunity to \nreview the reasons for this sudden reversal, we did not address this \nissue in our markup. Instead, we scheduled a hearing with the Secretary \nof Defense and the Army Chief of Staff to consider the merits of the \nprogram.\n  At that hearing, the Secretary of Defense favored termination. The \nArmy Chief of Staff testified that the system was very important and \nvery necessary and, as a matter of fact, an important part of \ntransformation. The Chief of Staff is a very strong supporter of \ntransformation.\n\n  I think we all--as we perhaps will be debating the Crusader System--\nshould recognize the contribution of the Army Chief of Staff to the \ntransformation of the Army. He is not one who has resisted \ntransformation. He has been a very strong supporter of transformation, \nand he views the Crusader Artillery System--or viewed this at the time \nhe testified--as an important part of that transformation.\n  On June 13, the committee met to discuss the Crusader Artillery \nSystem. At that time, the committee voted 13 to 6 to recommend an \namendment that would do two things. First, it would take the $475 \nmillion out of the Crusader program and put the money into a separate \nfunding line for future combat systems research and development. This \nis the Army's armored systems modernization line. Second, we would \nrequire the Army Chief of Staff, in our amendment, to conduct an \nanalysis--or finish his analysis--of alternatives for the Army's \nartillery needs and to submit his findings to the Secretary of Defense \nno later than 1 month after the date of enactment of this act.\n  This approach would enable the Secretary of Defense to terminate the \nCrusader program following the receipt of the Army's analysis which was \ntruncated. The Army, in late April, was told that it could complete its \nanalysis by the end of this fiscal year. And then, in early May, it was \ntold that it could have until the end of May to complete this analysis.\n  I emphasize the importance of this analysis. The Army's analysis is \nintended to answer seven questions. I am not going to go through them \nall, but I am simply going to say these are important questions. These \nare important questions for the future well-being of the men and women \nin the Army. They are critical questions. They have to do with risk. \nWhat are the risks in proceeding? What are the risks in canceling?\n  These are questions which the Army was in the middle of analyzing \nwhen suddenly, a few days into May, despite the earlier decision to \nallow the completion of this analysis by the end of May, the Secretary \nof Defense simply said: We are going to terminate.\n  Seven questions were to be answered. And I emphasize, these are \nquestions which can be life-and-death questions for the men and women \nin the future armies of this country. They were going to analyze these \nquestions in six combat scenarios. They were going to look at four \ndifferent alternatives. We believe the answers to those questions in \nthat analysis should be completed. The amendment, which I will offer on \nbehalf of the committee, as I promised to the committee I would offer \nearly in this debate, was adopted, as I said, by a 13-to-6 vote.\n  We hope the Senate will approve this amendment. We think it is the \ncorrect balance. Not only should we have that information before we or \nthe Defense Department--either one of us--finally decide on \ntermination, that analysis is important as to how best to spend that \nmoney. Where should we jump to? Even if we, this Nation, decide to jump \nfrom Crusader, even if we take whatever risks are involved--and there \nare risks involved in that--the decision also involves, Where do we \nthen allocate those funds? How do we allocate those funds? And that \nanalysis is critically important to that issue as well. We hope our \namendment will address both those issues in a rational, thoughtful way.\n  Congress has a responsibility also to ensure that the resources our \ntaxpayers provide for national defense are spent wisely. The \nadministration has not complied with statutory requirements to provide \nCongress with a national security strategy and an annual report \noutlining detailed plans for the size, structure, shape, or \ntransformation of the military. In the absence of that planning, again, \nrequired by law, the Department of Defense is going to have difficulty \nestablishing a clear vision for the future for our Armed Forces.\n  But a year ago, the Secretary of Defense testified before us saying: \n``We have an obligation to taxpayers to spend their money wisely.'' He \nsaid that he had ``never seen an organization, in the private or public \nsector,'' to use his words, ``that could not, by better management, \noperate at least five percent more efficiently if given the freedom to \ndo so. Five percent of the DOD budget,'' he pointed out, ``is over $15 \nbillion!''\n  He testified that that $15 billion of savings from management \nefficiencies could be used to: increase ship procurement from six to \nnine ships a year; to procure several hundred additional aircraft \nannually rather than 189. He could meet the target of a 67-year \nfacility replacement rate, and those savings could increase defense-\nrelated science and technology funding from 2.7 percent to 3 percent \nfor the Department of Defense budget.\n  To this date, it has been disappointing that the Department has \nidentified less than $150 million of the $15 billion annual savings \nprojected by the Secretary. Despite the largest proposed increase in \ndefense spending in 20 years, the budget request would fund just 5 \nships and 166 aircraft, way below the goals; replace facilities at a \n122-year rate instead of the 67-year rate, which is desirable. It would \nleave the rate of defense-related science and technology unchanged at \njust 2.7 percent of the Department of Defense budget instead of the 3-\npercent target which is desirable.\n  In short, despite the proposed $48 billion increase in defense \nspending, management efficiencies are needed now more than ever to \nensure the taxpayers' money is well spent.\n  Our bill includes a number of provisions to help address this \nproblem, including a major initiative, based on recommendations of the \nDefense Science Board and the DOD Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation, to address budget shortfalls and organizational \nshortcomings in the Department's test and evaluation infrastructure \nthat have led to inadequate testing of major weapons systems.\n  It would provide for a continuation of last year's initiative by the \ncommittee to improve the way in which the Department manages its $50 \nbillion of services contracts with resulting savings of $850 million. \nWe include a provision that would address the Department's inability to \nproduce reliable financial information and achieve $400 million of \nsavings by deferring spending on new financial systems that would be \ninconsistent with a comprehensive financial management enterprise \narchitecture currently being developed by the Department. We include a \nprovision requiring the Department to establish new internal controls \nto address recurring problems with the abuse of purchase cards and \ntravel cards by military and civilian personnel.\n\n  In the area of missile defense, the bill would reallocate $812 \nmillion for missile defense expenditures that appear to be unjustified \nor duplicative to higher priority areas. The bill would transfer $690 \nmillion from missile defense activities to fund advanced procurement of \na second Virginia-class submarine as soon as fiscal year 2005; advanced \nprocurement for a second LPD-17 amphibious transport dock in fiscal \nyear 2004; and advanced procurement for a third DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-\nclass destroyer in fiscal year 2004.\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n  Every defense budget requires choices, as every other budget of every \nother Department. Even with more than $390 billion to spend for \nnational security activities, the administration was not able to fund \nevery important national security priority. Each of the military \nservices came to us with a long list of unfunded priorities, items not \nincluded in their budget, which they believe to be important to the \nnational defense.\n  There was unanimous agreement among the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee that the President's budget did not provide adequate \nresources to maintain the Navy's surface fleet or attack submarines. \nThe committee received extensive testimony from DOD witnesses and \nnumerous DOD and Navy reports indicating that the Navy should be \nbuilding 8 to 10 ships per year to recapitalize its current fleet. A \nnumber of Navy witnesses, including the chief of naval operations, have \nindicated they believe that the Navy should be building a fleet with as \nmany as 375 ships in order to meet the requirements the Navy faces \ntoday.\n  Two years ago, the Navy's shipbuilding plan called for 23 ships \nbetween 2003 and 2005. This year's plan calls for only 17 ships during \nthat period.\n  The Department's proposed budget for missile defense was not even \nreviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Earlier this year, each of the \nfour service chiefs testified before the Armed Services Committee that \nthey had not been asked for their views on the funding for missile \ndefense programs relative to other priorities in the budget--all those \nunmet requirements that they told us about. They were not asked to \nweigh the importance of the missile defense budget against those other \nneeded items.\n  The committee, and the subcommittee chaired by Senator Jack Reed, \nconducted an exhaustive examination of the proposed missile defense \nbudget, holding two strategic subcommittee hearings alone on missile \ndefense, reviewing 400 pages of missile defense budget documentation, \nand participating in more than 25 hours of staff briefings by the \nDepartment of Defense. Based on this lengthy review, the committee \nrecommended funding the vast majority of the Department's missile \ndefense requests, an amount that is sufficient to aggressively fund all \nof the specific systems that the Department has said it wants to \ndevelop.\n  However, at the same time the committee identified $810 million of \nthe missile defense request, which is 11 percent of the total request, \nthat could not adequately be justified by the Department despite a \ndetailed review of available documentation and repeated requests at \nhearings and in briefings.\n\n  For example, the budget request included $1.1 billion in the \nballistic missile defense program element. That is an increase of $250 \nmillion over the current funding level. The major purpose of this \nprogram element is to develop an integrated architecture of BMD \nsystems. While this is an important goal, most of the systems that will \ncomprise the BMD architecture are years away from being deployed, \nmaking the development and definition of a detailed BMD architecture \nimpossible at this point.\n  After receiving more than $800 million for this program element in \nfiscal year 2002, the Missile Defense Agency has yet to provide to \nCongress any indication what the overall ballistic missile defense \narchitecture might be. In fact, the committee learned that of the $800 \nmillion appropriated for that program element in fiscal year 2002, only \n$50 million had been spent by the end of March, halfway through the \nfiscal year.\n  Because of this slow execution, the Missile Defense Agency informed \nus that $400 million of these fiscal year 2002 funds will be available \nfor expenditure in 2003. So half of the money that we appropriated in \n2002 for that program element is not going to be spent. It is going to \nbe available next year. Under those circumstances, it is hard to see \nwhy the Department would need a $250 million increase in that program \nelement in fiscal year 2003.\n  In short, we made a choice to make careful, well-justified reductions \nin missile defense programs to fund increases to the Department's \nshipbuilding accounts, and other critically important accounts, which \nare strongly supported by most members of the uniformed Navy and by \nmembers of the committee. The choice was the right one.\n  One of the things we used the money for, one of the important areas \nthat we used that funding for, was greater security of our Department \nof Energy nuclear facilities. The greatest threat we face is a \nterrorist threat. Those facilities are not adequately protected. We \nfound some additional money--about $100 million--in those reductions in \nthe missile defense accounts which we believed could not be justified, \nnot just to build more ships, which are necessary, but also to give \ngreater security to our Department of Energy nuclear facilities which \nare so critically important to be defended.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has written us that the Department opposes these \nchanges and he would recommend that the President veto the bill if this \nchange in missile defense funding remains in the bill. But again, this \nveto threat not only is addressed at the funding cuts in the bill but, \nin effect, is addressed at the items that we added in the bill which \nare so important to the national security of this country.\n  We believe our bill would provide the Missile Defense Agency as much \nmoney as can reasonably be executed for the missile defense program in \nthis year and would ensure that this money is expended in a sound \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, finally, I wish to say a few words on two items that \nare not included in this bill. First, the budget request of the \nadministration included $15 million in the Department of Energy to \nbegin studying the feasibility of the new robust nuclear earth \npenetrator. We had doubts about the need for this new nuclear weapon, \nparticularly at a time when we are trying to convince other countries \nto forgo the development of nuclear weapons, and we adopted an \namendment deleting funding for the robust nuclear penetrator and \ninstead we directed the Department of Defense, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy, to submit a report to Congress on the requirements \nfor this new nuclear weapon--how it would be deployed, what categories \nof targets it would be used against, and whether conventional weapons \ncould effectively address such targets.\n  Second, less than a month before we began our markup, the Department \nof Defense sent us a legislative proposal to exempt certain military \ninstallations and activities from the Endangered Species Act, the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Clean \nAir Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, or CERCLA.\n  We did not consider those proposals because all those statutes fall \noutside the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. We did \ninclude two environmentally sound provisions in the Department's \nproposal that were in our committee's jurisdiction. These provisions \nauthorize the Department of Defense to enter into agreements with non-\nFederal entities to manage lands adjacent to military installations and \nto create buffer zones between training areas and the surrounding \npopulation.\n  America's Armed Forces are ready to help keep the peace, to deter \ntraditional and nontraditional threats to our security and our vital \ninterests around the world, and to win any conflict decisively. Our \nbill builds on the considerable strength of our military forces and \ntheir record of success by preserving a high quality of life for U.S. \nforces and their families, sustaining readiness, transforming the Armed \nForces to meet the threats and challenges of tomorrow.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office is required to prepare \na cost estimate for spending legislation reported by committees. The \ncost estimate for the bill reported by the committee, S. 2514, was not \nfinished at the time the report on this bill was filed. The CBO cost \nestimate is now available. I ask unanimous consent that the \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate for the Defense authorization \nbill reported by the Committee on Armed Services be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2002.\n     Hon.

It also would prescribe personnel \n     strengths for each active-duty and selected reserve component \n     of the U.S. armed forces. CBO estimates that appropriation of \n     the authorized amounts for 2002 and 2003 would result in \n     additional outlays of $402 billion over the 2002-2007 period.\n       The bill also contains provisions that would raise the \n     costs of discretionary defense programs over the 2004-2007 \n     period. CBO estimates that those provisions would require \n     appropriations of $6.8 billion over those four years.\n       The bill contains provisions that would increase direct \n     spending by an estimated $5.6 billion over the 2003-2007 \n     period and $17.6 billion over the 2003-2012 period, primarily \n     from the phase-in of concurrent payment of retirement \n     annuities with veterans' disability compensation to retirees \n     from the military and the other uniformed services who have \n     service-connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or \n     greater. Because it would affect direct spending, the bill \n     would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures.\n       S. 2514 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 2514 is shown in Table 1. Most of the \n     costs of this legislation fall within budget function 050 \n     (national defense).\n\n       TABLE 1.--BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 2514, THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law for\n Defense Programs:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\..........      346,319            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............      346,900      116,372       38,931       13,267        5,535        2,723\nProposed Changes:\n    Authorization of Supplemental\n     Appropriations for 2002:\n        Estimated Authorization          14,048            0            0            0            0            0\n         Level \\2\\................\n        Estimated Outlays \\2\\.....        5,345        5,782        1,941          660          174           79\n    Authorization of\n     Appropriations for 2003:\n        Estimated Authorization               0      391,543            0            0            0            0\n         Level....................\n        Estimated Outlays.........            0      259,711       88,543       28,227        8,201        2,856\nSpending Under S. 2514 for Defense\n Programs:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.      360,367      391,543            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............      352,245      381,865      129,415       42,154       13,910        5,658\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0          359          674        1,081        1,533        1,936\nEstimated Outlays.................            0          359          674        1,081        1,533       1,936\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2002 level is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by S. 2514.\n\\2\\ The estimates shown for the 2002 supplemental are amounts contained in the Administration's supplemental\n  request for defense programs.

Excluding emergency spending would lower total outlays in 2003 to\n  $376,181 million.\nNote.--This table excludes estimated authorizations of appropriations for years after 2003. (Those additional\n  authorizations are shown in Table 3.)\n\n     Basis of estimate\n       Spending subject to appropriation\n       The bill would specifically authorize appropriations \n     totaling $391.5 billion in 2003 (see Table 2) and additional \n     amounts as may be necessary for supplemental appropriations \n     for defense in 2002, which CBO estimates would total $14 \n     billion based on the Administration's request. Most of those \n     costs would fall within budget function 050 (national \n     defense). S. 2514 also would specifically authorize \n     appropriations of $70 million for the Armed Forces Retirement \n     Home (function 600--income security).\n       The estimate assumes that the estimated authorization \n     amount for 2002 is appropriated by the end of June 2002, and \n     that the amounts authorized for 2003 will be appropriated \n     before the start of fiscal year 2003.

Table 3 contains estimates of those amounts. In \n     addition to the costs covered by the authorizations in the \n     bill for 2003, these provisions would raise estimated costs \n     by $6.8 billion over the 2004-2007 period.

Those amounts are shown in\n  Table 2. Amounts shown in this table for 2004 through 2007 are not included in Table 1.\n\n       Multiyear Procurement. In most cases, purchases of weapon \n     systems are authorized annually, and as a result, DoD \n     negotiates a separate contract for each annual purchase. In a \n     small number of cases, the law permits multiyear procurement; \n     that is, it allows DoD to enter into a contract to buy \n     specified annual quantities of a system for up to five years. \n     In those cases, DoD can negotiate lower prices because its \n     commitment to purchase the weapons gives the contractor an \n     incentive to find more economical ways to manufacture the \n     weapon, including cost-saving investments. Annual funding is \n     provided for these multiyear contracts, but potential \n     termination costs are covered by an initial appropriation.\n       Section 131 would authorize the Secretary of the Air Force \n     to enter into a multiyear contract to purchase C-130J \n     aircraft beginning in 2003 after the Secretary certifies that \n     the C-130J has been cleared for worldwide, over-water \n     capability. Based on information provided by the Air Force, \n     CBO assumes that DoD will procure 64 aircraft over the 2003-\n     2008 period--40 CC-130J aircraft for the Air Force and 24 KC-\n     130J aircraft for the Marine Corps. CBO also assumes that the \n     CC-130J and KC-130J aircraft would be purchased under one \n     contract administered by the Air Force and covering six years \n     of production beginning in 2003. CBO estimates that savings \n     from buying these aircraft under a multiyear contract would \n     total $473 million, or about $95 million a year, over the \n     2003-2007 period. CBO also estimates that additional savings \n     of $182 million would accrue in 2008. Funding requirements to \n     purchase these aircraft would total just under $3.4 billion \n     over the 2003-2007 period (instead of the almost $3.9 billion \n     that would be needed under annual contracts).\n       Multiyear procurement of C-130Js would raise costs in 2003 \n     because the KC-130J did not receive advance procurement in \n     2002 in anticipation of multiyear procurement starting in \n     2003, and because the Air Force would need to provide advance \n     procurement for the aircraft that it would purchase in 2004.\n       Military Endstrength. The bill would authorize active and \n     reserve endstrength levels for 2003. The authorized \n     endstrengths for active-duty personnel and personnel in the \n     selected reserve would total about 1,390,000 and 865,000, \n     respectively. Of those selected reservists, about 68,500 \n     would serve on active duty in support of the reserves. The \n     bill would specifically authorize appropriations of about $94 \n     billion for the costs of military pay and allowances in 2003. \n     The authorized endstrength represents a net increase of 2,200 \n     servicemembers that would boost costs for salaries and other \n     expenses by $87 million in the first year and about $190 \n     million annually in subsequent years, compared to the \n     authorized strengths for 2002.\n       The bill also would authorize an endstrength of 9,000 in \n     2003 for the Coast Guard Reserve. This authorization would \n     cost about $92 million and would fall under budget function \n     400 (transportation).\n       Section 402 would allow the Secretary of Defense to \n     increase endstrength by 2 percent above the level authorized \n     by the Congress. The provision would also allow an increase \n     in endstrength equal to the number of personnel within the \n     reserve components that are on active duty in support of a \n     contingency operation. While there is the potential for \n     increased costs, CBO believes that DoD would still have to \n     manage their resources given the finite amount of money \n     appropriated each year for military personnel. As such, CBO \n     estimates that this provision would not significantly \n     increase costs.\n       Compensation and Benefits. S. 2514 contains several \n     provisions that would affect military compensation and \n     benefits for uniformed personnel.\n       Military Pay Raises. Section 601 would raise basic pay by \n     4.1 percent across-the-board and authorize additional \n     targeted pay raises, ranging from 0.9 percent to 4.4 percent, \n     for individuals with specific ranks and years of service at a \n     total cost of about $2.3 billion in 2003. Because the pay \n     raises would be above those projected under current law, CBO \n     estimates that the incremental costs associated with the \n     larger pay raise would be about $276 million in 2003 and \n     total $1.9 billion over the 2003-2007 period.\n       Expiring Bonuses and Allowances. Several sections would \n     extend DoD's authority to pay certain bonuses and allowances \n     to current personnel. Under current law, most of these \n     authorities are scheduled to expire in December 2002, or \n     three months into fiscal year 2003. The bill would extend \n     these authorities through December 2003. Based on data \n     provided by DoD, CBO estimates that the costs of these \n     extensions would be as follows:\n       Payment of reenlistment bonuses for active-duty personnel \n     would cost $327 million in 2003 and $191 million in 2004; \n     enlistment bonuses for active-duty personnel would cost $133 \n     million in 2003 and $361 million in 2004;\n       Various bonuses for the Selected and Ready Reserve would \n     cost $99 million in 2003 and $114 million in 2004;\n       Special payments for aviators and nuclear-qualified \n     personnel would cost $67 million in 2003 and $72 million in \n     2004;\n       Retention bonuses for officers and enlisted members with \n     critical skills would cost $29 million in 2003 and $19 \n     million in 2004;\n       Accession bonuses for new officers with critical skills \n     would cost $14 million in 2003 and $5 million in 2004; and\n       Authorities to make special payments and give bonuses to \n     certain health care professionals would cost $37 million in \n     2003 and $34 million in 2004.\n       Most of these changes would result in additional, smaller \n     costs in subsequent years because payments are made in \n     installments.\n       Assignment Incentive Pay. Section 617 would authorize a new \n     incentive pay to servicemembers who volunteer for difficult-\n     to-fill jobs or less-than-desirable locations. The authority \n     would expire three years after the enactment date of this \n     bill. Based on information from DoD, CBO expects that only \n     the Navy would use this authority. Based on information \n     provided by the Navy, CBO assumes that the special incentive \n     pay would average $300 a month and that 11,250 servicemembers \n     would receive this special pay by 2005. Given expected \n     personnel turnover, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     cost $1 million in 2003 and $46 million over the 2003-2005 \n     period.\n       Education and Training. Section 521 would allow the \n     military services to increase the number of students at each \n     of the service academies from the current ceiling of 4,000 to \n     4,400 students. Based on information from DoD, CBO expects \n     that only the Navy would significantly increase its service-\n     academy strength and that it would bring on about 100 extra \n     academy students a year, so that the student body would \n     increase, after several years, to about 4,400 students. Based \n     on information provided by DoD, CBO assumes the other service \n     academies would each increase their enrollments by an \n     insignificant number of students a year.\n       According to DoD, the additional cost to bring on 400 extra \n     students at the Naval\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\n     Academy would be about $29,000 per student each year. These \n     additional students would not be used to increase overall \n     officer endstrength, but rather to offset a desired draw down \n     in the number of officers commissioned through the Officer \n     Candidate School (OCS) program, according to the Navy. Thus, \n     the actual cost of the increase for the academy students \n     would be offset somewhat by the cost of the OCS graduates \n     they would replace. Because the OCS program lasts less than \n     one year, the offsetting costs would not begin to affect net \n     outlays until 2007, when the first of the additional academy \n     students would graduate and be commissioned. CBO estimates \n     the cost of implementing this provision would be $1 million \n     in 2003 and $31 million over the 2003-2007 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       Section 652 would extend the period during which eligible \n     reservists may use their education benefits from 10 years to \n     14 years. In 2001, over 82,000 reservists trained under this \n     program and received an average annual benefit of $1,653. \n     These benefits are paid by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     from the DoD Education Benefits Fund. Each month, DoD pays \n     into the fund the net present value of the education benefit \n     granted to each person who enlisted in the previous month. \n     Based on information from DoD about current contributions to \n     the fund and expected accessions, CBO estimates implementing \n     section 652 would increase payments into the fund by about $2 \n     million each year. (CBO estimates that there also would be \n     direct spending of about $24 million over the 2003-2012 \n     period for increased outlays from the fund. CBO's estimate of \n     those costs is discussed below under the heading of ``Direct \n     Spending.'')\n       Concurrent Receipt. Section 641 would phase in over five \n     years total or partial concurrent payment of retirement \n     annuities together with veterans' disability compensation to \n     retirees from the uniformed services who have service-\n     connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or greater. The \n     uniformed services include all branches of the U.S. military, \n     the Coast Guard, and uniformed members of the Public Health \n     Service (PHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA).\n       Under current law, disabled veterans who are retired from \n     the uniformed services cannot receive both full retirement \n     annuities and disability compensation from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA). Because of this prohibition on \n     concurrent receipt, such veterans forgo a portion of their \n     retirement annuity equal to the nontaxable veterans' benefit. \n     This section would phase in concurrent receipt of both \n     benefits so that, beginning in 2007, individuals who have \n     significant service-connected disabilities and have a \n     retirement annuity based on years of service, would receive \n     both benefits in full without the reduction called for under \n     current law. Individuals whose retirement pay is based on \n     their degree of disability would continue to forgo retirement \n     pay equal to the VA compensation payment, but only to the \n     extent that their disability had entitled them to a larger \n     retirement annuity than they would have received based on \n     years of service.\n       The military retirement system is financed in part by an \n     annual payment from appropriated funds to the military \n     retirement trust fund, based on an estimate of the system's \n     accruing liabilities. If this provision is enacted, the \n     yearly contribution to the military retirement trust fund (an \n     outlay in budget function 050) would increase to reflect the \n     added liability from the expected increase in annuities to \n     future retirees. Using information from DoD, CBO estimates \n     that implementing this provision would increase such payments \n     by $588 million in 2004 and $2.5 billion over the 2004-2007 \n     period. Because the phase-in of concurrent receipt benefits \n     would not take effect until January 1, 2003, the accrual \n     payment for fiscal year 2003 would not be affected. CBO \n     estimates that there also would be direct spending of about \n     $17.3 billion over the 2003-2012 period for increased outlays \n     from the fund. CBO's estimate of those costs is discussed \n     below under the heading of ``Direct Spending.''\n       National Call to Service. Section 541 would give the \n     Secretary of Defense authority to establish an enlistment \n     program in which a participant, in exchange for a specified \n     incentive, would enlist in the armed forces for a period of \n     15 months plus training time followed by service in the \n     reserves, the Peace Corps, Americorps, or another national \n     service program. The specified incentives would consist of \n     either a cash bonus of $5,000, payment of student loans not \n     to exceed $18,000, or education benefits similar to those \n     provided for in the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) education \n     program.\n       Based on information from DoD, CBO estimates that DoD would \n     seek to recruit about 1 percent of annual enlisted accessions \n     (an average of about 2,000 enlistees a year) under the \n     National Call to Service program. CBO assumes that all (or \n     nearly all) participants would choose the $5,000 cash bonus \n     option since DoD has indicated that the amount it would \n     probably offer for the repayment of student loans would be \n     less than or equal to $5,000. Moreover, while the education \n     benefits offered under this program would be worth more than \n     $5,000, CBO believes that few enlistees would choose these \n     benefits because a participant who selected the cash bonus \n     would also have the potential to be eligible for active-duty \n     or reserve MGIB benefits. Thus, CBO estimates that the cost \n     for providing the cash bonus to participants who enlist under \n     the National Call to Service program would be about $10 \n     million a year once the program was implemented. Based on \n     information provided by DoD, CBO assumes that it would take \n     about one year for DoD to implement this program.\n       CBO also estimates that there would be an additional cost \n     associated with administering this program. Since \n     servicemembers who would enlist under the National Call to \n     Service program would leave the military one year sooner than \n     the average enlisted member who leaves after his or her \n     initial obligation is fulfilled, DoD would need to induct \n     more people into the military to maintain endstrength. CBO \n     estimates that DoD would need to induct 1,000 additional \n     enlistees a year to make up for the accelerated loss in \n     personnel. With an average training period of about six \n     months, DoD would need to add these enlistees about half a \n     year earlier. Thus, the first bonuses would not be paid out \n     until 2004 and the first replacements would not have to be \n     inducted until 2005.\n       Based on information from DoD, CBO estimates that the \n     average cost for each additional enlistee would be about \n     $16,250 in fiscal year 2003, which includes the cost of \n     providing new uniforms, travel expenses, and six months of \n     salary and benefits during training. After adjusting for \n     inflation and assuming that new participants are brought into \n     the program evenly throughout the first year, CBO estimates \n     that the cost of these additional accessions would be $9 \n     million in 2005 and an average of $20 million per year \n     thereafter.\n       Therefore, CBO estimates that the total costs for the \n     National Call to Service program would be $10 million in \n     2004, $19 million in 2005, and about $85 million over the \n     2004-2007 period.\n       Defense Health Program. Title VII contains several \n     provisions that would affect DoD health care and benefits. \n     Tricare is the name of DoD's health care program; Tricare \n     Prime and Tricare Prime Remote are managed care programs, and \n     Tricare Standard is a fee-for-service program.\n       Tricare Prime Remote. Section 703 would affect dependents \n     of servicemembers on active duty who live in a remote area, \n     which is defined as roughly a one-hour-or-more driving \n     distance from a military treatment facility. Under certain \n     conditions, this section would allow dependents of personnel \n     on active duty who live in a remote area to participate in \n     Tricare Prime Remote if the servicemember is transferred to a \n     different duty station and is not allowed to bring his or her \n     family. Under current law, dependents of personnel on active \n     duty living in remote areas must reside with the active-duty \n     member to participate in Tricare Prime Remote. If the active-\n     duty servicemember is transferred to a duty station where he \n     or she cannot bring family members, the family can no longer \n     participate in the Tricare Prime Remote program.\n       Based on information provided by DoD, CBO estimates that \n     about 27,000 dependents of personnel on active duty would be \n     affected by this provision. According to DoD, about 40 \n     percent of those dependents who would be eligible for Tricare \n     Prime Remote under this section already participate in \n     Tricare Standard. Based on data provided by the department, \n     CBO estimates that the additional incremental cost of \n     providing Tricare Prime Remote to those individuals would be \n     $113 per person. In addition, CBO estimates that the new \n     benefit would attract about 1,350 dependents to Tricare Prime \n     Remote who had not previously used any Tricare program at an \n     estimated annual cost of $1,900 per person. Thus, CBO \n     estimates that the cost of providing Tricare Prime Remote to \n     more individuals would be $4 million in 2003 and $22 million \n     over the 2003-2007 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     estimated amounts.\n       Transitional Health Care. Under section 707, family members \n     of reservists who were called to active duty for more than 30 \n     days would be eligible for health care coverage under Tricare \n     for 60 days after the reservist is released from active duty. \n     Under current law, only the reservist is eligible for health \n     care coverage under Tricare for the 60 days after he or she \n     is released from active duty. While there are currently more \n     than 80,000 reservists on active duty, CBO assumes for this \n     estimate that the number of reserves will fall to about \n     65,000 in 2003 and 10,000 by 2006. If the number of \n     reservists remains at current levels over the 2003-2007 \n     period, the estimated costs would be correspondingly higher.\n       Based on data from DoD and the General Accounting Office, \n     CBO estimates that about 50 percent of the reservists have \n     families and that about 40 percent of those families would \n     use the transitional health care. CBO further estimates that \n     providing an additional 60 days of health care coverage to \n     those families would cost, on average, about $600 per family. \n     After accounting for inflation and the assumed decline in the \n     level of reservists called to active duty, CBO estimates that \n     this provision would cost $7 million in 2003, and $18 million \n     over the 2003-2007 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     estimated amounts.\n       Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Incentives. S. \n     2514 contains several provisions that would allow DoD and the \n     Department of Energy to offer voluntary retirement incentives \n     to their civilian employees. Taken together, CBO estimates \n     implementing these provisions would cost $121 million in 2004 \n     and $544 million over the 2004-2006 period.\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\n       Section 1102 would provide DoD with the authority to offer \n     voluntary retirement incentives of up to $25,000 to its \n     civilian employees who voluntarily retire or resign through \n     September 30, 2006. Current buyout authority for DoD is \n     scheduled to expire on September 30, 2003. Based on \n     discussions with DoD staff, CBO assumes that about 16,500 DoD \n     employees would participate in the buyout program in 2004 \n     through 2006. CBO estimates that the buyout payments would \n     cost $88 million in 2004 and $414 million over the 2004-2006 \n     period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts. DoD \n     also would be required to make a payment to the Civil Service \n     Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) for every employee who \n     takes a buyout. The payments would equal 15 percent of the \n     final basic pay of each employee and come out of the agency's \n     appropriated funds. Assuming an average final salary for the \n     affected workers of $45,000, CBO estimates these payments \n     would cost DoD $24 million in 2004 and $118 million over the \n     2004-2006 period. (CBO estimates that enacting this section \n     also would increase direct spending for federal retirement \n     and retiree health care benefits by a total of $188 million \n     over the 2004-2012 period. CBO's estimate of those outlays is \n     discussed below under the heading of ``Direct Spending.'')\n       Section 3163 would provide DOE with authority to offer \n     voluntary retirement incentives of up to $25,000 to employees \n     who voluntarily retire or resign in calendar year 2004. \n     Current buyout authority for DOE is scheduled to expire on \n     December 31, 2003. Based on information from DOE, CBO assumes \n     that about 350 DOE employees would participate in the buyout \n     program in calender year 2004. CBO estimates that the cost of \n     the buyout payments would total $6 million in 2004 and $2 \n     million in 2005. DOE would also be required to make a payment \n     to the CSRDF for every employee who takes a buyout. The \n     payments would equal 15 percent of the final pay of each \n     employee and come out of the agency's appropriated funds. \n     Assuming an average final salary for the affected workers of \n     $75,000, CBO estimates these payments would cost DOE $3 \n     million in 2004 and $1 million in 2005. (CBO estimates that \n     enacting this section also would increase direct spending for \n     federal retirement and health care benefits by a total of $8 \n     million over the 2004-2012 period. CBO's estimate of those \n     outlays is discussed below under the heading of ``Direct \n     Spending.'')\n       Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Section \n     1103 would extend a provision of law into fiscal year 2007 \n     that allows DoD and certain Department of Energy employees \n     whose employment is terminated because of a reduction-in-\n     force action to continue to participate in the FEHB health \n     insurance program and only pay the regular employee's share \n     of the insurance premium. The respective departments would be \n     responsible for paying the normal employer's share of the \n     premium. Under current law, this provision expires in fiscal \n     year 2004. Based on information from DoD and the Office of \n     Personnel Management, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     affect about 500 people a year at an average annual cost of \n     $5,500 per person over the 2003-2007 period. CBO estimates \n     that extending this provision into fiscal year 2007 would \n     cost $2 million in 2004, and $11 million over the 2004-2007 \n     period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts.\n       School Impact Aid. Section 1064 would allow school \n     districts with a large percentage of children from military \n     families to continue to receive heavy impact aid when \n     military families are temporarily relocated. Heavy impact aid \n     is federal funding earmarked for school districts with large \n     military populations. Many military families in those school \n     districts live on federal installations and do not contribute \n     to the local property tax base that is used to help finance \n     school operations. Heavy impact aid helps to offset this loss \n     of local tax revenue. Under current law, schools can only \n     receive heavy impact aid if they meet strict criteria for \n     numbers of federal students located in their districts, local \n     tax rates, and per pupil expenditures. Because of population \n     relocations associated with certain military housing \n     initiatives, some school districts will temporarily be unable \n     to meet these criteria and will lose their heavy impact aid \n     for several years.\n       Based on data from the Department of Education and the \n     Military Impacted Schools Association, CBO estimates that \n     about four school districts would initially be affected by \n     housing privatization and that these school districts receive \n     about $18 million in heavy impact aid annually. Because \n     applications for heavy impact aid are based on school \n     district statistics from three years prior, CBO estimates \n     that the cost of implementing this section would not occur \n     until 2006. After adjusting for the changes in student \n     population within the affected districts, CBO estimates that \n     restoration of this aid would cost about $14 million per \n     year. Since the requirements of the School Impact Aid program \n     are not always fully funded, CBO expects that the Department \n     of Education would likely fund this increase through \n     reductions in aid to other school districts. CBO expects this \n     cost would reoccur annually only for the duration of the \n     housing privatization effort within the affected school \n     districts, which CBO estimates to be about three years.\n       Section 1064 also would allow coterminous school districts \n     (school districts whose boundaries are the same as a military \n     base) to change the way in which they include students living \n     off the base in their heavy impact aid calculations. CBO \n     estimates that implementing this provision would change the \n     calculation of heavy impact aid for 200 students in two \n     school districts and that the impact aid for these students \n     would increase by about $2,300 per student. CBO estimates \n     allowing coterminous school districts to change the method \n     for calculating heavy impact aid would cost slightly less \n     than $500,000 each year beginning in 2003.\n       Arctic and Western Pacific Environmental Cooperation \n     Program. Section 1214 would authorize the Department of \n     Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to \n     assist in mitigating the impact of military operations on the \n     environment of the arctic and western Pacific regions, \n     particularly nuclear or radiological impacts. Based on \n     information from DoD, CBO estimates that implementing this \n     provision would cost $29 million over the 2003-2007 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts.\n       Revitalizing DoD Laboratories. Section 241 would allow DoD \n     to establish a new three-year pilot program beginning in \n     March 2003 at various DoD laboratories to pursue improved \n     efficiencies for performing research and development work at \n     these laboratories. The section also would extend through \n     2006 authorizations for similar pilot projects that will \n     expire in 2003. Finally, section 241 would permit \n     laboratories participating in this new pilot program to enter \n     into public-private partnerships and other business \n     arrangements with private firms to achieve improved \n     efficiencies. The authority to enter into such partnerships \n     would expire in 2006. Under section 241, one of the public-\n     private partnerships could be established as a limited \n     liability corporation where the federal and nonfederal \n     partners could contribute capital, services, or facilities to \n     the corporation.\n       Under the new pilot program, DoD would be authorized to \n     waive certain restrictions not required by law that hinder \n     the objective of achieving improved efficiencies. The \n     department also would be authorized to use innovative methods \n     of personnel management and technology development. According \n     to information provided by DoD, the laboratories \n     participating in the existing pilot program were granted \n     similar authorities. DoD reported that these laboratories did \n     not substantially change their business practices because, in \n     their view, they already had the authority to waive non-\n     statutory regulations. Thus, CBO assumes that any \n     laboratories selected for the new program would not change \n     their business practices substantially. CBO estimates that \n     spending under these new and extended authorities would not \n     be significant--probably less than $500,000 annually over the \n     2003-2006 period. (CBO estimates that the provision allowing \n     a limited liability corporation also would increase direct \n     spending by a total of $15 million over the 2004-2006 period. \n     CBO's estimate of those outlays is discussed below under the \n     heading of ``Direct Spending.'')\n       Multiyear Procurement of Environmental Remediation \n     Services. Section 827 would give DoD the authority to enter \n     into multiyear contracts for environmental remediation \n     services. Under current law, the total cost of any multiyear \n     remediation service contract must be fully funded at the \n     beginning of the contract. DoD has found this difficult to do \n     for contracts that are expensive and last several years. \n     Instead, DoD often awards these contracts for environmental \n     remediation to cover work for one year and then extends the \n     contract on a year-to-year basis as funds become available. \n     DoD states that contracting in this manner is generally more \n     expensive because contractors charge higher prices when they \n     don't know whether the contract will continue beyond the \n     current year. Thus, allowing DoD to sign multiyear contracts \n     for environmental remediation would most likely produce some \n     savings. DoD could not provide CBO with the necessary data to \n     produce a precise estimate of the annual savings. However, \n     given the high cost of these contracts, CBO believes these \n     savings could be significant. CBO estimates that DoD \n     currently spends about $1.7 billion each year on \n     environmental cleanup related activities. If 10 percent of \n     future contracts were negotiated as multiyear contracts and \n     those contracts produced savings of about 5 percent on \n     average, multiyear contracting for environmental remediation \n     efforts would save about $10 million annually after a five-\n     year phase-in period.\n       Disposition of Surplus Plutonium. In January 2002, the \n     Secretary of Energy announced that the federal government \n     plans to convert roughly 34 metric tons of surplus weapons \n     grade plutonium currently located at various DOE facilities \n     into mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel that would be suitable for use in \n     U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. The federal government \n     would ship the surplus plutonium to a MOX fuel fabrication \n     facility at its Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. \n     DOE plans to start construction of the facility in 2004 and \n     expects that construction would be complete by 2007. The \n     facility would be able to convert about 3.5 metric tons of \n     plutonium a year and would complete the conversion in about \n     12 years.\n       Section 3182 would require that the Secretary of Energy pay \n     up to $100 million a year to the state of South Carolina \n     beginning in 2011, if the planned conversion schedule was not \n     met. The federal government could avoid these penalties, \n     however, if it removes at least one metric ton of plutonium a \n     year from South Carolina over the 2011-2016 period and \n     removes all remaining plutonium after 2016.\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\n       Based on delays in developing the construction plans for \n     the proposed MOX facility, and delays in similar programs \n     such as the Nuclear Waste Repository Site at Yucca Mountain, \n     Nevada, and the Waste Isolation Pilot Program at Carlsbad, \n     New Mexico, CBO believes that there is some chance that \n     construction of the MOX facility could be delayed for several \n     years beyond the 2007 planned completion date and that \n     construction would not be completed by 2011. If DOE does not \n     remove the required surplus plutonium from the state of South \n     Carolina, DOE would need to pay up to $100 million a year to \n     the state starting in 2011.\n     Direct Spending\n       The bill contains provisions that would increase direct \n     spending, primarily from the phase-in of concurrent payment \n     of retirement annuities with veterans' disability \n     compensation to retirees from the military and the other \n     uniformed services who have service-connected disabilities \n     rated at 60 percent or greater. The bill also contains a few \n     provisions with smaller direct spending costs. In total, CBO \n     estimates that enacting S. 2514 would result in an increase \n     in direct spending totaling $5.6 billion over the 2003-2007 \n     period (see Table 4).\n\n           TABLE 4.--ESTIMATED DIRECT SPENDING FROM CONCURRENT RECEIPT AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN S. 2514\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     2003         2004         2005         2006         2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nSection 641--Concurrent Receipt:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................          356          628          995        1,439        1,905\n    Estimated Outlays..........................          356          628          995        1,439        1,905\nSection 651--Education Benefits for the\n Selected Reserves:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            2            2            2            2            2\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            2            2            2            2            2\nSection 702--Mental Health Benefits:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            1            1            1            1            1\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            1            1            1            1            1\nSection 1102--Voluntary Separation and Early\n Retirement Incentives (DoD):\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            0           31           73           87           28\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            0           31           73           87           28\nSection 3163--Voluntary Separation and Early\n Retirement Incentives (DOE):\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            0            3            4            1          (a)\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            0            3            4            1          (a)\nSection 241--Revitalizing DoD Laboratories:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            0            6            6            3            0\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            0            6            6            3            0\nSection 2824--Land Conveyance of Navy Property,\n Westover Reserve Air Base:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.................            0            3            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays..........................            0            3            0            0            0\n \n                                        TOTAL CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority.....................          359          674        1,081        1,533        1,936\nEstimated Outlays..............................          359          674        1,081        1,533       1,936\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na Less than $500,000.\n\n       Concurrent Receipt. Section 641 would phase in over five \n     years total or partial concurrent payment of retirement \n     annuities together with veterans' disability compensation to \n     retirees from the uniformed services who have service-\n     connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or greater. Under \n     section 641, the phase-in of concurrent receipt would not \n     take effect until January 1, 2003.\n       Under current law, disabled veterans who are retired from \n     the uniformed services cannot receive both full retirement \n     annuities and disability compensation from VA. Because of \n     this prohibition on concurrent receipt, such veterans forgo a \n     portion of their retirement annuity equal to the nontaxable \n     veterans' benefit. This section would permit, beginning in \n     2007, individuals who have significant service-connected \n     disabilities and have a retirement annuity based on years of \n     service, to receive both benefits in full without the \n     reduction called for under current law. Individuals whose \n     retirement pay is based on their degree of disability would \n     continue to forgo retirement pay equal to the VA compensation \n     payment, but only to the extent that their disability had \n     entitled them to a larger retirement annuity than they would \n     have received based on years of service.\n       This section also would repeal, as of January 1, 2003, a \n     program that partially compensates certain severely disabled \n     retirees for this reduction in their retirement annuities. \n     This program currently pays a fixed benefit of $50 to $300 a \n     month, depending on degree of disability. Taken together, CBO \n     estimates that implementing section 641 would increase direct \n     spending for retirement annuities and veterans' disability \n     compensation by a net amount of about $356 million in 2003, \n     $5.3 billion over the 2003-2007 period, and $17.3 billion \n     over the 2003-2012 period (see Table 5).\n       Retirement Annuities. Since the proposed legislation would \n     treat retirees differently based on their type of \n     retirement--nondisability or disability, the potential costs \n     of the legislation depend on the number of beneficiaries, \n     their type of retirement, their disability levels, and their \n     benefit amounts.\n       Nondisability Retirees. A nondisability retirement is \n     granted based on length of service--usually 20 or more years. \n     Section 641 would allow those longevity retirees whose degree \n     of disability has been rated as 60 percent or greater to \n     receive full retirement annuities and veterans' disability \n     benefits with no offset in 2007, and to receive an increasing \n     portion of their retirement annuities over the 2003-2006 \n     period. Data from the uniformed services indicate that in \n     2001 the prohibition on paying both benefits concurrently \n     caused about $1.3 billion to be withheld from the annuity \n     payments of about 74,000 eligible DoD retirees with \n     nondisability retirements, and about 900 eligible Coast \n     Guard, PHS, and NOAA retirees. Using current rates of net \n     growth in the population of new beneficiaries, CBO estimates \n     this caseload would rise to about 78,000 nondisability \n     retirees in 2003, and 96,000 nondisability retirees by 2012. \n     CBO assumes that future benefit payments will increase \n     consistent with current rates of growth in average disability \n     levels and also increase from cost-of-living adjustments. \n     After phasing the benefits in over five years as specified in \n     the provision, CBO estimates that enacting the legislation \n     would increase direct spending on retirement annuities for \n     nondisability retirees of the uniformed services by $342 \n     million in 2003, $4.7 billion over the 2003-2007 period, and \n     $15.2 billion over the 2003-2012 period.\n\n                          TABLE 5.--ESTIMATED CHANGES IN RETIREE BENEFITS UNDER S. 2514\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n        Description of benefits program         ----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     2003         2004         2005         2006         2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRetirement Annuities:\n    Nondisability..............................          342          582          861        1,223        1,654\n    Disability.................................           56           92          127          172          223\nVeterans Compensation Payments.................            0           13           67          104           89\nSurvivor Benefit Plan Payments.................            7            7            8            9            9\nSpecial Compensation for Severely Disabled.....          -49          -66          -68          -69          -70\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total Changes in Retiree Benefits........          356          628          995        1,439        1,905\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Disability Retirees. Servicemembers who are found to be \n     unable to perform their duties because of service-related \n     disabilities may be granted a disability retirement. Section \n     641 would allow eligible disability retirees to receive \n     retirement annuities based on their years of service and \n     veterans' disability benefits with no offset in 2007, and \n     partial concurrent receipt of these payments in 2003 through \n     2006. Disability retirees would be eligible to obtain \n     concurrent receipt of their retirement annuity and veterans' \n     disability compensation if they served 20 or more years in \n     the uniformed services and had a disability rating of 60 \n     percent or greater.\n       Data from the uniformed services indicate that in 2001, the \n     prohibition on paying both benefits concurrently caused about \n     $200 million to be withheld from annuity payments of about \n     11,400 eligible DoD retirees with disability retirements, and \n     about 500 eligible Coast Guard, PHS, and NOAA retirees. An \n     analysis of retiree records by DoD indicates\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n     that, under the criteria set forth in this section, these \n     retirees would be eligible to receive about 95 percent of \n     their retirement annuity concurrently with their VA \n     disability benefit. Assuming continuation of current trends \n     in population and benefit growth, and phasing the benefit in \n     over five years as specified in this section, CBO estimates \n     that, of the disability retirees who would be receiving VA \n     disability benefits in fiscal year 2003, about 12,100 would \n     be entitled to an additional $56 million in retirement \n     annuities. CBO estimates their retirement annuities would \n     increase by $670 million over the 2003-2007 period and $1.9 \n     billion over the 2003-2012 period.\n       Other Effects of Concurrent Receipt. Enacting section 641 \n     also would affect Veterans' Disability Compensation, receipts \n     to the Treasury for Survivor Benefit Payments, Special \n     Compensation to Severely Disabled Retirees, and the level of \n     contributions to the Military Retirement Trust Fund.\n       Veterans' Disability Compensation. Data from DoD indicates \n     that an additional 15,100 disability retirees of the \n     uniformed services--14,500 from DoD and about 600 from the \n     other uniformed services--do not currently receive VA \n     disability benefits that they are entitled to receive. Since \n     many disability retirees are not taxed on their annuities, \n     there is no incentive under current law for these retirees to \n     apply for the tax-free VA benefits, as they will be offset, \n     dollar-for-dollar, against their retirement annuities. \n     Section 641 would provide a significant incentive for the \n     more disabled of these individuals to apply for VA disability \n     benefits. CBO estimates that about 7,000 disability retirees \n     might be eligible for concurrent receipt under section 641, \n     but, because many of these retirees are both disabled and \n     quite elderly, CBO expects that only about half of that \n     number would become aware of this improved benefit and \n     successfully complete the application process. Based on their \n     DoD-assessed degree of disability, CBO estimates that outlays \n     for VA disability benefits would increase by $13 million in \n     2004, about $270 million over the 2003-2007 period, and $760 \n     million over the 2003-2012 period. Because of the time needed \n     for individuals to prepare and submit their applications and \n     the current backlog in processing applications, CBO estimates \n     that enacting this legislation would not increase outlays for \n     veterans' disability compensation in 2003.\n       Survivor Benefit Plan Offsetting Receipts. Many retirees \n     have a Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) premium payment deducted \n     from their retirement annuity. The SBP was established in \n     Public Law 92-425 to create an opportunity for military \n     retirees to provide annuities for their survivors. Those \n     retirees who are not receiving a paycheck from DoD because \n     their retirement annuity is totally offset by their VA \n     disability benefit may still participate in the SBP by paying \n     the monthly premium to the U.S. Treasury. These payments are \n     recorded as offsetting receipts (a credit against direct \n     spending) to DoD. According to DoD, approximately 34,000 \n     military retirees paid $23 million in SBP premiums to the \n     Treasury in 2001. DoD also indicates that about $7 million of \n     that amount was paid by about 8,000 retirees who would begin \n     to receive annuity checks under section 641. CBO's estimate \n     of the increase in retirement outlays presented above assumes \n     that the SBP premiums of retirees who benefit from the \n     legislation would be deducted from the retirees' annuities, \n     and their payments to the Treasury would cease. Assuming \n     continuation of current trends in population and benefit \n     growth, CBO estimates these offsetting receipts would \n     decrease by about $7 million in 2003, $40 million over the \n     2003-2007 period, and $90 million over the 2003-2012 period.\n       Repeal of Special Compensation for Severely Disabled \n     Retirees. Section 641 also would repeal a special \n     compensation program that currently pays a fixed benefit of \n     $50 to $300 a month to certain uniformed service retirees who \n     were determined to be 60 percent to 100 percent disabled \n     within four years of their retirement. These special payments \n     would stop on January 1, 2003, under section 641. Based on \n     information from DoD and assuming the population growth \n     trends continue, CBO estimates that about 36,000 DoD retirees \n     and about 600 retirees of the other uniformed services will \n     receive an average monthly benefit of $150 in 2002. Under \n     current law, this benefit is scheduled to increase over the \n     next two years to $172 a month. CBO estimates that the \n     savings from repealing this program would be $49 million in \n     2003, about $320 million over the 2003-2007 period, and $690 \n     million over the 2003-2012 period.\n       Increased Accrual Payment Financing. The military \n     retirement system is financed in part by an annual payment \n     from appropriated funds (an outlay in budget function 050) to \n     the Military Retirement Fund, based on an estimate of the \n     system's accruing liabilities. If this provision is enacted, \n     the yearly contribution to the fund would increase to reflect \n     the added liability from the expected increase in annuities \n     to future retirees. These discretionary costs were discussed \n     earlier in the ``Spending Subject to Appropriation'' section.\n       Education Benefits for the Selected Reserve. Section 651 \n     would extend the period during which eligible reservists may \n     use their education benefits from 10 years to 14 years. VA \n     reported that, in 2001, over 82,000 reservists trained under \n     this program and received an average annual benefit of \n     $1,653. This average benefit includes both the basic benefit \n     and a supplemental benefit that DoD can offer to enhance \n     accessions or re-enlistment in critical skill specialties. \n     This benefit increases each year by a cost-of-living \n     adjustment and by the level of supplemental benefits being \n     offered. Based on current usage rates, CBO estimates that \n     enacting this extension would result in an extra 1,500 \n     trainees a year. Based on information from DoD and VA, CBO \n     estimates that enacting this legislation would increase \n     education outlays by $2 million in 2003, $10 million over \n     the 2003-2007 period and by $24 million over the 2003-2012 \n     period. Since DoD makes monthly payments into the DoD \n     Education Benefits Fund in the amount of the net present \n     value of the benefits granted during the previous month, \n     this increase in usage of the education benefit would \n     necessitate an increase in payments to the fund. (The \n     discretionary costs associated with these payments are \n     discussed earlier in the ``Spending Subject to \n     Appropriation'' section under the heading of ``Education \n     and Training.'')\n       Mental Health Benefits. Section 702 would remove a \n     statutory requirement that inpatient mental health care be \n     preauthorized for retirees and dependents who are eligible \n     for Medicare. Under current law, Tricare for Life (TFL), \n     another medical program run by DoD, pays all Medicare \n     copayments and deductibles for those benefits that are \n     covered by both programs. Beginning in 2003, TFL spending for \n     Medicare-eligible retirees and dependents will be considered \n     direct spending. Under current law, Medicare does not require \n     a preauthorization for inpatient mental health care but \n     Tricare does. Removing this requirement would make the mental \n     health benefits identical and reduce confusion among \n     beneficiaries and health care providers.\n       Although most individuals would seek preauthorization \n     before receiving inpatient mental health care, CBO expects \n     that, under current law, some individuals would fail to \n     obtain the necessary preauthorization from Tricare and would \n     have to pay the copayments and deductibles on their own. \n     Because DoD does not have any available data on the frequency \n     or costs of inpatient mental health care for Medicare-\n     eligible retirees and dependents, CBO extrapolated this data \n     from the general Medicare population. Under section 702, CBO \n     estimates that in 2003 TFL would cover the copayments and \n     deductibles for about 600 additional people at an average \n     cost of about $1,700 per person. Thus, CBO estimates section \n     702 would raise direct spending by $1 million in 2003, $5 \n     million over the 2003-2007 period, and $15 million over the \n     2003-2012 period.\n       Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Incentives. S. \n     2514 contains several provisions that would allow the DoD and \n     DOE to offer voluntary separation incentives to their \n     civilian employees. Taken together, CBO estimates enacting \n     these provisions would increase direct spending for federal \n     retirement and retiree health care benefits by $34 million in \n     2004 and $196 million over the 2004-2012 period.\n       Section 1102 would provide DoD with authority to offer its \n     civilian employees voluntary retirement incentive payments of \n     up to $25,000 for employees who voluntarily retire or resign \n     in fiscal years 2004 thorough 2006. Current buyout authority \n     for DoD is set to expire on September 30, 2003. CBO estimates \n     that enacting section 1102 would increase direct spending for \n     federal retirement and retiree health care benefits by $31 \n     million in 2004 and $188 million over the 2004-2012 period.\n       Section 3163 would provide DOE with authority to offer \n     payments of up to $25,000 to employees who voluntarily retire \n     or resign in calendar year 2004. Current buyout authority for \n     DOE is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003. CBO \n     estimates enacting section 3163 would increase direct \n     spending for federal retirement and retiree health care \n     benefits by about $3 million in 2004 and about $8 million \n     during the 2004-2012 period.\n       DoD Retirement Spending. CBO assumes that about 16,500 DoD \n     employees would participate in the buyout program over the \n     three-year period and that many workers who take a buyout \n     would begin collecting federal retirement benefits several \n     years earlier than they would under current law. Inducing \n     some workers to retire earlier would result in additional \n     benefits being paid from the Civil Service Retirement and \n     Disability Fund. In later years, annual federal retirement \n     outlays would be lower than under current law because the \n     employees who retire early receive smaller annuity payments \n     than if they had retired later. CBO estimates that enacting \n     section 1102 would increase direct spending for federal \n     retirement benefits by $24 million in 2004 and $136 million \n     over the 2004-2012 period. (The discretionary costs over the \n     2004-2006 period associated with the buyout payments were \n     discussed earlier in the ``Spending Subject to \n     Appropriation'' section under the heading of ``Voluntary \n     Separation and Early Retirement Incentives.'')\n       DoD Retiree Health Care Spending. Enacting section 1102 \n     also would increase direct spending on federal benefits for \n     retiree health care because many employees who accept the \n     buyouts would continue to be eligible for coverage under the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The \n     government's share of the premium for these retirees--unlike \n     current employees--is mandatory spending. Because many of \n     those accepting the buyouts would convert from being an \n     employee to being a retiree earlier than under current law, \n     mandatory spending for FEHB premiums would increase. CBO \n     estimates\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\n     these additional FEHB benefits would increase direct spending \n     by $7 million in 2004 and $52 million over the 2004-2012 \n     period.\n       DOE Retirement Spending. CBO assumes that about 350 DOE \n     employees would participate in the buyout program in calender \n     year 2004 and that many workers who take a buyout would begin \n     collecting federal retirement benefits several years earlier \n     than they would under current law. Inducing some workers to \n     retire earlier would result in additional retirement benefits \n     being paid from the CSRDF. In later years, annual federal \n     retirement outlays would be lower than under current law \n     because the employees who retire early receive smaller \n     annuity payments than if they had retired later. Under \n     section 3163, CBO estimates spending for federal retirement \n     benefits would increase by $3 million in 2004 and by $8 \n     million over the 2004-2012 period.\n       DOE Retiree Health Care Spending. Section 3163 would also \n     increase spending on federal retiree health benefits because \n     many employees who would accept the buyouts continue to \n     eligible for coverage under the FEHB program. CBO estimates \n     that these additional FEHB benefits would increase direct \n     spending by less than $500,000 a year over the 2004-2006 \n     period.\n       Revitalizing DoD Laboratories. Section 241 would allow DoD \n     to establish a new three-year pilot program beginning in \n     March 2003 at various DoD laboratories to pursue improved \n     efficiencies for performing research and development work at \n     these laboratories. The section also would extend through \n     2006 authorizations for similar pilot projects that will \n     expire in 2003. Finally, section 241 would permit \n     laboratories participating in this new pilot program to enter \n     into public-private partnerships and other business \n     arrangements with private firms to achieve improved \n     efficiencies. The authority to enter into such partnerships \n     would expire in 2006. Under section 241, one of the public-\n     private partnerships could be established as a limited \n     liability corporation where the federal and nonfederal \n     partners could contribute capital, services, or facilities to \n     the corporation.\n       CBO has little information about how this limited liability \n     corporation would be structured, but one of the purposes of \n     this corporation would be to finance improvements to DoD's \n     research, test, and evaluation functions. CBO considers such \n     hybrid entities as governmental. Hence, their activities \n     should be recorded in the federal budget. CBO treats the \n     assets that are expected to be contributed by the private \n     party as borrowed by the federal government. Borrowing \n     authority is treated as budget authority in the year and in \n     the amounts that CBO estimates the private party would \n     contribute to the limited liability corporation. This \n     budgetary treatment is consistent with the recommendations of \n     the President's 1967 Commission on Budget Concepts, which \n     suggests that entities jointly capitalized with private and \n     public assets be included in the federal budget until they \n     are completely privately owned.\n       CBO assumes that DoD would need about one year to develop \n     the policies and regulations for the new corporation that \n     would be authorized under section 241. Based on information \n     provided by DoD, CBO estimates that the additional expenses \n     of the limited liability corporation could total between $4 \n     million and $7 million a year. Assuming costs fall midway \n     within that range, CBO estimates that federal borrowing would \n     be about $6 million starting in 2004 and total about $15 \n     million over the 2004-2006 period.\n       The budget also would record any cash proceeds collected by \n     the corporation from the public. Any payments from federal \n     agencies would be an intragovernmental transfer and would \n     have no net budgetary impact. In contrast, any proceeds \n     accruing to the corporation from nonfederal entities would \n     be recorded as offsetting collections and would reduce the \n     net cost of the partnership over time. For this estimate, \n     CBO assumes that the government would use most of the \n     services of this corporation. As a result, CBO estimates \n     that proceeds from nonfederal sources would not be \n     significant.\n       Land Conveyance and Other Property Transactions. Title \n     XXVIII would authorize a variety of property transactions \n     involving both large and small parcels of land.\n       Section 2824 would allow the Secretary of the Navy to \n     convey 30.38 acres and 133 housing units located at Westover \n     Reserve Air Base to the city of Chicopee, Massachusetts, \n     without receiving payment for this property. Under current \n     law, the Navy will soon declare this property excess and \n     transfer it to the General Services Administration (GSA) for \n     disposal. Under normal procedures, GSA sells property not \n     needed by other federal agencies or by nonfederal entities in \n     need of property for public-use purposes such as parks or \n     educational facilities. Information from GSA indicates that \n     the housing and land will likely be sold under current law \n     after the entire parcel is screened for other uses in 2003. \n     As a result, CBO estimates that this conveyance would result \n     in forgone receipts totaling about $3 million in 2004.\n       Section 2828 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior \n     to convey to the city of West Wendover, Nevada, and Tooele \n     County, Utah, without consideration, two parcels of federal \n     land located in those states and identified in the bill. \n     According to the Bureau of Land Management, those lands, \n     which are withdrawn for military purposes, currently generate \n     no offsetting receipts and are not expected to in the \n     foreseeable future. Hence, CBO estimates that conveying the \n     lands would not affect offsetting receipts. According to the \n     U.S. Air Force, portions of the lands that could be conveyed \n     have been used as a bombing range by the Air Force. Under the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act, the Air Force would have to remediate any \n     expended and unexploded ordnance prior to conveying those \n     lands. Based on information from the Air Force, we estimate \n     that initial remediation activities would cost at least $2 \n     million, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. \n     Although we do not have sufficient information to estimate \n     the cost of subsequent remediation activities that may be \n     necessary, CBO expects that such costs could be significant. \n     Any spending for additional remediation would be subject to \n     appropriation.\n       CBO estimates that other provisions in title XXVIII would \n     not result in significant costs to the federal government \n     because they would either authorize DoD to convey land for \n     fair market value, to exchange one piece of property for \n     another or would authorize DoD to convey land that under \n     current law is unlikely to be declared excess and sold or is \n     likely to be given away.\n       Other Provisions. The following provisions would have an \n     insignificant budgetary impact on direct spending:\n       Section 111 would extend through 2004 the authority for a \n     pilot program that allows industrial facilities within the \n     Army to sell manufactured goods to the private sector even if \n     the goods are manufactured in the domestic market. Section \n     111 also would direct that a portion of the sales proceeds in \n     excess of $20 million a year be made available for ammunition \n     demilitarization. CBO estimates, however, that there would \n     likely be less than $5 million in annual sales under this \n     pilot program over the 2003-2004 period, based on data \n     provided by the Army, and that since the industrial \n     facilities are allowed to spend any sales proceeds, the net \n     effect on direct spending would be insignificant.\n       Section 642 would increase the retirement annuity of \n     enlisted servicemembers who are retired from a reserve \n     component of the Armed Forces and have been credited by their \n     service secretary with extraordinary heroism in the line of \n     duty. Under section 642, these retirees would be entitled to \n     a 10 percent increase in their retirement annuity. CBO \n     estimates that enacting section 642 would increase direct \n     spending by less than $500,000 a year.\n       Section 1063 would extend through 2006 DoD's authority to \n     sell aircraft and aircraft parts for use in responding to oil \n     spills. Based on information from DoD, CBO does not \n     anticipate any transactions would occur under this authority.\n       Section 3151 would require that the program to eliminate \n     weapons-grade plutonium production in Russia be transferred \n     from the Department of Defense to the Department of Energy. \n     Funds appropriated for the program for 2000 through 2002 \n     would be transferred to DOE and would be made available for \n     obligation until expended. Under current law, those funds \n     have a three-year period of availability, thus this provision \n     could result in a reappropriation because it would extend the \n     availability of some funds that would otherwise lapse. CBO \n     estimates that about $120 million has been appropriated for \n     this program over the 2000-2002 period and that nearly all of \n     those funds will be obligated and spent under current law. As \n     a result, CBO estimates that reappropriations under section \n     3151 would not be significant--probably less than $500,000 \n     annually from 2003 through 2005.\n       Section 3162 would allow the Department of Energy to \n     penalize contractors operating at DOE facilities for \n     occupational safety violations. These penalties would most \n     likely be levied by reducing the fees owed to the contractor. \n     Based on information about penalties levied over the last few \n     years for nuclear safety violations, CBO estimates that the \n     reduction in contract fees due to occupational safety \n     violations would be less than $500,000 annually.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in direct spending that are subject \n     to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 6. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects through fiscal year 2006 are counted.\n\n                                          TABLE 6.--ESTIMATED IMPACT OF S. 2514 ON DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                         By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   2002    2003    2004    2005    2006    2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays..............................................       0     359     674   1,081   1,533   1,936   2,132   2,261   2,391   2,529   2,676\nChanges in receipts                                                                                    Not applicable\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 2514 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On May 3, 2002, CBO transmitted a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 4546, the Bob Stump National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, as ordered reported \n     by the House Committee on Armed Services on May 1, 2002. The \n     House bill would authorize approximately $382 billion in \n     defense funding for fiscal year 2003 ($10 billion less than \n     S. 2514 would authorize for 2003) and an estimated $14 \n     billion in additional defense funding for 2002 (as also \n     contained in S. 2514).\n       Both H.R. 4546 and S. 2514 would increase direct spending \n     over the 2003-2007 period, but the Senate bill contains about \n     $200 million less spending. Both bills contain provisions \n     that would phase in over five years total or partial payment \n     of retirement annuities together with veterans' disability \n     compensation to retirees from the uniformed services who have \n     service-connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or greater \n     but the provisions specify different rates and schedules for \n     phasing in the increased payments.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, and \nI look forward again--as this will be our 24th year--of working \ntogether on the authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I simply say to my good friend, the chairman, he \nmentioned that the Bush administration has yet to provide a formal \nnational security strategy. I note that the timetable for submitting \nthis document is not unusual. The Clinton administration did not submit \nits first national security strategy until well into its second year in \noffice. In my contacts with the administration, they will soon be \nsubmitting that national security strategy.\n  I thank Chairman Levin for the work he has done on the bill which is \nbefore the Senate. I also want to thank my colleagues on the committee \nfor their wise counsel and efforts, as well as the tremendous efforts \nof our committee staff. In large measure, this Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003 is a good bill and an important step forward \nin our war against terrorism. In this time of national emergency it is \nessential that we provide our President and our armed forces the vital \nresources they need to defend our Nation, and to fight the scourge of \nterrorism at home and abroad.\n  In the end, I joined with seven of my Republican colleagues on the \ncommittee in voting against this bill in committee--primarily due to \nthe drastic cut of over $800 million in missile defense. Having worked \nhard for a year on the many critical issues related to this bill, I \nconsidered my vote against the bill necessary, but regrettable.\n  Despite the fact that I voted against this bill, I support most of \nwhat is contained in this legislation. It represents the bipartisan \nwork of all committee members--working together to support our men and \nwomen in uniform, and their families.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 contains \nthe largest defense increase in over 20 years--an increase of $45.0 \nbillion over the fiscal year 2002 appropriated level. The good news \nstory associated with this much needed increase is that it has the \nfull, bipartisan support of the Senate. While there is disagreement \nover how some of the money is allocated in this bill, there is \nvirtually no dissent about the need for this significant increase in \nthe top line for defense. This is a remarkable display of unity behind \nour President, so important and fitting with our nation at war.\n  In line with the request of the President, the bill significantly \nincreases all major defense accounts over the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriated levels:\n  It increases spending on military personnel by over 12 percent, \nincluding a 4.1 percent pay raise for our servicemen and women.\n  It increases funding for operations and maintenance by over 15 \npercent, providing the necessary resources to fully fund our war \neffort.\n  The bill increases the procurement account by almost 10 percent. This \nwill enable our military departments to procure the equipment they need \nto replace aging and heavily used assets, as well as to buy the things \nthey need to protect our facilities, infrastructure and people in these \nincreasingly uncertain and dangerous times.\n  Additionally, the bill increases spending on research and development \nby almost 9 percent, ensuring that investment is being made in the \nfuture to develop the capabilities we need to deter and defeat emerging \nthreats to our national security.\n  The bill also sets aside a $10.0 billion reserve fund, as requested \nby the President, to pay for ongoing and future military operations in \nthe global war on terrorism.\n  The threats to our Nation and the ongoing war on terrorism demand \nthis increased investment in national security, both now and in the \nfuture.\n  The bill contains many key provisions which I support to improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform, our retirees, and \ntheir families. In addition to the 4.1 percent pay raise for our \nuniformed personnel I mentioned earlier, additional funding is included \nfor facilities and services that will greatly improve the quality of \nlife for our service personnel and their families, at home and abroad. \nThe bill includes a legislative provision that calls for the phased \nrepeal of the prohibition on concurrent receipt of non-disability \nretired military pay and veterans disability pay for our military \nretirees with disabilities rated at 60 percent or higher. The committee \nalso approved a managers' amendment, sponsored by Senator Bob Smith, \nwhich will soon be considered by the full Senate, to repeal fully and \nimmediately, the prohibition on concurrent receipt, a step which will \nallow all nondisability retired veterans with VA disability ratings to \ncollect the full amount they have earned. This action is long overdue.\n  It is important to note that this bill, with the exception of the \ncuts made to missile defense, supports and fully funds virtually all of \nthe priorities established by the Department and the President for the \ndevelopment and procurement of major weapons systems, including Joint \nStrike Fighter, F-22 and the Army's future combat system. In addition, \nI was pleased that we were able to add $229 million to the CVN(X) new \ngeneration aircraft carrier to restore the original development and \nfielding schedule for this essential program. The carrier proved its \nworth once again in Afghanistan--a war which relied on carrier-based \nassets. This bill supports acceleration of this important program.\n  Despite the very favorable aspects of this bill, however, I cannot \nsupport the bill in its current form. I was joined by seven of my \nRepublican colleagues in opposing the bill as reported by the \ncommittee.\n  For the second consecutive year, the Senate Armed Services Committee \ndivided along party lines primarily over the issue of missile defense. \nSincere, good-faith efforts were made by Republican Members to find \ncommon ground and compromise on this issue, but these efforts were \nvoted down. The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n2003 that we have before us, in my view, fundamentally alters the \nPresident's national security priorities and fails to send a clear \nmessage, on the issue of missile defense, to America's allies and \nadversaries that the Congress will provide the resources necessary to \nprotect our homeland, our troops deployed overseas and our allies and \nfriends from all known threats--including the very real and growing \nthreat of missile attack. I will work in the days ahead, and into the \nconference with the House, to restore the cuts made to these important \nprograms and to staunchly defend the priorities our President has \nestablished.\n\n  The world as we knew it changed forever on September 11. We lost not \nonly many lives and much property that day, but we also lost our \nuniquely American feeling of invulnerability;\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nour feeling of safety within our shores, our borders, behind two vast \noceans. But from our darkest hour, our nation has quickly emerged \nstronger and more united than ever. Our President has rallied our \ncountry and many nations around the world to fight the evil of \nterrorism.\n  As we begin our floor debate on the national defense authorization \nbill for fiscal year 2003, our nation is at war. U.S. soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines, together with their coalition partners, \nare engaged on the front lines in the global war against terrorism, \nwith a mission to root out terrorism at its source in the hopes of \npreventing future attacks. Our armed forces have responded to the call \nof duty in the finest traditions of our nation. It is critical that the \nCongress keep faith with our troops by providing the resources and \ncapabilities our President--our Commander in Chief has requested.\n  Homeland security is now, without a doubt, our top priority. We have \na solemn obligation to protect our Nation and our citizens from all \nknown and anticipated threats--whatever their source or means of \ndelivery. As a candidate and as President, George W. Bush promised our \nNation that homeland security was his most urgent priority.\n  Our President submitted a responsible, prioritized budget request for \nfiscal year 2003 that addressed our most important security needs. The \nbill before us reflects the urgent security needs of our Nation by \ndoubling the funding for combating terrorism at home and abroad. It \ninvests in new technologies to detect weapons of mass destruction and \nto deter their development. The bill provides funding and authorities \nfor the establishment of new organizations within the Department of \nHomeland Defense, including the formation of Northern Command, \nNORTHCOM, to provide coordinated land, sea and air defense of the \nUnited States. As we re-look and re-evaluate our security needs, it is \nespecially important to remember that protection of our nation, our \ncitizens, our deployed troops and our allies from ballistic missiles is \nalso an integral part of homeland defense and an overall sense of \nsecurity.\n  The budget request for missile defense was reasonable. It was a \nrequest that represented no increase over last year's funding level, \nand a request that was less than two percent of the defense budget. We \nmust use these resources to move forward now, without artificial \nlimitations--either fiscal or legislative--to develop and deploy \nadequate missile defenses.\n  The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2003, as \nreported out of committee, contains a drastic reduction, of over $800 \nmillion, from the President's request for missile defense programs, \nincluding over $400 million in reductions to theater missile defense \nprograms. In addition, the bill contains a number of restrictions and \nexcessive reporting requirements that will further hamper the rapid \ndevelopment of missile defenses. Together, these actions have resulted \nin a letter from the Secretary of Defense informing the Senate that he \nwould recommend a veto of this legislation if the reductions and \nrestrictions on missile defense remain.\n  Three years ago, by a vote of 97 to 3, this body approved the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999--the Cochran bill. This act \nestablished two clear goals: to deploy an effective ballistic missile \ndefense for the United States, ``as soon as technologically feasible;'' \nand, to seek further negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. \nLast month, President Bush signed a landmark arms control agreement, in \nMoscow, that will ultimately reduce the number of U.S. and Russian \ndeployed nuclear warheads by two-thirds over the next 10 years. The \nsecond goal of the Cochran bill has been achieved.\n  This month, the United States formally withdrew from the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty--a 30-year-old treaty--which had hampered the \nU.S. missile defense program. With this action, all artificial \nrestraints have been removed from the ability of the United States to \nresearch, develop and deploy effective missile defense systems. Both \ngoals of the Cochran bill that the Senate so overwhelmingly supported \nare in sight. Congress should not now apply new limitations on the \nrapid, cost-effective development of defenses to protect our nation and \ndeployed troops from missile attack. The funding reductions and program \nconstraints contained in the bill before us are a significant step \nbackward in our efforts to improve the security of our nation.\n  The threat of missile attack against the United States and U.S. \ninterests is real and growing. According to the January 2002 national \nintelligence estimate, NIE, on the missile threat, ``The probability \nthat a missile with a weapon of mass destruction will be used against \nU.S. forces or interests is higher today than during most of the cold \nwar, and will continue to grow as the capabilities of potential \nadversaries mature.'' Dozens of nations already have short- and medium-\nrange ballistic missiles in the field that threaten U.S. interests, \nmilitary forces, and allies; and others are seeking to acquire similar \ncapabilities, including missiles that could reach the United States. We \nmust be prepared to protect our nation.\n  I am also concerned with other key areas in the bill, particularly \nthe level of funding for shipbuilding. While I understand the tough \nchoices that our defense leaders must make in establishing priorities \nand putting forth budget recommendations, shipbuilding was severely \nunderfunded in the President's budget request. The bill we are now \nconsidering provides some additional resources for shipbuilding, but I \nbelieve more must be done to reverse the downward trend in \nshipbuilding. We all know that we are not currently building enough \nships to maintain an adequate Navy for the future. Ultimately, there \nwill be a high price to pay if this trend is not reversed.\n  It is with these concerns in mind that I urge my colleagues to join \nme in constructive dialogue to find a way to restore the President's \nfundamental national security priorities and to ensure we are making \nthe right investments in future capabilities. It is imperative that we \nsend our President, our fellow citizens and the world a message of \nresolve from the Congress--a national defense authorization bill that \nprovides the resources and authorities our Nation's leaders and our \narmed forces require to protect our Nation, our citizens abroad, our \nvital interests, and our international partners who stand with us \nagainst terrorism.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman. I am going to a meeting on this \nbill tonight as to how we can order the amendments tomorrow on which I \nwill work with the chairman.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of my most important \nresponsibilities throughout my almost 48 years in the Senate has been \nto vote on the annual national defense authorization bill. This bill \nnot only provides for our Nation's security but, more importantly, it \nprovides for the Nation's most valuable asset, the men and women who so \nproudly wear the uniform and their family members who are an integral \npart of our military. Today, I rise, ever mindful of my \nresponsibilities, to offer my views on the last national defense \nauthorization bill that I will vote on before I leave the Senate.\n  Before discussing the bill, I want to congratulate Chairman Levin, \nand the ranking member, Senator Warner, for their leadership of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. The challenges they face in pulling \ntogether this annual bill are immense, yet, year after year they \nprepare a bill that reflects a bipartisan approach to national \nsecurity. There may be differences on individual programs, but their \nleadership and the participation of every member of the committee \ncrafted a bill that enhances the security of the country and improves \nthe quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines and \ntheir families.\n  The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2003, \nsupports the President's budget request of $379 million, the largest \nincrease to the defense budget in twenty years. It provides significant \nincreases in military pay, readiness funding, and military \nconstruction. The bill includes a provision that would address long-\nstanding inequities in the compensation of military retirees by \nauthorizing the concurrent receipt of retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation. This is an issue which I have supported for \nsome time and I am pleased to see it resolved this year.\n  Like all bills there are provisions that cause me concern. The most \negregious in this bill is the reduction to the\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nPresident's request for missile defense. By reallocating more than $800 \nmillion requested for missile defense to other programs, the bill \nfundamentally alters the President's priorities and leaves open the \npossibility that we will not adequately defend our Nation against a \nmissile attack. I urge the Senate to reverse this flawed provision.\n  Mr. President, in closing I remind my colleagues that this bill also \nprovides vital funding to support our forces currently engaged in the \nwar against terrorism. This war is unlike any faced by my generation. \nIt will not be won by large armies, but by dedicated, highly trained \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. I am extremely proud of what our \nmilitary personnel have accomplished and I have no doubt that their \nprofessionalism and dedication will bring an end to the terrorist \nthreat. We owe these men and women the best our Nation can provide and \nwe must show them our support by voting for this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, as we have recently passed June 13, I \nwant to discuss the demise of the Anti-Ballistic Missile ABM Treaty \nthat ceased to exist after that date. I believe it is important to help \na record of how this important treaty was brought to its end.\n  The ABM Treaty was signed by President Nixon in 1972 with the Soviet \nUnion as an important element of U.S.-Soviet arms control and strategic \nstability. It served to prevent an arms race in defensive weapons that \nwould have led to larger offensive nuclear missile forces. It thus \nhelped pave the way for negotiated limits and reductions in strategic \narms. It was supported by every U.S. President until President George \nW. Bush, including Presidents Ford, Reagan and the first President \nBush.\n  The ABM Treaty affected only defenses against long-range, or \nstrategic, ballistic missiles, those missiles with ranges of 5,500 \nkilometers or more. It has no effect on defenses against missiles of \nshorter ranges, which are the only missiles that endanger our troops \nand allies today, and against which we have designed and built the \nPatriot theater missile defense system and helped develop Israel's \nArrow missile defense system.\n  Both the United States and the Soviet Union saw this treaty as a \ncentral component of their efforts to ensure mutual security. Russia, \nlike the Soviet Union before it, saw the ABM Treaty as one of the \nfoundations for the structure of arms control and security arrangements \nthat had been carefully built over three decades to reduce the risk of \nnuclear war.\n  As late as June 2000, at their Moscow summit, President Clinton and \nPresident Putin issued a joint statement emphasizing the importance of \nthe ABM Treaty. That statement said the two Presidents ``agree on the \nessential contribution of the ABM Treaty to reductions in offensive \nforces, and reaffirm their commitment to that treaty as a cornerstone \nof strategic stability.'' It also stated that ``The Presidents reaffirm \ntheir commitment to continuing efforts to strengthen the ABM Treaty and \nto enhance its viability and effectiveness in the future, taking into \naccount any changes in the international security environment.''\n  Last December 13, President Bush announced that the United States \nwould unilaterally withdrawn from the treaty. The treaty permits either \nside to withdraw from the treaty upon six months notice if either side \ndecides that ``extraordinary events related to the subject matter of \nthis Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests.''\n  Although President Bush and members of his administration said they \nwould try to modify the treaty to permit the development, testing and \ndeployment of a limited National Missile Defense system, in the end \nthey did not offer an amendment to the Russians.\n  When he was campaigning for the presidency, then-Governor Bush gave a \nspeech at The Citadel on September 23, 1999, in which he stated the \nfollowing: ``we will offer Russia the necessary amendments to the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty--an artifact of the Cold War confrontation.'' \nHe went on to say: ``If Russia refuses the changes we will give prompt \nnotice, under the provisions of the Treaty, that we can no longer be a \nparty to it.''\n  That seems to be a clear and straightforward position. Candidate Bush \nsaid that the United States would offer amendments to the Russians to \nmodify the treaty so as to permit the deployment of missile defense \nsystems, and if Russia refused the amendments the President would \nwithdraw the United States from the treaty.\n  But the administration didn't propose any amendments to the treaty \nthat would permit it to remain in effect in a modified form that, in \nturn, would have permitted the testing and deployment of limited \nmissiles defenses.\n  Instead, we tried to sell Russia on the idea of abandoning the \ntreaty, not modifying it. That was something the Russians were never \ngoing to accept.\n  Last year it was difficult to get a clear answer from the \nadministration on its missile defense plans for fiscal year 2002, and \nwhether they would be inconsistent with the ABM Treaty. First, \nLieutenant General Ronald Kadish, director of the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization told us in June that he knew of no planned missile \ndefense testing activities that would conflict with the treaty.\n  Later in June, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld told us he didn't know \nwhether there would be a conflict because, even after the budget had \nbeen submitted to Congress, the missile defense program was undecided.\n  Then in July, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz said that our \nplanned missile defense activities would inevitably ``bump up'' against \nthe treaty in a manner of months, not years. He also said that by the \ntime a planned missile defense activity encounters ABM Treaty \nconstraints, ``we fully hope and intend to have reached an \nunderstanding with Russia'' on a new security framework with Russia \nthat would include missile defenses.\n  Next came an announcement on October of last year by Secretary \nRumsfeld that several planned missile defense tests were being \npostponed because they could have violated the treaty, even though one \nof the tests had already been postponed previously for entirely \ndifferent technical reasons.\n  Finally, the President announced on December 13th that the United \nStates would unilaterally withdraw from the ABM Treaty to permit \ntesting and development of missile defenses, something Deputy Secretary \nWolfowitz had previously called a ``less than optimal'' choice.\n  During all months of discussions and negotiations with the Russians \nwe never heard details of any amendments proposed by the United States \nto modify the permit limited missile defenses. At the end we didn't \noffer an amendment to the treaty.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell acknowledged this fact in a letter \ndated May 2, 2002 after I wrote him in January to ask whether the \nUnited States had, in fact, ever presented Russia with any proposed \namendments or modifications to the treaty. ``The direct answer to your \nquestion,'' wrote Secretary Powell, ``is that we did not table a \nproposed amendment to the ABM Treaty.''\n  The administration has made much of the argument that the ABM Treaty \nwas the reason we could not develop and test missile defense \ntechnologies adequately, and thus the treaty was keeping us defenseless \nagainst ballistic missiles.\n  Madam President, now that the ABM Treaty has ceased to exist, I \nexpect the administration to assert that they are finally free to make \nunconstrained progress toward defenses against long-range ballistic. As \none example, they plan to begin construction of a missile\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\ndefense test facility in Alaska, even though that would have been \npermitted under the treaty. Congress authorized this construction last \nyear, and they could have begun construction while the treaty was still \nin force. I expect they will also start to conduct a number of tests \nthat would not have been permitted under the treaty, but which will not \nsignificantly advance the state of missile defense technology in the \nnear term.\n  All this may make good political theater, but it will not suddenly \nmake possible rapid progress toward effective missile defenses because \nit wasn't the treaty that was preventing such progress; If these \ntechnologies prove workable, it will still take many years of rigorous \ndevelopment, integration, testing, and refinement, and probably \nhundreds of billions of dollars, to produce operationally effective \nmissile defenses--even without the ABM Treaty.\n  And or course, even if they prove to be technologically feasible and \naffordable, limited missile defenses still could be readily overwhelmed \nor spoofed by decoys and countermeasures that Russia or China might \ndevelop and possibly provide to others. In 1999, the intelligence \ncommunity stated publicly that ``Russia and China each have developed \nnumerous countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the requisite \ntechnologies.'' This would only make the task of developing missile \ndefenses more difficult, more time consuming and more expensive.\n  So although the ABM Treaty will come to an end after 30 years, its \nabsence will not suddenly permit effective missile defenses. That task \nwill remain inherently difficult, expensive, and time consuming.\n  Furthermore, there may be long-term consequences of our withdrawal \nthat we cannot yet foresee, but which may make us less secure. For \nexample, two weeks ago it was reported that Japanese officials \nindicated the possibility that Japan may feel a need to pursue its own \nnuclear weapons. This was in response to Japanese concerns about \nChina's increasing nuclear forces, which in turn seems to be, at least \nin part, a Chinese response to our pursuit of defenses against long-\nrange ballistic missiles. Our security will not be enhanced if China \nincreases or accelerates its nuclear missile forces, or if Japan then \ndecides to pursue its own nuclear weapons.\n  Madam President, this is just one recent example of the kind of \nrepercussions or consequences that may result from our unilateral \nwithdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Other nations will act in their own \nself interest, and if our actions make other nations feel less secure, \nthey will act in a manner designed to preserve their security--even if \nit makes us less secure. In a world with nuclear weapons, the United \nStates cannot be secure by making other nations feel insecure. If our \nballistic missile defense efforts make other nations feel less secure, \nthey could take actions that would reduce our security.\n  We cannot yet foresee all the long-term reverberations from our \ndecision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. By taking a unilateral \napproach, it makes it more likely that others will act unilaterally as \nwell. That is not the best way to increase mutual security and \ninternational stability.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the correspondence \nbetween Secretary of State Powell and myself on this matter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                          Washington, May 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your recent letters \n     concerning our discussions with the Russians concerning an \n     amendment of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.\n       The direct answer to your question is that we did not table \n     a proposed amendment to the ABM Treaty. Although we did have \n     ideas on what an amendment might look like and discussed them \n     at length with Russia, the discussions never reached the \n     point that such a proposal would have been appropriate. We \n     were prepared to entertain any proposal, to include an \n     amendment, that would allow us to do the missile defense \n     testing we needed to do. The Russians, in the end, made it \n     clear that, in their view, such testing would be inconsistent \n     with the Treaty and an amendment to permit such testing would \n     vitiate the Treaty.\n       The way out of this impasse was for us to leave the Treaty \n     as provided for by the Treaty. The Russians regretted our \n     decision, but recognized our right to withdraw.\n       The President was faithful to his 1999 campaign statement. \n     We spent ten months trying to find a way to conduct our \n     testing within the Treaty, with or without amendment. We \n     could not find a way to do so and we, therefore, are leaving \n     the Treaty.\n       This issue is now behind us and we are working with the \n     Russians on a new strategic framework.\n           Sincerely,\n     Colin L. Powell.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Colin Powell,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I received a letter dated February 4, \n     2002 (attached) from Paul Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State \n     for Legislative Affairs in response to my letter to you dated \n     January 10, 2002, regarding the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) \n     Treaty. Mr. Kelly's letter did not answer my questions.\n       These are important questions and I feel it is essential to \n     receive clear written answers to them. To this end, I am \n     asking you to provide answers to these questions.\n       1. Did the United States ever present to the Russian \n     government any written proposal or proposals to amend or \n     modify the ABM Treaty? If so, what specific proposal(s) did \n     the U.S. present, where and on what date(s)?\n       2. If the United States did present any specific \n     proposal(s) to the Russian government, what was the response \n     of the Russian government to the U.S. proposal(s)?\n       3. If the United States did not ever present to the Russian \n     government any proposals to modify or amend the ABM Treaty, \n     please explain why that is the case, especially given \n     President Bush's commitment to offer Russia ``the necessary \n     amendments'' to the ABM Treaty.\n       I look forward to your answers to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n      Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of January 10, \n     regarding Russia concerning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) \n     Treaty.\n       As you know, the Administration has been engaged in \n     intensive discussions with the Russians on a broad range of \n     strategic issues including the best way to meet the \n     President's objective of moving beyond the ABM Treaty. The \n     President made clear from his first meeting with President \n     Putin last July, his determination to devise a new U.S. \n     strategic posture better suited to meet today's threats. He \n     explained how the ABM Treaty was hindering our government's \n     ability to develop ways to protect people from future \n     terrorist or rogue state missile attacks. We discussed with \n     the Russians a number of ways in which we could devise a new \n     structure that included the Treaty in many meetings over \n     subsequent months but, in the end, we concluded that the best \n     way to proceed was for the United States to withdraw \n     unilaterally. We provided notification of our decision to \n     withdraw from the ABM Treaty on December 13. As President \n     Putin made clear, Russia disagreed with our decision, but was \n     not surprised by it, and judged that it was not a threat to \n     Russian security.\n       Our discussions with Russia on strategic reductions were \n     given added impetus by President Bush's declarations of our \n     intention to reduce our operationally deployed weapons to \n     1700-2200 and by President Putin's positive response and \n     similar intention.\n       We will be continuing our discussions with the Russians in \n     the months ahead, with the objective of reaching further \n     agreements codifying the strategic nuclear reductions we have \n     both decided to undertake and providing for transparency and \n     confidence-building measures relating to missile defenses.\n       We would be happy to provide additional briefings or \n     information if you have further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul V.

Bush stated the following:\n\n     ``At the earliest possible date, my Administration will \n     deploy anti-ballistic missile systems, both theater and \n     national to guard against attack and blackmail. To make this \n     possible, we will offer Russia the necessary amendments to \n     the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty--an artifact of the Cold \n     war confrontation. . . . If Russia refuses the changes\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\n     we will give prompt notice, under the provisions of the \n     Treaty, that we can no longer be a party to it.'' (emphasis \n     added)\n\n       On December 13, 2001, President Bush gave notice of his \n     intent to withdraw the United States from the ABM Treaty. \n     Please provide answers to the following questions:\n       Did the United States ever present to the Russian \n     government any written proposal or proposals to amend or \n     modify the ABM Treaty? If so, what specific proposal(s) did \n     the U.S. present, where and on what date(s)?\n       If the United States did present any specific proposal(s) \n     to the Russian government, what was the response of the \n     Russian government to the U.S. proposal(s)?\n       If the United States did not ever present to the Russian \n     government any proposals to modify or amend the ABM Treaty, \n     please explain why that is the case, especially given \n     President Bush's commitment to offer Russia ``the necessary \n     amendments'' to the ABM Treaty.\n       I would appreciate your prompt response to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, the International Crisis Group, ICG, \nrecently issued a report on the instability and unrest in Mitrovica \ncaused, in part, by the Serbian Ministry of Interior's, MUP, support of \nparallel security and administrative structures in northern Kosovo.\n  According to the report, Serbian officials have publicly admitted to \nproviding salaries to over 29,800 people in Kosovo, including Serb \n``bridgewatchers'' over the river Ibar who were responsible for \ninjuring 26 United Nations Missions in Kosovo, UNMIK, police officers \nin a shootout 2 months ago.\n  Five Americans serving with UNMIK were injured in that incident. \nWhile my thoughts and prayers are with the policemen as they recover, I \nfind it completely unacceptable that Serbian government-backed goons \nhave committed destabilizing acts of violence with virtual impunity. \nThe bridgewatchers and other criminals in northern Kosovo must be \nbrought to justice--a job perhaps best handled by UNMIK police officers \nbacked by NATO-led KFOR troops.\n  Now is not the time for a change in U.S. policy toward Kosovo. \nAmerica must publicly and forcefully condemn any covert or overt \nefforts to partition Mitrovica from the rest of Kosovo.\n  I encourage the State Department to find its voice on this issue, and \nto publicly condemn the actions of the bridgewatchers and their \nsupporters in Belgrade. This issue should not be left to the gentle \nmassage of quiet diplomacy--this is a cancer that must be treated in an \naggressive and forthright manner.\n  It seems clear to me that if Serbia has 50,000,000 Euro to support \nthe partition of Kosovo, the U.S. Congress should consider reducing \nfuture foreign assistance to Serbia by an equivalent amount.\n  The reformers in Serbia know they have my full support and \nencouragement. However, Serbia would be wise to invest its revenues in \nits own political, economic, legal, and social reforms rather than \nfomenting and sponsoring regional unrest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5689-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      DISABLED VETERAN OF THE YEAR\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

He served on the Garrett \nCounty Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, the Governor's Commission for \nEmployment of the Handicapped, the Governor's Commission to Study the \nNeeds of the Handicapped, the Maryland World War II Memorial \nCommission, the Maryland Military Monument Commission, and the Maryland \nVeterans Memorial Commission.\n  As one of Maryland's most highly decorated veterans, Secretary \nBratten boasts life membership in nine congressionally chartered \nveterans organizations, including the Military Order of Foreign Wars, \nthe Americal Veterans Association and the distinguished Military Order \nof the Purple Heart. He has served as the Director of the Maryland \nVeterans Commission, is a member of the National Association of State \nDirectors of Veterans Affairs, and has sat on countless other \ncommittees dedicated to improving the lives of America's veterans.\n  I am so proud of Tom. His record of service in America's military and \nin Maryland civic life as an advocate for veterans and the disabled are \nunique and unparalleled. He is the best example of what Marylanders can \naccomplish when they dedicate themselves to their communities, state, \nand country, no matter what the circumstances. He has served America \nwith honor. I congratulate Tom as he continues to bear the mantle of \nleadership and service as the DAV's veteran of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5689-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ROCKY FLATS SECURITY TEAM--SIMPLY THE BEST\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Kahuku \nHigh and Intermediate School for its successful participation in the We \nthe People: The Citizen and the Constitution national competition. \nKahuku recently won the top award in the contest's Unit 3 category \ncalled ``How the Values and Principles Embodied in the Constitution \nShaped American Institutions and Practices.''\n  The three-day competition, sponsored by the Center for Civic \nEducation in Washington, DC, provided an opportunity for students \nthroughout the country to apply constitutional principles and \nhistorical facts to contemporary situations. The Kahuku students joined \nhundreds of other students nationwide in illustrating their knowledge \nof the Constitution and the Bill of Rights before simulated \ncongressional committees made up of constitutional scholars, lawyers, \njournalists, and government leaders. Students who participate in this \nprogram honor the rights afforded them by the Constitution, and they \naccept and practice their civic responsibilities.\n  The 2001-2002 Kahuku High and Intermediate School team included the \nfollowing students: Ashton Alvarez, Marisa Becker, Jenna Bjorn, \nElizabeth Burroughs, Amanda Chew, Jonathan Ditto, Marissa Hontanosas, \nHeather Huff, Ji Hye Jean, Sondra Kahawaii, Alisi Langi, Solomon Lee, \nEmily Lowe, Sienna Palmer, Michelle Sauque, Jessica Savini, Starlyn \nTaylor, Wilson Unga, Keilani Yang.\n  Hawaii is proud of these students' award-winning performance. I \ncommend them for their hard work in pursuit of worthy goals. I hope \nthat their knowledge and understanding of America's ideals and values \nwill guide them as they become our future leaders.\n  My colleagues may be interested to know that a team from Kahuku High \nand Intermediate School represented Hawaii in eight of the past 10 \nnational competitions. Their success is a testament to the \ninspirational efforts of Kahuku High and Intermediate School teacher \nSandra Cashman. I also wish to acknowledge the contributions of \nDistrict Coordinator Sharon Kaohi and State Coordinator Lyla \nBerg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5690-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THOMAS A. ATHENS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is with sadness that I speak \ntoday about the death of a distinguished citizen of Illinois, Thomas A. \nAthens, who is survived by his wife, Irene, and their three children. \nMr. Athens had a lifetime of outstanding achievement and service to \nGod, this great nation, his home state of Illinois, and his fellow \ncountrymen.\n  A native of Chicago, Mr. Athens attended Northwestern University and \nthen served in the United States Army during the Second World War. \nOutside of his military service, Mr. Athens strove constantly to be \nengaged in philanthropic activity. Whether it was the Greek Orthodox \nChurch, the United Hellenic American Congress, UHAC, or the National \nSteel Distributors, Mr. Athens used his time and magnetic personality \nto build and support these organizations.\n  As a member of the Board of Directors and finance chairman of UHAC \nsince 1975, Mr. Athens' dynamism helped the group to stay true to the \nideals and traditions of Hellenism, while reaching sound levels of \nfinancial stability. He also served as the National Treasurer of the \nAssociation of Steel Distributors, receiving its Steel Man of the year \nAward in 1969. In addition, Mr. Athens has served as the National \nChairman of the Lake Forest College Parent's Fund and is an Honorary \nTrustee of Deree-Pierce College.\n  Mr. Athens had a deep-seated passion for his Church. He was a \nfounding member of the Archbishop Iakovos Leadership 100 Fund, an \nendowment fund for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in America and was \ninstrumental in building its initial member base. He was also a founder \nof Saints Peter and Paul Greek Orthodox Church in Glenview, Illinois, \nand served on the parish council for many years. Mr. Athens has been \nthe recipient of numerous awards, demonstrative of his passion for \nservice to his Church and community. Among the many have been The Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor Award in 1999 and the Knighthood of Mikros \nStravroforos of the Knights of the Orthodox Crossbearers of the All-\nHoly Sepulchre recognition from the Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 1982. \nHe has also received the Medal of St. Andrews in 1980 and the Medal of \nSt. Paul in 1979 from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and the office of \n``Archon Deputatos'' from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople \nin 1977.\n  Mr. Athens, along with his brother Andrew, co-founded Metron Steel \nCorporation, one of the largest independent steel service centers, in \n1950. He served as the Executive Vice President until he retired in \n1985.\n  The Greek-American community and the people of Illinois have lost \nsomeone who spent his life making a contribution to the values and \norganizations he loved. And many of us have lost a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5690-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL FACILITY OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

On June 27, \n2002, Ms. Needler will retire from her position as Vice Principal of \nthe esteemed Washington Irving High School where she also served as \nDirector of the school's distinguished Arts program.\n  The success of the Arts Program is largely the result of Ms. \nNeedler's dedication and resolve. Skillfully combining the support of \nprivate business with her education plan, established an inspiring \nlevel of credibility with her supervisors and peers. This greatly \nbenefited the program she both developed and administered.\n  She was most revered, however, for the special relationships she \ndeveloped with her students. Ms. Needler has been a listener, a \nprotector, an advocate and a constant source of energy for young people \nwho confront the challenges that adolescence may bring.\n  Ms. Needler's career is marked by her creative effort to integrate \nthe world of arts into the lives of her students. Many of those who are \nfamiliar with the Washington Irving High School's Arts Program, \nattribute its success to Ms. Needler's vision, hard work and \ncommitment. Since her arrival the program has expanded beyond bounds. \nNearly 100 percent of its graduates are admitted to four-year colleges. \nWe owe a great debt of gratitude to Ms. Needler's dedication.\n  Ms. Needler's legacy will endure in the hearts and minds of those \nwhose lives she touched. I commend Ms. Needler for her tremendous \nachievements. She exemplifies the high-quality of teaching and public \nservice that we aspire to instill in all those dedicated individuals \nentrusted with the education of our nation's young people.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5691-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n        RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am proud to recognize the \nfour schools throughout Maryland that were selected as Blue Ribbon \nSchool Award winners in 2002. These schools are among only 172 schools \nnationwide to be honored with this award, the most prestigious national \nschool recognition for public and private schools.\n  According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have \nbeen judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and \nnational goals. These schools also display the qualities that are \nnecessary to prepare our young people for the challenges that will face \nour nation in the years to come. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to \nschools which have strong leadership; a school community with a clear \nvision and shared sense of mission; high-quality teaching; a \nchallenging and up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that \nensure a safe and learning conducive environment; a solid commitment to \nfamily involvement; evidence that the school helps students achieve \nhigh standards; and a commitment to share best practices with other \nschools.\n  The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of \nthe successful practices that enable the students of these schools to \nsucceed and achieve. After a screening process by appropriate state and \nlocal departments, the Blue Ribbon School nominations were forwarded to \nthe U.S. Department of Education. A panel of outstanding educators from \naround the country then reviewed the nominations, selected schools for \nsite visits, and made recommendations to the Secretary of Education.\n  Over the past few years, I have tried to visit Blue Ribbon Schools in \nmy State and have always been delighted to witness the strong \ninteraction between parents, teachers, and the community, a \ncharacteristic shared by all of these successful schools. As I carry \nout my visits, I look forward to personally congratulating the \nstudents, teachers and staff for achieving this exceptional \naccomplishment.\n  The four winning Maryland schools are:\n  Our Lady of Good Counsel, located in Montgomery County, is an \noutstanding example of a school willing to go to great lengths to \nprepare its students for higher education. Good Counsel prides itself \non the quality of its academic offerings, faculty, students, and unique \ncommunity spirit. In an effort to ensure all students are college-\nready, Good Counsel undertook an immense mission when it established \nthe Ryken Program: a college preparatory program for motivated students \nwith learning disabilities. Unique to Good Counsel, compared to other \nprivate schools in the metro area, is its progressive integration of \ntechnology into the classroom, including three state-of-the-art \ncomputer labs, seven departmental technology rooms, and a laptop in \neach classroom. The successes that Good Counsel graduates find in \ncollege and careers attest to the school's overall excellence.\n  Phillips School, Laurel, has been a staple of special education, \nproviding services to students with a variety of learning, emotional, \nand behavioral disorders for over 30 years. Phillips School greets the \nchallenge of teaching children with special needs with open arms, \naddressing not only the needs of the student, but the needs of the \nfamily as well. The Phillips staff also includes related service \npersonnel, so that working with students is a team effort and the needs \nof each and every student are addressed throughout the entire school \nday. By providing a program of education, family support services, \ncommunity education and advocacy in a supportive environment, Phillips \nworks hard to ensure its students will be able to succeed in the next \nstage of life.\n  Thomas Spriggs Wootton High, located in Montgomery County, is a \npublic high school dedicated to college preparedness and high student \nmotivation. Established in 1970, Wootton has a long history of \nexcellence in academics and student participation. Wootton strives to \ncreate an exceptional learning environment supporting pride and \nachievement. Student involvement has been one of the primary focuses at \nWootton in recent years, encouraging students not only to participate \nin school activities themselves, but also to lead others. Historically, \n90 percent of Wootton graduates go on to attend college. This statistic \nis a direct reflection of the school wide dedication of Wootton staff \nto work with all students to support and ensure their success. As \nWootton's enrollment and diversity expand, it continues its dedication \nto ensuring all students excel.\n  Windsor Knolls Middle School, located in Frederick County, is a \npublic middle school embodying a challenging, multifaceted learning \ncommunity. Their strong commitment to success is easily demonstrated by \nstudent statistics, high scores on the CRES tests, Maryland Functional \ntests, CTBS, and MSPAP tests. However, a better understanding of the \nexcellence at Windsor Knolls can be gained by observing students. They \nare consistently immersed into a world of education through programs \ninvolving cultural awareness, character education, community \ninteraction, and many other groundbreaking programs. These techniques \nand outstanding dedication by the community are key to Windsor Knolls' \nconsistent success.\n  Again, I congratulate all of the students, teachers and parents from \nthese outstanding schools for receiving the National Blue Ribbon School \nAward. It is a well-deserved tribute to their dedication and enthusiasm \nfor learning. As the school year closes, I wish all of them an \nenriching and restful summer and continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5691-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5691-S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF \n                             2002''--PM 92\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Government Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby transmit to the Congress proposed legislation to create a \nnew Cabinet Department of Homeland Security.\n  Our Nation faces a new and changing threat unlike any we have faced \nbefore--the global threat of terrorism. No nation is immune, and all \nnations must act decisively to protect against this constantly evolving \nthreat.\n  We must recognize that the threat of terrorism is a permanent \ncondition, and we must take action to protect America against the \nterrorists that seek to kill the innocent.\n  Since September 11, 2001, all levels of government and leaders from \nacross the political spectrum have cooperated like never before. We \nhave strengthened our aviation security and tightened our borders. We \nhave stockpiled medicines to defend against bioterrorism and improved \nour ability to combat weapons of mass destruction. We have dramatically \nimproved information sharing among our intelligence agencies, and we \nhave taken new steps to protect our critical infrastructure.\n  Our Nation is stronger and better prepared today than it was on \nSeptember 11. Yet, we can do better. I propose the most extensive \nreorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s by creating a \nnew Department of Homeland Security. For the first time we would have a \nsingle Department whose primary mission is to secure our homeland. Soon \nafter the Second World War, President Harry Truman recognized that our \nNation's fragmented military defenses needed reorganization to help win \nthe Cold War. President Truman proposed uniting our military forces \nunder a single entity, now the Department of Defense, and creating the \nNational Security Council to bring together defense, intelligence, and \ndiplomacy. President Truman's reforms are still helping us to fight \nterror abroad, and today we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our \npeople at home.\n  President Truman and Congress reorganized our Government to meet a \nvery visible enemy in the Cold War. Today our nation must once again \nreorganize our Government to protect against an often-invisible enemy, \nan enemy that hides in the shadows and an enemy that can strike with \nmany different types of weapons. Our enemies seek to obtain the most \ndangerous and deadly weapons of mass destruction and use them against \nthe innocent. While we are winning the war on terrorism, Al Qaeda and \nother terrorist organizations still have thousands of trained\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nkillers spread across the globe plotting attacks against America and \nthe other nations of the civilized world.\n  Immediately after last fall's attack, I used my legal authority to \nestablish the White House Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland \nSecurity Council to help ensure that our Federal response and \nprotection efforts were coordinated and effective. I also directed \nHomeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge to study the Federal Government as \na whole to determine if the current structure allows us to meet the \nthreats of today while preparing for the unknown threats of tomorrow. \nAfter careful study of the current structure, coupled with the \nexperience gained since September 11 and new information we have \nlearned about our enemies while fighting a war, I have concluded that \nour Nation needs a more unified homeland security structure.\n  I propose to create a new Department of Homeland Security by \nsubstantially transforming the current confusing patchwork of \ngovernment activities into a single department whose primary mission is \nto secure our homeland. My proposal builds on the strong bipartisan \nwork on the issue of homeland security that has been conducted by \nMembers of Congress. In designing the new Department, my Administration \nconsidered a number of homeland security organizational proposals that \nhave emerged from outside studies, commission, and members of Congress.\n\n\n             the need for a department of homeland security\n\n  Today no Federal Government agency has homeland security as its \nprimary mission. Responsibilities for homeland security are dispersed \namong more than 100 different entities of the Federal Government. \nAmerica needs a unified homeland security structure that will improve \nprotection against today's threats and be flexible enough to help meet \nthe unknown threats of the future.\n  The mission of the new Department would be to prevent terrorist \nattacks within the United States, to reduce America's vulnerability to \nterrorism, and to minimize the damage and recover from attacks that may \noccur. The Department of Homeland Security would mobilize and focus the \nresources of the Federal Government, State and local governments, the \nprivate sector, and the American people to accomplish its mission.\n  The Department of Homeland Security would make Americans safer \nbecause for the first time we would have one department dedicated to \nsecuring the homeland. One department would secure our borders, \ntransportation sector, ports, and critical infrastructure. One \ndepartment would analyze homeland security intelligence from multiple \nsources, synthesize it with a comprehensive assessment of America's \nvulnerabilities, and take action to secure our highest risk facilities \nand systems. One department would coordinate communications with State \nand local governments, private industry, and the American people about \nthreats and preparedness. One department would coordinate our efforts \nto secure the American people against bioterrorism and other weapons of \nmass destruction. One department would help train and equip our first \nresponders. One department would manage Federal emergency response \nactivities.\n  Our goal is not to expand Government, but to create an agile \norganization that takes advantage of modern technology and management \ntechniques to meet a new and constantly evolving threat. We can improve \nour homeland security by minimizing the duplication of efforts, \nimproving coordination, and combining functions that are currently \nfragmented and inefficient. The new Department would allow us to have \nmore security officers in the field working to stop terrorists and \nfewer resources in Washington managing duplicative activities that \ndrain critical homeland security resources.\n\n  The Department of Homeland Security would have a clear and efficient \norganizational structure with four main divisions: Border and \nTransportation Security; Emergency Preparedness and Response; Chemical, \nBiological, Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures; and Information \nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection.\n\n\n                   border and transportation security\n\n  Terrorism is a global threat and we must improve our border security \nto help keep out those who mean to do us harm. We must closely monitor \nwho is coming into and out of our country to help prevent foreign \nterrorists from entering our country and bringing in their instruments \nof terror. At the same time, we must expedite the legal flow of people \nand goods on which our economy depends. Securing our borders and \ncontrolling entry to the United States has always been the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. Yet, this responsibility and \nthe security of our transportation systems is now dispersed among \nseveral major Government organizations. Under my proposed legislation, \nthe Department of Homeland Security would unify authority over major \nFederal security operations related to our borders, territorial waters, \nand transportation systems.\n  The Department would assume responsibility for the United States \nCoast Guard, the United States Customs Service, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (including the Border Patrol), the Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, and the Transportation Security \nAdministration. The Secretary of Homeland Security would have the \nauthority to administer and enforce all immigration and nationality \nlaws, including the visa issuance functions of consular officers. As a \nresult, the Department would have sole responsibility for managing \nentry into the United States and protecting our transportation \ninfrastructure. It would ensure that all aspects of border control, \nincluding the issuing of visas, are informed by a central information-\nsharing clearinghouse and compatible databases.\n\n\n                  emergency preparedness and response\n\n  Although our top priority is preventing future attacks, we must also \nprepare to minimize the damage and recover from attacks that may occur.\n  My legislative proposal requires the Department of Homeland Security \nto ensure the preparedness of our Nation's emergency response \nprofessionals, provide the Federal Government's response, and aid \nAmerica's recovery from terrorist attacks and natural disasters. To \nfulfill these missions, the Department of Homeland Security would \nincorporate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as one of \nits key components. The Department would administer the domestic \ndisaster preparedness grant programs for firefighters, police, and \nemergency personnel currently managed by FEMA, the Department of \nJustice, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In responding \nto an incident, the Department would manage such critical response \nassets as the Nuclear Emergency Search Team (from the Department of \nEnergy) and the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (from the Department \nof Health and Human Services). Finally, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity would integrate the Federal interagency emergency response \nplans into a single, comprehensive, Government-wide plan, and would \nwork to ensure that all response personnel have the equipment and \ncapability to communicate with each other as necessary.\n\n\n    chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures\n\n  Our enemies today seek to acquire and use the most deadly weapons \nknown to mankind--chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear \nweapons.\n  The new Department of Homeland Security would lead the Federal \nGovernment's efforts in preparing for and responding to the full range \nof terrorist threat involving weapons of mass destruction. The \nDepartment would set national policy and establish guidelines for State \nand local governments. The Department would direct exercises for \nFederal, State, and local chemicals, biological, radiological, and \nnuclear attack response teams and plans. The Department would \nconsolidate and synchronize the disparate efforts of multiple Federal \nagencies now scattered across several departments. This would create a \nsingle office whose primary mission is the critical task of securing \nthe United States from catastrophic terrorism.\n  The Department would improve America's ability to develop \ndiagnostics, vaccines, antibodies, antidotes, and other countermeasures\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\nagainst new weapons. It would consolidate and prioritize the disparate \nhomeland security-related research and development programs currently \nscattered throughout the executive branch, and the Department would \nassist State and local public safety agencies by evaluating equipment \nand setting standards.\n\n\n           information analysis and infrastructure protection\n\n  For the first time the Government would have under one roof the \ncapability to identify and assess threats to the homeland, map those \nthreats against our vulnerabilities, issue timely warnings, and take \naction to help secure the homeland.\n  The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection division of \nthe new Department of Homeland Security would complement the reforms on \nintelligence-gathering and information-sharing already underway at the \nFBI and the CIA. The Department would analyze information and \nintelligence fro the FBI, CIA, and many other Federal agencies to \nbetter understand the terrorist threat to the American homeland.\n  The Department would comprehensively assess the vulnerability of \nAmerica's key assets and critical infrastructure, including food and \nwater systems, agriculture, health systems and emergency services, \ninformation and telecommunications, banking and finance, energy, \ntransportation, the chemical and defense industries, postal and \nshipping entities, and national monuments and icons. The Department \nwould integrate its own and others' threat analyses with its \ncomprehensive vulnerability assessment to identify protective \npriorities and support protective steps to be taken by the Department, \nother Federal departments and agencies, State and local agencies, and \nthe private sector. Working closely with State and local officials, \nother Federal agencies, and the private sector, the Department would \nhelp ensure that proper steps are taken to protect high-risk potential \ntargets.\n\n\n                            Other Components\n\n  In addition to these four core divisions, the submitted legislation \nwould also transfer responsibility for the Secret Service to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Secret Service, which would report \ndirectly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, would retain its \nprimary mission to protect the President and other Government leaders. \nThe Secret Service would, however, contribute its specialized \nprotective expertise to the fulfillment of the Department's core \nmission.\n  Finally, under my legislation, the Department of Homeland Security \nwould consolidate and streamline relations with the Federal Government \nfor America's State and local governments. The new Department would \ncontain an intergovernmental affairs office to coordinate Federal \nhomeland security programs with State and local officials. It would \ngive State and local officials one primary contact instead of many when \nit comes to matters related to training, equipment, planning, and other \ncritical needs such as emergency response.\n  The consolidation of the Government's homeland security efforts as \noutlined in my proposed legislation can achieve great efficiencies that \nfurther enhance our security. Yet, to achieve these efficiencies, the \nnew Secretary of Homeland Security would require considerable \nflexibility in procurement, integration of information technology \nsystems, and personnel issues. My proposed legislation provides the \nSecretary of Homeland Security with just such flexibility and \nmanagerial authorities. I call upon the congress to implement these \nmeasures in order to ensure that we are maximizing our ability to \nsecure our homeland.\n\n\n         Continued Interagency Coordination at the White House\n\n  Even with the creation of the new Department, there will remain a \nstrong need for a White House Office of Homeland Security. Protecting \nAmerica from Terrorism will remain a multi-departmental issue and will \ncontinue to require interagency coordination. Presidents will continue \nto require the confidential advice of a Homeland Security Advisor, and \nI intend for the White House Office of Homeland Security and the \nHomeland Security Council to maintain a strong role in coordinating our \ngovernment-wide efforts to secure the homeland.\n\n\n                         The Lessons of History\n\n  History teaches us that new challenges require new organizational \nstructures. History also teaches us that critical security challenges \nrequire clear lines of responsibility and the unified effort of the \nU.S. Government.\n  President Truman said, looking at the lessons of the Second World \nWar: ``It is now time to discard obsolete organizational forms, and to \nprovide for the future the soundest, the most effective, and the most \neconomical kind of structure for our armed forces.'' When skeptics told \nPresident Truman that this proposed reorganization was too ambitious to \nbe enacted, he simply replied that it had to be. In the years to \nfollow, the Congress acted upon President Truman's recommendation, \neventually laying a sound organizational foundation that enabled the \nUnited states to win the Cold War. All Americans today enjoy the \ninheritance of this landmark organizational reform: a unified \nDepartment of Defense that has become the most powerful force for \nfreedom the world has ever seen.\n  Today America faces a threat that is wholly different from the threat \nwe faced during the Cold War. Our terrorist enemies hide in shadows and \nattack civilians with whatever means of destruction they can access. \nBut as in the Cold War, meeting this threat requires clear lines of \nresponsibility and the unified efforts of government at all levels--\nFederal, State, local, and tribal--the private sector, and all \nAmericans. America needs a homeland security establishment that can \nhelp prevent catastrophic attacks and mobilize national resources for \nan enduring conflict while protecting our Nation's values and \nliberties.\n  Years from today, our world will still be fighting the threat of \nterrorism. It is my hope that future generations will be able to look \nback on the Homeland Security Act of 2002--as we now remember the \nNational Security Act of 1947--as the solid organizational foundation \nfor America's triumph in a long and difficult struggle against a \nformidable enemy.\n  History has given our Nation new challenges--and important new \nassignments. Only the United States Congress can create a new \ndepartment of Government. We face an urgent need, and I am pleased that \ncongress has responded to my call to act before the end of the current \ncongressional session with the same bipartisan spirit that allowed us \nto act expeditiously on legislation after September 11.\n  These are times that demand bipartisan action and bipartisan \nsolutions to meet the new and changing threats we face as a Nation. I \nurge the Congress to join me in creating a single, permanent department \nwith an overriding and urgent mission--securing the homeland of America \nand protecting the American people. Together we can meet this ambitious \ndeadline and help ensure that the American homeland is secure against \nthe terrorist threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nbenefits for Filipino veterans of World War II and surviving spouses of \nsuch veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould amend Title 38 of the United States Code to provide health care \nand burial benefits to all Filipino veterans of World War II and their \nspouses who reside in the United States.\n  Many of you are aware of my continued advocacy on the importance of \naddressing the plight of Filipino World War II veterans. As an \nAmerican, I believe the treatment of Filipino World War II veterans is \nbleak and shameful. The Philippines became a United States possession \nin 1898, when it was ceded from Spain following the Spanish-American \nWar. In 1934, the Congress enacted the Philippine Independence Act, \nPublic Law 73-127, which provided a 10-year time frame for the \nindependence of the Philippines. Between 1934 and final independence in \n1946, the United States retained certain powers over the Philippines, \nincluding the right to call all military forces organized by the newly-\nformed Commonwealth government into the service of the United States \nArmed Forces.\n  The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was called to serve with the \nUnited States Armed Forces in the Far East during World War II under \nPresident Roosevelt's July 26, 1941 military order. The Filipinos who \nserved were entitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their \nactive service with our armed forces. Hundreds were wounded in battle \nand many hundreds died in battle. Shortly after Japan's surrender, the \nCongress also enacted the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment Act of \n1945 for the purpose of sending Filipino troops to occupy enemy lands, \nand to oversee military installations at various overseas locations. \nThese troops were authorized to receive pay and allowances for services \nperformed throughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities had \nceased, wartime service of these troops continued as a matter of law \nuntil the end of 1946.\n  Despite all of their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, the Congress \nenacted the Rescission Act of 1946, now codified as Section 107 of \nTitle 38 of the United States Code. The 1946 Act deemed that the \nservice performed by these Filipino veterans would not be recognized as \n``active service'' for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring ``rights, \nprivileges, or benefits.'' Accordingly, Section 107 denied Filipino \nveterans access to health care, particularly for non-service-connected \ndisabilities, and pension benefits. Section 107 also limited service-\nconnected disability and death compensation to 50 percent of what is \nreceived by their American counterparts.\n  On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental \nSurplus Appropriations Rescission Act, which duplicated the language \nthat had eliminated Filipino veterans' benefits under the First \nRescission Act. Thus, Filipino veterans who fought in the service of \nthe United States during World War II have been precluded from \nreceiving most of the veterans' benefits that had been available to \nthem before 1946, and that are available to all other veterans of our \narmed forces regardless of race, national origin, or citizenship \nstatus.\n\n  The Health Care for Filipino World War II Veterans Act includes four \nprovisions: health care and nursing home care access for Filipino \nveterans residing in the United States; dependency and indemnity \ncompensation for surviving spouses of certain Filipino veterans, \nprovided the surviving spouse lives in the United States; an increase \nin the payment amount from 50 to 100 percent for service-connected \ndisability compensation for new Philippine Scout veterans residing in \nthe United States and burial benefits for new Philippine Scout \nveterans. All these measures will assist Filipino veterans in their \ntwilight years, and the bill is fully supported by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  Throughout the years, I have sponsored several measures to rectify \nthe lack of appreciation America has shown to those gallant men and \nwomen who stood in harm's way with our American soldiers and fought the \ncommon enemy during World War II. It is time that we, as a Nation, \nrecognize our long-standing history and friendship with the \nPhilippines. The legislation I introduce today will remove the burden \nof health care and burial costs for a very deserving group of highly \ndecorated individuals: members of the Filipino Commonwealth Army and \nnew Philippine Scouts who valiantly fought with the Allied forces in \nthe Second World War. These groups have been neglected by the United \nStates Congress.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored; let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Let us now work to repay all of \nthese brave men and women for their sacrifices by providing them the \nveterans' benefits they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide \ngrants for transitional jobs programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the STEP Act \non behalf of myself and Senator Murray.\n  This bill is a companion to the Education Works Act, which I \nintroduced a couple of weeks ago. Both bills address the same issue, \nthe need to support state efforts to use welfare to work strategies \nthat combine work with a flexibility mix of education, training, and \nother supports. Study after study has demonstrated that states that use \na combination of activities to help families move from welfare to work \nare more successful. For many welfare recipients, vocational training \nand postsecondary education led to work and, through substantial \nincreases in earnings and job quality, long-term financial \nindependence. This is important because although many have left welfare \nfor work during the past several years, many have returned or live in \npoverty dependent on other government supports because they are working \nat low wages with limited benefits. In addition, many with multiple \nbarriers remain on the rolls. As we move forward with the \nreauthorization process, we must do more to support state efforts to \nhelp these people find work and to ensure that all individuals leaving \nwelfare are moving to employment that will provide long-term financial \nindependence. The STEP Act and the Education Works Act will do just \nthat.\n  The Education Works Act deals with increasing state flexibility to \ndetermine the right mix of work with education and training. The STEP \nAct provides resources to States seeking to implement effective \nprograms that combine work with education and training. One of the most \neffective types of these programs, particularly for the most difficult \nto serve TANF recipients, are transitional job programs. Transitional \njob programs provide subsidized, temporary, wage-paying jobs for 20 to \n35 hours per week, along with access to job readiness, basic education, \nvocational skills, and other barrier-removal services based on \nindividualized plans. The STEP Act would provide states with funding to \nimplementing these programs and other training and support programs.\n  Existing transitional job programs are achieving great outcomes. A \nMathematical study released last month demonstrated that between 81 to \n94 percent of those who had completed transitional job programs move on \nto unsubsidized jobs with wages. Most of these participants moved into \nfull-time employment, median hours worked was 40 hours. Another survey \nrevealed that transitional jobs program completers reported average \nwages at placement into unsubsidized employment between $7 and $10 per \nhour.\n  Transitional jobs programs can be particularly effective with the \nhardest to serve welfare recipients. Transitional jobs program often \nfocus primarily on welfare recipients who have participated in welfare \nemployment and training programs without successfully finding steady \nemployment. The reasons for their inability to find and sustain \nmeaningful employment are complex and varied. For people who face \nbarriers, or who lack the skills or experience to compete successfully \nin the labor market, paid work in a supportive environment, together \nwith access to needed services provides a real chance to move forward. \nWhile more expensive than other work first strategies, transitional \njobs programs are able to do what their cheaper and less intensive \ncounterparts have not, help the most difficult to serve TANF \nparticipants find stable, permanent employment.\n  Additional support for transitional jobs programs is needed. The TANF \nand Welfare-to-Work block grants have been the principal sources of \nfunding for Transitional Jobs programs. Welfare-to-Work funds have been \nexhausted in many parts of the country and must be spend completely \nduring the next year or two. In addition, with an ever growing \ncompetition for TANF funds in a period of rising caseloads and \ndeclining State revenues, it will be increasingly difficult to fund \ntransitional jobs programs solely with TANF funds.\n  I believe that transitional job programs are good investments because \nthey serve as stepping stones to permanent employment and decrease \ngovernment expenditures on health care, food stamps, and cash \nassistance. Transitional jobs programs can be particularly important in \neconomically depressed and rural areas because they increase work \nopportunities for hard-to-employ individuals, they reduce pressure on \nlocal emergency systems and, they provide income that stimulates local \neconomies.\n  Our legislation also supports ``business link'' programs that provide \nindividuals with fewer barriers or individuals who have only been able \nto access very low wage employment with intensive training and skill \ndevelopment activities designed to lead to long-term, higher paid \nemployment. These programs are based on partnerships with the private \nsector.\n  In my home State, just such a program is producing great results, the \nTeamworks program. Teamworks provides training in life skills, as well \nas employment skills, during a 12 week course. The program also \nprovides necessary supports to participants such as childcare and \ntransportation. Teamworks assists participants in their job search and \nprovides ongoing support for 18 months after job placement. The results \nare impressive. The average wage of those completing the program is \n$1.50 per hour higher than other programs and job retention rates are \n20 percent higher. This experience is not unique. Welfare programs that \ncombine work with education and training with support services are more \nlikely to result in work leads to self-sufficiency.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will give States the \ntools to implement what works. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting both the STEP Act and the Education Works Act. I as \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide an equitable formula for computing the \nannuities of surviving spouses of members of the uniformed services who \ndied entitled to retired or retainer pay but before the Survivor \nBenefit Plan existed or applied to the members, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, a couple weeks ago, on Memorial Day, we \npromised to remember and honor those who have sacrificed so much to \nserve our country. In Iowa, Mary ``Beth'' James and her family were \nhonoring the memory of her husband, Bob James. But I'm afraid we have \nforgotten Beth, and not done Bob justice. Today I am introducing a bill \nfor Beth and the other ``Forgotten Widows.''\n  Bob James proudly served his country as an active member of the Army \nand Army Reserves for 35 years, until he passed away in 1977. Bob's \nservice began with the Amphibious Combat Infantry in North Africa and \nItaly in World War II. As a junior officer, Bob James landed with the \nThird Division near Casablanca, and later served with the 34th Division \nthrough the North African and Tunisian campaigns, as well as in \namphibious landings at Solarno, Italy, the battle of Mt. Casino and \nfour crossings of the Volturno River. He was awarded the Bronze Star \nmedal for the Rome-Arno campaign and was given a battlefield promotion \nto First Lieutenant.\n  After five years in World War II, he carried a mobilization \ndesignation as part of his 30-year reserve duty with the Selective \nService Unit in Cedar Rapids that he proposed and was asked by General \nHershey to organize. In fact, Bob served longer than the usual 30 years \nbecause General Hershey personally requested that he remain in active \nReserves until he reached the age of 60.\n  When Bob became ill, he continued to attend Reserve meetings. His \nwife, Beth, now age 83, remembers Bob telling her on April 9, 1977, \nEaster Sunday, ``I only have to live another six months.'' You see, he \nwas worried about Beth's welfare after he passed away. He knew he had \nto turn 60 before he could enroll in the military's Survivor Benefit \nPlan to provide for Beth after he passed away. Unfortunately, Bob was \nnot able to hold on. Lieutenant Colonel William R. James, USAR, died at \nage 59\\1/2\\ in 1977, 5\\1/2\\ months before his 60th birthday.\n  Under the military's Survivor Benefit Plan, members who choose to \nenroll in the plan have a small deduction taken from their retirement \nbenefit each month so that their spouses can continue to receive a \nportion of the benefit after the member dies. When the Reserve \nComponent Survivor's Benefit Plan was established in 1972, members \ncould not sign up for survivors benefits until they became eligible for \nthe retirement benefit at age 60. Because of this arbitrary rule, and \nbecause Bob died at 59\\1/2\\, Beth received no survivor's benefit even \nthough Bob served in the military for 35 years and had more than the \nmaximum number of points used in calculating retirement benefits.\n  Congress quickly became aware of this unjust consequence of the SBP \nlaw. One year after Bob's death, Congress took action to correct the \nunfair enrollment structure of the Reserve Component Survivor's Benefit \nPlan. Legislation passed in 1978 allows Reserve Component members to \ndecide whether or how they will participate in the RCSBP when they are \nnotified of retirement eligibility, but not yet eligible to receive \nretired pay, in almost all cases, many years before reaching age 60. \nHad this legislation been enacted earlier, Bob could have provided for \nBeth's security.\n  Unfortunately, when drafting the legislation in 1978, Congress forgot \nabout Beth and thousands of spouses like her whose husbands, despite \nhaving served their country for at least 20 years, died before they \nwere allowed to enroll in the program to provide for their survivors.\n  Congress continued to ignore these widows until 1997. Led by my \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, Congress finally took \nan important, but limited, step to recognize the ``Forgotten Widows,'' \nas Beth and the other spouses had come to be known. Congress created a \nspecial annuity of $165 per month for the Forgotten Widows. For the \nfirst time in 20 years, Beth James received some support from our \ngovernment in return for Bob James' service to his country.\n  While the annuity for certain military surviving spouses created in \n1997 was certainly a step in the right direction, it is by no means \nadequate. The forgotten widows currently receive about $185 per month, \nafter cost of living increases since 1997. In comparison, the monthly \nSBP benefits average is about $580 for beneficiaries over 62 and the \nmonthly RC-SBP benefits average about $325 for beneficiaries over 62. \nThe current benefit for forgotten widows is low for two reasons. First, \nthe fiscal year 1998 legislation initially set the ACMSS benefit at the \nminimum allowable amount a service member could elect, even though most \nmembers participate at a higher level. Second, the 1997 legislation did \nnot take into account cost of living increases that the widows would \nhave received for more than two decades. If these widows had been \nenrolled in these programs in 1972 at the minimum level, their monthly \nbenefit today would be approximately $434, rather than $185.\n  The Forgotten Widows' Benefit Equity Act of 2002 amends the Annuity \nfor Certain Military Surviving Spouses program established in the \nfiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization Bill. It does not change the \neligibility criteria for the program. It directs the Department of \nDefense to calculate each surviving spouse's annuity assuming that the \nmember had enrolled in the SBP before he died and had elected a base \namount equal to his retired pay. For almost all forgotten widows this \nwill be much more than the current annuity; if it is not, the survivor \nwill continue to receive the current benefit. This approach ensures \nthat the survivors' annuities take into account the members' rank and \nyears of service, and the past cost of living increases.\n  It is possible that some of the members would not have elected to \nparticipate in the SBP, or would not have chosen a base amount of 100 \npercent of retired pay, and thus the survivors would have received a \nlower benefit. However, they were never given that choice. And most \nmembers today do\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\nchoose to participate at or near the highest level. In addition, this \nlegislation is not retroactive; the forgotten widows will not be \ncompensated for the thousands of dollars of benefits they would have \nreceived for over 20 years.\n  These women, whose husbands devoted over 20 years of their lives to \ndefending our freedoms and some of whom received no pensions of their \nown, were abandoned by our government for at least 20 years. While \nCongress recognized our responsibility to them in 1998, we have not \nfully met our obligation to provide them with an adequate, fair \nbenefit. We can and must do better. We must stand by our Memorial Day \npromises to remember those who sacrificed for our country. I ask my \ncolleagues to do what is right and support passage of the Forgotten \nWidow's Benefit Equity Act of 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, \nmaintaining, managing, controlling, renting, leasing, making available \nfor use, or profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, \ndistributing, or using any controlling substance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, over the past several years, I have \nbecome increasingly concerned with the trafficking and use of the \nnewest fad drug, Ecstasy. All across the country, thousands of \nteenagers are treated for overdoses and Ecstasy-related health problems \nin emergency rooms each year. And recent statistics from the \nPartnership for a Drug Free America show that teen use of Ecstasy has \nincreased 71 percent since 1999. Unless we mount a major education \ncampaign across schools and campuses nationwide, we may not be able to \ncounter the widespread misconception that Ecstacy is harmless, \nfashionable and hip.\n  Much of the abuse of Ecstasy and other club drugs happens at all-\nnight dance parties known as ``raves.'' A few months ago in the Caucus \non International Narcotics Control I held a hearing to take an in-depth \nlook at the phenomenon of these all-night dance parties and recent \nefforts at the Federal, State and local levels to crack down on rave \npromoters who allow rampant drug use at their events and do everything \nthey can to profit from it.\n  It is common for rave organizers to go to great lengths to portray \ntheir events as safe so that parents will allow their kids to attend. \nThey advertise them as alcohol-free parties and some even hire off-duty \npolice officers to patrol outside the venue. But the truth is that many \nof these raves are drug dens where use of Ecstasy and other ``club \ndrugs,'' such as the date rape drugs Rohypnol, GHB and Ketamine, is \nwidespread.\n  But even as these promoters work to make parents think that their \nevents are safe, they send a different message to kids. Their \npromotional flyers make clear that drugs are an integral part of the \nparty by prominently featuring terms associated with drug use, such as \nthe letters ``E'' or ``X,'' street terms for Ecstasy, or the term \n``rollin,'' which refers to an Ecstasy high. They are, in effect, \npromoting Ecstasy along with the rave.\n  By doing so, the promoters get rich as they exploit and endanger \nkids. Many supplement their profits from the $10 to $50 cover charge to \nenter the club by selling popular Ecstasy paraphernalia such as baby \npacifiers, glow sticks, or mentholated inhalers. And party organizers \nknow that Ecstasy raises the core body temperature and makes the user \nextremely thirsty, so they sell bottles of water for $5 or $10 apiece. \nSome even shut off the water faucets so club goers will be forced to \nbuy water or pay admission to enter an air-conditioned ``cool down \nroom.''\n  Despite the conventional wisdom that Ecstasy and other club drugs are \n``no big deal,'' a view that even the New York Times Magazine espoused \nin a cover story, these drugs can have serious consequences, and can \neven be fatal.\n  After the death of a 17-year-old girl at a rave party in New Orleans \nin 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted an assessment of \nrave activity in that city which showed the close relationship between \nthese parties and club drug overdoses. In a two year period, 52 raves \nwere held at the New Orleans State Palace Theater, during which time \napproximately 400 teenagers overdosed and were treated at local \nemergency rooms. Following ``Operation Rave Review'' which resulted in \nthe arrest of several rave promoters and closing the city's largest \nrave, overdoses and emergency room visits dropped by 90 percent and \nEcstasy overdoses have been eliminated.\n  State and locals governments have begun to take important steps to \ncrack down on rave promoters who allow their events to be used as \nhavens for illicit drug activity. In Chicago, where Mayor Daley has \nshown great leadership on this issue, it is a criminal offense to \nknowingly maintain a place, such as a rave, where controlled substances \nare used or distributed. Not only the promoter, but also the building \nowner and building manager can be charged under Mayor Daley's law. The \nState of Florida has a similar statute making such activity a felony.\n  And in Modesto, California, police officers are offering ``rave \ntraining classes'' to parents to educate them about the danger of raves \nand the club drugs associated with them.\n  And at the Federal level, there have been four cases in which Federal \nprosecutors have used the so called ``crack\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\nhouse statute'' or other Federal charges to go after rave promoters. \nThese cases, in Little Rock, AR, Boise, ID, Panama City, FL, and New \nOrleans, LA, have had mixed results, culminating in two wins, a loss \nand a draw, suggesting that there may be a need to tailor this Federal \nstatute more precisely to the problem at hand. Today I am proposing \nlegislation, Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, or the \n``RAVE'' Act, which will do just that. I am pleased to have Senator \nGrassley as the lead cosponsor.\n  The bill tailors the crack house statute to address rave promoters' \nactions more specifically so that Federal prosecutors will be able to \nuse it to prosecute individuals who allow rampant drug use at their \nevents and seek to profit from putting kids at risk. The legislation \nalso addresses the low penalties for trafficking gamma hydroxybutyric \nacid, GHB, by directing the United States Sentencing Commission to \nexamine the current penalties and consider increasing them to reflect \nthe seriousness of offenses involving GHB.\n  But the answer to the problem of drug use at raves is not simply to \nprosecute irresponsible rave promoters and those who distribute drugs. \nThere is also a responsibility to raise awareness among parents, \nteachers, students, coaches, religious leaders, etc. about the dangers \nof the drugs used and sold at raves. The RAVE Act directs funds to the \nDEA for that purpose. Further, the bill authorizes nearly $6 million \nfor the DEA to hire a Demand Reduction Coordinator in each state who \ncan work with communities following the arrest of a significant local \ntrafficker to reduce the demand for drugs through prevention and \ntreatment programs.\n  It is the unfortunate truth that most raves are havens for illicit \ndrugs. Enacting the RAVE Act will help to prosecute the promoters who \nseek to profit from exploiting and endangering young lives and will \ntake steps to educate youth, parents and other interested adults about \nthe dangers of Ecstasy and other club drugs associated with raves.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me and support this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Biden today in introducing the RAVE Act, or Reducing America's \nVulnerability to Ecstacy Act of 2002. I believe this legislation will \nhelp America's law enforcement go after the latest methods drug dealers \nare using to push drugs on our kids. As drug dealers discover new drugs \nand new methods of pushing their poison, we must make sure our legal \nsystem is adequately structured to react appropriately. I believe this \nlegislation does that.\n  Many young people perceive Ecstasy as harmless and it is wrongly \ntermed a recreational or ``kid-friendly'' drug. This illegal substance \ndoes real damage to real lives. Although targeted at teenagers and \nyoung adults, its use has spread to the middle-aged population and \nrural areas, including my own State of Iowa. Ninety percent of all drug \ntreatment and law enforcement experts say that Esctasy is readily \naccessible in this country. We cannot continue to allow easy access to \nthis drug or ignore the consequences of its use.\n  The sale of illicit narcotics, whether on a street corner here in \nWashington, D.C., or a warehouse in Des Moines, IA, must be confronted \nand halted wherever possible. One of the new, ``trendy'' illicit \nnarcotics is Ecstasy, an especially popular club drug that is all too \noften being sold at all-night dance parties, or raves. Ecstasy is an \nillegal drug that has extremely dangerous side effects. In general, \nEcstasy raises the heart rate to dangerous levels, and in some cases \nthe heart will stop. It also causes severe dehydration, a condition \nthat is exacerbated by the high levels of physical exertion that \nhappens at raves. Users must constantly drink water in an attempt to \ncool off, a fact that some rave promoters take advantage of by charging \nexorbitant fees for bottles of water. Too often, users collapse and die \nbecause their bodies overheat. And even those who survive the short-\nterm effects of Ecstasy use can look forward long-term problems such as \ndepression, paranoia, and confusion, as scientists have learned that \nEcstasy causes irreversible changes to the brain.\n  The legislation that we introduce today is the result of information \ngathered during a series of hearings held by the Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control. It will help U.S. attorneys shut down \nraves and prosecute rave promoters who knowingly maintain a place where \ndrugs are used, kept, or sold by expanding the existing statute that \nallows the closure and prosecution of crack house operators.\n  The statute would only be applicable if the rave promoters or \nlocation owners ``knowingly and intentionally'' either use or allow to \nbe used space for an event where drugs will be ``manufactured, stored, \ndistributed, or used.'' This legislation will not eliminate all raves. \nProvided rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as they are so \noften advertized, as places for people to come dance in a safe, \nalcohol-free environment, then they have nothing to fear from this law. \nBut this legislation will give law enforcement the tools needed to shut \ndown those rave operators and promoters who use raves as a cover to \nsell drugs. Innocent owners or proprietors will remain exempt from \nprosecution.\n  This legislation is an important step, but a careful one. Our future \nrests with the young people of this great nation and America is at \nrisk. Esctasy has shown itself to be a formidable threat and we must \nconfront it on all fronts, not only through law enforcement but \neducation and treatment as well. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting the RAVE Act, and help us work towards its quick passenge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 2638. A bill to encourage health care facilities, group health \nplans, and health insurance issuers to reduce administrative costs, and \nto improve access, convenience, quality, and safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today I am introducing the Efficiency \nin Health Care, eHealth Care, Act. The time is long overdue to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of America's antiquated healthcare \ninformation technology systems. We can achieve large cost savings and \nimprove patient care by bringing the nation's health care systems into \nthe information age.\n  The eHealth Care Act provides modern standards for financial \ntransactions such as billing and claims processing that can only be met \nby adoption of the same kind of high volume, speedy, cost-efficient \ntechnology that has dramatically lowered administrative costs in other \nindustries. The new standards will be coupled with grants to health \ncare providers to assist them in upgrading their information \ntechnologies to meet these new demands.\n  Estimates are that administrative costs currently represent 20 to 30 \npercent of health care spending, or up to $420 billion each year. While \nother industries are making full use of available information \ntechnology, health care has been a very slow adopter. And this bill \nwill reduce health care administration by as much as $300 billion a \nyear, enough to provide universal health coverage for every American \nmany times over.\n  The sad fact is that processing a single health care transaction can \ncost as much as 25 dollars. Other industries have drastically reduced \nadministrative costs by using modern information technology. Banks and \nbrokerages have cut their costs to less than a penny per transaction \nusing modern technology. Health care remains one of the few industries \nclinging to antiquated 20th century technology while the rest of the \nNation's businesses have moved into the 21st century. This bill will \nprovide the tools for health care systems to make a great leap forward \nby using new technologies to cut costs.\n  Recent breakthroughs in technology not only can save money, but also \ncan provide more timely and accurate billing and claims transactions. \nToday, only 10 or 15 percent of all patient charts are available \nelectronically, and it costs about $9 each and every time a doctor has \nto pull a patient's chart. Even worse, despite the high cost, the \npatient's chart is often incomplete. Through advances in technology, \ndoctors should be able to access complete patient records at a huge \ncost saving. That is not only more efficient care, it is better care.\n  Today, 30 percent of doctor's claims leave the physician's office \nwith errors, and nearly 15 percent get lost. Manual procedures for \nhandling referrals, eligibility, treatment authorizations, and\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\nexplanations of benefits can add anywhere from $10 to $85 per \ntransaction. In fact, estimates are that $250 billion is spent each \nyear on medical claims paperwork. Paper claims processing amounts to \n$28,000 per physician and $12.7 billion for all physicians each year. \nConducting these transactions online could cut that figure tenfold. We \nare clearly not getting much bang for our buck. The eHealth Care Act \nwill provide the standards needed for health plans, insurers, \nproviders, and patients to realize both the cost savings and better \nbilling and claims transactions.\n  But the cost to the health care system is not just monetary. The \neHealth Care bill will also set standards for physicians ordering \nprescription medications. Medication errors are responsible for over \n7,000 deaths annually, but doctors currently write only 1 percent of \nprescriptions electronically. By requiring adoption of computerized \nsystems for writing prescriptions, errors due to mistaken prescriptions \nor illegible handwriting will be reduced. There is no excuse for \npatients to be harmed and even die when we have the technology to save \nthem.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate to \nget this very important legislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2639. A bill to provide health benefits for workers and their \nfamilies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today I am introducing the Health Care \nfor Working Families Act, a bill that will make the basic human right \nto health care a reality for millions of working Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  The tragedy of September 11 created a special obligation to address \nthe injustices that have festered for far too long within our national \nfamily. The brave passengers of Flight 93 fought and defied the \nterrorists and saved the lives of thousands. Construction and health \nworkers braved the treacherous fire and debris to rescue survivors and \nrecover the remains of those who lost their lives. Police and \nfirefighters, and ordinary citizens, gave their lives so that others \nmight live. And thousands of Americans all over the country lined up to \ndonate blood to help the victims.\n  I believe that the most enduring legacy of the September 11 attacks \nis a new sense of community among all Americans. A nation that has \nunited to battle a terrorist threat from abroad can also unite to \nvanquish the conditions here at home that curtail the opportunities and \nsadden the lives of so many of our fellow citizens. Just as the British \npeople came together after World War II to provide health care for all \ncitizens of the United Kingdom, we join hands after September 11 to \nguarantee all citizens of the United States the protection and \nopportunity that should be their birthright. There is no area where \naction is more urgently needed than health care.\n  Americans are rightly proud to be at the forefront of medical and \nscientific advancement. In the past year, we successfully mapped the \nhuman genome. We developed new pharmaceuticals to target specific \ncancers. We have seen the promise stem cell research gives to millions \nsuffering from chronic diseases. We clearly recognize the value of \nscientific achievement and have always been supportive of the great \ninstitutions and individuals that are driving our progress.\n  But our successes in the science of medicine must not blind us to the \ngreat failure of our health care system, the failure to provide \naffordable, quality health insurance to all our people. We lead the \nworld in medical research. We lead the world in our capacity to cure \nand treat the most complex and deadly illnesses. But we lag behind \nevery country in the industrial world in guaranteeing all our people \naccess to the best medical care we can offer. And today we face another \nhealth care crisis as the number of the uninsured has begun to rise and \nrise rapidly.\n  Health care is not just another commodity. It is not a gift to be \nrationed based on the ability to pay. The state of a family's health \nshould not be determined by the size of a family's wealth.\n  Yet, thirty-nine million Americans now have no health insurance at \nall. Over the course of a year, 30 million more will lack coverage for \nan extended period. It is unacceptable that any American is uninsured. \nIt is shameful that thirty-nine million Americans are uninsured. And it \nis intolerable that the number of uninsured is now rising again and, if \nwe do nothing, could reach more than 52 million by the end of the \ndecade.\n  Who are the 39 million uninsured Americans who must go without the \nhealth care they need because they must do without the health insurance \nthey deserve? Over 80 percent are members of working families. They are \ngrocery baggers, car mechanics, construction workers. They are factory \nworkers, nurses and nurses aides, secretaries and the self-employed. \nThey are child care workers and waiters and cooks. They are teachers \nand social workers. They are veterans. They are people who wake up \nevery morning and go to work. They work hard 40 hours a week and fifty-\ntwo weeks a year, but all their hard work cannot buy them the health \ninsurance they need to protect themselves and their families, because \nthey can't afford it and their employers don't provide it.\n  They play by the rules. They stand by their families and their \ncountry. But when it comes to health insurance, America has let them \ndown.\n  A recent report by the Institute of Medicine lays out the stark \nresult of America's failure to provide health insurance. Cancer, \nstroke, heart disease, leukemia, AIDS, and other serious illnesses know \nnothing about insurance, or economic class or race or creed. They can \nstrike anyone equally. And when they do, the uninsured are left out and \nleft behind. In hospital or out, young or old, black or white, the \nuninsured receive less care, suffer more pain, and die at higher rates \nthan those who are insured.\n  One-third of uninsured Americans will simply go without care when \nthey get sick instead of seeking medical attention. They stop and ask \nthemselves whether their symptoms or their childrens symptoms are truly \nworth a doctor visit. Is this cough just a cold or could it be strep \nthroat? Is this pain in my bones indicative of something more serious \nor will it eventually go away if I ignore it? Millions of families are \nforced to decide between their health and other necessities of life. \nThey ration health care for themselves and their children, and too \noften they pay a terrible price.\n  Every year, 8 million uninsured Americans fail to take their \nmedications because they can't afford to pay for their prescriptions. \n300,000 children with asthma never get treated by a doctor. Uninsured \nwomen diagnosed with breast cancer are 50 percent more likely to die \nfrom the disease because their cancer is diagnosed later. 32,000 \nAmericans with heart disease go without life-saving bypass surgery or \nangioplasty. The chilling bottom line is that Americans without health \ninsurance are one-quarter more likely to die prematurely solely because \nthey lack coverage.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is a major step forward toward \nthe day when all Americans will enjoy the health insurance that should \nbe their birthright This measure will require every firm with more than \n100 workers to provide health insurance coverage for employees and \ntheir dependents. This coverage must be as good as the coverage now \nprovided for Federal employees. If good health insurance coverage is \navailable to every member of the Senate, to every member of the House, \nand to the President of the United States, it ought to be available to \nevery other American too.\n  This measure alone would assure coverage for more than a third of \ntoday's uninsured workers.\n  For generations we have required employers to contribute to Social \nSecurity and then to Medicare. We have required them to pay a minimum \nwage, and contribute to unemployment insurance. Now it is time to say, \nat least for large firms, that they also have an obligation to \ncontribute to the cost of health insurance for their employees. The \nvast majority of large businesses already do so, and the rest should \nfulfill that obligation, too.\n  The legislation I am introducing is supported by more than 100 \nhealth, labor, elderly, disability, church, and family groups. It \ndeserves the support of Congress as the single most important way to \nmove America closer to the goal of health care for all.\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n  This legislation is an important first step toward the day when the \nfundamental right to health care will be a reality for every American. \nBut it is only a first step. Later this year, after broad consultation \nwith affected groups, I will introduce legislation to assure that all \nAmericans, wherever they work, wherever they live, have the quality, \naffordable health insurance coverage they deserve.\n  Health care is a defining test of our commitment and our national \ncharacter. The American people have shown that they are ready for great \nmissions. They are the creators of the new spirit of September 11. Now, \nwe in public life must live up to the standards they have set.\n  We must strive to do what is best, in health and education as well as \nnational defense, and we must measure our success by what we accomplish \nnot just for one political party or another, not for this or that \ninterest group, but for America and its enduring ideal of liberty and \njustice for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2640. A bill to provide for adequate school facilities in Yosemite \nNational Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this \nlegislation today to authorize the Interior Department to provide \ncritical services to three national parks in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n  With the passage of this bill, Yosemite, Manzanar, and Golden Gate \nNational Parks will receive the Federal support needed to continue to \noffer a broad range of services to the millions of tourists and \nCalifornians who visit these national treasures each year.\n  This bill meets four distinct needs in these parks: it authorizes the \nInterior Secretary to designate Federal emergency funds to small \nschools in Yosemite National Park, allows the Yosemite Area Regional \nTransportation System, YARTS, to continue operating and extends the \nManzanar and Golden Gate National Recreational Area, GGNRA, Advisory \nCommissions for ten more years.\n  The first component of this bill provides critical funds to three \nsmall schools nestled in the heart of Yosemite National Park.\n  Approximately 126 children of park service employees are taught in \nthe quaint one-room buildings of Wawoma, El Portal, and Yosemite Valley \nelementary schools. The remote location of these schools, along with \ntheir small sizes and California's unique method for funding education, \nhave all contributed to the schools amassing a combined deficit of \n$241,000. In their efforts to continue to provide basic educational \nservices to students, the schools have had to cut supplemental \ninstruction that would normally be available to students taught outside \nof the Park.\n  In light of these facts, this bill allows the Interior Secretary to \nassist these schools if their combined state funding falls below \n$75,000. It also clarifies how funds will be used by limiting \nallocations to providing general upkeep, maintenance, and classroom \ninstruction.\n  Furthermore, this legislation allows the Park Service to allot \nfederal funds for the continuing operation of the Yosemite Area \nRegional Transportation System, YARTS.\n  YARTS is a bus service that gives visitors the option of taking a \nfree shuttle through Yosemite National Park instead of driving on their \nown. Since it began operating in 2000, this service has played a \ncrucial role in improving visitor accessibility to the Park's \nattractions, alleviating traffic congestion on access roads and \nreducing the amount of air pollution emitted by incoming cars.\n  The Federally funded demonstration project that allowed YARTS to \noffer services on a temporary basis expired in May and since then, \nYARTS has leveraged local funds to ensure that services were not \ndiscontinued.\n  Both the Park Service and YARTS are supportive of continuing their \nmutually beneficial agreement. This legislation would do just that by \ntaking the burden off local entities and providing the necessary \nassistance that this service needs.\n  The last component of this bill will extend the advisory commissions \nof the Manzanar Historic Site and Golden Gate National Recreation Area \nfor ten more years.\n  Both of these commissions have active committees that represent a \nwide range of user groups from bicyclists to bird watchers to outdoor \nenthusiasts. They provide a vital communications link between the Park \nService and the surrounding communities that enjoy the attractions that \nthese national sites have to offer. Without these commissions, the Park \nService would be hard pressed to provide the same level of service and \nattention to the broad interests and diverse communities that they \nserve.\n  I continue to be a strong advocate for public involvement in Park \nService decisions. I believe that these commissions have been essential \nin ensuring that the Park Service upholds its commitment to allow \ncommunity participation in its decision making process, particularly \nwhen it comes to contentious issues.\n  California's national parks are truly invaluable, each one of the \nparks that this bill supports offers an opportunity for visitors and \nresidents to enjoy unique national habitats and open spaces. This \nlegislation mark the beginning of a process that I hope will result in \nthe Park Service and the community working together not only to protect \nthe environment, but also the interests of the nearby communities. I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Dayton, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2641. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to reduce \nthe health risks posed by asbestos-containing products; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today I rise and join my colleagues \nSenators Baucus, Cantwell, Dayton, and Wellstone in introducing \nlegislation to improve protections for workers and consumers against a \nknown carcinogen: asbestos. The primary purpose of the Ban Asbestos in \nAmerica Act of 2002 is to require the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, to ban the substance by 2005.\n  Most Americans believe that asbestos has already been banned. People \nhave this misconception in part because EPA tried to ban it in 1989, \nand the ban was well publicized. But what wasn't so publicized was the \nfact that in 1991, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned EPA's \nban, and the first Bush Administration didn't appeal the decision to \nthe Supreme Court. While new uses of asbestos were banned, existing \nones were not.\n  People also believe asbestos has been banned because the mineral has \nbeen heavily regulated, and some uses are now prohibited. But the \nsweeping ban that EPA worked for ten years to put in place never went \ninto effect. As a result, products such as asbestos clothing, pipeline \nwrap, roofing felt, vinyl-asbestos floor tile, asbestos-cement shingle, \ndisc brake pads, gaskets and roof coatings still contain asbestos \ntoday. Had EPA's ban gone into effect, these products would no longer \nbe allowed to contain this deadly substance.\n  This morning I met with three people who wish there had been better \nprotections in place against the dangers of asbestos years ago. I had \nthe honor of meeting Mrs. Susan Vento, the wife of the beloved \nCongressman Bruce Vento from Minnesota who died from a disease caused \nby asbestos in October of 2000 at the age of 60. Representative Vento \nwas exposed to asbestos when he worked in factories in St. Paul during \ncollege.\n  I also had the privilege of meeting Lt. Col. James Zumwalt, the son \nof the legendary Navy Admiral Elmo Zumwalt who also died in 2000 of \nmesothelioma, a rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and internal \norgans caused by asbestos. Like so many others who served in the Navy, \nAdmiral Zumwalt was exposed to asbestos during his military service.\n  In addition, I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Brian Harvey, a former \nEnglish teacher from Washington State University and a survivor of the \ndeadly disease. Like Congressman Vento, Mr. Harvey was exposed to \nasbestos working summers during college, only Mr. Harvey worked in a \ntimber mill in Shelton, WA instead of in factories in St. Paul. Mr. \nHarvey received aggressive treatment from the University of\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\nWashington, and his triumph over the deadly disease offers all of us \nhope.\n  You don't have to tell Mrs. Vento, Lt. Colonel Zumwalt or Mr. Harvey \nthat asbestos can kill, or that it hasn't been banned. Unfortunately, \nthey already know about asbestos.\n  I have also heard from other Washington State residents about the \ndevastating effects that asbestos exposure can have on people's lives. \nI'd like to take a moment to tell you about an e-mail I received from \ntwo of my constituents, Mr. Charles Barber and his wife, Ms. Karen \nMirante, who live in Seattle. They wrote to me last year to express \nsupport for my efforts on asbestos. Mr. Barber and Ms. Mirante had just \nrecently learned that both of their fathers were diagnosed with \nmesothelioma, the same deadly disease that took the lives of \nCongressman Vento and Admiral Zumwalt.\n  Mr. Barber's father, Rudolph ``Rudy'' Barber, was a World War II \nveteran who worked at Todd shipyards. Then he worked for Boeing for 35 \nyears building airplanes. According to his son, when Rudy served on a \ntroopship during the war he recalled sleeping in a bunk under asbestos-\ncoated pipes which flaked so badly that he had to shake out his \nsleeping bag every morning.\n  A few years after retiring from Boeing, Rudy Barber started to \ndevelop breathing problems. First he was told by one doctor that his \ndisease could be cured with surgery, but it wasn't. After undergoing \nsurgery, another doctor diagnosed him with mesothelioma. After a year \nand a half of suffering and of enduring repeated radiation and \nchemotherapy treatments, Mr. Barber died on April 28, 2002. According \nto his family, he never complained and continued to help his family and \nneighbors with maintenance and farm work for as long as he could.\n  Karen Mirante's father, Fred Mirante, was a retired truck driver who \nwas active in labor issues. While the source of Mr. Mirante's exposure \nto asbestos is unknown, it is likely that he breathed in asbestos from \nbrakes when he worked on cars. After receiving experimental therapies \nfor the disease and after a two and one-half year battle, he died on \nJune 4, 2002. June 16, last Sunday, was the first Father's Day that Mr. \nBarber and Ms. Mirante had to spend without their cherished, hard-\nworking dads.\n  I mention Bruce Vento, Admiral Zumwalt, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Barber and \nMr. Mirante to demonstrate that asbestos disease strikes all different \ntypes of people in different professions who were exposed to asbestos \nat some point in their lives. Asbestos knows no boundaries. It is still \nin thousands of schools and buildings throughout the country, and is \nstill being used in some consumer products.\n  I first became interested in this issue because, like most people, I \nthought asbestos had been banned. But in 1999, the Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer starting running stories about a disturbing trend in the \nsmall mining town of Libby, Montana. Residents there suffer from high \nrates of asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. These findings \nprompted Montana Senator Max Baucus to ask EPA to investigate. The \nagency found that the vermiculite mine near Libby, which operated from \nthe 1920s until 1990, is full of tremolite asbestos. EPA is still \nworking to clean up Libby, which is now a Superfund site.\n  W.R. Grace, the company which ran the mine, had evidence of the \nharmful health effects of its product, but did not warn workers, town \nresidents or consumers. Instead, the product was shipped to over 300 \nsites nationally for processing and then was used to make products such \nas home insulation and soil additives. EPA and the Agency for Toxic \nSubstances and Disease Registry, ATSDR, have determined that 22 sites \nare still contaminated today, including one in Spokane, WA.\n\n  At many plants where vermiculite from Libby was processed, waste rock \nleft over from the expansion process was given away for free, and \npeople used it in their yards, driveways and gardens. During its \ninvestigation into sites around the country which processed vermiculite \nfrom Libby, ATSDR discovered a picture taken of two darling little \nboys, Justin and Tim Jorgensen, climbing on waste rock given out by \nWestern Minerals, Inc. in St. Paul, MN sometime in the late 1970s. \nAccording to W.R. Grace records, this rock contained between 2 and 10 \npercent tremolite asbestos. This rock produced airborne asbestos \nconcentrations 135 times higher than the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration's current standard for workers. Thankfully, neither \nJustin nor Tim has shown any signs of disease, but their risks of \ndeveloping asbestos diseases, which have latency periods of 15 to 40 \nyears, are increased from their childhood exposures.\n  People may still today be exposing themselves to harmful amounts of \nasbestos in vermiculite. As many as 35 million homes and businesses may \nhave insulation made with harmful minerals from Libby. And EPA has also \ntested agricultural products, soil conditioners and fertilizers, made \nwith vermiculite, and determined that some workers may have been \nexposed to dangerous concentrations of tremolite asbestos.\n  As I learned more about Libby, and how asbestos has ended up in \nproducts by accident, I was shocked to learn that asbestos is still \nbeing used in products on purpose. While some specific uses have been \nbanned, the EPA's more sweeping ban was never put into effect because \nof an asbestos industry backed lawsuit. As a result, new uses of \nasbestos were banned, but most existing ones were not. Asbestos is \nstill used today to make roofing products, gaskets, brakes and other \nproducts. In 2001 the U.S. consumed 13,000 metric tons of it. Asbestos \nis still entering the product stream in this country, despite its known \ndangers to human health.\n  In contrast, asbestos has been banned in these 20 countries: \nArgentina, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, \nGermany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, \nPoland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Now \nit is time for the United States to ban asbestos, too. According to \nEPA, 27 million Americans had significant exposure to the material on \nthe job between 1940 and 1980. It is time for the sad legacy of \nasbestos disease we have witnessed during the 20th century to come to \nan end. I want to ensure our government does all it can to minimize \nfuture suffering and death caused by this substance.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Ban Asbestos in America Act of \n2002. The legislation has four main parts. First and foremost, this \nbill protects public health by doing what the EPA tried to do 13 years \nago: ban asbestos in the United States. The bill requires EPA to ban it \nby 2005. Like the regulations EPA finalized in 1989, companies may file \nfor an exemption to the ban if there is no substitute material \navailable: if there is no substitute material available and EPA \ndetermines the exemption won't pose an unreasonable risk of injury to \npublic health or the environment.\n  Second, the bill requires EPA to conduct a pubic education campaign \nabout the risks of asbestos products. Within 6 months of passage, the \nEPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission will begin educating \npeople about how to safely handle insulation made with vermiculite. I \nbelieve the government needs to warn people that their insulation, if \nmade with vermiculite, may be contaminated with asbestos. Home owners \nand workers may be unknowingly exposing themselves to asbestos when \nthey conduct routine maintenance near this insulation. While EPA has \nagreed to remove vermiculite insulation from homes in Libby, the agency \ncurrently has no plans to do this nation-wide.\n  The legislation also requires EPA to conduct a survey to determine \nwhich foreign and domestic products being consumed in the United States \ntoday have been made with asbestos. There is no solid, up-to-date \ninformation about which products contain it, although EPA has estimated \nthat as many as 3,000 products still do.\n  The survey will provide the foundation for a broader education \ncampaign so consumers and workers will know how to handle as safely as \npossible asbestos products that were purchased before the ban goes into \neffect.\n  Third, the legislation requires funding to improve treatment for \nasbestos diseases. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, working through the National Institutes of Health, to \n``expand, intensify and coordinate programs for the conduct and support \nof research on diseases caused\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nby exposure to asbestos.'' The Ban Asbestos in America Act requires the \ncreation of a National Mesothelioma Registry to improve tracking of the \ndisease. If there had been an asbestos disease tracking system in \nplace, public health officials would have detected the health problems \nin Libby much sooner, and may have saved lives.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes funding for 7 mesothelioma treatment \ncenters nationwide to improve treatments for and awareness of this \nfatal cancer. As was the case with Mr. Harvey, who received treatment \nfrom the University of Washington, early detection and proper treatment \nmake the difference between life and death. This bill authorizes \n$500,000 for each center for five years. This means more mesothelioma \npatients will receive treatments that can prolong their lives.\n  In response to the EPA Inspector General's report on Libby, Montana, \nEPA committed to create a Blue Ribbon Panel on asbestos and other \ndurable fibers. However, because of insufficient resources, EPA has now \nnarrowed the focus of the Panel to address issues surrounding only the \nsix regulated forms of asbestos. The bill requires EPA to expand its \nBlue Ribbon Panel on Asbestos to address issues beyond those \nsurrounding the six regulated forms of asbestos.\n  The Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2002 expands the Blue Ribbon \nPanel's scope to include nonasbestiform asbestos and other durable \nfibers. The Panel shall include participation by the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. In its response to the Inspector General, \nEPA was originally planning for the Panel to address implementation of \nand grant programs under Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, \ncreation of a National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Pollutants \nunder the Clean Air Act for contaminant asbestos, and other legislative \nand regulatory options for protecting public health.\n  The Administration also promised for the Panel to review the \nfeasibility of establishing a durable fibers testing program within \nEPA, options to improve protections against exposure to asbestos in \nasbestos-containing products in buildings, and public education. The \nBan Asbestos in America Act of 2002 requires the Panel to address these \nsubjects as EPA originally planned.\n  The legislation also requires the Panel to explore the need to \nestablish across federal agencies a uniform asbestos standard and a \nprotocol for detecting and measuring asbestos. Currently, asbestos is \nregulated under at least 11 statutes. There are different standards \nwithin EPA and across federal agencies, and agencies rely on different \nprotocols to detect and measure the substance. This has led to \nwidespread confusion for the public, for example, in 2000, there were \nreports that there was asbestos in crayons. There has also been \nconfusion surrounding asbestos exposure in New York City following the \ncollapse of the World Trade Center Towers. And in Libby, the EPA \nInspector General's report cited split jurisdiction and multiple \nstandards as one of the reasons EPA didn't do a better job of \nprotecting the people of Libby from exposure to asbestos in the first \nplace.\n  The Blue Ribbon Panel will also review the current state of the \nscience on the human health effects of exposure to asbestos and other \ndurable fibers, whether the current definition of asbestos containing \nmaterial should be modified throughout the Code of Federal Regulations, \nand current research on and technologies for disposal of asbestos-\ncontaining products and contaminant asbestos products. The bill leaves \nup to the discretion of the Panel whether it will expand its scope to \ninclude manmade fibers, such as ceramic and carbon fibers. The Blue \nRibbon Panel's recommendations are due 2 years after enactment of the \nAct.\n  Our Federal agencies need to do a better job of coordinating and \nworking together on asbestos, which will mean less confusion for the \npublic and improved protection for everyone.\n  The toll that asbestos has taken on people's lives in this country is \nstaggering. And while Senators Baucus, Cantwell, Dayton, Wellstone, and \nI continue to mourn the loss of Congressman Bruce Vento, Admiral Elmo \nZumwalt, more than 200 people from Libby and thousands of others, today \nour message is one of hope.\n  Our hope is that by continuing to work together, we will build \nsupport for the Ban Asbestos in America Act. If we can get this \nlegislation passed, fewer people will be exposed to asbestos, fewer \npeople will contract asbestos diseases in the first place, and those \nwho already have asbestos diseases will receive treatments to prolong \nand improve quality of life. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Ban \nAsbestos in America Act of 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ban Asbestos in America Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance;\n       (2) there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos;\n       (3)(A) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the \n     example of asbestos was used to justify the need for \n     comprehensive legislation on toxic substances; and\n       (B) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);\n       (4) in 1989, the Administrator promulgated final \n     regulations under title II of the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) to phase out asbestos in \n     consumer products by 1997;\n       (5) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th \n     Circuit overturned the regulations, and the Administrator did \n     not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court;\n       (6) as a result, while new uses of asbestos were banned, \n     asbestos is still being used in some consumer and industrial \n     products in the United States;\n       (7) available evidence suggests that--\n       (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products \n     may be increasing; and\n       (B) some of those products are imported from foreign \n     countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;\n       (8) many people in the United States incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (9) asbestos has been banned in Argentina, Austria, \n     Belgium, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \n     Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, \n     Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       (10) asbestos will be banned throughout the European Union \n     in 2005;\n       (11) the World Trade Organization recently upheld the right \n     of France to ban asbestos, with the United States Trade \n     Representative filing a brief in support of the right of \n     France to ban asbestos;\n       (12) the 1999 brief by the United States Trade \n     Representative stated, ``In the view of the United States, \n     chrysotile asbestos is a toxic material that presents a \n     serious risk to human health.'';\n       (13) people in the United States have been exposed to \n     harmful levels of asbestos as a contaminant of other \n     minerals;\n       (14) in the town of Libby, Montana, workers and residents \n     have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos for \n     generations because of mining operations at the W.R. Grace \n     vermiculite mine located in that town;\n       (15) the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n     found that over a 20-year period, ``mortality in Libby \n     resulting from asbestosis was approximately 40 to 60 times \n     higher than expected. Mesothelioma mortality was also \n     elevated.'';\n       (16)(A) in response to this crisis, in January 2002, the \n     Governor of Montana requested that the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency designate Libby as a \n     Superfund site; and\n       (B) the Administrator is in the process of placing Libby on \n     the National Priorities List;\n       (17)(A) vermiculite from Libby was shipped for processing \n     to 42 States; and\n       (B) Federal agencies are investigating potential harmful \n     exposures to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite at sites \n     throughout the United States; and\n       (18) although it is impracticable to ban asbestos entirely \n     because asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral in the \n     environment and occurs in several deposits throughout the \n     United States, Congress needs to do more to protect the \n     public from exposure to asbestos.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require background checks of alien flight school \napplicants without regard to the maximum certificated weight of the \naircraft for which they seek training, and to require a report on the \neffectiveness of the requirement; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, in the wake of the September \n11 terrorist attacks, it was discovered that many of the hijackers \nreceived flight training in the United States. In addition, Zacarias \nMoussaoui, the alleged ``20th hijacker,'' was apprehended by \ninvestigators in Minnesota after accounts that he was only interested \nin learning to fly, not land, an airplane.\n  Section 113 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires \nbackground checks of all foreign flight school applicants seeking \ntraining to operate aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or more. While this \nprovision should help ensure that events like the September 11 attacks \nare not performed by U.S.-trained pilots using hijacked jets in the \nfuture, it does nothing to prevent different types of potential attacks \nagainst our domestic security.\n  The FBI recently issued a terrorism warning indication that small \nplanes might be used to carry out attacks. We need to ensure that we \nare not training terrorists to perform these activities. We can't allow \ncritical warnings to go unheeded.\n  Today I am introducing legislation that would close this dangerous \nloophole by requiring background checks on all foreign applicants to \nU.S. flight schools, regardless of the aircraft on which they plan to \ntrain. I am joined in this effort by Senators Thomas, Feinstein, and \nBayh, and I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I am submitting today, along with my \ncolleague Senator Stabenow, a resolution congratulating the Detroit Red \nWings, who on June 13th, 2002, defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-1 to \nwin their third Stanley Cup in six years. With this victory, the Wings \nhave further solidified their position as one of the most storied teams \nin all sports by bringing Lord Stanley's Cup home to Hockeytown for a \n10th time.\n  Few doubted that this year's team could make a run at the Cup. Many \nhave argued that this was the greatest hockey roster ever assembled. \nThe last names alone evoke hockey greatness. Along with long time stars \nlike Yzerman, Fedorov, Lidstrom, and Shanahan, this season's team \nincluded future hall of famers by the names of Hull, Robitaille, and \nHasek. It was a team assembled to win, and in the end, that goal was \nreached.\n  This is not a story of individual talent, though surely there was a \nsurplus of that. This is a story of teamwork and dedication. Despite \nthe phenomenal play by Detroit's stars, they would not have succeeded \nhad it not been for the contributions of players like Igor Larionov, \nTomas Holmstrom, Kris Draper, Darren MacCarty and Steve Duchesne. Their \nselfless dedication was exemplified by Duchesne, who sat out only one \nshift, about ten minutes, after losing six teeth to an errant puck.\n  During the season many critics claimed that while Detroit had talent, \nthe team was too old to endure the grueling playoffs, which last for \nover two months. They claimed that the Wings, who average over 30 years \nof age and have seven players over 35, would succumb to injury or \nfatigue against younger competition. However as the playoffs \nprogressed, the team only grew stronger. All questions were put to rest \nin game three of the playoffs when 41 year old Igor Larionov scored two \ngoals including the game winner in the third overtime.\n  Though the Wings are known for their powerful offense, it was their \nsmothering defense which led to their victory. Throughout the playoffs, \ntheir defense kept the number of scoring chances for the opposing team \nto a bare minimum. The anchor of the Detroit defense was Nicklas \nLidstrom who averaged over 31 minutes per game throughout the playoffs \nand over 35 minutes during the finals. For his exceptional \ncontributions, he was awarded the Conn Smythe trophy as the Most \nValuable player in the Playoffs.\n  Special recognition is also due to the Red Wings Captain, Steve \nYzerman, who has been the team captain since 1986. During his career in \nthe Motor City, this humble star has amassed 175 playoff points, \nbesting the great Gordie Howe for the team record. For this year's \nplayoffs, Yzerman led the team with 23 points, second in the NHL. Along \nwith holding the team record for playoff goals, Stevie, as he is fondly \nknown in Detroit, is the motivational leader of the team. When things \nwere going poorly in the series against Vancouver, it was Yzerman who \ngave the motivational speech which led to a Wings victory and a tide \nshift in the series--all of this despite a knee which will need \nreconstructive surgery this off-season.\n  This victory also marks the end of an era, not only for Detroit, but \nfor the NHL. Soon after the game ended, Scotty Bowman, the Red Wings \ncoach since 1993, announced his retirement. When Scotty came to Detroit \nnine years ago, we had been without the Cup for nearly four decades. \nHowever, during his tenure, the Wings made it to the payoffs seven of \neight years, and won the Stanley Cup three times. With this, his ninth \nStanley Cup, victory Scotty also surpasses his mentor Toe Blake with \nthe most cups in NHL history and joins Red Auerbach and Lakers coach \nPhil Jackson among the coaches with the most championship victories in \nmajor sports. I join with every Detroiter in saying, ``Thank you \nScotty.''\n  Hockey has long been a second religion in Detroit. I fondly remember \ngoing to Red Wings games as a kid with my big brother, Sander--\nCongressman Levin now--and our mother. Those teams were also filled \nwith future hall of famers: Sid Abel, Gordie Howe, Teddy Lindsay. These \nplayers and other Wings alumni established a winning tradition which \ncontinues to this day.\n  Yesterday, Senator Stabenow and I joined over a million fans in \ncongratulating this fantastic team. The celebration was not only an \noutpouring of emotion and a celebration of talent, it was an \naffirmation of Detroit's title as Hockeytown. During the ceremonies, I \nhad the opportunity to say thanks and farewell to Scotty Bowman. I also \nhad the pleasure of chatting with Stevie Yzerman and his family. I wish \nhim a speedy recovery from his surgery. More than anything else, he and \nthe rest of the wings have been mentors to our children--along with \nbeing incredible hockey players on the ice they are charitable public \ncitizens and dedicated family members .\n  I know my Senate Colleagues will join me and hockey fans around the \ncountry in congratulating the Red Wings for bringing hockey's ``Holy \nGrail'' back to Hockeytown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, it was with great joy and excitement \nyesterday that I joined with Senator Levin as we celebrated the Stanley \nCup win by the Detroit Red Wings. It was a beautiful sunshiny day in \nDetroit, and over a million people came out to join with all of us in \nthanking Scotty Bowman and thanking the entire team for their wonderful \nwin again this year. We are so proud, as Senator Levin said, of what \nthey do, not only on the ice but off the ice. So it is with great \npleasure that I join with Senator Levin today in coauthoring this \nresolution of tribute to the Detroit Red Wings.\n  As has been said, this is the third time in 6 years the Detroit Red \nWings have won the Stanley Cup. It is the 10th Stanley Cup in total \nthat the Detroit Red Wings have won. We are pleased we are only behind \nthe Montreal Canadiens, that have won it 23 times, and the Toronto \nMaple Leaves, that have won it 13 times. They are the only two teams \nthat have won more Stanley Cups than our own Detroit Red Wings, of \nwhich we are so proud.\n  We also, yesterday, saw a wonderful tribute to the head coach and the \nentire coaching staff, but particularly Scotty Bowman, who has his \nninth Stanley Cup win in his 30 years, and 9 years with Detroit. This \nis the most for any coach in the NHL. Sports Illustrated has called him \nthe best coach in any sport. That is high praise.\n  Yesterday, the fans, of whom we have many--in fact, we in Detroit and \nin Michigan believe we have the best fans in the country, and indeed in \nthe world, in Hockeytown everyone joined in rousing support and thanks \nto Scotty Bowman for all he has done to bring this team to another \nvictory and also for leading a group of men who are role models both in \ntheir sport on the ice as well as in their own communities and personal \nlives.\n  We are sorry to see Scotty leave, but we are so grateful that he has \nspent this time in Detroit and that he has given his all to help our \nteam achieve the very highest honors possible.\n  Interestingly, we know the Stanley Cup was named after Lord Stanley \nof Preston, the Governor General of Canada. In 1893, he started this \naward by purchasing a small, gold-plated, silver bowl from a London \nsilversmith for $50.\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nThe bowl was awarded to the best hockey team in Canada. The original \ncup is actually in a museum.\n  It was a great honor, yesterday, for me to see our Stanley Cup, to \nsee the names that are engraved there, to know that Detroit has such a \nhigh place of honor, and that the Detroit Red Wings have once again \nbrought the cup home to Detroit.\n  So congratulations to the Red Wings. We are so proud of you. It is my \ngreat pleasure to stand with Senator Levin in salute to our Detroit Red \nWings today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/18/senate-section/article/S5714-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3891.

Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Ensign (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \nStevens)) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 4560, to eliminate the \ndeadlines for spectrum auctions of spectrum previously allocated to \ntelevision broadcasting; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Auction Reform Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have \n     changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the \n     700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in \n     1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original \n     deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are \n     consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum \n     management principles.\n       (2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating \n     additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other \n     advanced communications services. The Federal Communications \n     Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies \n     in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.\n       (3) The study being conducted by the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration in \n     consultation with the Department of Defense to determine \n     whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish \n     additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other \n     advanced communications services will not be completed until \n     after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz \n     band, and long after the applications must be filed to \n     participate in the auction, thereby creating further \n     uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 \n     megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for \n     the benefit of consumers.\n       (4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the \n     process of determining how to resolve the interference \n     problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for \n     public safety. One option being considered for the 800 \n     megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The \n     Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before \n     the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a \n     tenable plan has been conceived.\n       (5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by \n     television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to \n     digital television is completed. This situation creates a \n     tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum \n     will be available and reduces the value placed on the \n     spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 \n     megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the \n     auction would be likely to produce and the probability that \n     the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued \n     the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most \n     productive use.\n       (6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms \n     for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations--\n       (A) produced no certainty that the band would be available \n     for advanced mobile communications services, public safety \n     operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the \n     existing statutory framework provides; and\n       (B) should advance the transition of digital television and \n     must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent \n     licensee.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF STATUTORY DEADLINES FOR SPECTRUM \n                   AUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) FCC To Determine Timing of Auctions.--Section 309(j) of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(15) Commission to determine timing of auctions.--\n       ``(A) Commission authority.--Subject to the provisions of \n     this subsection (including paragraph (11)), but \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission \n     shall determine the timing of and deadlines for the conduct \n     of competitive bidding under this subsection, including the \n     timing of and deadlines for qualifying for bidding; \n     conducting auctions; collecting, depositing, and reporting \n     revenues; and completing licensing processes and assigning \n     licenses.\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n       ``(B) Termination of portions of auctions 31 and 44.--\n     Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Commission shall \n     not commence or conduct auctions 31 and 44 on June 19, 2002, \n     as specified in the public notices of March 19, 2002, and \n     March 20, 2002 (DA 02-659 and DA 02-563).\n       ``(C) Exception.--\n       ``(i) Blocks excepted.--Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to \n     the auction of--\n\n       ``(I) the C-block of licenses on the bands of frequencies \n     located at 710-716 megahertz, and 740-746 megahertz; or\n       ``(II) the D-block of licenses on the bands of frequencies \n     located at 716-722 megahertz.\n\n       ``(ii) Eligible bidders.--The entities that shall be \n     eligible to bid in the auction of the C-block and D-block \n     licenses described in clause (i) shall be those entities that \n     were qualified entities, and that submitted applications to \n     participate in auction 44, by May 8, 2002, as part of the \n     original auction 44 short form filing deadline.\n       ``(iii) Auction deadlines for excepted blocks.--\n     Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the auction of the C-block \n     and D-block licenses described in clause (i) shall be \n     commenced no earlier than August 19, 2002, and no later than \n     September 19, 2002, and the proceeds of such auction shall be \n     deposited in accordance with paragraph (8) not later than \n     December 31, 2002.\n       ``(iv) Report.--Within one year after the date of enactment \n     of this paragraph, the Commission shall submit a report to \n     Congress--\n\n       ``(I) specifying when the Commission intends to reschedule \n     auctions 31 and 44 (other than the blocks excepted by clause \n     (i)); and\n       ``(II) describing the progress made by the Commission in \n     the digital television transition and in the assignment and \n     allocation of additional spectrum for advanced mobile \n     communications services that warrants the scheduling of such \n     auctions.\n\n       ``(D) Return of payments.--Within one month after the date \n     of enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall return \n     to the bidders for licenses in the A-block, B-block, and E-\n     block of auction 44 the full amount of all upfront payments \n     made by such bidders for such licenses.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Communications act of 1934.--Section 309(j)(14)(C)(ii) \n     of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     309(j)(14)(C)(ii)) is amended by striking the second \n     sentence.\n       (2) Balanced budget act of 1997.--Section 3007 of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (111 Stat. 269) is repealed.\n       (3) Consolidated appropriations act.--Paragraphs (2) and \n     (3) of section 213(a) of H.R. 3425 of the 106th Congress, as \n     enacted into law by section 1000(a)(5) of an Act making \n     consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2000, and for other purposes (Public Law 106-\n     113; 113 Stat. 1501A-295), are repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4.

UNDERSTANDINGS.\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understandings, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification of \n     the Protocol:\n       (1) No assumption of obligations under the convention on \n     the rights of the child.--The United States understands that \n     the United States assumes no obligations under the Convention \n     on the Rights of the Child by becoming a party to the \n     Protocol.\n       (2) Implementation of obligation not to permit children to \n     take direct part in hostilities.--The United States \n     understands that, with respect to Article 1 of the Protocol--\n       (A) the term ``feasible measures'' means those measures \n     that are practical or practically possible, taking into \n     account all the circumstances ruling at the time, including \n     humanitarian and military considerations;\n       (B) the phrase ``direct part in hostilities''--\n       (i) means immediate and actual action on the battlefield \n     likely to cause harm to the enemy because there is a direct \n     causal relationship between the activity engaged in and the \n     harm done to the enemy; and\n       (ii) does not mean indirect participation in hostilities, \n     such as gathering and transmitting military information, \n     transporting weapons, munitions, or other supplies, or \n     forward deployment; and\n       (C) any decision by any military commander, military \n     personnel, or other person responsible for planning, \n     authorizing, or executing military action, including the \n     assignment of military personnel, shall only be judged on the \n     basis of all the relevant circumstances and on the basis of \n     that person's assessment of the information reasonably \n     available to the person at the time the person planned, \n     authorized, or executed the action under review, and shall \n     not be judged on the basis of information that comes to light \n     after the action under review was taken.\n       (3) Minimum age for voluntary recruitment.--The United \n     States understands that Article 3 of the Protocol obligates \n     States Parties to the Protocol to raise the minimum age for \n     voluntary recruitment into their national armed forces from \n     the current international standard of 15 years of age.\n       (4) Armed groups.--The United States understands that the \n     term ``armed groups'' in Article 4 of the Protocol means \n     nongovernmental armed groups such as rebel groups, dissident \n     armed forces, and other insurgent groups.\n       (5) No basis for jurisdiction by any international \n     tribunal.--The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Protocol establishes a basis for jurisdiction by any \n     international tribunal, including the International Criminal \n     Court.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 6, the \nOptional Protocol No. 2 to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on \nthe Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; that \nthe protocol be considered as having advanced through its parliamentary \nstages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of \nratification; and that the reservation, understandings, declaration, \nand condition be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very pleased that today the Senate \nis approving two Optional Protocols to the U.N. Convention on the \nRights of the Child. The Optional Protocol on Involvement of Children \nin Armed Conflict, also known as the Child Soldiers Protocol, aims to \nprevent children under the age of 18 from directly participating in \nhostilities. The second treaty, the Optional Protocol on the Sale of \nChildren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography aims to strengthen \nefforts to put a stop to the trafficking and exploitation of children.\n  Last March, I chaired a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \nthese two Protocols that featured members of the State, Justice, and \nDefense Departments. I appreciate the cooperation the committee \nreceived from these agencies in making ratification of these two \ntreaties possible. The hearing also featured a panel of private \nwitnesses that was led by Jo Becker, a tireless advocate on the issue \nof banning the use of child soldiers.\n  During her testimony, Ms. Becker pointed out that in Afghanistan, two \ngenerations of children have been subject to recruitment, first into \nthe resistance to Soviets forces, and then into various warring \nfactions. It is well-known that the Taliban recruited children from the \nreligious schools in Pakistan.\n  The Child Soldiers Protocol requires parties to the treaty to (1) \ntake ``all feasible measures'' to ensure that individuals under the age \nof 18 do not take a ``direct part'' in hostilities; (2) ban involuntary \nrecruitment into the armed forces for those under the age of 18; and \n(3) raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nforces from the current benchmark of 15 years of age to that of 16 or \nhigher. Under current law, the minimum age for voluntary recruitment in \nthe U.S. is already set at 17.\n  Why is ratification of the child Soldiers Protocol important? Right \nnow, an estimated 300,000 children under the age of 18 are currently \nfighting in more than 30 conflicts around the world. In places like \nSierra Leone, children have been kidnapped by rebel groups, given \ndrugs, and forced to commit atrocities. Child soldiers not only lose \ntheir childhood, they develop psychological scars, they suffer physical \ninjuries, and, in the worst cases, they die.\n  Listen to the story of a 16-year old girl who was abducted by the \nLord's Resistance Army in Uganda:\n\n       One boy tried to escape, but he was caught . . . his hands \n     were tied, and they made us, the other new captives, kill him \n     with a stick. I felt sick. I knew this boy from before. We \n     were from the same village. I refused to kill him and they \n     told me they would shoot me. They pointed a gun at me, so I \n     had to do it. The boy was asking me. ``Why are you doing \n     this?'' I said I had no choice. After we killed him, they \n     made us smear his blood on our arms .  .  . They said we had \n     to do this so we would not fear death and so we would not try \n     to escape . . . I still dream about the boy from my village \n     who I killed. I see him in my dreams, and he is talking to me \n     and saying I killed him for nothing, and I am crying.\n\n  Here is another story from a former child soldier in Sierra Leone:\n  ``Most times I dream, I have a gun, I'm firing, I'm killing, \namputating. I feel afraid thinking that perhaps these things will \nhappen to me again. Sometimes I cry...''\n  And finally another says, ``my schoolmates and I met our old teacher, \nand we knocked him down. We killed the teacher and we took his books \nand burned them.''\n  I am proud that the Senate is taking action today to put an end to \nthese stories. Formally adopting the protocol's standards for U.S. \nmilitary operations will enable the U.S. to be able to effectively \npressure other governments and forces to end the use of children within \ntheir own military ranks.\n  The second treaty the Senate is approving today is the Protocol on \nthe Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. The \nSale of Children Protocol requires parties to the treaty to make sure \nthat these acts are fully covered by penal or criminal law.\n  The abuse of children is a global problem. Millions of boys and girls \nunder the age of 18 are bought and sold each year. Girls are \nparticularly vulnerable. According to the United Nations Children's \nFund (UNICEF), girls appear to be forced into the sex industry at \nincreasingly younger ages, partly as a result of the mistaken belief \nthat younger girls are unlikely to be infected with HIV or AIDS.\n  Let me mention just a few atrocious examples:\n  A 15-year-old boy from Mali watched the torture and subsequent deaths \nof two other forced laborers who tried to escape from a coffee \nplantation in the Ivory Coast.\n  A 14-year-old girl from Mexico was brutally raped and then \nprostituted for months by traffickers in Florida who lured her there by \npromising a job in the restaurant industry.\n  An 11-year-old in Thailand was included in a sexually explicit \nvideotape produced by a pornographer in the United States.\n  Under the Protocol, countries are encouraged to cooperate to protect \nchildren trafficked across borders. The Optional Protocol also calls on \nnations to ensure that children who have been sexually trafficked, \nexploited or sexually abused receive services to ensure a complete \nphysical and psychological recovery.\n  Ratification of this treaty is important to protect these vulnerable \nchildren. These children cannot often get help on their own--not only \nbecause of their young age--but also because they have no birth \ncertificates or official documents. They are, in effect, ``invisible.''\n  Earlier this year, both of these protocols attained the necessary 10 \nratifications to make them operative. The Child Soldier Protocol \nentered into force on February 12. The Sale of Children Protocol \nentered into force on January 18.\n  Once again, I am pleased that the United States is adding its name as \na ratifying party to these two treaties and I hope that more nations \njoin us in expanding international protections for children.\n  Mr. REID.
