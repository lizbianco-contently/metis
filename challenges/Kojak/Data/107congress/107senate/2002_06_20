Some are under severe stress because of so much to do and so \nlittle time to do it. Ease their tension, Lord. Wipe the furrows from \ntheir brow and remind them that Your grace is sufficient for this day.\n  Some harbor animosity toward people who have offended them. They know \nthat Your word says to forgive quickly. It is just so hard to do it. \nHelp them to have the grace to release that irritation and experience \nthe freedom of forgiveness. We all have the need for forgiveness of our \nown sin and hope for life beyond. So Lord, grant us the humility to \ntrust You completely for those things that we can't control, and grant \nthe confidence to us that we can do all things through Christ, who \nstrengthens us.

Mr. President, since its creation in 1965, the Medicare \nProgram has helped millions of the Nation's elderly and disabled when \nthey were in desperate need, after they had become sick enough to \nrequire a physician's assistance or hospitalization. Thirty-seven years \nafter its creation, it is time for change.\n  A prescription drug benefit is the most fundamental reform we can \nmake to the Medicare Program. Why? If we want to truly reform Medicare, \nwe must change its basic approach from one that is oriented toward \nintervention after sickness to one that focuses on maintaining wellness \nand the highest quality of life. This prevention approach will require \nin almost every instance a significant use of prescription drugs.\n  An example of how the use of prescription drugs has changed medicine \nwas made by Dr. Howard Forman, a congressional fellow in my office, who \nis a doctor and professor at the Yale Medical School. Dr. Forman \nremarked to me that none of his students had ever seen ulcer surgery. \nWhy? Because we now give patients prescription drugs to care for this \nailment which previously was dealt with through surgery. This is just \none of many examples of where modern medicine has fundamentally been \naltered by prescription drugs; notably, by improving the quality of \npeople's lives, ending the need for many surgeries and long recovery \nperiods.\n  A side benefit of this change would be that the cost to the Medicare \nProgram could be lowered by utilizing these expensive but less \nexpensive prescription procedures as opposed to traditional surgery.\n  The prescription drug legislation I am sponsoring, with my friends, \nSenator Zell Miller of Georgia and Senator Ted Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, would improve the Medicare Program and give seniors a \nreal, a meaningful, a sustainable drug benefit. With a $25 monthly \npremium, no deductible, and a simple copayment of $10 for generic \ndrugs, $40 for medically necessary, standard brand name drugs, and $60 \nfor other brand name drugs, and a maximum of $4,000 in out-of-pocket \nexpenses, our plan would give seniors the universal, affordable, \naccessible, and comprehensive drug coverage which they want and need.\n  Our plan would help 80-year-old Freda Moss of Tampa, FL. She has no \nprescription drug coverage. Today, she pays nearly $8,000 a year for \nthe drugs she needs to keep her healthy. This does not include a new \nprescription for Actos, an oral diabetes drug that costs $143.68 every \nmonth. Freda has not had this prescription filled because it is so \nexpensive.\n\n  Under the Graham-Miller-Kennedy plan, she would pay just over \n$2,900--saving $5,100 each year. Under the House Republican plan, \nFreda's drug costs would be at least $4,220 a year. Why would the House \nplan cost Freda $1,320 more per year?\n  There are many reasons, including a higher monthly premium and a $250 \ndeductible. But the single biggest reason is the ``donut.''\n  What is the donut, Mr. President? We are all familiar with donuts. \nThey are round; they taste good; often, they have powdered sugar on \nthem; they are tasty at the edges. But when you get into the middle, \nthere is nothing there. That describes the benefit structure of the \nHouse Republican plan.\n  Let's look at how this plan would have affected Freda and her \nhusband, Coleman. After having paid a $250 annual deductible, Freda and \nher husband would pay 20 percent of the cost of each specific \nprescription up to $1,000. From $1,001 to $2,000, she would pay 50 \npercent of each prescription. And then she hits the hole in the donut. \nFreda is on her own until she reaches the catastrophic limit of $4,900 \nin total drug costs.\n  While she is struggling through this hole in the middle of the donut, \nshe would be responsible for continuing to pay her monthly premiums of \nabout $34, for which she would receive nothing, no benefit.\n  Mr. President, there is no comparable donut in private health care \nplans. The kind of plan which probably covered Freda and Coleman before \nshe came on to Medicare did not have this approach; it has, as we do, \ncontinuous protection. One of the things our older citizens want is \ncertainty and security. Our plan gives them that.\n  The House Republican plan converts them into guinea pigs, \nexperimenting with untested health care policies and a ``gotcha'' of an \nunexpected hole in the middle of their benefit--a hole which runs from \n$2,001 all the way to $4,900 of expenditures. We are not going to make \n39 million senior Americans into laboratory experiments.\n  Under our plan, Freda would pay no deductible, receiving coverage \nfrom her first prescription. She would pay a simple copay for each \nprescription. There are no donut holes. Instead of gaps, we give \nAmerican seniors a plan that mirrors the copay system that they had in \ntheir working lives.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague, Senator Miller, says with such \nconviction and passion: This is the year for action, not just talk, on \nprescription drugs.\n  I don't want to go back to Tampa, FL, and tell Freda we had a very \nstrong debate about this issue. I want to tell Freda she can start \ngoing to the drugstore and from her first prescription begin to get \nreal assistance. We all will come to the floor this week, and in the \nfollowing weeks, to remind our colleagues about the importance of \npassing a prescription drug benefit before the August recess, and to \nhave that benefit in law before the end of this session of Congress.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I, too, rise to talk about prescription \ndrugs and the struggle our seniors face every day.\n  Since April, I have been coming down to this Chamber on a regular \nbasis to speak about the urgency of passing a prescription drug benefit \nbefore the August recess. I have spoken about how we have kept our \nseniors waiting in line for years and how we have bumped them time and \ntime again to debate other issues--other important issues but other \nissues.\n  Our majority leader, Senator Daschle, has said we will bring up \nprescription drugs on the Senate floor before the August recess. I and \nmany others are very grateful.\n  As of today, we now have three bills in Congress to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare--two in the House and one in the \nSenate--the one I am a cosponsor of, along with Senator Graham of \nFlorida, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, and about 28 other Senators.\n  This issue is now where it should be; it is front and center. It has \nmore momentum today than it has had in all the years we have been \ntalking about it. Our seniors have finally reached the front of the \nline. Now it is time to get down to business and have a real debate on \nthe details of these proposals.\n  Make no mistake about it, there are real differences among them. \nLet's debate those differences. If we can, let's find some common \nground. And then let's get something passed because if we fail to do \nsomething now, if we just criticize each other's bills for the sake of \ncriticizing, and dig in our heels and refuse to compromise and work \nsomething out, our seniors are never going to let us forget it come \nNovember.\n  After years of wandering in the wilderness, our seniors are now \ninside of the promised land. Both political parties have brought them \nthere and have given them a glimpse. We cannot send them away to wander \nin the desert for\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nanother election cycle or who knows how many more years.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us have a healthy debate on these bills. \nLet us point out the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal, but \nnever lose sight of the big picture, as Senator Graham just said at the \nend of his remarks.\n  This should not be viewed as just an issue for the next election \ncampaign. I urge my colleagues not to look at it in that way. Our goal \nshould be to pass a prescription drug benefit. I will work hard to see \nthat the bill we pass in the Senate offers real help for our seniors, \nespecially for our neediest seniors.\n  As Senator Kennedy said so eloquently last week: The state of a \nfamily's health should not be determined by the size of a family's \nwealth.\n  One way to help our seniors, including the neediest, with \nprescription drugs is to pass a bill that has no gap in coverage and \nthat places a reasonable cap on out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill offers just that. There is no gap in \ncoverage, and the out-of-pocket maximum is set at $4,000 a year. After \n$4,000, Medicare would pick up 100 percent of the cost of prescriptions \nunder our bill. But the House Republican bill provides no coverage from \nthe time a senior's total drug costs reach $2,000 to the time they \nreach $4,900. That is that ``hole in the donut'' Senator Graham was \ntalking about that is so obvious.\n  Who will it hurt the most? The ones who can afford it the least--the \nlow-income seniors. To add insult to injury, the House bill requires \nseniors to continue paying monthly premiums during this gap, even \nthough they are not receiving a single penny of benefit. Even the \nneediest seniors would have to pay these premiums during this gap. That \nis not right; that is just plain unacceptable.\n\n  I look forward to debating this provision, and many others, when we \ntake up prescription drugs in the next few weeks. I urge my colleagues \nin both Houses and in both parties to keep the big picture in mind. Our \nduty to seniors is not just to debate a bill, it is to pass a bill.\n  The final product won't be perfect. It won't include everything that \nI want, and it won't include everything that some of my colleagues may \nwant. But it will be better than what our seniors have now. And what \nour seniors have now is nothing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend our \ncolleagues, Senator Miller and Senator Graham, for their leadership in \nthis area, which is of such enormous importance and consequence to \npeople in my State of Massachusetts and across the country.\n  I hope the American people are going to pay close attention to these \npresentations that are made today by both of these leaders, as well as \nmy friend from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow, as they continue to help the \nAmerican people understand what is really at stake.\n  Medicare is a solemn promise between the government and the American \npeople and between the generations. It says ``Play by the rules, \ncontribute to the system during your working years, and you will be \nguaranteed health security in your retirement years.'' Because of \nMedicare, the elderly have long had insurance for their hospital bills \nand doctor bills. But the promise of health security at the core of \nMedicare is broken every day because Medicare does not cover the \nsoaring price of prescription drugs.\n  Too many elderly citizens must choose between food on the table and \nthe medicine their doctors prescribe. Too many elderly are taking half \nthe drugs their doctors prescribe--or none at all--because they can't \nafford them. The average senior citizen has an income of $15,000 and \nprescription drug costs of $2,100. Some must pay much more.\n  I want to pick up on the issue of comparing the different bills. \nHopefully, as we come to debate these issues and questions, we will \nbegin to understand the importance of the differences in the Democratic \nand Republican bills. They are enormously different.\n  The administration's first bill did not even pass the laugh test, and \nthe bill that is being considered now by the Republicans in the House \nof Representatives does not pass the truth-in-advertising test. The \nadministration allocated $190 billion. Senior citizens are going to \nspend $1.8 trillion for prescription drugs. So they get about 10 cents \non the dollar to assist them, and there are still a lot of gimmicks \nthey have to go through to get even that.\n  Listen to the Republican proposal. The House Republicans have a \nproposal that says: If you have an income below 150 percent of poverty, \nyou are not going to have to worry about your premiums, copayments, or \ndeductibles. Doesn't that sound reasonable for low-income people? \nExcept there is an assets test which the Miller-Graham proposal does \nnot have.\n  This is basically a hoax on the low-income people. To qualify for \nlow-income subsidies under the Republican plan a senior cannot have \n$2,000 in savings. They cannot have $2,000 in furniture or property, \nthey cannot have a car that is worth $4,500 or a burial plot that is \nworth $1,500. Any one of these assets disqualifies one from the \nRepublican plan. Do they mention that? No. Do you read about it? No. Is \nit there? Yes. Effectively this writes off, writes out millions of low-\nincome seniors.\n  This group of seniors is seeing a fraud perpetrated on them. The \nMiller-Graham bill has rejected that concept. If we in the Senate are \ngoing to be true to our word, we will reject it, too. This will be an \nimportant battle.\n  The second group of seniors is those with moderate incomes who are \ngoing to pay the $420 annual premium and the additional $250 \ndeductible. We know they are going to get very little in return. They \nwill pay up to $670 in premiums and deductibles before they are going \nto get any assistance at all. Those with prescription drug spending of \n$250 or less will pay $670 and receive no benefit. Seniors who have \ndrug costs between $250 and $1,000 annually will spend up to $820 in \nannual costs but only receive up to $600 in benefits. Those seniors \nwith prescription drug costs falling between $1,000 and $2,000 a \nyear will pay premiums, deductibles, and copayments totaling up to \n$1,320 in return for benefits of up to only $1,100. Seniors ought to \nknow just what help the Republicans are offering in their proposal.\n\n  Finally there is the last group, individuals who still have a very \nmodest income, but have prescription drug costs over $2,000. They are \ngoing to fall into the hole, as Senator Graham has pointed out. They \nwill get no assistance for their drug costs once they reach $2,000.\n  It is important to understand, as we begin this debate, who is going \nto be helped and who is not going to be helped. The Republican program \nfails to explain that either to their membership or to the American \npublic.\n  In each of these areas, the Miller-Graham bill rejects those \nartificial barriers and assists each and every citizen all the way \nthrough. That is a major difference. This is one of the important \ndifferences we ought to recognize.\n  Here's another important difference. Rather than the safe, dependable \nMedicare system that senior citizens understand, the Republican plan is \nrun through private insurance companies--pharmaceutical HMOs. They are \nallowed to set premiums at whatever the traffic will bear. And there is \nno guarantee that benefits will actually be available if private \ninsurance companies decide they don't want to participate. Senior \ncitizens have seen what has happened to HMOs in the regular Medicare \nprogram--cutbacks in benefits, withdrawal of services. They don't need \nthat for lifesaving prescription drug coverage.\n  And to complete this dishonor roll of the Republican plan, it does \nnot even start until 2005. The Republican prescription for senior \ncitizens: take two aspirin and call the pharmacy in two and a half \nyears.\n  Senior citizens and their children and their grandchildren understand \nthat affordable, comprehensive prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare should be a priority. Let's listen to their voices instead of \nthose of the powerful special interests. Let's pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit worthy of the name.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill of which I am very pleased to \nbe a\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\ncosponsor, which will provide a voluntary comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. This is long overdue.\n  I also rise today to express great concern about what is being done \nin the House of Representatives. We know that in the end we need to \ncome together with a bipartisan bill. We welcome that and want to work \nwith our colleagues, but it has to be something real, it has to be \nsomething that provides more than 20 percent of the cost of \nprescription drugs--only 20 percent help--leaving our seniors to pay 80 \npercent and, in some cases more, for their prescriptions. It is just \nnot good enough.\n  I wish to share some portions of a letter I received yesterday from \nthe Kroger Company of Michigan that was written to me concerning the \nlegislation that is being drafted and passed by our Republican \ncolleagues in the House. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: As president of the Michigan Kroger \n     stores, I am writing to advise you that our stores oppose the \n     Thomas-Tauzin medicare bill.\n\n  The Republican bill in the House.\n\n       Passage of this bill will hurt Michigan senior citizens by \n     confining their freedom in choosing generic over brand name \n     medications and restricting their pharmacy choices. \n     Furthermore, the viability of community pharmacies is of \n     significant concern, especially in rural areas where \n     inadequate reimbursement rates could force many community \n     pharmacies out of business, further restricting seniors' \n     choices.\n\n  There is great concern not only from the senior groups, those that \nrepresent consumers in our country. I appreciate the president of \nKroger expressing great concern about this as well. We can do better. \nThe question is, To whom are we going to listen?\n  I am asking, as are my colleagues, that we listen to not only seniors \nbut businessowners and others who are experiencing an explosion in the \nprices of prescription drugs, and that we act and do so now. It is long \noverdue.\n  A few weeks ago, I invited people to come to my Web site. We have set \nup the prescription drug people's lobby in Michigan. We are tying it to \na Web site that has been set up nationally, fairdrugprices.org, and I \nhave been asking people to share their concerns, their experiences with \nthe high prescription drug prices we are seeing across the country.\n  Once again, I wish to share a story from one of those citizens in \nMichigan who has signed up to be a part of our prescription drug \npeople's lobby.\n  This is from Molly A. Moons, who is 44 years old in Pontiac, MI. She \nsays:\n\n       Senior citizens are not the only people suffering from the \n     high cost of prescription drugs. I am the sole employee of a \n     small business and not eligible for any health care plans \n     that cover the cost of prescription drugs. I have four \n     prescriptions that need filling each month, and the cost is \n     in excess of $300 a month--a real financial burden. At the \n     invitation of some senior citizen friends, I was invited to \n     take a ``drug run'' to Canada.\n\n  Mr. President, a number of us have done this to demonstrate the \ndifferences in prices.\n\n       These ladies were all widows/retirees on fixed incomes that \n     were having trouble paying for their medications, so I joined \n     them to buy our prescriptions in Canada.\n       . . . I am able to get a 3-month supply of medication for \n     what it costs me for a 1-month supply in the United States.\n\n  A 3-month supply in Canada for a 1-month supply in the United States.\n\n       I find that shameful.\n       While I believe that everyone has a right to make a \n     profitable living, the gouging of the pharmaceutical \n     companies is sickening. Additionally, the loopholes that \n     these companies use to keep drugs from generic manufacturers \n     are also criminal. Please help make this stop.\n\n  I thank Molly Moons for sharing her story as a small businessowner \nand sharing her concern about the senior citizens who were on that bus \ngoing to Canada. Shame on us. She is right, ``I find it shameful,'' and \nit is shameful. We are saying we can do something about it. We can do \nsomething about it by passing the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill that will \nprovide a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit, and we can \nfurther do it by passing other legislation to lower prices through \nexpanded use of generics, opening the border to Canada and other \npolicies that will lower prices. We can do that, and we need to do \nthat.\n  Why has this not been done? Why has this not happened? We have been \ntalking about it. I talked about it as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. We tried to pass something then. Colleagues of mine \nhave talked about it. Presidential candidates have talked about it. As \nthe Senator from Georgia said earlier, it is time to stop talking about \nit and get something done.\n  Why has that not happened? Unfortunately, we have seen too much \ninfluence and too many voices trying to stop this, and not enough of \nthe people's voice in this process, which is what we are trying to do \nright now.\n  We have a Web site that I have invited people to go to that is called \nfairdrugprices.org. We are inviting people to sign a petition to urge \nCongress to act right now, to urge Congress to pass a comprehensive \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, and to pass other efforts to lower \nprices. We urge people to go to this Web site and share their story. We \nwill share those stories on the floor of the Senate.\n  Why is that important? It is important because, according to our \nnumbers, there are about six drug company lobbyists for every Member of \nthe Senate. Their voice is being heard. This is about making the \npeople's voice heard through their Representatives and their Senators.\n  Unfortunately, there are other ways in which voices are heard. I \nfound it unfortunate that yesterday, while in the midst of debating a \nMedicare bill, which has been viewed by colleagues and quoted in the \npaper from House Republican staff as being a bill they are very \nconcerned about having reflect the needs of the drug companies, but at \nthe same time we do not have the concerns of our seniors and our \nfamilies being voiced as a part of that process, that last evening \nthere was a major fundraiser. Our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and the House of Representatives had a major Republican \nfundraiser and we saw a number of pharmaceutical companies playing a \nmajor role.\n  We saw Glaxo Smith Klein, according to the newspaper, contributing \nabout $250,000 to that fundraising effort; PHRMA, which is the trade \norganization for the companies, contributing about $250,000 to that \nfundraiser; Pfizer, about $100,000, and other companies as well. So \nthere are those that are not only here as lobbyists but contributing \ndollars to fundraisers, certainly wanting to make their voice heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. In conclusion, we know the lobbyists' voices are heard \non this issue, the drug companies' voices are heard in a multitude of \nways. Now is the time for the people's voice to be heard on this \nsubject, and I urge those who are watching today to get involved \nthrough fairdrugprices.org, by showing support for a bill that will be \nbrought up in July and will be voted on in this Senate to provide real \nhelp for seniors and those with disabilities in our country.\n  We will bring forward other legislation to lower prices for everyone, \nfor the small businessowner, the manufacturer in Michigan, the farmer, \nthose who are paying high prices through their insurance premium or at \nthe pharmaceutical counter. The time has come to act. We know what to \ndo. Now it is time to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5794-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5794-S5795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair for that clarification. \nI have sought recognition this morning to express my concern that the \nlegislation submitted by the President for homeland security submitted \ntwo days ago to the Congress does not meet the critical need for \ncollection and analysis of intelligence information in one place.\n  Each day there are new disclosures of key information, information \nwhich was known prior to September 11, 2001. If it had been activated \nand put together with other information, this might well have prevented \nthe September 11 attack.\n  This morning's Washington Post has as its major story, in the upper \nright-hand corner, ``NSA Intercepts On Eve of 9/11 Sent a Warning.'' \nThe first sentence reads:\n\n       The National Security Agency intercepted two messages on \n     the eve of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center \n     and the Pentagon warning that something was going to happen \n     the next day.\n\n  If that information had been put together with other information \nwhich was in the files of Federal intelligence agencies but not focused \non, there would have been, I think, an emerging picture providing a \nwarning, not just connecting dots, but a picture which was pretty \nobvious when all of the pieces were put together.\n  The FBI had the now-famous Phoenix report, which had been submitted \nin July 2001 by the Phoenix office, telling about aeronautical training \nto people with backgrounds which indicated potential terrorist \nleanings, aeronautical students with a large picture of Osama bin Laden \nin their room and a background which would have supported the inference \nthat those students in training might well have been put up to \nsomething. If that had been put together with the confession that was \nobtained by a Pakistani terrorist known as Abdul Hakim Murad in 1996, \nwho had connections with al-Qaida, when he told of plans to attack the \nCIA headquarters in Washington by plane and to fly into the White \nHouse, there might have been a pretty sharp focus, especially if linked \nto the information which had been developed by the FBI field office in \nMinneapolis, that there was a man named Zacarias Moussaoui, who had \nterrorist connections to al-Qaida, and that plans were being developed \nand that he was actually to be the twentieth hijacker.\n  That information never came to full fruition because of a failure of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation to move the matter forward for a \nwarrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard testimony from special agent Coleen \nRowley about the difficulties of dealing with the FBI, which requires a \nstandard not in accordance with the law, 51 percent, more probable than \nnot where the standard of a warrant does not require that. Had \nMoussaoui's computer been examined, it would have provided a virtual \nblueprint for what was about to happen.\n  These are very glaring and fundamental defects in our intelligence \nsystem. They have existed for a very long time. We have had a situation \nwhere the Director of Central Intelligence, who is supposed to be in \ncharge of all intelligence, does not have key components of the \nintelligence apparatus under his wing. For example, he does not have \naccess to the National Reconnaissance Office. He does not have \nunfettered access to the National Security Agency, the National Imagery \nand Mapping Agency, and certain special Navy units. This is a \ndeficiency which has gone on for a long time.\n  When I chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee during the 104th \nCongress, I introduced Senate bill 1718. That bill was designed to \ncorrect the deficiency that the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, who nominally and in the public view had access to all of the \nintelligence information, but, in fact, did not have it. My bill, S. \n1718, is only one of many efforts which are currently underway, efforts \nwhich are currently under consideration by the White House. However, \nthere is strong opposition by the Department of Defense and opposition \nby others. I am not characterizing it necessarily as a turf battle. It \nis a battle which has its origin in the concerns of some in the \nDepartment of Defense that the Department of Defense has the \nresponsibility to fight a war and needs access to all of these \nintelligence matters; that is unique control.\n  The reality is that a structure can be worked out so the Department \nof Defense is not deprived of access to any of this information in time \nof war or at any time. However, the Director of Central Intelligence \nought to have it in one coordinated place.\n  Now, when you create a Department of Homeland Security, it is \nobviously very difficult to touch upon matters on the broader picture. \nThat is something that must be done and which must be addressed. When \nthis matter was considered, I raised some of these issues in a meeting \nwhich Senators had with the White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and \nHomeland Security Advisor, Governor Ridge. Recently, there have been \nadditional meetings at the staff level, working together with the White \nHouse staff extensively, one of which was last Friday afternoon. During \nthat meeting, my staff made a specific proposal that on the Department \nof Homeland Security, there should be a repository in one place to \ngather all of this information. The suggestion which we submitted was \nthat there should be a national terrorism assessment center, a concept \ndeveloped by someone who is very experienced in intelligence affairs, \nCharles Battaglia, who spent years in the CIA, as well as the Navy, and \nwho served as majority staff director for the Intelligence Committee \nduring my tenure as chairman during the 104th Congress.\n  The Battaglia proposal to establish a national terrorism assessment \ncenter, in my opinion, goes right to the mark. It would be staffed by \nanalysts who would come from the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency, \nthe National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, and a listing of other Federal agencies, including the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, which would have \naccess to all of this information.\n\n  The bill, which was submitted by the President two days ago to \nestablish the Department of Homeland Security, I say respectfully, does \nnot meet this core critical ingredient. For example, referring to \nintelligence staff, the President's proposal provides at section 201: \nThe Secretary may obtain such material by request.\n  Mr. President, that is hardly the authority that the Secretary of \nHomeland Defense needs to do his job. If he has to ask somebody in \nWashington, DC, for something, it is an enormous uncertainty as to \nwhether he will get it. In fact, it is more probable than not that he \nwill not get it. There is a long trail around here to get information \nfrom anyone. I have seen that in detail in my time trying to conduct \noversight on the FBI or in conducting oversight when I chaired the \nIntelligence Committee. That information just is not forthcoming.\n  The President's bill further provides that the Secretary may enter \ninto ``cooperative arrangements with other executive agencies to share \nsuch material.'' Whether or not there will be such arrangements entered \ninto, and whether the other executive agencies will be agreeable to \nthat, is highly uncertain.\n  The time has long since passed to leave it to the discretion of a \nlarge variety of the Federal bureaucrats as to what they will do on \nintelligence. The time has come for the Congress of the United States \nin legislation signed by the President to establish central authority \nin one place, under one roof, to collect all the information which is \navailable. To do any less is dereliction of our duty. That has not been \ndone. The intelligence community has been stumbling along. America \nstumbled into September 11 because this Congress had not undertaken the \napproach with the strength to resolve all of these jurisdictional \ndisputes and see to\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nit that this information was under one roof.\n  The Congress of the United States has a fundamental responsibility to \nprovide for the security of the United States. When the Judiciary \nCommittee conducts hearings and finds out that the FBI does not have \nthe procedures in place to know what is in the Phoenix report on a \npotential terrorist with Osama bin Laden's picture on his wall, when \nthe Judiciary Committee commits oversight and finds out that the FBI \nMinneapolis office cannot get headquarters to request a warrant under \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because they are applying the \nwrong standard, when the Intelligence Committee conducts oversight on \nthe Director of Central Intelligence and finds his authority lacking \nbecause he does not know what many other intelligence agencies are \ncollecting, and when the National Security Agency has on the eve of \nSeptember 11 specific warnings and these pieces are not put together, \nthe time has come to act.\n  On this legislation, we ought to move ahead with a national terrorism \nassessment center. This information, as I noted earlier, was \ncommunicated by my staff to the White House staff. We did not have it \nprepared in time, but we had it this week in draft form. However, the \nmatter is now before the Congress.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis draft proposal be printed in the Congressional Record. It is by no \nmeans a finished product, however it might be of some help as we move \nahead with hearings on this very important subject in the Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Amendment No.--\n\n   (Purpose: To provide the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \n    Security with timely and objective intelligence assessments on \n   terrorism and actionable intelligence essential to carry out the \n Secretary's duties as assigned, and to refocus the efforts of Federal \n law enforcement (including the FBI) on the collection, analysis, and \n          dissemination of intelligence related to terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I stand to try to enlighten Members \nabout the Yucca Mountain resolution which is going to be before this \nbody. Yesterday, I took to the floor to speak on the current status of \nthe Yucca Mountain debate in the Senate. I bring it to my colleagues' \nattention this measure has been reported by the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and is now ready for consideration by the full \nSenate.\n  There is a process here. I think it is somewhat confusing to Members, \nand hopefully we will get a better understanding when I share my \nanalysis.\n  I want to make sure everyone understands that I certainly support the \nmajority leader's ability to control the floor of the Senate and hence \nthe schedule. I hope the majority leader will bring this issue to the \nfloor shortly. I and others are looking forward to working with him, \nSenator Lott and others, to try to come to an agreement to move the \nYucca Mountain issue. However, should the majority leader choose not to \nbring this up and asks the Republicans to do it, we are prepared to \noblige.\n  The process laid out is unique in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It \nwas intended to eliminate any opportunity to delay, impede, frustrate, \nor obstruct the Senate and House votes on this siting resolution. That \nis the reason this expedited procedure was put into the act.\n  As Senator Craig pointed out last week, this was very specific \nlanguage. It provides that any Senator on either side may move to \nproceed to consideration of the resolution.\n  There is a historical association with these procedures. Back when \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act was debated in 1982, a central question \nwas how to treat an obligation by the State selected for the repository \nif, in fact, the State objected--hence the situation with regard to \nNevada. Nevada was selected. Nevada has rejected the site.\n  Back then there was a Congressman by the name of Moakley, the \nchairman of the House Rules Committee. He was concerned over what he \nperceived as a constitutional issue--single House action--and sought an \napproach that would allow a State to raise an objection but also \nguarantee that a decision would be made without raising constitutional \nquestions. The solution he proposed, and which is included in the \nlegislation, was passage of a joint resolution coupled with expedited \nprocedures that would eliminate any opportunity for obstruction or \ndelay. In other words, trying to make it fair to the State that was \naffected.\n  Moakley's State veto provision was added to the House-Senate \ncompromise bill after Senator Proxmire threatened to filibuster the \nbill unless it was included. Senator Proxmire described the provisions \nas making it ``in order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed \nto consideration of the resolution'' to override the State's veto.\n  That is where we are today on this matter.\n  Further, as a little history, Senator George Mitchell, who was the \nmajority leader at that time, insisted that the language ``should not \nburden the process with dilatory or obstructionist provisions'' and was \nonly accepted in the Senate because we were all assured that there were \nno procedural or other avenues that would prevent the Senate from \nworking its will within the statutory framework.\n  Again, I want to quote Congressman Moakley on that provision when the \nHouse approved the final measure:\n\n       The Rules Committee compromise resolved the issue in a fair \n     manner. We proposed a two-House veto of a State objection but \n     required that both the House and Senate must vote within a \n     short timeframe. So long as the vote is guaranteed, the \n     procedures are identical as a political and parliamentary \n     matter.\n\n  The process, which includes the right of any Senator to make the \nmotion to proceed, is that guarantee.\n  All of this brings me to the point of the majority leader's ability \nto control the flow of legislation in this body. The majority leader \nhas been very forthcoming in his position on the resolution, and I \nunderstand and appreciate that. While I disagree with his position, I \ndo not question his honesty or his integrity. Nor do I wish to hinder \nhis ability to control the floor in normal circumstances.\n\n  This situation, however, is not one in which we often find ourselves. \nIn this rather extraordinary case, we find ourselves governed not by \nthe usual rules and traditions of the Senate but, rather, by a very \nspecific and limited expedited procedure--a procedure set out in law, a \nlaw that was passed by this body.\n  Senator Daschle chooses to call this fast-track procedure--he \nmentioned ``a violation of the Senate rules.'' I choose to call it an \n``exception.'' But whatever it is, whatever you want to call it, it is \nthe same thing. It is a statutory fast track to consider a type of \nmeasure that is not ordinarily before the Senate, nor ordinarily \ntreated in this manner. Extraordinary circumstances often call for an \nextraordinary procedure, and I think that is what we have before us.\n  Despite what Senator Daschle has indicated in a press conference \nearlier this week:\n\n       This whole procedure, as you know--we locked in a procedure \n     many, many years ago--I believe it was in 1982--\n\n  And he continued later in the statement:\n\n       But this is what we are faced with. And so given the fact \n     that we're faced with a very un-Senate-like procedure, I have \n     no objection to that concept. (Here he is referring to a \n     Republican making the motion to proceed) in terms of who \n     would raise the issue on the floor.\n\n  Certainly I appreciate the leader's recognition that this measure \nmust come up, and should the majority leader not make the motion, \nobviously some other Member will. If that is what will happen, it does \nnot in any manner undercut the authority of our majority leader. No \nSenator, however, has come running to interrupt the present schedule of \nproceedings by bringing up this resolution.\n  We have, in fact, had discussions between the majority and minority \nleaders. We would like to enter into a unanimous consent agreement to \nminimize any potential disruption to the Senate, but that may not be \npossible, given the objection of the Senators from Nevada.\n  I quote from an article that appeared in one of the publications that \nI was given, in the ``Hill Briefs,'' a reference by Emily Pierce, \nCongressional Quarterly staff writer, on 6-19 of this year, third \nparagraph:\n\n       And Senator Ensign and Senator Reid said they aimed to \n     persuade enough Members of both parties to reject the \n     procedural motion, contending it would set a bad precedent. \n     They contend the majority leader should control the agenda \n     rather than leave that task to another Senator.\n\n  That is really incidental, but I think it points out that we have two \nSenators from Nevada who rightly are going to object to moving this \nmatter before the Senate.\n  Barring what would be any further delays, we can find an appropriate \ntime that is convenient to the schedule of our two leaders to resolve \nthis matter. As to who makes the motion to proceed, I do not know that \nit really matters very much.\n  When I was chairman of the Energy Committee, I occasionally came to \nthe floor to move to proceed to some measure reported from the \ncommittee. I certainly think it would be equally appropriate for our \npresent chairman to make the motion to proceed to the consideration of \nthis resolution. However, he may not want to do so.\n  I commend Senator Bingaman for an excellent committee report and the \ndeliberate approach that he took to the consideration of the \nresolution. I commend him. But the bottom line is that, if the majority \nleader does not want to make the motion, for substantive or whatever \nreason, the statute explicitly deals with the situation to ensure that \nthe Senate can take action.\n  As I have said before, the State veto and the congressional joint \nresolution are extraordinary provisions. A vote on the resolution is \nessential to the compromise in the agreement of 1982 to go to a two-\nHouse resolution.\n  It offers no precedent for any other situation and by its terms is \nlimited to this specific situation. There are enough substantive issues \nthat we can discuss. We do not need to suggest that somehow an explicit \nprovision in a\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\nstatute should be ignored and does not mean precisely what it says.\n  It is time we focus on substance and I sincerely hope that the two \nleaders can find a time before the July recess for us to take up this \nimportant Yucca Mountain resolution.\n  I would note that all debate is limited to 10 hours, so it would be \npossible to take up the resolution one afternoon or evening and have a \nvote the next morning. That would create very little inconvenience to \nthe leaders' schedule, but I look forward to whatever they can work \nout.\n  It is time for either the majority leader or his designee--perhaps \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee who introduced the resolution and \nso ably guided it through committee--to make the motion to proceed and \nestablish, under the rules of the Senate and the procedures laid out in \nthe act, a time and date certain when the Senate can debate and vote on \nthis resolution--as the act intended.\n  This matter is long overdue. It is the obligation of this body. The \nHouse of Representatives has done its job, and the Senate should do its \njob.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5798-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have heard my friend, the distinguished \njunior Senator from Alaska speak, as I have heard the Senator from \nIdaho speak on several occasions during the last few days. I have \nchosen not to respond because what my friends have spoken about we have \nheard many times.\n  We have a situation on which the American people are now focusing. \nThe focus for many years has been whether Yucca Mountain is a suitable \nsite for a nuclear waste depository. Scientifically, that has fallen \napart for many reasons. One is that under the statute, Yucca Mountain \nand/or any other site was supposed to be a facility that would \ngeologically protect the American people from nuclear waste. Yucca \nMountain didn't work. They have learned that geologically it can't do \nthat because of the fault lines, because of the water tables, and \nbecause of many other facts. They decided to use Yucca Mountain anyway. \nBut they would build an encasement and put it down in the hole. They \nwould have the waste in containers in Yucca Mountain.\n  The point is that now people are no longer focusing on Yucca \nMountain. They are not focusing on Yucca Mountain because they have \ncome to the realization they have to get it there some way. You are not \ngoing to wake up one morning and suddenly find thousands of tons of \nnuclear waste from around the country from different reactors there. \nNo. You will have to haul it there. We have learned they are going to \nhaul it by water, by train, and by truck. They can haul all they want. \nBut the waste is always going to be at these reactor sites. You can't \nget rid of it. You are producing it all of the time.\n  When they take a spent fuel rod out, it has to stay onsite for 5 \nyears before they can touch it. Then they have to determine how to move \nit.\n  We have known since September 11 that we have a lot of difficulty \nmoving anything dangerous on the highways of this country. The most \npoisonous substances known to man are in these spent fuel rods.\n  There is a Web site--www.mapscience.org. It has been up since last \nTuesday. You can punch in an address--whether it is Georgia, whether it \nis Nevada, Virginia, Maryland, or Rhode Island. You will find \ninstantaneously how close nuclear waste will travel to your home \naddress or any other address you enter.\n  Since Tuesday, we have had about 100,000 people who have focused on \nthat and who have made hits on that site. People from all over this \ncountry are now realizing that nuclear waste is not a Nevada problem, \nit is their problem.\n  My friends from Alaska and Idaho can come here and talk all they \nwant. But the people who are eminent scientists and who have enough \nexperience dealing with transportation--for example, the former head of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board--agree that this is a bad \nidea. Jim Hall, the former head of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard has done editorial boards, and he is an expert on transportation \nsafety. He said you shouldn't do it. You can't do it. People say: OK, \nbig shot. What do you want to do with it? That is very easy to answer. \nLeave it where it is, where there are storage containers, where you can \nencase and cover them with cement. There are all kinds of ways to \nprotect them onsite, but you can't do those things when you haul the \nwaste. The casks become too heavy.\n  The majority leader is absolutely right. He does not like this. He \nthinks it is wrong headed. People have been wined and dined by the \nnuclear power industry for 20 years. One of the great trips they take \nis to Las Vegas. They say: Come on. We will show you Yucca Mountain.\n\n  They whip them out to the mountain for a few hours and put them up in \nfancy hotels in Las Vegas for a weekend or so. They have had hundreds \nof staff out there to look at this. We know how powerful staff is. They \ncome back and say there is a great repository out there.\n  I acknowledge that my job is easier than my friend, the junior \nSenator from Nevada. My job is easier because this battle has been \ngoing on for a while. President Clinton vetoed a proposal to change \nenvironmental standards at Yucca Mountain. That veto was upheld by a \nvote of the Senate--33 Democrats and 2 Republicans.\n  They also tried to establish Yucca Mountain as a temporary place--an \ninterim storage site. President Clinton interceded. That was soundly \ndefeated.\n  My job is easier than my friend from Nevada. I am working with people \nwho have not voted against this in the past, and who have voted for my \nposition in the past. We had a President who, even though he had a \nnuclear plant in Arkansas, understood.\n  But my friends on this side of the aisle must do the right thing. I \ndon't say this negatively. I get campaign contributions also. Even \nthough I get campaign contributions, that isn't how I have to vote. \nThey give me that money because they think I am an honorable person \ntrying to do the right thing.\n  The fact that for 20-odd years millions of dollars have been given to \ncampaigns around this country, people have to set that aside and do the \nright thing. It is not easy to do. But they have to do the right thing. \nI am not in any way trying to demagog the issue other than to say there \nare occasions when people have to do the right thing.\n  For my friend, John Ensign, and for the people of this country, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle must do what is fair and \nunderstand that the transportation of nuclear waste is not safe.\n  The Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said last week if \nthis bill does not go forward and the veto of the Governor of Nevada is \nupheld, that it is no big deal. We can and will leave the nuclear waste \nwhere it is. That is what the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory \nMission said last week.\n  The former member of the NRC, Dr. Victor Gilinsky, said at an Energy \nCommittee hearing: I don't understand what the rush is. They can't \ntransport the stuff in Europe. They have tried. This week they had a \nbig demonstration where people chained themselves to the railroad \ntracks. Basically, they stopped the trains from hauling it. Germany has \ngiven up on it.\n  The mad rush is because the nuclear power lobby is extremely \npowerful. But for the good of the people of this country, whether they \nhave a nuclear reactor in their State or not, you can't haul it safely. \nIt is better left where it is until we find the right technological \nsolution.\n  I guess the reason I came down is that I have just kind of had it up \nto here on all of these speeches about what a righteous thing they are \ndoing by bringing this forward. It is the wrong thing to do. It is not \na Nevada issue. It is an issue that affects everybody in this country.\n  For anyone to even suggest or intimate that this matter should now be\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nreported to the Senate in a matter of a minute or two, and the Defense \nauthorization bill should be set aside to take it up--we are talking \nabout giving our men and women in the military additional resources to \nfight the war on terror and to make this country secure. To even think \nwe would set this aside for that is, to me, distasteful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5799-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2514, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2514) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2003 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Feingold Amendment No. 3915, to extend for 2 years \n     procedures to maintain fiscal accountability and \n     responsibility.\n       Reid (for Conrad) Amendment No. 3916 (to Amendment No. \n     3915), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nfiscal year 2003 Defense authorization bill. I believe this bill \nprovides the needed resources to compensate and to reward the men and \nwomen in uniform who are doing an extraordinary job protecting this \ncountry across the globe and here at home. I also think the bill will \nprovide the funding and the direction to continue the transformation of \nour military forces so that we are able to meet the new emerging \nthreats of this new century.\n  This year, I again served as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee. \nThis subcommittee focuses on strategic systems, space systems, missile \ndefense, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance programs, and \nthe national security functions of the Department of Energy. The \nsubcommittee and the full committee held seven hearings dealing with \nmatters in the subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  The issues addressed by the subcommittee cover a wide range of \nsubjects. These issues include the Nuclear Posture Review, which the \nDefense Department issued in December, which covers our strategic \nnuclear plan; the creation of a new Missile Defense Agency, which \nreplaced the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization; increased concerns \nabout the security of nuclear weapons and materials; the need to \nsubstantially restructure several space programs; and proposed \nreductions to the number of deployed nuclear weapons in the context of \nthe new and very commendable agreement with Russia.\n  Let me turn, first, to the issues of strategic systems.\n  The strategic systems that fall within the jurisdiction of the \nStrategic Subcommittee include long-range bombers, the land-based and \nsea-based ballistic missile forces, and the broad range of matters \npertaining to nuclear weapons in the Department of Defense.\n  In the area of strategic systems, the bill, as reported, adds $23 \nmillion to keep the Minuteman III ICBM upgrade programs and the effort \nto retire the Peacekeeper on track, as has been requested by the Air \nForce in their list of unfunded requirements.\n  The Peacekeeper and the Minuteman III missiles are both land-based \nmissile systems. When the Peacekeeper is retired, Minuteman III will be \nthe only land-based system, so it is very important to ensure, for our \nnuclear deterrence, that the process of retirement of Peacekeeper and \nmodernization of Minuteman III continues at the appropriate pace.\n\n  Under the terms of the Nuclear Posture Review, the Department of \nDefense plans to eliminate all 50 of the Peacekeeper missiles and \ndownload the 500 Minuteman III missiles from their current multi-\nwarhead configuration to a single warhead. This is a significant step \nin reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons and one of the major \nreasons that the United States and Russia were able to come to an \nagreement.\n  Reducing the number of warheads on the Minuteman III to one warhead \nper missile, and removing all of the warheads from retiring Peacekeeper \nmissiles, is a key to achieving the goals of a reduced number of \ndeployed missiles that are at the heart of the agreement with the \nUnited States and Russia.\n  The commitment is to reduce the number of deployed nuclear warheads \nto the range of 1,700 to 2,200 from the present approximately 6,000 \ndeployed warheads.\n  Also, this will provide more stability, as missiles with single \nwarheads, in the context of deterrence policy, are a more stable \nelement than multi-warhead missiles.\n  These are all encouraging developments, but it is necessary to keep \nthis process on track by the additional funds which we have added to \nthis legislation.\n  The subcommittee is also concerned about ensuring that the long-range \nbomber fleet is modernized and maintained. These bombers, particularly \nthe B-2 and the B-52, have repeatedly showed their usefulness in \nconflicts from Desert Storm to present operations. There are no plans \nto replace these bombers in the near future. In fact, in 2000, when the \nAir Force last reviewed the projected lifetime of these bombers, they \ndetermined they could rely on these bombers for an additional 30 years. \nThe reality is, the pilots who will retire the B-52 and B-2 bombers \nhave not yet been born.\n  We have to maintain these systems, upgrade their electronics and \navionics, to make sure they are still a valuable and decisive part of \nour forces.\n  This bill would include an additional $28 million to address \nshortfalls in the B-2 and B-52 bomber programs, and also approves the \nrequest by the Department of Defense to reduce and consolidate the B-1 \nfleet.\n  Adding these additional funds is absolutely necessary if the Air \nForce projections are correct, and we will have these systems--the B-2 \nand the B-52--in our inventory for an additional 30 years.\n  Turning to the area of space, another jurisdiction of the Strategic \nSubcommittee, we considered a variety of very important Defense \nDepartment space programs. These programs include satellite programs \nthat provide communications, weather, global positioning systems, early \nwarning, and other satellites for defense and national security \npurposes.\n  Space programs are critical to the effective use of our Nation's \nmilitary forces, and each day they grow in importance. This is a very \nimportant aspect of our deliberations.\n  We also included in our consideration the ability of the United \nStates to continue to effectively launch space vehicles by looking at \nthe east coast ranges in Florida and the west coast ranges in \nCalifornia.\n  The bill includes funding at the requested levels for most of the \nDepartment of Defense space programs. There are some exceptions, \nhowever. The committee has added $29 million to continue to improve the \nreadiness and operations safety at the east coast and west coast space \nlaunch and range facilities. If we cannot launch vehicles into space, \nwe cannot ensure that we have the appropriate constellation of \nsatellites to communicate, to provide intelligence resources, to \nprovide global positioning signals--all the things that are critical to \nthe success of our military forces in the field. These ranges are \nimportant, and these additional funds will upgrade their ability to \ncontinue to play a vital role in our national security.\n\n  The bill also includes reductions in certain space programs. One of \nthese programs is the Space-Based Infrared Radar-High or SBIRS-High \nsatellite program. This is a satellite program which is critical to \nreplacing an older and aging system of satellites that provides early \nwarning of missile launches and other activities of concern to the \nUnited States.\n  The worldwide reach of this satellite system is key to its ability to \nwarn of any launches and to provide other critical intelligence. But \nthis program has been plagued with serious problems. It is overbudget \nand years behind schedule. It is in the process of being restructured \nby the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\n  Reflecting this restructuring, the bill reduces the over $800 million \nbudget request for SBIRS-High by $100 million so that this \nrestructuring can literally catch up with the funding stream. I think \nthis is an appropriate way to continue to maintain the defense \ncapabilities of the United States while recognizing a program that is \nin the midst of serious restructuring by the Department of Defense.\n  The bill also reduces the requested funding for another satellite \nthat has had a troubled history; and that is the Advanced Extremely \nHigh Frequency, or Advanced EHF satellite. This satellite program is \ndesigned to ensure that the Department of Defense and the military \nservices will retain the ability to have a reliable and survivable \ncommunication. Advanced EHF, like SBIRS-High, is a replacement for a \ncurrent system. But, here again, the program is in serious trouble, \noverbudget and behind schedule. It, too, is being structured. This \nrestructuring made $95 million available that the Air Force requested \nbe shifted to other high-priority programs. And we have followed their \nadvice and their suggestion.\n  Space programs are critical to the operations of the U.S. military. \nAs I indicated, with each day, they become more and more critical. But \nseveral of these programs, not only the SBIRS-High program and the \nAdvanced EHF communications satellite program, are experiencing \nsignificant problems with cost growth and schedule slippage.\n  Some of the problems with the space programs appear to be connected \nwith the oversight and management of the programs. To address this, the \nbill includes a legislative provision to ensure the adequate oversight \nof space programs. This provision would direct the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense to maintain oversight of space programs and would \nrequire the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan on how oversight by \nOSD and the joint staff will be accomplished. This provision is \nincluded largely as a result of testimony before the Strategic \nSubcommittee in March of 2002 and will ensure that OSD remains and \nretains an oversight role for space programs.\n  Under Secretary of the Air Force Peter Teets, when testifying before \nthe subcommittee, stated that the Air Force is facing significant \nchallenges in several of our most important space programs. This bill \nattempts to address these concerns by ensuring that adequate oversight \nby the Department of Defense is maintained.\n  Let me again stress the importance of these programs. We have all \nbeen amazed by the extraordinary success of our military forces in \nAfghanistan. If you listened to the reports of the special forces \ntroops conducting these operations on the ground, one of the key \nweapons they had was not a cannon or an M-16, it was a global-\npositioning, range-finding, targeting device which will operate \nmagnificently as long as we have GPS satellites and comparable \nsatellites in the air. So communications and satellites are critical to \nthe special forces soldier on the ground, the aviator in the air, every \nmember of our military forces. We are endeavoring to maintain, to \nenhance, and to secure the future of our space operations within this \nlegislation.\n  Let me turn now to another aspect of our responsibilities. That is \nthe intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance functions. This area \nincludes programs such as the Global Hawk and the Predator unmanned \naerial vehicles, or UAVs. We have long supported these very innovative \nand sophisticated weapons. They have shown their worth, particularly \nPredator in Afghanistan, and therefore the committee recommends fully \nfunding the administration's request to accelerate the development and \nprocurement of UAVs.\n  Another area we have supported--and in fact we provide additional \nsupport in the legislation--is the acquisition of commercial satellite \nimagery by the Department of Defense. The bill includes an additional \n$30 million to authorize the Department to buy commercially available \nimagery to supplement and complement the imagery which we collect \nthrough our own assets. This will enhance our ability to conduct \noperations. This is an initiative strongly supported by Senator Allard, \nranking member of the committee. We join in his support of this very \nworthy enterprise and endeavor.\n  Let me turn to some of the aspects in the subcommittee that touch \nupon the responsibilities of the Department of Energy when it comes to \nnuclear weapons. We include several provisions addressing DOE programs. \nThe first would ensure that Congress continues to exercise its \noversight responsibility with respect to funding for future nuclear \nweapons activities.\n  This is absolutely important. In December the administration released \na Nuclear Posture Review. This Nuclear Posture Review has been \ncriticized, challenged, identified as perhaps blurring the line between \nnuclear and conventional responses. This is an area where there is much \nconcern. Again, it reinforces the need for Congress to be informed and \nresponsive to evolving policy with respect to development \nand deployment and use, potentially--we hope never--of nuclear weapons.\n\n  If you look at the Nuclear Posture Review, you will see throughout a \nnew triad which includes offensive strike systems which are described \nas including both nuclear and nonnuclear.\n  You will see that in the context and literal words of the Nuclear \nPosture Review, they have talked about ``in setting requirements for \nnuclear strike capabilities, distinctions can be made among the \ncontingencies for which the United States must be prepared. \nContingencies can generally be categorized as immediate, potential, or \nunexpected.''\n  In the realm of immediate, potential, or unexpected contingencies, \nthey list countries such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya. \nThese are countries which may be endeavoring to develop nuclear weapons \nbut at this time are not declared nuclear powers, raising the issue of \nwhether we would abandon a long-term policy that we would not use \nnuclear weapons as a first strike on a nonnuclear power unless they \nattack us in conjunction with a nuclear power. This uncertainty, \nambiguity, exists. Perhaps it has always existed, but it underscores \nthe need for Congress to be informed, to be part of this evolving \ndiscussion and debate about nuclear policy.\n  Therefore, we would ask that the Department of Energy specifically \nrequest funds for any new or modified nuclear weapons. There is no \nmoney in this budget for such weapons, but I think at this juncture we \nhave to go on record to ask for that type of specific information and \nnot rely upon finding it buried in some larger account. It is an \nimportant issue. It is a critical issue. After the tensions between \nPakistan and India, that have not yet subsided totally, no one needs to \nbe reminded about the horrendous impact of the potential use of a \nnuclear weapon. Therefore, it is vitally important that this Congress \nbe informed of any potential developments of new weapons by the United \nStates.\n  The budget request did include $15.5 million for a feasibility study \nof a robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon. The bill denies funding \nfor this purpose and directs the Secretaries of Energy and Defense to \nsubmit a report to Congress setting forth the military requirements, \nthe characteristics and types of targets the nuclear earth penetrator \nwould hold at risk, the employment policies of such a nuclear earth \npenetrator, and an assessment of the capabilities of conventional \nweapons against these potential targets.\n  Once again, in the context of a statement by administration officials \nabout the, perhaps, rejection of long-term policy, the nonfirst use \nagainst nonnuclear powers, and the ambiguity that has been created, it \nis essential to stop and look at justification for creating this weapon \nsystem.\n  We already have a nuclear earth penetrator. It is the B61-11; it has \nbeen publicly reported. We have the system in place. It is incumbent \nupon the Departments of Energy and Defense to say why we need to modify \nanother system to do a similar job.\n  I will also point out there has been some suggestion that what the \nDepartment of Energy might be working on is a small mini-nuke that \nwould be less troublesome in terms of radiation, in terms of the \nimpact. Quite seriously, once we cross the nuclear threshold, the size \nof the weapon may be less important than the fact that we have crossed \nthe threshold.\n  From the candidates that might be chosen to modify for this robust \nnuclear earth penetrator, these are very large weapons, hundreds of \nkilotons, at\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nleast six or seven times the destructive force that was used upon \nHiroshima. We have to be very careful. The bill goes ahead and denies \nthe funds and asks the Department of Energy to justify with the report \nseveral parameters which are necessary before they go forward, if they \ndo go forward.\n  The last DOE provision I would like to speak about is a provision \nthat would focus additional resources, $100 million, in cleanup efforts \nto clean up DOE sites throughout the country that have been polluted by \nthe nuclear activities going back more than 50 years. It is essential \nto make our commitment to communities throughout this country that have \nhosted DOE facilities and now see the ground around them literally \ncontaminated, in many cases by nuclear operations. This is very \nimportant.\n  Let me turn to one of the most contentious and challenging issues \nbefore the subcommittee. That is the issue of ballistic missile \ndefense. I want to take some time and go into some detail because there \nare misconceptions and misinformation about what the subcommittee did \nand what the committee finally approved.\n  Let me start with the very broad picture. The administration \nrequested $7.6 billion for missile defense. The committee recommends \n$6.8 billion, a reduction of $812 million, or 11 percent. I should \npoint out that the budget for missile defense has grown dramatically in \nthe last several years. We are still funding this program at a very \nrobust $6.8 billion. The $812 million reduction in ballistic missile \ndefense was transferred to more immediate and pressing needs in the \nview of the committee.\n  The most significant, in terms of dollars, was $690 million for \nadditional shipbuilding, which will provide advanced procurement for a \nnew submarine, a new destroyer, and a new troop transport ship, all \nimmediate and vital needs for our military forces.\n  Some of the additional money would be used to increase the security \nof the Department of Energy facilities. Again, after the last several \nweeks, where we thought an al-Qaida operative was making his way to the \nUnited States to steal radioactive material to construct a ``dirty'' \nbomb, the need for enhanced security at DOE sites, as well as many \nother sites that have radiological material, cannot be underestimated.\n  Let me talk in general terms about the ballistic missile threat and \nthe programs that are evolving to meet that threat. First, historically \nand generally, we have categorized this in two ways: short-range \nthreats and the longer range threat of the intercontinental ballistic \nmissile. The reality is that many countries have short-range missiles, \nsome of which are capable of mounting chemical and biological warheads. \nThey are an immediate present threat to U.S. forces deployed throughout \nthe world and to U.S. allies throughout the world.\n  Intercontinental ballistic missiles are those, obviously, that travel \nlong distances and are designed to strike the homeland of the United \nStates. Those two distinctions have formed most of our programmatic \nresponse for many decades.\n  The administration has come in and, in some respects, blurred the \nlines between these two distinctions. Rather than the traditional \ndistinction between theater missile and national missile defense, \nbetween the short- and medium-range missiles and the longer range \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, they have talked about creating a \nmissile defense consisting of the boost phase defense systems--those \nsystems designed to strike a missile when it leaves the launch pad, in \nthe 2 or 3 minutes before it gets into the upper atmosphere; in fact, \noutside of the atmosphere in some cases--a midcourse phase, as the term \nindicates, which would destroy the missile in the middle of its flight; \nand the terminal phase, which is the final point where the missile is \nheading toward its target, coming down rapidly towards its target.\n  Now, there is a certain logic to this. I have to be fair about that. \nIf one looks at defense in other contexts, such as the more terrestrial \ncontexts of a land battle, defense in depth is a watchword--long-range \nfires, intermediate fires, and close fires. So there is a logic to \nthis, and it might be unwitting, but there is a blurring and distortion \nthat I think can be misinterpreted--and I think it has been in many \ncases--with respect to the actual programs we are trying to develop and \nthe progress on those programs.\n  One case in point is a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, on \nJune 18, where it talks about discussions by General Kadish, about the \nNavy theater-wide missile system, on which the Journal opined in this \narticle:\n\n       The move would represent the first deployment of a \n     defensive missile shield since a system was first proposed by \n     President Reagan in the 1980s.\n\n  What General Kadish was talking about was a theater missile, not a \nnational missile system. In point of fact, the PAC-3 system, a land \nbased theater system, is being operationally tested now and likely will \nbe deployed. Certainly it is further along in development than this \nproposed sea based system.\n  This type of blurring of the lines in recalibration and renaming of \nsystems I think has created a lot of misunderstanding. Hopefully, we \ncan add some clarity today.\n  As I mentioned before, theater ballistic missiles have long \nthreatened forward deployed U.S. forces. For years we have confronted \nthe potential of a real-time missile attack in North Korea and in other \nplaces. Long-range missiles were the source of our long and, \nfortunately, stalemated cold war with the Soviet Union. They had the \ncapacity to fire missiles intercontinentally. We were able to wait them \nout or, through deterrence, through our strategic policy, we were able \nto bring the cold war to a conclusion, and also to have a situation in \nwhich now we are making real progress with Russia in terms of strategic \narms control. So this distinction between theater missiles and ICBMs is \nsignificant.\n  I think it is appropriate at this point to try to go through the list \nof the systems which have been developed, which we have been \ndeveloping, and systems that are the underpinning of this new \nconstellation of missile defenses the administration talks about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article by Philip Coyle, \nformer director of operational test and evaluation in the Department of \nDefense, in the Arms Control Today of May 2002. It summarizes in \nexcellent detail the systems we are talking about today.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Arms Control Today, May 2002]\n\n            Rhetoric or Reality? Missile Defense Under Bush\n\n                           (By Philip Coyle)\n\n       Since it assumed office, the administration of President \n     George W. Bush has made missile defense one of its top \n     priorities, giving it prominence in policy, funding, and \n     organization.\n       First, the administration outlined an ambitious set of \n     goals that extend well beyond the Clinton administration's \n     missile defense aims. In early January 2002, Secretary of \n     Defense Donald Rumsfeld described the administration's top \n     missile defense objectives his way: ``First, to defend the \n     U.S., deployed forces, allies, and friends. Second, to employ \n     a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that layers \n     defenses to intercept missiles in all phases of their flight \n     (i.e., boost, midcourse, and terminal) against all ranges of \n     threats. Third, to enable the Services to field elements of \n     the overall BMDS as soon as practicable.''\n       Then, in its nuclear posture review, the administration \n     outlined the specific elements of a national missile defense \n     that it wants to have ready between 2003 and 2008: an air-\n     based laser to shoot down missiles of all ranges during boost \n     phase; a rudimentary ground-based midcourse system, a sea-\n     based system with rudimentary midcourse capability against \n     short- and medium-range threats; terminal defenses against \n     long-range ICBMs capable of reaching the United States; and a \n     system of satellites to track enemy missiles and distinguish \n     re-entry vehicles from decoys.\n       Finally, to speed implementation, the administration has \n     taken a number of tangible steps. It announced on December \n     13, 2001, that the United States would withdraw from the 1972 \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, ostensibly because the \n     treaty was restricting testing of mobile missile defenses \n     against y026ICBMs. In its first defense budget, the \n     administration requested a 57 percent increase in funding for \n     missile defense--from $5.3 billion to $8.3 billion, of which \n     it received $7.8 billion. Then, Rumsfeld reorganized the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization into the new Missile \n     Defense Agency, cancelled the internal Pentagon documents \n     that had established the program's developmental goals, and \n     changed the program's goal from being able to field a \n     complete system against specific targets to simply being able \n     to field various missile defense capabilities as they become \n     available.\n       All in all, a lot has happened in missile defense in the \n     first year or so of the Bush administration. But have these \n     actions brought\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\n     the United States any closer to realizing its missile defense \n     goals, especially deployment of a national missile defense? \n     And what elements, if any, of a national missile defense \n     capability might it be possible for the United States to \n     deploy by 2008, as called for in the nuclear posture review?\n       Despite the Bush administration's push for missile defense, \n     the only system likely to be ready by 2008 is a ground-based \n     theater missile defense intended to counter short-range \n     targets--i.e., a system to defend troops in the field. Before \n     Bush leaves office, the only system that could conceivably be \n     ready to defend the United States itself is the ground-based \n     midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration. None \n     of the other elements mentioned in the nuclear posture review \n     as possible defenses against strategic ballistic missiles is \n     likely to be available by 2008.\n       To understand why, let us examine each of the missile \n     defense programs--starting with the short-range, theater \n     missile defense systems and moving to the longer-range, \n     strategic systems--to see what has happened since the Bush \n     administration took office 16 months ago. The results suggest \n     that the Bush administration should not base its foreign \n     policy on the assumption that during its tenure it will be \n     able to deploy defenses to protect the United States from \n     strategic missiles.\n\n\n                        Theater Missile Defenses\n\n       Each of the U.S. military services has been pursuing \n     tactical missile defense programs designed to defend U.S. \n     troops overseas. None of these programs was designed to \n     defend the United States against ICBM attacks, and none has \n     any current capability to do so. However, the administration \n     hopes to be able to apply some of the technology from these \n     service programs to a layered national defense capable of \n     defending the U.S. homeland. (For an explanation of the \n     various stages of development discussed below, see the box \n     below.)\n     PAC-3\n       The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) is a tactical \n     system designed to defend overseas U.S. and allied troops in \n     a relatively small area against short-range missile threats \n     (such as Scuds), enemy aircraft, and cruise missiles. \n     Developmentally, it is the most advanced U.S. missile defense \n     system, and a small number have been made available for \n     deployment although testing has not yet been completed.\n       PAC-3 flight testing began in 1997. From 1997 to 2002, 11 \n     developmental flight tests were conducted, including four \n     flight intercept tests with two or three targets being \n     attempted at once. Most of these tests were successful, but \n     in two of the tests one of the targets was not intercepted. \n     In February, PAC-3 began initial operational testing, in \n     which soldiers, not contractors, operate the system. Three \n     operational tests have been conducted, all with multiple \n     targets. In each, one of the targets has been missed or one \n     of the interceptors has failed.\n       A year ago, PAC-3 was planned to begin full-rate production \n     at the end of 2001. However, problems with system reliability \n     and difficulties in flight intercept tests have delayed that \n     schedule. This means that full-rate production likely will be \n     delayed until more stressing ``follow-on'' operational tests \n     can be conducted against targets flying in a wide range of \n     altitudes and trajectories. In March, Lieutenant General \n     Ronald Kadish, who heads U.S. missile defense programs, \n     testified to Congress that the full-rate production decision \n     would be made toward the end of 2002 (before operational \n     testing has been completed), representing a delay of about a \n     year since last year. The full system will be deployed once \n     all operational testing has been completed, perhaps around \n     2005.\n       A future version of PAC-3 is being considered for terminal \n     defense of the United States. However, PAC-3 was not designed \n     to counter long-range threats, and no flight intercept tests \n     have been conducted to demonstrate how it might be \n     incorporated in a terminal defense layer. Further, the ground \n     area that can be defended by PAC-3 is so small that it would \n     take scores of systems to defend just the major U.S. cities. \n     A version of PAC-3 that could be effective in a national \n     missile defense is probably a decade away.\n     THAAD\n       The Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system is \n     designed to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles in \n     their terminal phase. THAAD would be used to protect forward-\n     deployed troops overseas as well as nearby civilian \n     populations and infrastructure. THAAD is to defend a larger \n     area against longer-range threats than PAC-3, but it is not \n     designed to protect the United States from ICBMs.\n       From 1995 to 1999, 11 developmental flight tests were \n     performed, including eight in which an intercept was \n     attempted. After the first six of those flight intercept \n     tests failed, the program was threatened with cancellation. \n     Finally, in 1999, THAAD had two successful flight intercept \n     tests. The THAAD program has not attempted an intercept test \n     since then, instead focusing on the difficult task or \n     developing a new, more reliable, higher-performance missile \n     than the one used in early flight tests.\n       A year ago, full-rate production was scheduled to begin in \n     2007 or 2008, but because there were no intercept tests in \n     2000 or 2001, that schedule has likely slipped two years or \n     more. In fact, no flight intercept test is scheduled until \n     2004, and it is therefore unlikely that the first THAAD \n     system will be deployed before 2010.\n       The Bush administration is considering THAAD for use in a \n     layered national missile defense system. Conceptually, THAAD \n     might be used in conjunction with PAC-3 as part of a terminal \n     defense, or it could be deployed overseas to intercept enemy \n     missiles in the boost phase. However, in its current \n     configuration THAAD is incapable of performing these \n     missions--even once it has met its Army requirements for \n     theater missile defense--and therefore a role for THAAD in \n     national missile defense is probably more than a decade away.\n     Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense\n       The Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense was the \n     sea-based equivalent of PAC-3. The Navy Area system was being \n     designed to defend forward-deployed Navy ships against \n     relatively short-range threats. But in December 2001 the \n     program was cancelled because its cost and schedule overruns \n     exceeded the limits defined by law. (Ironically, the \n     cancellation came just one day after President Bush announced \n     that the United States would pull out of the ABM Treaty \n     because its missile defense testing was advanced enough to be \n     bumping up against the constraints of the treaty.)\n       The Navy still wants to be able to defend its ships against \n     missile attack, and the program will most likely to be \n     restructured and reinstated once the Navy decides on a new \n     approach. In the meantime, the Navy Area program is slipping \n     with each day that passes. As with PAC-3, the Bush \n     administration has considered extending the Navy Area system \n     to play a role in the terminal segment of a layered national \n     missile defense. However, at this point the program is too \n     poorly defined to allow speculation about when it could \n     accomplish such a demanding mission.\n     Navy Theater Wide\n       The Navy Theater Wide program was originally intended to \n     defend an area larger than that to be covered by the Navy \n     Area system--that is, aircraft carrier battle groups and \n     nearby territory and civilian populations--against medium \n     range missiles during their midcourse phase. In this sense, \n     Navy Theater Wide is the sea-based equivalent of THAAD.\n       In January, the Navy Theater Wide program conducted its \n     first successful flight intercept test, but a dozen or more \n     developmental flight tests will be required before it is \n     ready for realistic operational testing. About a year ago, \n     full-rate production was scheduled for spring 2007, meaning \n     that the system could be deployed before the end of the \n     decade.\n       But since then, the Pentagon has given new priority to a \n     sea-based role in defending the U.S. homeland. Navy Theater \n     Wide was not designed to shoot down ICBMs, but the Bush \n     administration has restructured the program so that it aims \n     to produce a sea-based midcourse segment and/or a sea-based \n     boost-phase segment of national missile defense.\n       Either mission will require a new missile that is twice as \n     fast as any existing version of the Standard Missile, which \n     the system now uses; a new, more powerful Aegis radar system \n     to track targets; a new launch structure to accommodate the \n     new, larger missiles; and probably new ships. As a result, \n     the Navy Theater Wide program requires a great deal of new \n     development. It is unlikely that Navy Theater Wide will be \n     ready for realistic operational testing until late in this \n     decade, and it will not be ready for realistic operational \n     demonstration in a layered national missile defense for \n     several years after that.\n     Airborne Laser\n       The Airborne Laser (ABL) is a program to develop a high-\n     power chemical laser that will fit inside a Boeing 747 \n     aircraft. It is the most technically challenging of any of \n     the theater missile defense programs, involving toxic \n     materials, advanced optics, and the coordination of three \n     additional lasers on-board for tracking, targeting, and beam \n     correction. The first objective of the program is to be able \n     to shoot down short-range enemy missiles. Later, it is hoped \n     the ABL program will play a role in national missile defense \n     by destroying strategic missiles in their boost phase.\n       The ABL has yet to be flight-tested. About a year ago, \n     full-rate production of the ABL was scheduled for 2008. The \n     plan was to build seven aircraft, each estimated to cost \n     roughly $500 million. At that time, the first shoot-down of a \n     tactical missile was scheduled for 2003. Recently, the ABL \n     program office announced that the first shoot-down of a \n     tactical missile had been delayed to later 2004 because of \n     many problems with the basic technology of high-power \n     chemical lasers--about a one-year slip since last year and \n     about a three-year slip since 1998. Accordingly, full-rate \n     production probably cannot be started before 2010, and the \n     cost will likely exceed $1 billion per aircraft.\n       Assuming all this can be done, it is important to note that \n     the ABL presents significant operational challenges. The ABL \n     will need to fly relatively close to enemy territory in order \n     to have enough power to shoot down enemy missiles, and during \n     a time of crisis it will need to be near the target area \n     continuously. A 747 loaded with high-power laser equipment \n     will make a large and inviting target to the enemy and will \n     require protection in the air and on the ground. Finally, \n     relatively simple countermeasures such as reflective surfaces \n     on enemy missiles could negate the ABL's capabilities.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n       Deployment of an ABL that can shoot down short- and medium-\n     range tactical targets is not likely before the end of the \n     decade, and the Airborne Laser will not be able to play a \n     role in national missile defense for many years after that.\n\n\n                        National Missile Defense\n\n       The Bush administration hopes to build a layered national \n     missile defense that consists of a ground-based midcourse \n     system, expanded versions of the theater systems discussed \n     above, and, potentially, space-based systems. The Bush \n     administration does not use the phrase ``national missile \n     defense'' because it was the name of the ground-based \n     midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration and \n     because the Pentagon's plans to defend the country are now \n     more robust. But national missile defense is a useful \n     shorthand for any system that is intended to defend the \n     continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     strategic ballistic missiles, and it is in that sense that it \n     is used here.\n       For all practical purposes, the only part of the Bush \n     national missile defense that is ``real'' is the ground-based \n     midcourse system. It is real in the sense that six flight \n     intercept tests have been conducted so far, whereas versions \n     of the THAAD or Navy Theater Wide systems that might be used \n     to defend the United States have not been tested at all. \n     Space-based systems are an even more distant prospect. For \n     example, the Space-Based Laser, which would use a laser on a \n     satellite to destroy missiles in their boost phase, was to be \n     tested in 2012, but funding cuts have pushed the testing date \n     back indefinitely. Deployment is so far in the future that it \n     is beyond the horizon of the Pentagon's long-range planning \n     document, Joint Vision 2020.\n       As a result, despite the Bush administration's attempts to \n     distinguish its plans from its predecessor's, Bush's layered \n     national missile defense is, in effect, nothing more than the \n     Clinton system.\n       Since 1997, the ground-based midcourse program has \n     conducted eight major flight tests, known as IFTs. The first \n     two, named IFT-1A and IFT-2, were fly-by tests designed \n     simply to collect target information. The next six tests, \n     IFT-3 through IFT-8, were all flight intercept tests. IFT-4 \n     and IFT-5, conducted in January 2000 and July 2000 \n     respectively, both failed to achieve an intercept, which \n     became a principal reason why, on September 1, 2000, \n     President Bill Clinton decided not to begin deployment of \n     ground-based midcourse components, such as a new X-band radar \n     on Shemya Island in Alaska.\n       Another year passed before the next flight intercept test, \n     IFT-6, was conducted. The intercept was successful except \n     that the real-time hit assessment performed by the ground-\n     based X-band prototype radar on the Kwajalein Atoll in the \n     Marshall Islands incorrectly reported the hit as a miss. IFT-\n     7, conducted in early December 2001, was also successful. \n     Until then, all of the flight intercept tests had had \n     essentially the same target cluster: a re-entry vehicle, a \n     single large balloon, and debris associated with stage \n     separation and decoy deployment. Then, in IFT-8, conducted on \n     March 15, 2002, two small balloons were added to the target \n     cluster. This flight intercept test also was successful and \n     marked an important milestone for the ground-based midcourse \n     program.\n       However, despite these recent successes, there have been \n     significant delays in the testing program. Several of the \n     flight tests were simply repeats of earlier tests, and as a \n     result IFT-8 did not accomplish the tasks set for it in the \n     original schedule. In short, the testing program has slipped \n     roughly two years--i.e., what was originally scheduled to \n     take two years has taken four. That is not to say that the \n     program has made no progress but rather that key program \n     milestones have receded into the future.\n       The pace of successful testing will be one of the primary \n     determinants of how quickly the United States can field a \n     national missile defense. If the ground-based midcourse \n     system has three or four successful flight intercept tests \n     per year, as it has during the past year, it could be ready \n     for operational testing in four or five years. If those \n     operational tests also were successful, then whatever \n     capability had been demonstrated in all those tests--which \n     would probably not include the capability to deal with many \n     types of decoys and countermeasures or the capability to \n     cover much of the space through which an enemy missile could \n     travel--could be deployed by the end of the decade or even \n     by 2008.\n       However, the ground-based midcourse system has difficulties \n     beyond the testing pace of its interceptor. The system \n     requires a new, more powerful booster rocket than the \n     surrogate currently being used in tests--a task that was \n     thought to be relatively easy. That new booster was to be \n     incorporated into the continuing series of flight intercept \n     tests to make those tests more realistic and to be sure that \n     the new booster's higher acceleration did not adversely \n     affect other components or systems on board.\n       But development of the new booster is about two years \n     behind schedule. Indeed, on December 13, just hours after \n     President Bush announced U.S. plans to withdraw from the ABM \n     Treaty, a test of the new booster had to be aborted and the \n     missile destroyed in flight for safety reasons because it \n     flew off course. Flight intercept tests that were to have \n     used the new booster have come and gone without it. Indeed, \n     development of the booster is so far behind that the Pentagon \n     recently issued another contract for a competing design.\n       Equally problematic is uncertainty over how the system will \n     track enemy missiles in flight and distinguish targets from \n     decoys. One approach is to use high-power radars operating in \n     the X-band (that is, at a frequency of about 10 billion \n     cycles per second). A prototype X-band radar on the Kwajalein \n     Atoll has been part all of the ground-based midcourse flight \n     intercept tests so far, and technically, X-band radar \n     progress has been one of the most successful developments in \n     missile defense technology.\n       A year and a half ago, Lieutenant General Kadish testified \n     to Congress that establishing an X-band radar in Alaska was \n     the ``long pole in the tent'' for missile defense. This meant \n     that the X-band radar was critical to a ground-based \n     midcourse system and that if that radar was not built soon, \n     the program would start slipping day for day. Then, as now, \n     there were many other developments that would take as long or \n     longer than building an X-band radar at Shemya, but the \n     Pentagon's official position was that construction needed to \n     start in the spring of 2001 at the latest. Nevertheless, \n     Clinton deferred taking action on the radar.\n       Surprisingly, the Bush administration has not requested \n     funding for an X-band radar at Shemya in either of its first \n     two budgets. This may be because the administration views \n     such an installation as inconsistent with the ABM Treaty, \n     which the administration has said it will not violate while \n     the treaty is still in effect. Or the administration may not \n     have requested funding because the Missile Defense Agency has \n     been exploring ``portable'' X-band radars--that is, X-band \n     radars deployed on ships or barges.\n       Some defense analysts believe that the Space-Based Infrared \n     Satellite (SBIRS) program could be used in place of the X-\n     band radar to assist a national missile defense. SBIRS--which \n     would consist of two sets of orbiting sensor satellites, \n     SBIRS-high and SBIRS-low--is designed to detect the launch of \n     enemy ballistic missiles and could be used to track and \n     discriminate among them in flight. However, the program has \n     significant technical problems.\n       SBIRS-high, which will consist of four satellites in \n     geosynchronous orbit and two satellites in highly elliptical \n     orbits, is to replace the existing Defense Support Program \n     satellites, which provide early warning of missile launches. \n     A year ago, the SBIRS-high satellites were scheduled for \n     launch in 2004 and 2006, but recently those dates have \n     slipped roughly two years because of problems with software, \n     engineering, and system integration. A year ago, realistic \n     operational testing was scheduled for 2007; now, it may not \n     occur this decade, which means that full deployment may not \n     occur this decade. SBIRS-high is also well over cost and is \n     in danger of breaching the legal restrictions covering cost \n     growth.\n       SBIRS-low is to consist of approximately 30 cross-linked \n     satellites in low-Earth orbit. A year ago, the launch of the \n     first of these satellites was scheduled for 2006, but SBIRS-\n     low has slipped two years because of a variety of difficult \n     technical problems. The developmental testing program for \n     SBIRS-low is very challenging, and realistic operational \n     testing will probably not begin this decade. This could delay \n     deployment of the full constellation of SBIRS-low satellites \n     until the middle of the next decade. SBIRS-low is also \n     dramatically over budget and was threatened with cancellation \n     in the latest round of congressional appropriations.\n       For now, the administration has been saying that it will \n     upgrade an existing radar on Shemya called Cobra Dane. Under \n     this plan, the Cobra Dane radar would become an advanced \n     early-warning radar with some ability to distinguish among \n     targets. But the Cobra Dane radar operates in the L-band with \n     about eight-times poorer resolution than a new X-band radar \n     would have, raising questions about the effectiveness of any \n     national missile defense using it.\n       In sum, the only element of a ``layered'' national missile \n     defense that exists on anything but paper is the ground-based \n     midcourse system pursued by the Clinton administration. \n     Accordingly, it is nearly impossible to predict when, if \n     ever, an integrated, layered national missile defense with \n     boost, midcourse, and terminal phases might be developed. As \n     noted above, given the most recent pace of testing, some part \n     of the ground-based midcourse system could be deployed by the \n     end of the decade or possibly by 2008.\n       However, the capability such a system would have would be \n     marginal and probably would not be able to deal with many \n     types of decoys and countermeasures or to cover much of the \n     space through which an attacking ICBM might fly. The Bush \n     administration has said it will deploy test elements as an \n     emergency capability as early as possible, but such a \n     deployment would be rudimentary and its capabilities would be \n     limited to those already demonstrated in testing. It would \n     likely not be effective against unauthorized or accidental \n     launches from Russia or China, which might include missiles \n     with countermeasures. It also would not be effective against \n     launches from Iraq, Iran, or Libya since those countries are \n     to the east, out of view of a radar on Shemya.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       During the first year of the Bush administration, all U.S. \n     missile defense programs--both theater and national--have \n     slipped. In general, the shorter-range tactical missile\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n     defense systems are further along than the medium-range \n     systems, and those medium-range systems are further along \n     than the longer-range systems intended to defend the United \n     States against ICBMs.\n       PAC-3 is the most developmentally advanced of any U.S. \n     missile defense system, but full deployment will not likely \n     take place before 2005, and realistic operational testing \n     will continue for many years after the first Army units are \n     equipped in the field. The THAAD program has slipped two \n     years or more and will not be deployable until 2010. The Navy \n     Area Wide program has been cancelled, and the Navy Theater \n     Wide program has slipped two years or more and will not be \n     deployable in a tactical role until the end of the decade. If \n     the Pentagon restructures the program so that its priority is \n     boost-phase or midcourse defense against strategic missiles, \n     it will likely take longer. The Airborne Laser has slipped \n     one year and will probably not be deployed as a theater \n     missile defense before the end of the decade.\n       SBIRS-low has slipped two years and doubled in cost and \n     probably will not be deployed before 2008. For all practical \n     purposes, national missile defense is technically not much \n     closer than it was in the Clinton administration. There have \n     been no flight intercept tests of the boost-phase or \n     terminal-phase elements suggested by the Bush administration, \n     and developmental testing could take a decade or more, \n     depending on the pace of testing and the level of success in \n     each test. The only element that can be flight-intercept \n     tested against strategic ballistic missiles today is the \n     ground-based midcourse system. Part of that system could be \n     deployed by 2008, but elements fielded before then will have \n     only a limited capability.\n       Thus, while making foreign policy, the Bush administration \n     would do well to consider that probably only a limited-\n     capability version of PAC-3 will be fielded during its tenure \n     and that an effective, layered national missile defense will \n     not be realized while it is in office. It would make little \n     sense to predicate strategic decisions on a defense that does \n     not exist.\n       It is important for Congress and the American public not to \n     be frightened into believing that the United States is--as \n     some missile defense proponents like to assert--defenseless \n     against even a limited missile attack by a ``rouge state'' \n     such as North Korea. Powerful and effective options exist, \n     both military and diplomatic.\n       In Afghanistan, U.S. attack operations with precision-\n     guided weapons have been highly effective. Those same \n     precision weapons would be effective against an enemy ICBM \n     installation. In fact, given current capabilities and the \n     ever-improving technologies for precision strike, it would be \n     fantasy to believe any national missile defense system \n     deployed by 2003 to 2008 would work better and provide \n     greater reliability at a lower cost than the precision-guided \n     munitions used in Afghanistan.\n       On the diplomatic front, in 1999 former Secretary of \n     Defense William Perry made a series of trips to convince \n     North Korea to stop developing and testing long-range \n     missiles. He was remarkably successful. Although Secretary \n     Perry would not say that North Korea was no longer a threat, \n     it was obvious that the North Korean threat had been \n     moderated. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was able to \n     build on his trip the next year to secure a pledge from \n     Pyongyang to half flight testing of missiles. Dollar for \n     dollar, Secretary Perry has been the most cost-effective \n     missile defense system the United States has yet to develop. \n     The most straightforward route to missile defense against \n     North Korea may be through diplomacy, not technology.\n       Many decision-makers in Washington--and, from what one \n     reads, the president himself--seem to be misinformed about \n     the prospects for near-term success with national missile \n     defense and the budgets being requested for it. It takes 20 \n     years to develop a modern, high performance jet fighter, and \n     it probably will take even longer to develop an effective \n     missile defense network. Taking into account the challenges \n     of asymmetric warfare, the time it can take to develop modern \n     military equipment, the reliability required in real \n     operational situations, and the interoperability required for \n     hundreds of systems and subsystems to work together, it would \n     be highly unrealistic to think that the United States can \n     deploy an effective, layered national missile defense by 2004 \n     or even by 2008.\n       In the meantime, policymakers should be careful that U.S. \n     foreign and security goals and policies are not dependent on \n     something that cannot work now and probably will not work \n     effectively for the foreseeable future. A case in point is \n     President Bush's decision to abandon the ABM Treaty with \n     Russia. That decision was certainly premature given the state \n     of missile defense technology and likely could have been \n     avoided or postponed for many years if not indefinitely.\n       This is not to say that missile defense technology ought \n     not to be pursued--only that it should be pursued with \n     realistic expectations. Policymakers must be able to weigh \n     the potential merits and costs of missile defense based on a \n     sound understanding of both the technology and the possible \n     alternatives. No one weapon system can substitute for the \n     sound conduct of foreign policy, and even a single diplomat \n     can be effective on a time scale that is short when compared \n     with the time that will be required to develop the technology \n     for national missile defense.\n\n\n                         stages of development\n\n       Missile defense, especially national missile defense, is \n     the most difficult program ever attempted by the Department \n     of Defense--much more difficult than the development of a \n     modern jet fighter like the F-22 Raptor, the Navy's Land \n     Attack Destroyer (DD-21), or the Army's Abrams M1A2 tank \n     complete with battlefield digitization, endeavors that all \n     have taken 20 years or more. Each new major weapons system \n     must proceed through several stages of development, which are \n     listed below. Most U.S. missile defense systems are currently \n     in developmental testing and are therefore not close to \n     deployment.\n       Research and Development (R): The period during which the \n     concepts and basic technologies behind a proposed military \n     system are explored. Depending on the difficulty of the \n     technology and the complexity of the proposed system, R can \n     take anywhere from a year or two to more than 10 years.\n       Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD): The period \n     during which a system design is engineered and the industrial \n     processes to manufacture and assemble a proposed military \n     system are developed. For a major defense acquisition such as \n     a high-performance jet fighter, EMD can take five years or \n     more. If substantial difficulties are encouraged, EMD can \n     take even longer.\n       Developmental Testing: Testing that is performed to learn \n     about the strengths and weaknesses of proposed military \n     technologies and the application of those technologies to a \n     new military system in a military environment. Generally, \n     developmental testing is oriented toward achieving certain \n     specifications, such as speed, maneuverability, or rate of \n     fire. Developmental testing is conducted throughout the R \n     and EMD phases of development and becomes more stressing as \n     prototype systems evolve and mature.\n       Operational Testing: Testing that aims to demonstrate \n     effective military performance against operational \n     requirements and mission needs established for a system. \n     Testing is performed with production-representative equipment \n     in realistic operational environments--at night, in bad \n     weather, against realistic threats and countermeasures. \n     Military service personnel, not contractors, operate the \n     system, which is stressed as it would be in battle. \n     Operational testing of a major defense acquisition system \n     typically takes the better part of a year and is usually \n     broken into several periods of a month or two to accommodate \n     different environments or scenarios. If substantial \n     difficulties are encountered, several years of operational \n     testing may be required.\n       Production: The phase of acquisition when a military system \n     is manufactured and produced. Early on, during ``low-rate \n     production,'' the quantities produced are typically small. \n     Later, after successfully completing operational testing, a \n     system may go into ``full-rate production,'' where the rate \n     of production is designed to complete the government's \n     planned purchase of the system in a relatively short period \n     of time, about five years.\n       Deployment: The fielding of a military system in either \n     limited or large quantities in military units. The first \n     military unit equipped may help develop tactics, techniques, \n     and procedures for use of the new system if that has not \n     already been done adequately in development.\n       All ballistic missiles have three stages of flight.\n       The boost phase begins at launch and lasts until the rocket \n     engines stop firing and pushing the missile away from Earth. \n     Depending on the missile, this stage lasts three to five \n     minutes. During much of this time, the missile is traveling \n     relatively slowly although toward the end of this stage an \n     ICBM can reach speeds of more than 24,000 kilometers per \n     hour. The missile stays in one piece during this stage.\n       The midcourse phase begins after the propulsion system \n     finishes firing and the missile is on a ballistic course \n     toward its target. This is the longest stage of a missile's \n     flight, lasting up to 20 minutes for ICBMs. During the early \n     part of the midcourse stage, the missile is still ascending \n     toward its apogee, while during the latter part it is \n     descending toward Earth. It is during this stage that the \n     missile's warhead, as well as any decoys, separate from the \n     delivery vehicle.\n       The terminal phase begins when the missile's warhead re-\n     enters the Earth's atmosphere, and it continues until impact \n     or detonation. This stage takes less than a minute for a \n     strategic warhead, which can be traveling at speeds greater \n     than 3,200 kilometers per hour.\n\n  Mr. REED. The system that is most developed is one I mentioned \npreviously, the PAC-3 system. It is a theater missile system. It is not \ndesigned to counter long-range threats. It has been tested rigorously. \nIt is in operational testing now. Phil Coyle states that the \nadministration is considering an advanced version of PAC-3 for a \nnational missile defense. But if you were trying to use it in a \nterminal phase it would take many systems to defend a rather small area \nof the United States. We probably would never have the number of \nsystems needed to adequately defend the United States.\n  Another system we have been developing for years is the THAAD system.\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nPhil Coyle states that the Administration is also considering use of \nTHAAD along with PAC-3 for national missile defense. But in its current \nconfiguration THAAD is not ready for this role. In fact, it is far away \nfrom it--perhaps a decade before it could be reasonably used in that \nway.\n  The other system being developed as we speak is a Navy theater-wide \nsystem. It is a midcourse system as it is currently designed. They are \nnow talking about this system as a potential element of their midcourse \nnational missile defense. Again, there are still significant issues \nwith respect to the use of this system for national missile defense.\n  As Mr. Coyle points out, if the system were to be used for a \nmidcourse mission, or a boost phase mission, for national missile \ndefense, it would require a new missile that is twice as fast as any \nexisting version of the standard missile which the system now uses. He \nwrites it would require:\n\n       A new, more powerful Aegis radar system to track targets; a \n     new launch structure to accommodate the new, larger missiles; \n     and probably new ships. As a result, the Navy theater-wide \n     program requires a great deal of new development. It is \n     unlikely that Navy theater-wide will be ready for realistic \n     operational testing until late in this decade, and it will \n     not be ready for realistic operational demonstration in a \n     layered national missile defense for several years after \n     that.\n\n  It is interesting to note that this system is being considered today \nby the Missile Defense Agency for possible deployment in 2004. It is \nalso interesting, and a bit surprising, because in last year's \nauthorization bill we asked the Missile Defense Agency to tell us what \nthey propose to do with the Navy theater-wide system. We asked for a \nreport on April 30. The response to our request was actually a letter \nthat came to us on May 30, and repeated the questions we asked. It \nresponded to some of the questions in a very cursory way. It didn't \ngive any life cycle cost for us, so it is hard for us to estimate how \nmuch this new evolving system will cost. It simply said they redefined \nthe system. That was May 30.\n  Yet, about 2\\1/2\\ weeks later, they were telling the press that we \nare deploying this system in 2004. In fact, one of the points they made \nin the letter is:\n\n       The details of the sea-based program block 2006 and out \n     capability are being developed through work that is scheduled \n     to be completed by December 2003. We will be able to provide \n     specifics on the system definition, along with a preliminary \n     assessment of force structure and life cycle cost at that \n     time.\n\n  So this work is going to be completed in planning by 2003. Yet this \nsystem is being talked about for deployment in 2004.\n  It just does not seem to make much sense, and it illustrates, I \nthink, the problem we have had in the subcommittee, first of getting \nreliable information, and second of getting a sense of the direction of \nall these programs.\n  We are not trying to micromanage the Missile Defense Agency, but when \nwe asked a year ago in our report for information specifically about a \ntype of missile system, when we get a cursory response saying, we have \nrenamed it and we will not be able to tell you anything until we \nconclude in December of 2003 our deliberations, and then 2 weeks later \nthey are talking about the system being deployed in a theater role in \n2004, it illustrates, I think, the problems and the issues we have \nconfronted with simply getting the information we need to do our job, \nto inform our colleagues, to make decisions that are not only important \nto our national security, but extremely expensive decisions so that we \ncan perform our mission, our role in the Senate.\n  That is the Navy theater wide system. There are other systems we have \ndeveloped, and I think it is appropriate to note that the next system \nis the airborne laser system. This is a program to develop a high-power \nchemical laser that will fit inside a Boeing 747 aircraft. This is a \nsystem that would be designed to shoot down short-range enemy missiles \nin the boost phase. It has some potential, but it is a major \ntechnological effort which is going forward, but not going forward with \ngreat speed at the moment.\n  The final major component is the national missile defense midcourse, \nor the land-based system, in Alaska, and that system we have supported. \nWe have supported it, but having supported it, we also have serious \nquestions with it. The system was inaugurated, if you will; at least \nground was broken last week for a test bed for missiles. There are \nconcerns that the missiles cannot be effectively used in a flight test \ncapacity because of safety concerns and other factors with respect to \nthe local area in Alaska. That is one issue.\n  The other issue, though, is for several years now in the development \nof this national missile defense midcourse land-based system in Alaska, \nthe administration and the Missile Defense Agency have talked about \nusing an x-band radar, claiming it as absolutely necessary because of \nits ability to discriminate the warhead. This is important because the \nmajor issue that faces the midcourse intercept is the possibility of \ncountermeasures and decoys. So we need a very fine discriminating radar \nto determine what is the warhead and what are the decoys. However, That \nx-band radar has not been funded by the administration. They have \ndeclared instead they will use an existing radar, COBRA DANE.\n  One of the problems with COBRA DANE is it faces the wrong way to \nprovide any coverage of Iran or Iraq and provides only limited coverage \nof North Korea, if you are concerned with the ``evil empire.''\n  Despite that, and in an effort to support sincerely and consistently \nthe mission of developing adequate national missile defense, we have \nprovided robust funding for the Alaska test bed, and that is included \nin this bill. However, I do think it is important and appropriate to \nstate our reservations now because they are points we should consider \nas we go forward.\n  Let me continue to discuss some of the important issues, particularly \nsome of the actions the committee has specifically taken.\n  One thing we should point out is we have looked at the theater \nmissile systems. We have particularly found that the Arrow Missile \nDefense Program is making great progress. We have increased funding for \nthe Arrow missile system. That is a joint United States-Israeli effort \nfor a theater missile system.\n\n  We have also fully funded the PAC-3 system, which is the one closest \nto deployment. It is one that is, again, a theater missile system.\n  In all of our deliberations, we have striven to ensure deployment of \nthese systems in a timely way, but also ensure these systems are \noperationally tested and rigorously tested before they are put in the \nfield. That is incumbent upon us.\n  We also tried to ensure the independent oversight of the Defense \nDepartment's Director of Operational Tests and Evaluation is part of \nthe process. One of the concerns I have, frankly, is that in an attempt \nby the administration for secrecy and flexibility, we will find a \nsituation in which there is no outside objective voice within the \nDepartment of Defense. One that is looking at these programs, advising \nthese programs, and making some judgments that are not influenced by \nthe need for a successful program at any cost, or even a program--\nforget successful--at any cost, but are motivated by the need to deploy \neffective systems that will defend this country.\n  The other factor we considered, and consider constantly, is the \ndiscussion of contingency deployments, contingency capabilities. One of \nthe reasons we pause slightly is these contingency capabilities and \ndeployments often result in a rush to failure, often result in a \nsituation where the system is pushed beyond its absolute capabilities. \nA few years ago, that is exactly what happened with the THAAD Program. \nIt failed its first six intercept tests in a rush to deploy the system \nbefore it was ready.\n  The THAAD Program was subsequently totally redone and revamped. It \ncost hundreds of millions of dollars that were unnecessary \nexpenditures. It is on track now but, frankly, the situation is such \nthat we do not want to repeat that experience in other missile defense \nprograms. We do not want a situation where the pressure for contingency \ndeployments undercuts the need for thorough, deliberate consideration \nof the operational characters of these systems and the ability of these \nsystems to do the job they are designed to do.\n  We have looked very closely at what we think are attempts to rush the \nsystems. In one area, we have reduced\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nfunding of THAAD because they have requested what we consider a \npremature acquisition of missiles before they have actually had \nmissile's first flight test. We have made that judgment.\n  Let's turn to another aspect of missile defense, and that is the ICBM \nthreat to the United States. It is not as immediate today as the \ntheater missile threat, but it is still a threat.\n  Fortunately, with our new relationship with Russia, the ICBM threat \nhas decreased significantly. China has a small arsenal of ICBMs, but \nthey typically do not have their missiles on ready status, fueled, and \nwith a warhead on the missile. North Korea seems to be developing an \nICBM capability of reaching the United States, although it has \nvoluntarily suspended its long-range missile flight test program. There \nare other potential adversaries.\n  This is an issue about which we are concerned, but one of the things \nwe have to recognize with an ICBM is that its launch leaves an \nindelible signal of the point of departure and our deterrence doctrine \nis very clear. We have the capacity to strike back, and strike back \nwith overwhelming force. That has been the hinge, really, of our \ndeterrence policy for 50 or more years, and it remains an important \npart of our policy.\n  As I have mentioned, the issue of intercontinental ballistic missiles \nhas been with us for many years. We have relied upon deterrence as a \nmainstay of our defense posture. Today we are developing one system in \nAlaska that is clearly designed to be a national missile defense \nsystem, and this authorization bill supports that effort in Alaska.\n  As I mentioned, we have taken away resources from some programs that \nare unjustified or duplicative and simply not advancing what we believe \nis the common concern of developing adequate missile defense systems, \nboth theater and national. We have taken away approximately $800 \nmillion and applied $690 million to shipbuilding. But in addition, we \nhave applied resources for security at our nuclear facilities.\n  One of the things I found startling in press reports was the fact \nthat the Department of Energy asked for considerably more money to \nprotect nuclear facilities, and they were turned down by OMB.\n  This is a letter to Bruce M. Carnes, who is the Director of the \nOffice of Management Budget and Evaluation, from the chief financial \noffice of the Department of Energy:\n\n       We are disconcerted that OMB refused our security \n     supplemental request. I would have much preferred to have \n     heard this from you personally, and been given an opportunity \n     to discuss, not to mention, appeal your decision. We were \n     told by Energy Branch staff that the Department's security \n     supplemental proposals were not supported because the revised \n     Design Basis Threat, the document that outlines the basis for \n     physical security measures, has not been completed. This \n     isn't a tenable position for you to take, in my view. We are \n     not operating, and cannot operate, under the pre-September 11 \n     Design Basis Threat. Until that is revised, we must operate \n     under Interim Implementing Guidance, and you have not \n     provided resources to enable us to do so.\n\n  That is from the Department of Energy to the OMB. We would move \nresources into the Department of Energy to provide for security of DOE \nfacilities.\n  But I think this underscores something else, too. It illustrates what \nI would say are the misaligned priorities between missile defense and \nother pressing, immediate concerns. Yes, missile defense is important. \nYes, we should develop it quickly, thoroughly, and deliberately, but \ncertainly defending and protecting our facilities that have nuclear \nradiological material is of an immediate and significant concern.\n  Last week, we were not threatened by an intercontinental missile. We \nwere threatened by a terrorist, an American who became infatuated with \nthe al-Qaida and their rhetoric and came here, if you believe the press \nreports, to obtain nuclear materials to construct a ``dirty'' bomb. \nThat is the immediate real threat today.\n\n  Yet when the question before the administration was, do we fund \nsecurity at DOE facilities or do we continue to put resources into \nmissile defense, they made their choice to put resources in missile \ndefense, way above, I believe, the appropriate amount. As a result, we \nhave made adjustments, and I think those adjustments are entirely \nappropriate.\n  The other aspect of this, too, when it comes to the issue of \nresources, is, first, a point that all of these deliberations on the \nmissile defense budget seems to be outside the purview of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. I thought it was shocking when the Chiefs came up and \ntestified that they were not consulted during the preparation of the \nballistic missile defense budget. These are the uniformed leaders of \nour military forces. These individuals are charged with and have taken \nan oath to the Constitution to protect the country, and yet they were \nnot consulted at all about this budget.\n  Another point that is critical, and let me quote from Secretary \nRumsfeld's testimony before the Appropriations Committee on May 21. He \nsaid:\n\n       In February of this year, we began developing the Defense \n     Planning Guidance for fiscal year 2004. In the fiscal years \n     2004 to 2009 program, the senior civilian and military \n     leadership had to focus on the looming problem of a sizeable \n     procurement bow wave beyond fiscal year 2007.\n\n  This is shorthand for describing the course of procurement of systems \nthat will be ready for fielding later in this decade.\n\n       If all were funded, they would crowd out all other areas of \n     investment and thereby cause a repetition of the same \n     heartaches and headaches that we still suffer from today as a \n     result of the procurement holiday of the 1990s.\n\n  This in the context of his plea to cut the Crusader system.\n  But what is most alarming about this quote is that this bow wave does \nnot include any deployment costs of missile defense at a time when the \nadministration is developing multiple systems which they proposed to \ndeploy at the end of this decade, costing hundreds of billions of \ndollars perhaps.\n  As a result, we cannot simply ignore the cost implications of these \nsystems. As I mentioned before, simply to obtain life cycle cost \ninformation on any of these systems has proven to be virtually \nimpossible. We asked for that with respect to Navy theater wide and we \ngot a letter back saying, we will not know until December of 2003 and \nthen we will tell you.\n  We cannot operate without an idea, understanding that it will be \namended many times before the end of this decade, but an idea about the \ncost of all of these systems over several years, procurement and \noperational deployment. If this bow wave is a crisis today, it becomes \na tidal wave when you include missile defense costs. As a result, we \nhave asked again for more specific information about the projected \ncosts associated with the missile defense program.\n  One of the areas, and an area on which we have focused our \nreductions, has been systems engineering funding. The Department of \nDefense Missile Defense Agency has asked for significant amounts of \nmoney for systems engineering, BMD systems engineering, in addition to \nspecific moneys they are asking in every one of these component parts, \nboost phase, midcourse, and terminal, where there is sufficient systems \nengineering money. So we have directed reductions in this BMD systems \nengineering.\n  It seems to us, again, to be an ill-defined area. We have asked for \nwhat products they are buying. Mostly, I suspect it is engineering \nservices, or consulting services. It is not hardware. We have asked for \nthis and we have gotten very little in terms of a response. As a \nresult, we have shifted these funds significantly into the \naforementioned shipbuilding programs and further security for our \nDepartment of Energy laboratories.\n\n  These efforts represent an attempt to provide good government, good \nmanagement to a program. We hope it will accelerate the deployment of \nan effective missile system that has been operationally tested.\n  I hasten to add that this does not represent a revisitation of the \nABM Treaty debate. The President used his prerogative as President to \nwithdraw. This is not about arms control as much as it is about \nmaintaining good management, informing the Congress, so we can make \ndifficult decisions, so that 5 years from now we are not surprised when \nthat bow wave hits us and suddenly the bow wave becomes a tidal wave \nbecause of the inclusion of significant costs of missile defense and \nfor theater missile defense.\n  There is a consensus to support missile defense, clearly theater and, \nin\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nfact, I think also at this juncture clearly national missile defense. I \ndo not think we support that without asking tough questions and making \ntough choices about how we spend our money, particularly when it comes \nto the other uses that are so necessary today, the immediate protection \nof our homeland, the immediate protection of forces around the globe \nthat are confronting our enemies today. So we have to make these \njudgments and we made these judgments.\n  In addition to that, we have asked that a whole system of, we think, \nvery sensible reports and information be given to us. I have a \ndisconcerting feeling that there is a deliberate attempt to limit \ninformation that we get and it is justified under the guise that we \nneed flexibility, that we have not thought through the problem yet. \nThere may be something to that, but it is particularly distressing when \nthe Director of Test and Evaluation does not have unfettered access to \nthe program. It is particularly distressing when the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council, the JROC, chaired by the Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, does not have a role in these deliberations. It is \nparticularly distressing when the Joint Chiefs of Staff are not \nconsulted in the preparation of this significant budget. The American \npeople, I think, assume that these officials of the Department of \nDefense are intimately involved in all of these details and have a seat \nat the table to make judgments and to give advice. Our legislation \nwould do that.\n  As we go forward, we will continue to ask the tough questions. The \nspecifics of our requests with respect to these issues of oversight \ninclude a reiteration of some of the things that we incorporated in \nlast year's request.\n  Last year, the National Defense Authorization Act required the Agency \nto submit lifecycle cost estimates for all missile defense programs \nthat it entered into the engineering and manufacturing and development, \nor EMD, phase. These are the same types of reports that every major \nweapons system provides to the Congress.\n  The THAAD missile defense program, I have mentioned before, entered \nEMD phase 2 years ago. We fully expected those lifecycle costs would be \nreported to us in a routine way. However, instead of providing the \nrequired information for THAAD, the Department chose to reclassify \nTHAAD as no longer being in EMD thereby avoiding, in their view, the \ncongressional requirement to submit the cost estimate.\n\n  It seems to be gamesmanship, to avoid responding to an obvious \nquestion, an obvious concern: Tell us how much this system will cost \nover its lifetime. That, again, is the type of nonresponsiveness, \neither inadvertent or deliberate, that we have encountered. Therefore, \nit reinforces the need for additional language in this legislation to \nrequire appropriate reports, the same types of reports that you get \nfrom mature systems in other areas of defense procurement.\n  We are not asking for the speculative. We are looking at systems that \nhave had many years of development, which are entering the phases of \nengineering work. So the issue is defined. We can't do that because it \nis not defined--sometimes we hear that--that is not at the heart of our \nrequest. We have applied the request to major missile defense systems \nsuch as the ground and sea-based midcourse program, Airborne laser, and \nthe THAAD program.\n  It is particularly important to get information because, on the one \nhand, the administration says these are all speculative, ill-defined, \nand they are thinking about it. And then they say: We will deploy the \nsystem in a very short time, in 2004, for example.\n  You cannot have it both ways. If we are ready for contingency \ndeployment, certainly the information should be available to the \nCongress. And this legislation would ask for that information.\n  We also recommend a provision that requires the Pentagon's director \nof testing and evaluation to assess the potential operational \neffectiveness of the major missile defense systems on an annual basis. \nThis would help the administration and Congress determine whether a \ncontingency deployment of a missile defense system is appropriate. \nThere has to be a certain operational threshold before deploying the \nsystem. Who better than the director of testing and evaluation to make \nthat assessment.\n  It also requires the Joint Requirement Oversight Council to annually \nassess the costs and performance in relation to military requirements. \nThis is the statutory role of the JROC for all military programs. \nMissile defense is too important to bypass such a review.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Chiefs were not even asked to provide \ntheir views with respect to these missile defense priorities. That \nshould be corrected also. That should be something the Secretary of \nDefense would want to have and would insist be included.\n  Now, we are endeavoring to bring this legislation to the floor \nrepresenting a commitment to missile defense but also a commitment to \nthe overall defense and security of the United States, to be able to \nassure our constituents that we have looked carefully and deliberately \nat all these programs and are aware of these programs, that we support \nthese programs, but we don't do it blindly. We do it on an informed \nbasis and are able to tell them: We are doing what we can, indeed, all \nwe can, in a thoughtful, deliberate, careful, professional way, to \nenhance the security of the United States in terms of missile defense \nand in terms of overall defense. We are, in fact, doing our job.\n  I believe the legislation we have brought from the subcommittee to \nthe committee and to the floor does this. It is a product of careful \ndeliberation. It is a product of many hours of work by staff and \nMembers. It is a product that is designed to enhance the security of \nthe United States. I believe it does. I hope my colleagues agree and \nconcur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hope all Members listened closely to the Senator from \nRhode Island. He certainly is qualified by virtue of his service in the \nCongress, but mostly by virtue of his service in the U.S. Army. The \nSenator from Rhode Island is the only Senator to graduate from the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point, to my knowledge. I always listen \nclosely to what he says. The country is very fortunate to have his \nexpertise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator allow me to associate myself as an \nextension about observations regarding my colleague. We have some \nphilosophical differences, but he does bring to our committee the \nwealth of experience he gained in the U.S. military. That is so \nimportant.\n  I also want to discuss scheduling on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to our leader, subject to the pending amendment, we \nare hopeful to move on to other amendments in due course.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Virginia, the comanager of this \nbill, Majority Leader Daschle announced in his dugout this morning that \nhe wanted Members to offer amendments and that he was going to look \nvery closely early next week, if things are not moving well, at filing \ncloture on this bill.\n  We cannot have this bill not completed by the time we leave for the \nJuly recess. The committee has worked too hard. The President needs \nthis legislation. The United States military needs it. We have to \ncomplete this bill.\n  I agree with the Senator from Virginia. We have a very important \namendment now pending, and we have to figure out some way to get this \noff the floor. There are many people working on that as we speak.\n  The Senator from Virginia is absolutely right. Members need to offer \namendments. The majority leader spoke earlier today; he very much \ndesires to move this legislation along quickly. If it does not move \nquickly after a week or so of debate, he will try to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished assistant majority leader.\n  I am assured that the Republican leader worked hand-in-glove with the \nmajority to bring up this bill, providing our committee with this very \nimportant period of time prior to the Fourth of July, but we must \nfinish it.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with for purposes of an introductory statement \nof approximately 5 minutes. At the conclusion, it is my intention to \nplace the Senate back into quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham pertaining to the introduction of S. 2652 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of Members, we have \nhad a message from the House. We are going to go back into a quorum \ncall. We are trying to move on that as quickly as possible. As I \nmentioned to the distinguished Senator from Texas, we are going to \nmodify the second-degree amendment. Then Senator Gramm has some things \nhe wants to say and a motion he wants to make, of which we are aware. \nBut this should not take long. In a few minutes we should be able to \nget to the legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3916, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send a modification to the desk to the \nReid-Conrad amendment.

Madam President, Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, wants to speak about this modification. The chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has been here for a while. Senator \nConrad has graciously allowed him to speak first. Senator Leahy needs \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business. Following that, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this is perhaps one of the most \nchallenging years we have faced dealing with the budget of the United \nStates. That is why moments ago I sent a modified amendment to the \ndesk. Let me just outline what is included in that amendment and why I \nthink it is so critically important that we adopt it today.\n  The Conrad-Feingold amendment sets discretionary spending limits for \n2003 and 2004.\n  It also extends the 60-vote points of order protecting Social \nSecurity, enforcing discretionary spending caps, and requiring fiscal \nresponsibility, and it extends for 5 years the pay-go and other budget \nenforcement provisions that otherwise expire on September 30.\n  Let me discuss the level of spending that is covered by this \namendment. For 2003, it would provide a discretionary spending limit of \n$768.1 billion. That is precisely the same as the President's budget \nfor 2003. The President sent us a discretionary spending level of $768 \nbillion.\n  I have talked with Mr. Daniels this morning, the head of the Office \nof Management and Budget. He believes this number is too high by some \n$9 billion. Even though that is the President's number, even though \nthat is the number the President sent us, we have not adopted the \nPresident's policy because the President has proposed switching certain \naccounts from mandatory spending to discretionary spending. Those are \nthe retirement requirements of people in the Federal Government. In \nother words, he has proposed switching the retirement accounts that \ncome out of the budget of the various agencies from mandatory spending \nto discretionary spending.\n  Obviously, that would make discretionary spending more by $9 billion. \nThat is included in the President's proposal. We have not adopted that \npart of his proposal. Their argument is that would shift back to the \nmandatory side of the equation and reduce the $768 billion by $9 \nbillion. That is true. They are correct about that.\n  It is also true that their budget needs to be adjusted in a number of \nways, I believe, in order to secure passage in the Congress. The \nPresident has cut transportation funding, highway construction, and \nbridge construction by 27 percent, by $9 billion. We proposed adding \nback about two-thirds of that, about $6 billion. That money has to come \nfrom somewhere.\n  The President has proposed cutting law enforcement by over $1 \nbillion. I do not think that is realistic at a time when we face \nterrorist threats to the United States. The President has proposed a \nsmaller amount for education that is even provided for in his own No \nChild Left Behind legislation. That is going to have to be acknowledged \nand dealt with before we finish our work. We are not going to cut that \nprogram of No Child Left Behind that the President talked about all \nacross the country.\n  There are other provisions as well that are going to have to be \naddressed. We are going to need that $9 billion to meet the needs of \nthe country. Again, it still leaves us with an overall amount that is \nprecisely what the President sent us in his own budget.\n  In addition to that, there is a second year of budget caps, of \nrestrictions on what can be spent, and that amount is $786 billion. \nThat is about a 2-percent increase over this year. That is a very sharp \nrestriction on spending, especially given the fact we are under attack, \nespecially given the fact the President, no doubt, will be asking more \nfor defense, more for homeland security. But we have agreed to a cap \nthis year that is exactly the number the President sent us in his \nbudget, and we have agreed on a cap for spending for next year at $786 \nbillion, about a 2-percent increase over where we are now.\n  In addition, the amendment I have sent to the desk limits advance \nappropriations. This was raised as an issue by Members on the other \nside of the aisle. They wanted a restriction on advance appropriations, \nso we included that in this bill. And we have included another request \nfrom the other side of the aisle to establish a 1-year defense \nfirewall. What that means is, the money that is allocated for defense \nwould go for defense and could not be used for other purposes.\n\n  This amendment establishes a supermajority point of order in the \nSenate to enforce a defense/nondefense firewall in 2003. Again, this \nwas in response to requests from Members on the other side of the \naisle.\n  This is the circumstance we face that I think we need to keep in mind \nas we consider this amendment. Last year, the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us we could expect some $5.6 trillion of budget surpluses \nover the next decade. That is what we were told just a year ago--nearly \n$6 trillion of surpluses. Some of us questioned that. Some of us said: \nDo not rely on a 10-year forecast. There is too much risk associated \nwith that. But others said: No, there will even be more money. That is \nwhat we were told repeatedly.\n  Now we get to June of this year and look at the difference a year \nmakes. Not only do we not see any surpluses for the next decade, we see \ndeficits of some $600 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Where did the money go? This chart shows our analysis of what \nhappened to those surpluses, and the biggest chunk went for the tax \ncuts that were enacted last year and the additional tax cuts passed \nthis year.\n  Forty-three percent of the disappearance of the surplus went to tax \ncuts; 21 percent went to increased spending as a result of the attack \non this country--increased defense spending, increased homeland \nsecurity spending. That is where all of the increase has gone. Twenty-\none percent is from economic changes, that is, the economic slowdown \nthat occurred. That is where 21 percent of the disappearance of the \nsurplus occurred. And the last 14 percent is technical changes. \nLargely, those are underestimations of the cost of Medicare and \nMedicaid. That is where the money went, primarily to tax cuts; the next \nbiggest is increased spending as a result of the attack on the country; \nthe next biggest reason was the economic slowdown, and actually those \ntwo are equal; and the final and smallest reason is underestimations of \nthe cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  That is where we are. What it tells us, as we look over an extended \nperiod of time, a 10-year period going back to 1992 when we were in \ndeep deficit, and when the husband of the occupant of the chair came in \nas President of the United States and fashioned a 5-year plan in 1993 \nthat was very controversial to raise revenue and cut spending, we can \nsee that plan worked.\n  Each and every year, we were pulling ourselves out of deficit under \nthat plan. In 1997, we had a bipartisan plan that finished the job. As \na result, we emerged from deficit. We stopped using Social Security \nfunds for other purposes, and we were running surpluses, non-trust-fund \nsurpluses for 3 years.\n  Then last year we had the triple whammy: the tax cut that was too \nlarge, the attack on this country, and the economic slowdown. We can \nsee now that we are headed for deficits for the entire next decade. \nThat is Social Security money being taken to pay for\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nthe tax cuts, being taken to pay for other items.\n  In fact, we now estimate some $2 trillion will be taken from Social \nSecurity over the next decade to pay for the President's tax cuts and \nother spending initiatives. All of that matters, and it matters a lot \nbecause of where we are headed.\n  The leading edge of the baby boom generation starts to retire in 6 \nyears. It is hard to believe, but that is the reality. What that tells \nus is those surpluses in the trust funds that have helped us offset \nthese deep deficits are going to evaporate; in 2016 the Medicare trust \nfund is going to turn cash negative; and in 2017 the Social Security \ntrust fund is going to turn cash negative. Then it is going to be like \nfalling off a cliff.\n  This is a demographic time bomb that we are facing as a society. It \nis unlike anything we have ever faced before because always in our \nhistory the succeeding generation has been much larger than the \ngeneration retiring.\n  In very rapid fire order, the number of people who are eligible for \nSocial Security and Medicare are going to double. We are headed for a \ncircumstance in which there will only be two people working for every \nretiree. If that does not sober us, if that does not inform our \nactions, I do not know what it will take.\n  The first thing we need to do is get these budget spending caps in \nplace for next year and the year thereafter, and couple that with the \nbudget disciplines that give us the chance to fend off ideas for \ngreater spending and for more tax cuts that are not paid for. Yes, we \ncan have spending initiatives. They have to be paid for. We can have \nadditional tax cuts, but they have to be paid for; otherwise, we are \ngoing to dig this hole deeper and deeper.\n  There are real consequences to digging that hole deeper. Mr. Crippen, \nthe head of the Congressional Budget Office, told us that when he \nappeared before the Senate Budget Committee. He said, in response to a \nquestion from me:\n\n       Put more starkly, Mr. Chairman, the extremes of what will \n     be required to address our retirement are these: We'll have \n     to increase borrowing by very large, likely unsustainable \n     amounts; raise taxes to 30 percent of GDP, obviously \n     unprecedented in our history; or eliminate most of the rest \n     of the Government as we know it. That is the dilemma that \n     faces us in the long run, Mr. Chairman, and these next 10 \n     years will only be the beginning.\n\n  I do not know how to say this with more force or more persuasiveness, \nbut we are coming to another moment of truth on this journey in our \neconomic future. Some will rise and say this spending amount is too \nmuch; that $768 billion is $9 billion more than the President proposed, \neven though the $768 billion number is precisely the number the \nPresident sent us. Some will say we ought to wait. Some will say there \nis some other reason to be opposed.\n  Another moment of truth is coming very soon, and the question is, Are \nwe going to have the budget disciplines that otherwise are phased out \nat the end of September? Are we going to have those to discipline the \nprocess as we proceed this year? Are we going to have a budget number \nthat can inform the appropriations process as we proceed, a budget \nnumber, I again say, that is identical to the budget number the \nPresident sent us?\n  I am swift to acknowledge we have adopted his number but not his \npolicy. It is absolutely correct he wanted to switch $9 billion from \nmandatory spending to discretionary spending, and when we do not do \nthat, it allows us to use that $9 billion in a way different from the \nway he proposed.\n  I say to my colleagues, do they really want to adopt a 27-percent cut \nin highway and bridge construction that puts 350,000 people out of work \nin this country? I do not think that is the will of the Congress or the \nwill of the American people. We have proposed a reduction from what was \nspent last year but not as big a reduction as the President has \nproposed.\n\n  Are we really going to cut the COPS Program by over a billion dollars \nwhen we have a terrorist threat to this country?\n  Are we really going to take police off the street? I do not think so. \nAre we really going to cut the President's signature education program, \nNo Child Left Behind? I do not think so. Those are the fundamental \nissues that are before us now.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that not only is this a spending cap for \nthis year at the level the President proposed in his budget, but in \naddition to that, it is a spending cap for next year of $786 billion. \nThat is an increase of over 2 percent. That is very tight fiscal \nconstraint. I am ready to take the medicine to get us back on a course \nto fiscal responsibility, and I believe most of my colleagues are as \nwell.\n  This amendment is the product of weeks of negotiation between \nRepublicans and Democrats and is a good-faith effort to capture in an \namendment the positions of Democrats and Republicans on what should be \ncontained in the budget for this year and next; what the limits should \nbe on spending for this year and next; what should be the budget \ndisciplines that are continued so we have a way of enforcing fiscal \nrestraint, and it contains a 1-year defense firewall in the Senate, \nsomething requested by Members on the other side.\n  For those of us who believe it is critically important to have a \nbudget process in the Senate, for those of us who believe it is \ncritically important to have budget disciplines in place, this is our \nopportunity. This is our chance. It may not come again.\n  I urge my colleagues to very carefully consider their votes on this \nmeasure. This should not be a Republican vote or a Democratic vote. \nThis should be a vote for the country. This should be a vote for the \nSenate. This should be a vote that sends a signal we are serious about \nreestablishing fiscal discipline. This is a vote that should send a \nsignal that fiscal discipline matters to the economy of this country. \nThis should be a signal to the markets that this Congress is serious \nabout fiscal responsibility, and this should be a signal that while the \nPresident has asked for the second biggest increase in our debt in our \nNation's history, all of us are committed to getting back on track \ntowards a course of reducing the debt of the United States, especially \nin light of the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the pending amendment and the second \ndegree to it, as modified, are an effort to control spending and \nprotect the Social Security trust fund. That is what it is--pure and \nsimple--to control spending and, by doing so, also protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is obviously not a new idea.\n  What we are doing here is trying to extend a process that has worked, \nand worked pretty well, for most of the years since 1990. We are trying \nto give 2 more years of life to the process that helped us do something \nthat a lot of people didn't think could happen--balance the budget \nwithout using Social Security in both 1999 and 2000.\n  What we are trying to do is make sure there is some constraint on the \nsize of the Government.\n  I remind my colleagues, if we do not pass this amendment, if we do \nnot extend the budget process, then the vast majority of budget process \nconstraints will simply expire on September 30. Our failure to act will \nmean an almost complete absence of responsible budget limitations.\n  Again, what our amendment does is not something new. It just tries to \nkeep in place these limitations that made the good fiscal management of \nthis Government possible during the 1990s.\n  As we saw this deadline coming, this problem that will occur on \nSeptember 30 with the loss of the rules and constraints, what I have \ntried to do, with others, is work very hard to come to where we are \ntoday. Our amendment is not my idea alone, by any means. It is the \nresult of a collaborative effort extending over several months. \nStarting in March, my staff has been working with the staff of Senators \nfrom about a dozen Senate offices, half Republican and half Democratic. \nI followed up in a\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nnumber of meetings with Senators from other sides of the aisle, trying \nto build consensus. What we tried to do is get the strongest budget \nprocess we could.\n\n  My colleagues will recall that we tried to extend the caps for 5 \nyears in an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill that \nSenator Gregg and I offered on behalf of Senators Chafee, Kerry, \nVoinovich, McCain, and Cantwell. Half the Senate, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, actually voted for that amendment, but we were not able to \ngenerate the support necessary to get the 60 votes and have the \namendment actually adopted.\n  The amendment before us today is an effort to get the most done that \nwe can. For the first 2 years, it provides almost exactly the same cap \nlevels that were in the amendment of myself and Senator Gregg to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is my judgment, and the judgment \nof the bipartisan group of Senators with whom I worked to draft this \namendment, that this is as strong a budget process that the Senate will \nactually be able to pass this year. So that is what I am asking of my \ncolleagues--to do at least this much. Let's at least get this done. \nLet's at least preserve this much constraint and this kind of \nresponsibility, even though many of us would prefer more.\n  One of the reasons is because in the next decade the baby boom \ngeneration will begin to retire in large numbers. Starting in 2016, \nSocial Security will start redeeming the bonds it holds and the non-\nSocial Security Government will have to start paying for those bonds \nfrom non-Social Security surpluses. Starting in 2016, the Government \nwill have to show restraint in the non-Social Security budget so we can \npay the Social Security benefits that Americans have already earned or \nwill have already earned by that time. If we keep adding to the Federal \ndebt, we will simply add to the burden to be borne by the taxpayers of \nthe coming decade and decades thereafter. That is all we are really \ndoing. It has been said in many political speeches, but it is true--we \nare just leaving them the bill. We are not doing our job. We are not \nshowing responsibility, if that is how we leave things.\n  Of course, September 11 changed our priorities in many ways, \nincluding how our Government spends money. But September 11 does not \nchange the oncoming requirements of Social Security. As an economist \nhas said: ``Demographics is destiny.'' We can either prepare for that \ndestiny or we can fail to prepare for it.\n  To get the Government out of the business of using Social Security \nsurpluses to fund other Government spending, we have to strengthen our \nbudget process. That is what this amendment does. That is why we urge \nour colleagues to support it.\n  We have sought to advance a goal that has a long and bipartisan \nhistory, and I would like to just recite a little of that history. In \nhis January 1998 State of the Union Address, President Clinton called \non the Government to ``save Social Security first.'' That is also what \nPresident George W. Bush said in a March 2001 radio address. In his \nwords, we need to ``keep the promise of Social Security and keep the \nGovernment from raiding the Social Security surplus.'' That is what \nPresident Bush said. It is what the Republican leader, Senator Lott, \nsaid on the Senate floor in June 1999 when he said:\n\n       Social Security taxes should be used for Social Security \n     and only for Social Security--not for any other brilliant \n     idea we may have.\n\n  It is what Senator Domenici said in April of 2000 when he said:\n\n       I suggest that the most significant fiscal policy change \n     made to this point--to the benefit of Americans of the future \n     . . . is that all of the Social Security surplus stays in the \n     Social Security fund. . . .\n\n  Yes, we should stop using Social Security surpluses to fund the rest \nof Government because it is the moral thing to do; for every dollar we \nadd to the Federal debt is another dollar our children must pay back in \nhigher taxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  I do not think our children's generation will forgive us if we fail \nin our fiscal responsibility today. History will not forgive us if we \nfail to act. We must balance the budget, we must stop accumulating \ndebts for future generations to pay, and we have to stop robbing our \nchildren of their own choices.\n  We have got to make our own choices. We are doing that today. Let's \nnot take away from these kids their right to make their own choices in \ntheir time because we have locked up all the money and we cannot pay \nthe Social Security benefits.\n  The amendment before us today, I am pretty sure, is the best, last \nhope to do this this year. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has \nissued a paper that concludes as follows:\n\n       These proposals, No. 1, are likely to be workable because \n     they extend enforcement tools that have worked in the past; \n     No. 2, are evenhanded because they treat spending increases \n     and tax cuts in the same fashion, without favoring one or the \n     other; and, No. 3, set targets that appear realistic and thus \n     are more likely not to be blown away by subsequent \n     congressional action.\n\n  This analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy is their view of \nthis amendment. It is a positive analysis.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of this analysis be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, June 20, 2002]\n\n The Feingold Amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill: A Workable \n           and Responsible Strengthening of Fiscal Discipline\n\n       Senator Feingold's amendment to the Defense authorization \n     bill would establish tight but realistic caps on \n     appropriations for 2003 and 2004, extend for five years the \n     requirement that tax and entitlement legislation be paid for, \n     and extend supermajority enforcement of congressional budget \n     plans for five years. These proposals: (1) are likely to be \n     workable because they extend enforcement tools that have \n     worked in the past; (2) are evenhanded because they treat \n     spending increases and tax cuts in the same fashion, without \n     favoring one or the other; and (3) set targets that appear \n     realistic and are thus more likely not to be blown away by \n     subsequent congressional action.\n       Key Budget Enforcement Tools are Due to Expire This \n     September 30. Four key tools to enforce budget discipline are \n     scheduled to expire September 30, 2002. If these provisions \n     expire, Congress will find it much easier to increase \n     appropriations and entitlements by unlimited amounts and cut \n     taxes by unlimited amounts. The clear risk is that the large \n     deficits we are currently experiencing would grow even larger \n     rather than decline, leaving the budget in a weak position at \n     just the wrong time--right before the baby boom generation \n     retires and places still greater pressure on the budget. \n     Allowing all these budget enforcement tools to expire could \n     set the stage for highly undisciplined budgeting in the \n     coming months and years.\n       Congressional Budget Targets. The budget targets in \n     Congressional budget plans are currently enforced by points \n     of order that can only be waived by 60 votes. This means that \n     appropriations and entitlement bills cannot spend more than \n     is provided for in the Congressional budget resolution and \n     tax cuts cannot exceed the level of tax cuts the \n     Congressional budget resolution allows, unless 60 Senators \n     agree. Starting October 1, however, excessive appropriation \n     bills, excessive entitlement increases, and excessive tax \n     cuts can all be agreed to by simple majority vote. The \n     Feingold Amendment keeps these vital 60-vote enforcement \n     mechanisms in place for another five years.\n       Discretionary Caps. Currently, a statute requires the \n     President to cut appropriations bills across-the-board if, at \n     the end of a session, those bills have breached dollar \n     ``caps,'' or upper limits, set in statute. This law worked \n     well for eight years--from 1991 through 1998--but then was \n     evaded through gimmicks or set aside by statute for the last \n     four years because the caps established in 1997 proved \n     unrealistically tight. The entire mechanism of caps and \n     across-the-board cuts (called ``sequestration'') expires on \n     September 30 and so does not apply to FY 2003 appropriations \n     bills. The Feingold amendment renews the mechanism for \n     another five years and sets caps for 2003 and 2004 (no such \n     caps currently exist). The 2003-2004 caps in this amendment \n     are at the levels in the recent Gregg-Feingold amendment and \n     are tight but probably realistic.\n       The Senate Pay-As-You-Go Rule. Currently, a point of order \n     waivable by 60 votes lies against legislation that would \n     increase the cost of entitlements or reduce revenues unless \n     these costs are offset over 1, 5, and 10 years, except to the \n     extent that a budget surplus is projected outside Social \n     Security. This rule expires September 30; the Feingold \n     Amendment would renew it for another five years.\n       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Rule. Under current law, a \n     statute requires the President to cut a selected list of \n     entitlement programs across the board if, at the end of a \n     session, OMB determines that tax and entitlement legislation \n     has not been fully offset for the coming fiscal year, i.e., \n     if entitlement increases and tax cuts have not been ``paid \n     for.'' This mechanism worked well from 1991 through 1998 but \n     broke down when surpluses appeared; Congress wrote ad hoc \n     provisions\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\n     setting it aside. Starting October 1, the mechanism \n     effectively expires even though deficits have returned--new \n     entitlement increases and tax cuts will not have to be paid \n     for. The Feingold Amendment renews for five years the \n     requirement that such legislation must be paid for, while \n     turning off this requirement if the Treasury reports that a \n     year has been completed in which the budget outside Social \n     Security was in surplus.\n       The Feingold Amendment Sets Appropriations Targets For This \n     Year That Can Be Enforced By The Senate. In addition to the \n     extension of the four enforcement mechanisms discussed above, \n     the Feingold Amendment responds to the particular situation \n     faced by the Senate this year because a new congressional \n     budget plan has not been agreed to. While last year's \n     congressional budget plan continues to govern entitlement and \n     tax legislation, it does not govern appropriations. This \n     means that, as soon as the Appropriations Committee is ready, \n     the Senate can begin consideration of appropriations bills at \n     any funding level and pass them by majority vote. The \n     Feingold Amendment would address this problem by requiring 60 \n     votes for any 2003 appropriations bill that exceeds its \n     allocation. The allocations for all the appropriations bills \n     combined must not exceed the statutory cap the Feingold \n     Amendment sets.\n\n\n            How Tight Are the Feingold Appropriations Caps?\n\n       If caps are too loose, they do not constitute fiscal \n     discipline. Experience also demonstrates that caps fail to \n     impose fiscal discipline if they are set unrealistically \n     tight. In that event, the caps are inevitably breached, which \n     can lead to a free-for-all on appropriations.\n       The Feingold caps are tight but realistic. They equal the \n     levels for 2003 and 2004 in the Gregg-Feingold amendment \n     offered three weeks ago. If Congress provides the defense and \n     homeland security increases the President has requested, as \n     appears very likely, these caps would require a reduction in \n     FY 2003 funding for all other discretionary programs of $5 \n     billion below the CBO baseline level--i.e., below the FY 2002 \n     level adjusted for inflation. (It may be said that the \n     proposed FY 2003 cap would be $36 billion above the 2000 \n     level adjusted for inflation. This is true, but the \n     President's defense and homeland security levels are $41 \n     billion above the 2002 levels adjusted for inflation. \n     Assuming the defense and homeland security requests are \n     funded, everything else would have to be cut $5 billion below \n     the CBO baseline.)\n       These figures constitute restraint. If figures much tighter \n     are agreed to, either the President will not receive his full \n     defense and homeland security increases, or, more likely, the \n     caps will be maneuvered around when appropriations battles \n     heat up because the cuts required in other programs will be \n     too large to be politically achieveable. If that occurs, the \n     attempt at restraint will fail and, as has been the case over \n     the last few years, no effective cap will be in operation.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Conrad \nsecond-degree amendment be agreed to; that the time until 3 p.m. today \nbe for debate with respect to the Feingold amendment, as amended, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled by the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that during this time, whenever Senator Gramm of Texas \nraises a Budget Act point of order against the amendment, and a motion \nto waive the point of order is made, the Senate vote on the motion to \nwaive at 3 p.m., without further intervening action or debate; provided \nthat no other amendments or motions be in order prior to a vote on the \nmotion to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the second-degree amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3916), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3915\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wish to explain why I am opposed to \nthis amendment, why I intend to raise a point of order against it, and \nwhy I believe that point of order should be sustained.\n  Let me begin by saying we have not adopted a budget this year. A \nbudget has never been brought to the floor of the Senate during this \nsession of Congress. We have not been in a similar position since 1974. \nWe are now being asked on a Defense authorization bill to have the \nSenate commit to a budget figure outside the budget process. In fact, \nthe point of order arises because we are basically going outside the \nbudget process and dealing with an amendment that was not reported by \nthe Budget Committee.\n  In doing so, we would be committing the Senate to a level of spending \nthat next year is $9 billion more than the President requested and $52 \nbillion more than we spent last year. We would be going on record as \nagreeing to setting a constraint under which we could spend $25 billion \nthis year that would not be counted until the following year.\n  In other words, we could actually spend $25 billion more than the $9 \nbillion more that we are committing above the level the President \nrequested by what is called advanced appropriations. I do not believe \nthe Senate should lock itself into a budget that has not been approved \nby the Budget Committee. We had a vote on that budget that was brought \nup on another bill. Nobody voted for it--not one Democrat or one \nRepublican. We are now being asked to commit to a figure of $9 billion \nabove the President's, $52 million above last year, with the ability to \nget around that constraint by spending $25 billion in advanced \nappropriations. Last year was the largest level of advanced \nappropriations in American history, and that was $23 billion. This \nwould set a new global record. And I do not believe this represents \ngood policy.\n  This is adamantly opposed by the President. OMB has notified Members \ntoday that they are opposed to it. There is no possibility the House \nwill agree to this. I say to any of my colleagues who are tempted by \nthis and by the thought that any kind of budget numbering process is \nbetter than none, the bottom line is the House will never agree to \nthis. What they would be doing in the process would be committing to a \nlevel of spending $9 billion above the level the President requested, \nwith a $25 billion advanced appropriation escape hatch.\n  I do not believe this is a good deal. I wish we had more than an \nopportunity to offer an amendment, but a consensus among Members that \nwhen we didn't adopt a budget, we needed a permanent budget enforcement \nprocess. This would give us the process but at numbers that are grossly \nbeyond the level the President requested and far beyond the numbers I \ncould ever support.\n  So I hope my colleagues will sustain this budget point of order. I \ndon't think it is good for the Senate to be trying to write a partial \nbudget on a Defense authorization bill instead of bringing a budget up \nand debating it and amending it. The amendment will be subject to \namendment if we do not sustain the point of order. There will be \namendments offered. I will offer amendments if we do not sustain the \nbudget point of order.\n  Let me reiterate briefly that this is $9 billion more than the \nPresident requested, $52 million more than we spent last year. This \nwould have advanced appropriations of $25 billion, which would be the \nlargest in American history, that would be sanctioned under this \nagreement. The White House is adamantly opposed to this amendment. The \nHouse will never accept this amendment. Therefore, it cannot and will \nnot become binding.\n  I urge colleagues to sustain the budget point of order. This is a \nbudget point of order with a purpose. Sometimes these budget points of \norder represent sort of a ``gotcha'' kind of circumstance, where they \napply, but the logic of them is kind of convoluted. They are almost \naccidental. The budget point of order I raise is not accidental. It \nsays that an amendment that alters the budget process has to come \nthrough the orderly process of being reported by the Budget Committee \nor else it is subject to a point of order.\n  I remind my colleagues that we are under a unanimous consent request. \nSo by making the point of order now, I am not cutting off anybody's \ndebate. That will continue until 3 o'clock. I say that so everybody \nunderstands exactly where we are.\n  The pending amendment contains matter within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on the Budget, and it has been offered to a measure that was \nnot reported from the Budget Committee. I therefore raise a point of \norder against amendment No. 3915 pursuant to section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\n  Let me ask the Parliamentarian a question. Is 3915 the right number, \ngiven they have merged the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 3915, as amended.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I make that point of order against the \npending amendment under section 306.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there a time \nlimit on the situation with which we are confronted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The time is evenly divided up until 3 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then we must proceed to a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Who is in charge of the time in favor of the amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes remain for the sponsors.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I have 20?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, it is not often I would come to the \nfloor on a Thursday afternoon when a Defense authorization bill is \nbefore us and join in an amendment offered by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the other side, who has failed to produce a budget \nresolution heretofore. I believe his side of the aisle had a \nresponsibility to do that. They did not do it. That is not the end of \nthe world.\n  We are today confronted with that situation. The truth of the matter \nis that there will be an awful lot of Senators pondering the \nappropriations process and wondering whether Senator Phil Gramm from \nTexas, who knows an awful lot about this, is right when he speaks of \nthe dangers to America of authorizing a budget produced by the \nCongress, not the President, which would exceed the President's annual \nappropriation by $9 billion.\n  My friend from Texas makes that appear to be a very big issue. Let me \nsuggest that I would not join in producing an alternative to a \ncongressional budget that would permit us to spend between $9 billion \nand $10 billion more than the President in appropriations if I did not \nsee down the road something a lot more onerous than a congressional \nattempt not only to limit spending for each of the next 2 years, but \nalso to insert the points of order that are going to keep this Congress \nfrom going absolutely wild on entitlement spending during the ensuing \nmonths.\n  I think I could say this is going to be a year without any \nrestraints, if it were the $9 billion we were arguing about. But I tell \nyou, that is not it. For all the Senators who have been praying for the \nday when there is no longer a Budget Act, they thought they would be \nconfronting appropriations bills run wild. But the truth of the matter \nis, it is the entitlement programs that are coming to us during the \nnext 4 months, until October 1, that will have no constraints on them \nand no 60-vote points of order, which have saved the American people \nand this Congress from hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of \noutyear, next year expenditures.\n  For formal purposes, the Senator ought to put my name on the \namendment as a cosponsor. This amendment sets caps that is expenditure \nlimitations--for 2003 and 2004 with a Defense firewall in the Senate \nbut only for 2003, and that is good enough. That means in the Senate we \nwill not spend Defense money for domestic programs, but neither will we \nspend the opposite. We will not spend domestic money for Defense \nprograms. That is what a wall means.\n  White House, before you get on the telephone and do what Senator Phil \nGramm said you have done, Mr. President--our President, down on \nPennsylvania Avenue--before you say to all the Republicans, ``Vote \nagainst this,'' let me make a couple points for you.\n  One, this is not your budget, Mr. President--I am speaking of our \nPresident down at the White House. It is not your budget. You have a \nbudget. The law of America says you produce a budget. I do not know \nwhat would happen if you did not, Mr. President, but you did.\n  Then it says in another place in the law that Congress passes a \nbudget, and that congressional budget is for the use by the Congress in \ntheir attempting to get their priorities adopted by the Congress. And, \nMr. President, if I were you, I would say: Congress, pass the best one \nyou can, but remember, that does not mean I am going to sign every bill \nyou produce.\n  The President still has the veto threat on every appropriations bill, \nif that is what he wants.\n  I submit to you, Mr. President, my friend down on Pennsylvania \nAvenue, just because the Senator from Texas has talked about the \nravages of his $9 billion that we might spend in excess of your \nappropriations, just remember, you can vitiate every one of those with \nnegotiations in the appropriations bills and a veto just like you have \ntoday. We cannot change your veto authority.\n  We have proceeded in a realistic manner with one of two alternatives, \nand listen up, there are not 20, there are 1 or 2. Do we do this, which \nis a half-baked budget resolution? It is half-baked because you did not \ndo your job, half-baked because you did not do your job because you \nwere supposed to produce a budget resolution, and you should not make \nup your mind that it is too tough this year so we will not do it. I \nheard somebody on that side say that. That is not the law.\n  For 27 years, when I was either chairman or ranking member, we \nproduced a budget every single year, no matter how tough it was, no \nmatter who had to vote on issues on which they did not want to vote. \nSenator Baker sat right there on that table with the appearance of a \nBuddha, and every Republican who came up, the Buddha would say--and 37 \ntimes the Buddha won.\n  We did precisely what the Republicans wanted to do to move our \ncountry ahead. You did not have that. That is not my fault. That is \nyour fault. But it isn't America that ought to suffer from it, nor \nshould Congress be put in a position where they cannot do any work.\n  I have come to the conclusion it is a lot better to get caps, and \nthey are at pretty meaningful levels. Next year's are pretty low. The \none for the budget we are writing today is $9 billion to $10 billion \nover the President's, and I submit when all this day is gone and the \nrhetoric has simmered down, it is going to be very difficult, even with \nour President with his pen in hand waiting to veto, it is going to be \nvery difficult to come out of this spending less than the amount that \nwe put in these caps. I hope we can. I will be there attempting to \nenforce them, for what it is worth. The truth is, those caps are better \nthan none, and the President retains his veto authority.\n\n  For the defense of America, for which you asked us for so much money, \nMr. President, we put all that money in and we got a firewall, meaning \nyou cannot spend defense money for anything else. That is a very \nimportant budget consideration.\n  We set limits on advance appropriations consistent with what we \nwanted on this side when we met.\n  We extend the 60-vote budget points of order, including the pay-as-\nyou-go.\n  We eliminated a gimmick regarding the crime victims fund, and I think \nyou all have seen that and concurred with it. We showed it to you 10 \ndays ago.\n  I do not know if 3 o'clock is enough time, or quarter of 3, but I \nthink it is. If somebody wants more time and we need to explain it \nbetter, or I need to explain it to my side better, just come down and \nask for some time. I think we will get it.\n  I repeat, I want to talk to two situations for the next 2 minutes. I \nsay to my fellow Senators, through no fault of this side of the aisle, \nwe are in a real predicament today. If we let a whole batch of bills \nget through and do not put some points of order and some budget-like \npoints of order and some caps on how much you can spend after which the \nexpenditure bills get hit--we have to do that. We cannot sit here and \nwatch this all go down the river, with the economy already in \nsputtering shape.\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\n  Second, the President of the United States does not lose anything in \nterms of his power, his strength. If anything, he gains a potential for \norderliness in the Senate and House as we finish our business that we \nmight not have but for the adoption of this amendment.\n  My last remarks: I do not know that this is the best bill on which to \nput this, but I do not know which bill is next. It is sort of the \nchicken and egg. The appropriators are waiting for the number. We are \nsaying: You know the number. Let's bring an appropriations bill up and \nwe will put this on it.\n  Others are saying that is too late if you do that. So here is a big \nauthorizing bill. If we approve this--and I urge that we do; Senator \nStevens, if he had time, would be here concurring in this, pledging to \nstick to the numbers--if we approve this, we can put it on another bill \nlater if, as a matter of fact, this defense bill does not pass or gets \ntied up in a conference that takes too long.\n  If anybody wants any further explanation, I will do it here on the \nfloor and seek time, or I will meet them wherever they like and show \nthem what we have done. I believe we might turn somebody. Thanks to \nSenator Feingold for his courage, and Senator Gregg who is with the \nSenator on this amendment. If he is not, we must ask him to be a \ncosponsor because he had a lot to do with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, be added as a cosponsor of the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 and \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank my colleague. We have heard some \narguments advanced by the Senator from Texas as to why Members should \nnot vote for this amendment. The Senator has said this has not gone \nthrough the budget process. I reject that argument by the Senator from \nTexas. The fact is the numbers that are before us are exactly the \nnumbers that passed the Senate Budget Committee on the budget \nresolution that I took through the committee. That is a fact.\n  The fact is, I reported out of the Budget Committee, pursuant to the \nbudget I proposed, $768.1 billion in discretionary spending for this \nyear. That is precisely the same as what was in the President's budget. \nIt is true we did not adopt his policy. We did adopt his number.\n  The Senator says this is outside what the Budget Committee has \nrecommended. It is not outside what the Budget Committee has \nrecommended. It is precisely what the Budget Committee recommended in \nthe resolution I offered--$768 billion this year, $786 billion next \nyear. Where is the money going? I say to my colleagues who think that \nis too much money, here is where the money is going: Last year we spent \n$710 billion. The President has asked for, and we have agreed to, a $45 \nbillion increase for national defense, every penny of it requested by \nthe President of the United States.\n\n  The President asked for an additional $5.4 billion for homeland \nsecurity. We have endorsed that, every penny of it requested by the \nPresident of the United States. Now there is another $7 billion, $7 \nbillion on a base last year of $710 billion. That is a 1-percent \nincrease available for all the other functions of Government, after the \nincrease asked for by the President for defense, after the increase \nasked for by the President for homeland security.\n  If we look at the amount of money that is in this budget for this \nyear, the $768 billion, we have provided for the year thereafter an \nincrease of $18.4 billion. That is an increase of 2 percent, and that \nis precisely what was in the budget resolution that passed the \ncommittee. It is true, we have not yet considered a budget resolution \non the floor of the Senate. That is not unprecedented for June. There \nhave been many times we have not concluded work on a budget. In fact, 4 \nyears ago, we never did complete work on a budget through the whole \nprocess.\n  So we know the reality. We know what has occurred in the past. The \nfact is, we have passed a budget resolution through the committee. The \nbudget numbers that are in that document are the numbers that are \nbefore us today. They represent serious constraint on spending for both \nthis coming year and the year thereafter.\n  When the Senator from Texas says there is a $50 billion increase over \nlast year, it is actually a $58 billion increase. But where is it? \nAgain, I remind my colleagues, it is in defense; $45 billion of the \nincrease is in national defense, every penny of it requested by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Is the Senator from Texas saying he is against that increase in \ndefense? And $5.4 billion is an increase in homeland security, every \npenny requested by the President of the United States. Is the Senator \nfrom Texas against that increase in homeland security requested by the \nPresident of the United States? The only other money is $7 billion for \neverything else, a 1-percent increase.\n  Let's get serious about budgets and let's get serious about what is \nbeing discussed. The Senator from Texas raises advanced appropriations. \nAdvanced appropriations have been done for many years. Why? Because the \nschool year does not fit the fiscal year of the Federal Government. The \nFederal fiscal year ends at the end of September. Everybody knows the \nschool year does not end until May or June. So advanced appropriations \nwere adopted to fit the reality of the school year in America. There is \nnothing wrong about that. There is nothing wrong with that at all.\n  The Senator from Texas says the House will never agree. That is not \nour job, to write a budget that agrees with the House. Our \nresponsibility is to write a budget for this Chamber. We will then \nnegotiate with the House on an overall agreement. The first thing we \nhave to do is reach a conclusion in this Chamber.\n  What we are proposing, once again, for discretionary spending for \nfiscal year 2003, is exactly the same number the President sent up in \nhis budget, $768 billion. That is what was in my mark that passed \nthrough the Budget Committee and that is what we are proposing. It is \ntrue it is not the same policy as the President proposed. He proposed a \ndifferent way of spending the money, but he proposed exactly that same \nnumber.\n\n  I am proud of the way the Budget Committee has performed. The Budget \nCommittee had dozens of hearings and produced a responsible document, \none that restrains spending, one that did not contain a tax increase or \nany delay in the scheduled tax cuts, but one that also called on the \nCongress to put in place a circuitbreaker mechanism so that next year \nit will be a responsibility of the Budget Committee to come before our \ncolleagues with a plan to stop the raid on Social Security.\n  The Budget Committee had more debt reduction than the President \nproposed, less deficits than the President proposed and said that \nadditional tax cuts can be had, but they ought to be paid for, and to \nput in place serious restraint on spending, not only for this year but \nin the years following.\n  I am proud of that budget resolution. I am proud of the parts of it \nthat are before us now, that give our colleagues a real opportunity to \nchoose. Are we going to have a budget for this coming year and budget \ncaps for the next year? Are we going to have a continuation of the \nbudget disciplines that are critically important to keep this process \nfrom spinning out of control or are we not? That is the choice that is \nbefore the body.\n  I want to again thank my colleague from Wisconsin who has been a \nvalued member of the Budget Committee and who came to the floor with \nsomething he negotiated on both sides of the aisle. I then became \ninvolved with him in an effort and we have negotiated with many more \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. I think we have a responsible \npackage, and our colleagues are going to have a chance to vote in a few \nmoments. I hope they will carefully consider the implications of a \nfailure to pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in this modern age, we are used to \nrevisionist history, but I have to say the debate we just heard is one \nof the most extraordinary examples of revisionist history I have ever \nheard. I am tempted to get into this debate about this wonderful budget \nthat when it was voted on not one Democrat voted for it and not one \nRepublican voted for it. That is a vote of confidence, or lack thereof, \nwhich I have never witnessed before.\n  The budget that was rejected without a single vote in favor was a \nbudget that set taxes above the level requested by the President the \nfirst year, the first 5 years, the first 10 years, and consistently \nspent more money. In fact, it raided Social Security in the first year \nmore than the President's budget, even though it had taxes higher than \nthe level requested by the President because it increased spending by \nover $13 billion. But that is an old debate. Why debate a budget that \nwas rejected unanimously?\n  Now we are on another debate, and it is a wonderful debate because we \nhave our colleagues who are saying we want to control spending, we are \nworried about spending, and we need this budget to control spending. \nThere is only one problem. The budget increases spending. The budget \nproposes spending $9 billion above what the President requested.\n  This amendment before us proposes spending $52 billion above last \nyear, and it does not stop with spending $9 billion more than the \nPresident wants. That kind of budget constraint we have had a lot of. \nIt not only spends $9 billion more than the President wants, but it \nallows $25.4 billion to be appropriated this year that won't count \nuntil next year, what is called advanced appropriations. Last year, we \nset a record in American history with $23 billion. This year, in this \namendment, we would condone in advance $25.4 billion, but that is not \nthe worst of it. We have had a budget provision that banned delayed \nobligations.\n  Senator Domenici was a big proponent of this provision, as I \nremember. This was to try to deal with this phony little game we play \nby starting a program on the last day of the fiscal year and claiming \nin the budget that it costs one-three hundred and sixty-fifth as much \nas it really does, and then have it permanently in effect.\n  Interestingly enough, not only does this amendment spend $9 billion \nmore than the President requested, not only does it say you can spend \n$25 billion more than that, it gets us back in the game of deferred \nobligations by striking subsections (a) through (f), (h), and (i) of \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 290. That is the section that deals with \ndeferred obligations.\n  This doesn't have to be belabored. This is not about controlling \nspending. This is about spending. This is about force-feeding the \nPresident and making the President take $9 billion more than he \nrequested, setting up a procedure where we will spend $25 billion more \nthan that, which will not count because it will be spent next year, and \nthen allowing us to get into the game of spending it, but deferring the \nspending until a point where it doesn't count. This is an issue about \nspending, and this point of order is about controlling spending.\n  The President has not been silent on this. Last night he spoke. I \nwill read what he said:\n\n       I know there's going to be some tough choices on these \n     appropriations bills, but I want to make sure that everybody \n     understands with clarity that the budget the House passed is \n     the limit of spending for the United States Congress.\n\n  If we adopt this amendment, we will be saying the President wants $9 \nbillion less, but we are going to go on record saying we are going to \nspend $9 billion more. I will be with the President on this issue. \nOther Members will have to decide where they are.\n  We have a letter dated today from the OMB Director, and I will read \npart of it:\n\n       It is my understanding that the Senate will continue \n     consideration today of two pending amendments regarding \n     budget enforcement--a Feingold amendment and a Reid/Conrad \n     amendment. I ask that you strongly oppose these amendments \n     and encourage your colleagues to oppose them as well.\n       Both amendments would lock in a spending cap that is much \n     too high--over $19 billion more than the President's budget \n     request.\n       Budget enforcement in Congress is vital and necessary but \n     enforcement at the wrong number could be even more \n     detrimental to our budget outlook.\n\n  Now, if we had not waived the budget last week, maybe I would take \nthis seriously. If 60 Members of this body had not last week voted to \nwaive the Budget Act to spend more money, maybe I would take this thing \nseriously. But I don't take it seriously. We rejected making the death \ntax permanent. This amendment would spend nine times as much money next \nyear as making the death tax penalty permanent would have cost.\n  Our colleagues do not have a nickel, they do not have a penny, to let \nworking people keep more of what they earn, but they have billions to \nspend. They never, ever, have enough to let working people keep what \nthey earn, but they have always got plenty to spend.\n  This is an effort to bust the President's budget. This is an effort \nto mandate that we set a budget $9 billion above the President's level. \nThis is a proposal that would let us back into the gimmick business on \ndeferred obligations. This is a budget that would let us advance \nappropriate--which is spending money but not counting it until another \nyear--at a level unprecedented in American history. The President does \nnot want this. OMB has asked that we oppose it. I hope my colleagues \nwill oppose it. But I hope they will understand, whether they oppose it \nor whether they support it, that this amendment is not about budget \ncontrol. This amendment is about spending, pure and simple. If you want \nto spend more, you want this amendment.\n\n  Now, I am not saying it is going to be easy in the budget process not \nhaving a budget. But we don't have a budget. We have not passed a \nbudget, and I don't believe we are going to see one brought to the \nfloor. People are proud of the budget resolution considered in the \nBudget Committee, but not proud enough to bring it to the floor to \ndebate it, amend it, and vote on it.\n  The President has said he will veto appropriations that violate his \nbudget and the budget adopted by the House. What this amendment would \ndo would be to legitimize $9 billion in additional spending. That is \nwhat it does.\n  Last week, we voted to waive the same points of order to spend money. \nWe have done it over and over again. What we are doing here is \nlegitimizing more spending. If you don't want to do it, you want to \nvote and sustain this point of order. Those who want to waive the point \nof order will have to have 60 votes. Maybe they have it. I pointed out \nearlier, this is not going to become law. I don't think it ought to be \npassed by the Senate. I don't think we ought to be slapping the \nPresident of the United States in the face today.\n  When the President last night said he was going to hold the line on \nhis budget, to then turn around and do this is to say: You say you are \ngoing to hold the line, but we are not going to let you do it.\n  Count me with the man. Count me with the President. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  I hope when people cast this vote, they won't be confused. I hope \nthey will understand. This is not about budget points of order that we \njust waived last week. This is not about process. This is about \nspending $9 billion more spending next year, $25 billion more spending \nabove that in advanced appropriations, and an unlimited amount of \nspending through a gimmick. I don't understand why people who support \nthe budget process, after all our effort to get rid of these delayed \nobligations, can support this amendment. I am sure our colleagues \nremember the games that were played where we started a program on \nSeptember 30 of a year so that it becomes law but you only count 1 day \nof the spending. Why anybody could say this is about controlling \nspending and could have an amendment that strikes the point of order on \ndeferred obligation, I don't understand. This is about spending, pure \nand simple.\n  Don't be confused. If you are for spending, if you are against the \nPresident, then vote to waive the budget point of order. But if you are \nwith the President, if you are against all this spending, if you think \nit has to end somewhere, end it right here today. Let's stop this \nprocess today. Do not add $9 billion more than the President asked \ntoday. Do not spend $25 billion\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nbeyond that in advanced appropriations today. And do not let Congress \nback in the gimmick business today. Vote to sustain the point of order.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as required.\n  The Senator from Texas knows very well that my goal in working on \nthis amendment has nothing to do with trying to upset the President's \nbudget. We have talked together, worked together on the Budget \nCommittee, and he knows exactly what I and other Members are trying to \ndo. We think there ought to be some rules, there ought to be some caps, \nthere ought to be some budget discipline. I don't think he could point \nto one shred of information or comment I have made throughout the \nmonths to suggest it has anything to do at all with trying to disrupt \nthe President.\n  I remember welcoming the comments of the OMB Director when he \nsuggested some aspects of what we were trying to do made sense. I will \nwork with anybody on this in order to get it done, because in the 10 \nyears I have been in the Senate, we have had rules, we have had budgets \ndisciplines, and they have had good results. Sometimes when the \nDemocrats were in the majority, and sometimes when the Republicans were \nin the majority, at least on this issue, I have seen this body \nfunction, and function well, but only because there were caps, only \nbecause there were rules and because there were enforcement mechanisms.\n  The Senator from Texas complains we are doing this outside of the \nbudget process. I agree with him. This is not the ideal way to do this. \nBut he knows why. He saw the efforts we made in the Budget Committee \nand the difficulties we had. We could not get it done there. It is not \nmy idea to have to do it on the Defense bill.\n  The Senator says, even if the Senate were considering the budget \nresolution, that the resolution could not have accomplished the \nextension of the budget process that our amendment would do. But the \nSenator from Texas knows that a budget resolution, unlike this one, \ncannot constitutionally bind the President or his OMB. We have to pass \na law, not just a resolution to extend the Budget Act.\n  I would say nobody in the history of the Senate knows this better \nthan the Senator from Texas, who is very famous across this country for \npassing statutes to control Government spending. A statute has much \nmore enforcement power than simply doing it on a budget resolution.\n  The Senator also suggests this is not going to go anywhere because \nthe House will not accept it. I certainly agree with my chairman, \nSenator Conrad. The one thing that makes sure nothing happens is if we \ndo not do anything at all in the Senate. If we send a message to the \nHouse that we do not need rules and disciplines, that is an invitation \nto them to do nothing.\n  On the other hand, if we do something here, and even though the \nSenator from Texas knows it is much less than I wanted to do at the \nbeginning, and less than he wanted to do, maybe it will put a little \npressure on the other body. Maybe they will hear from their \nconstituents, who will say: At least in the Senate they still believe \nthere ought to be some limits and some caps and some rules. Why don't \nyou folks in the House do the same thing?\n  If we do nothing, there is no pressure on them. As the chairman \nindicated, if we at least put a marker down here, put something in this \nbill that suggests some limits and some rules, we have a chance that \nsomething will come through in a conference report that will achieve \nbipartisan limitation on this.\n  We have now heard arguments about the levels in our amendment being \ntoo high. We also heard arguments that they are too low. In this \nrespect the debate is taking on sort of the hallmarks of any debate to \nset a level. There is always going to be disagreement about the amount. \nBut let's be clear about the amount in this 2-year period. The chairman \nof the committee has indicated we have sought to use what I believe to \nbe the most neutral starting point. The number for 2003 is what the \nBudget Committee reported. It is what we included in the Gregg-Feingold \namendment, for which 49 Senators voted, including the Senator from \nTexas. On June 5, he voted for these exact 2-year limitations. I admit \nthere were 3 other years there on top of it, but he did vote for these \nfigures for those 2 years.\n  It is also the most neutral and most appropriate figure because it is \nour best estimate, as the chairman has pointed out, of what the \nPresident's budget request actually requires, what it really is when \nyou cut away the gimmicks and see what the real number is.\n  I think this is a consensus number that is reasonable. As the Senator \nfrom Texas knows, he and I have worked together in various meetings to \ntry to have an even stronger budget process. We have tried to draft \namendments, and we reached agreement on a budget process amendment \nthat, had it been enacted, would have created powerful incentives to \nreduce the deficit and further protect Social Security. I stood ready \nand I stand ready to work with him to tighten fiscal discipline. In the \nbattle for fiscal responsibility, I want the Senator from Texas to know \nI am and will be his ally.\n\n  But as the Senator from Texas also knows, we did not offer the \namendment we drafted. Now the question is, In the absence of that, in \nthe absence of a more perfect solution to the budget process, what will \nwe do?\n  We really only have a couple of choices. We can stand by and simply \ndo nothing or we can at least do this. That is the choice before the \nSenate today. Nobody really believes there are going to be a lot of \nreal opportunities to do this in the future if we do not do it today.\n  I would prefer a stronger budget process. In fact, not only in \ncommittee but on the floor I, with Senator Gregg, fought for a stronger \nbudget enforcement regime, and we offered our amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  I voted with the Senators from Arizona and Texas when they sought to \nlimit spending on the supplemental appropriations bill. I stood ready, \nand I continue to stand ready, to work with the Senator from Texas to \nfight for the process changes that we worked on together. But the \namendment that Senator Gregg and I offered received only half of the \nvotes--it actually needed 60 to prevail.\n  The efforts to stop spending items on the supplemental appropriations \nbill fell well short of a majority, and we have not offered the \namendment we worked on together.\n  So we face a very stark choice. We face the expiration of the budget \nprocess. We have to face the question, Is the absence of a budget \nprocess preferable to the 2-year extension of the existing process that \nI and Chairman Conrad and Senator Cantwell and now Senator Domenici \noffer today? Obviously, it most assuredly is not. Even though there are \nimperfections in the existing budget process, it does provide some \nbudget discipline. It creates 60-vote hurdles for spending measures \nthat exceed the caps. It requires 60 votes to expand entitlements or \ncut taxes without paying for the cuts.\n  These constraints have been a valuable force for consensus. They have \nhelped ensure the work we do in the Senate can garner the support of \nthree-fifths of the Senate, not just a bare majority. I think these are \nuseful bulwarks in the defense of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  Again, there could be better budget processes. After the adoption of \nthis amendment, if it is adopted, I will still join with others who \nseek to advance further budget improvements. Even if this amendment is \nadopted, nothing will stop the Senator from Texas from offering the \nbudget process on which he and I were working.\n  But at least let's draw the line. Let's at least prevent further \nerosion of budget discipline. Let's seek further improvement where we \ncan, but let's at least ensure that things do not get worse.\n  The Senator from Texas may consider the amendment before the Senate \ntoday to be half a loaf or maybe even less. I admit the amendment \nbefore the Senate today is not perfect, but it is a far better result \nthan doing absolutely nothing, and that is where we are headed. Nothing \nis what we will get if the Senate votes down this very modest attempt \nat fiscal discipline.\n  I urge my colleagues to join at this barricade, if you will, this \nlast stand\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\nthis year for fiscal responsibility. I urge my colleagues, more than \nanything else, to do this to defend the Social Security surplus. I urge \nthem to support this amendment.\n\n  How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 12 minutes; the \nSenator from Texas has just under 22 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make clear I feel strongly about \nthis amendment, but I have profound respect for my colleague. I am a \nlongtime believer in the Jeffersonian thesis that good men, with the \nsame facts, are prone to disagree.\n  I point out the Gregg amendment that I voted for had 5 years of \nbudget numbers; not just the 2 years where the budget went up, but 3 \nyears where it went down. So I thought, in terms of the whole package, \nit was an improvement over nothing. But I do not think it is an \naccident that this amendment has only the 2 years where spending goes \nup.\n  Maybe I was not tending my business, but I do not think that the \nGregg amendment struck the provision on delayed obligations. If it did, \nI was not aware of it, and I would stand to be corrected if anybody \ncorrected me.\n  I think the Gregg amendment left advanced appropriations untouched, \nwhereas this amendment increases them by $2.4 billion.\n  But ultimately, if we are talking about this being a consensus \nproduct, there is one person who is not part of this consensus and that \nis the President.\n  The President is taking a hard position, and, quite frankly, it is \nabout time. I love our President. I have known him for a long time. I \nrespect him. But I thought last year, in trying to work with both \nparties and trying to bring a new environment of bipartisanship to \nWashington, that he let Congress spend too much money. But it was a \nprice he was willing to pay to try to work with everybody and try to be \nbipartisan. But our President is a Texan. And once you have slapped him \nonce or twice, then he begins to think maybe you mean to fight. The \nbottom line is the President has said, I am going to limit spending to \nthe budget that I proposed, and to the aggregate number adopted in the \nHouse. The amendment before us would add billions of dollars to that. \nIt would not only condone but basically justify $25.4 billion of \nspending--in addition to the $9 billion I spoke of earlier--counted a \nyear later through a process called advanced appropriations. This would \nbe the highest level in American history.\n\n  Finally, to add insult to injury--and I asked somebody to explain to \nme why it is in here--this amendment strikes the language on delayed \nobligations. If people weren't meaning to cheat, why do they make it \nlegal? If people didn't expect to be in jail, why are they pulling the \nbars out of the windows? If people aren't expecting to take advantage \nof something we had stopped in the past, why are they taking the \nprohibition against it out?\n  I do not know if my colleague from Oklahoma is aware of it, but the \namendment before us in part strikes our old language preventing delayed \nobligation.\n  Our colleague will remember the bad old days when you wanted to fund \na great big old costly program but you didn't have the money in the \nbudget, so you started it on September 30--the last day of the fiscal \nyear. Then it cost only 1 day. It was just magic. You could spend 365 \ntimes as much money by just starting the program on the last day. We \nfinally wised up to that. We stopped it.\n  Now we have an amendment where our colleagues say they are trying to \nstop spending. They are not for spending. They want to stop spending. \nBut yet they strike the language on delayed obligations, which is a \ngimmick that has been used to spend billions of dollars.\n  I do not know how you could say they don't intend to do it when they \nare legalizing it.\n  To sum up--because I know we have others who want to speak, including \nmy colleague from Oklahoma--this comes down to whether you are with the \nPresident or you are with the spenders.\n  With all good intentions--I don't doubt good intentions on the other \nside--the bottom line is that this amendment, if adopted, gives \ncredence to and gives cover to people who mean to bust the President's \nbudget in three ways: $9 billion on its face, $25.4 billion in advanced \nappropriations, and then cheating with delayed obligation.\n  If you are with the President, if you are for fiscal restraint, if \nyou want to stop the spending spree in Washington, this is not the way \nto do it.\n  I don't mind people making the best arguments they can. But I don't \nthink you can have it both ways. I don't think you can say this is \nabout fiscal restraint, and then say: Oh, by the way, we want to bust \nthe President's budget by adopting this.\n  I mean you have to be fish or fowl. You are either with the man or \nyou are against the man. I am with the man.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Concord Coalition indicated today \nthat our amendment ``provides a strong and needed dose of fiscal \ndiscipline.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the complete \nConcord Coalition statement appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Concord Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2002.\n\n\n        concord coalition supports budget enforcement amendment\n\n       Washington.--The Concord Coalition said today that the \n     Conrad-Feingold-Domenici bipartisan budget enforcement \n     amendment provides a strong and needed dose of fiscal \n     discipline. It sets new discretionary spending caps for two \n     years at tough but achievable levels, extends the pay-as-you-\n     go (paygo) requirement for entitlement expansions and tax \n     cuts, and renews important points of order that enforce \n     discipline.\n       The rapidly deteriorating budget outlook highlights the \n     importance of this amendment. With sudden speed, budget \n     deficits are back and the first time in several years there \n     is no clear agreed upon fiscal goal. As a result, open-ended \n     budgeting is back. Rather than setting priorities and making \n     hard choices, Congress and the President are falling back on \n     the old habit--cut taxes, increase spending, eat up the \n     Social Security surplus, and run up the debt. It's a \n     dangerous path to follow when looming just beyond the \n     artificial 10-year budget window are the huge unfunded \n     retirement and health care costs of the coming senior boom.\n       Restoring a sense of fiscal discipline--and eventually \n     returning to non-Social Security surpluses--is a very \n     difficult challenge. It is virtually impossible without the \n     type of enforcement mechanisms established in this amendment.\n       With the discretionary spending gaps, paygo, and vital \n     enforcement points of order scheduled to expire, the choice \n     for policymakers is whether to extend the current \n     mechanisms--and thus maintain a measure of fiscal \n     discipline--or to simply let the entire budget enforcement \n     framework expire and be left with renewed deficits and no \n     mechanism for enforcing fiscal discipline.\n       In Concord's view the choice is clear. Allowing caps, \n     paygo, and 60-vote points of order to expire is an open \n     invitation to fiscal chaos. The Concord Coalition strongly \n     commends and supports this bipartisan effort to restore \n     fiscal discipline to the budget process.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, my good friend, Senator \nGramm, is doing exactly what good debaters do, except that I caught \nhim, so it won't work.\n  First of all, it is obvious on the point of the President's budget \nand this budget that this isn't the President's budget, it is \nCongress's budget. The President's budget is alive. The President's \nveto powers are alive.\n  What we are trying to do is pass some constraints that Congress will \nimpose on itself in terms of entitlements, which have the opportunity \nof going through the roof in hundreds of billions of dollars, between \nnow and October 1 and thereafter with no 60-vote point of order.\n  Down at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Mr. OMB Director, just get \nthe President ready when this Congress sends entitlement programs that \nare going through the roof, because the 60 votes won't be available \nhere, and they will end up on your desk.\n  The Senator from Texas said it 10 times, but I will only say it once.\n  I am with the President. He is the best President we will have in \nthis century. When his first term is finished, that is what we will \nbegin saying about\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nhim. But, Mr. President, do not be fooled by people who want you to get \ninvolved in something in which you don't have to get involved. And you \nlose no prerogatives; you keep all of them.\n  The second point is, when Senator Gramm loses his major argument, he \nturns to another one. So he is up here about as loud as I speak talking \nabout this delayed obligation.\n  Let me tell Senator Gramm, just take another look at the late \nobligations. First of all, it sunsets at the end of this year. So it \nisn't around. It is literally not around.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why didn't you extend it?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't speak when you are speaking, Senator. Would you \nmind?\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you mind acknowledging that you shouldn't be \nspeaking when I am speaking? I would appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the second point is, for as long as we \nhave had this provision that he is now telling the President he is \ngoing to lose, which provision I invented, we have never used it \nbecause it can't be interpreted. We have never been able to interpret \nwhat these words mean, which is now the real reason the President \nshould come down on us because we are getting rid of it. It never was \nused. It will never be used. It is not interpretable. I knew that one \nyear after it was passed, and I considered getting rid of it because it \nisn't necessary. It wouldn't be used.\n  My last point is a very simple one.\n  Fellow Senators, writing a budget resolution is essentially the work \nof the Congress. The President is not bound by it. He loses no \nauthority. He can veto every bill that comes through here if it doesn't \nmeet what he wants. But I will tell you, fellow Senators, if you think \nyou can live within the President's budget with no problems, then I \nsuggest to you that you had better look at what is eliminated from the \nbudget: $1.2 billion for veterans' medical care, $1.2 billion for the \nviolent crime trust fund, and $1.7 billion for State and local \nenforcement. They are not in his budget.\n\n  We will have to decide whether we are going to put them in and cut \nsomething else. Nonetheless, this will not change the President's \nprerogative to veto every single bill.\n  But, Mr. President--I am not speaking to you, Mr. President, but I am \nspeaking to the President down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue--if \nsomething like this is not adopted, then remember this afternoon when \nSenator Phil Gramm said there was an invitation to spend, and see what \nyou have when entitlement programs come down to your desk because they \npassed up here 51 to 48, or 51 to 49 because there was no 60-vote point \nof order to keep them from breaking the budget because we will not have \nthat protection unless this amendment is adopted.\n  I would say for an afternoon that it is a pretty good piece of change \nfor the American people and a pretty good way for the President to say, \nI will veto, but I would rather not have all the entitlements coming up \nhere. Which entitlements? You know what they are. They have to do with \nthe various medical programs. They have to do with everything we are \ngoing to be looking at for Medicaid reforms and Medicare reforms. Sixty \nvotes is not going to be applicable.\n  It seems to this Senator, Mr. President, that you ought to stick to \nyour work and to your veto authority, and you ought to let us do our \nbudget because we can help you a lot when we don't send you all the \nentitlement bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I am not telling the \nPresident anything. The President was telling me. I read what the \nPresident said last night. I am joining my voice with the President's, \nbut I am not speaking for the President.\n  Second, our problem is that the whole budget enforcement expired--not \njust this one provision. We are extending the rest of it. We are not \nextending this provision.\n  The bottom line is, this is about $9 billion. Senator Domenici says \nwe can't live within the President's budget. I believe we can live \nwithin the President's budget. And the President has asked us to try.\n\n  Now, granted, the President can do whatever he wants to do. The \nquestion is, Do Republican Senators want to vote to go on record for a \nbudget number that is $9 billion more than the President says he is \ngoing to stand behind? I think that is why it comes down to the \nquestion of whether you are with him or whether you are against him. I \nam with him.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas controls 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nTexas for his remarks. I will just make a comment. I see the chairman \nof the Budget Committee is in the Chamber. Bring the budget to the \nfloor. I can tell you, my colleagues--who might have listened to my \nvery good friend, Senate Domenici, who says, let's vote for this \namendment--this amendment is going absolutely nowhere, even if it is \nadopted--and it is not going to be adopted--because it is on the \nDepartment of Defense bill, I tell my colleague.\n  It does not belong on the Department of Defense bill. I have urged \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin that they should table this amendment. \nIt does not belong on this bill. Maybe we will make a budget point of \norder it is a little higher--it does not belong on this bill.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. Let's bring the budget before the \nSenate. Then we can have a good debate. Are we going to change points \nof order? Are we going to change on whether or not you can have end-of-\nyear spending gimmicks that we have banned in the past, which evidently \nthis one-day budget is going to do? Are we going to reverse that? I \nwould like to know. I am on the Budget Committee.\n  I tell my good friend from Nevada, I believe the Senate procedures \nshould work. Now, for whatever reason, the majority has not decided to \ncall up the budget. So this is the second time that various Senators \nhave said: Well, let's do the budget on whatever authorization bill is \ngoing through the Senate. That is not the way it should work. It is not \nthe way it has worked. I have been in the Senate for 22 years, and it \nhas never worked this way.\n  We have always passed the budget, and it has not been easy. I will \ntell the majority, I know it is not easy. I will help them try to work \nit. I want to see the Senate pass a budget. I do not happen to agree \nwith the majority's budget, but I will help to try to formulate the \nprocess to go through the budget procedure to pass a budget. I believe \nin it. But it does not belong on DOD authorization.\n  Let's just assume that it passed. I hope and I believe it will not, \nbut let's just assume that it passes. OK. So the Senate passes the \nSenate budget--or part of the Senate budget, because I do not believe \nthis is the entire Senate budget. I do not think this is what passed \nthe Senate Budget Committee, which I serve on, and we spent a couple \ndays in markup. But we had lots and lots of hearings. It was a lot more \nextensive.\n  I don't know the difference between this and what passed out of the \nSenate Budget Committee, but I did not vote for it when it came out of \nthe Senate Budget Committee. But I know one thing: It doesn't belong on \nthe DOD authorization bill. I know my friends and colleagues from the \nHouse, and they would say: Thank you very much. That is not going to be \naccepted in conference. You have wasted your time--totally, completely.\n\n  Budgets have to pass both the House and the Senate if you want to \nhave a binding budget. It does not do any good just to pass it in the \nSenate by one amendment on one day. That has no impact whatsoever. So \nwe are absolutely wasting our time.\n  I urge my colleagues--I urge the majority because this is not in the \nminority's capability. The majority should bring this budget as passed \nout of the Budget Committee and try to pass it\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\non the floor. That is what we should do. Instead, we have this game, \nand it just happens to be the Democrats' budget. Obviously, the \nPresident does not want it.\n  My Budget Committee staff tells me it is $21 billion higher than the \nfigure the President submitted. It is not a 1-year budget; it is a 2-\nyear budget. Wow. OK, it is $21 billion. We increased the amount you \ncan have on advanced appropriations, something that probably not three \npeople in the Senate really understand. But we are going to increase \nthat figure from $23 billion to $25 billion. Oh, we are going to do \nthat. Oh, now we are going to be changing the rules of the Senate \ndealing with end of the year, beginning new programs, delayed \nobligations. Oh, we are changing that.\n  Wait a minute. I say, if we are going to do all these things, let's \ndo it on a budget. Then, when we eventually pass it--it may not have my \nvote--but when we eventually pass it, it goes to the conference with \nthe House, with budget conferees, not with DOD conferees. DOD conferees \nin the House would laugh this off: We don't agree with that. It is \ndropped.\n  The President is against it. He would say he would veto it if it is \nin the DOT authorization bill. It has no business being in DOD \nauthorization.\n  We have to learn in the Senate at some point to have a little \ndiscipline and say, when we are going to bring up the DOD authorization \nbill, we are going to stay on DOD. That means the managers of the bill \nhave to table nongermane amendments. That means the majority has to \nbring up a budget in a timely manner, which the law says we are \nsupposed to bring up and pass by April 15. And now we are past June 15, \nand we have not had the budget brought up on the floor.\n  The majority needs to bring it up. It does not belong on this bill. \nIt is not going to be included in this bill, I hope. I believe a budget \npoint of order will be sustained. It takes 60 votes to pass it, as it \nshould, because the budget statute says it has to come out of the \nBudget Committee, not to be done on DOD authorization. Oh, we are going \nto have Senator Warner and Senator Levin be the conferees on the \nbudget? It is not going to happen. We are wasting our time.\n  I am embarrassed for the Senate and the way this Senate is being run, \nthe fact that we did not bring up a budget. And then some people say: \nWell, we will take pieces of it and put it on DOD authorization. That \nis absurd. And it just happens to be a couple of pieces that say: Oh, \nwe are going to spend billions of dollars more than the President \nanticipated.\n  I will be happy to consider pay-go. I will be happy to consider a lot \nof different things that are in the germane jurisdiction of the Budget \nCommittee on a budget resolution. But to do it on DOD authorization, I \nthink, is just a total, complete waste of time.\n  The point of order that it does not belong on this bill is exactly \nright. I am sure--and I hope--that our colleagues will sustain that \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma argues that we \nshould not have brought up this amendment on this bill.\n  This bill authorizes appropriations for the majority of appropriated \nspending. It may well be the largest spending bill we consider this \nyear. So I think it is absolutely appropriate to consider the total \namount of appropriate spending on this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. For a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I respect my colleague from Wisconsin. I have agreed \nwith him on many issues dealing with fiscal matters.\n  Wouldn't you agree we should have a budget resolution that passed the \nSenate Budget Committee for consideration by both Democrats and \nRepublicans so we would go through the budget procedure as we have \nalways done for the last 20-some years?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It would be great to have a budget resolution, but far \nmore important, far more useful is a statute to guarantee that these \ncaps and enforcement mechanisms exist to bind both Houses, a mechanism \nthat is actually the law of the land.\n  So this is far more important. This is an appropriate vehicle to do \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remains for the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, that the Senator from Oklahoma argues against himself. He \ngives advances as a reason to oppose putting it on this measure, that \nit will never pass both Houses, and that a budget has to pass both \nHouses.\n  I say to my colleague, one of the key reasons we have not brought the \nbudget resolution to the floor is because the House passed a 5-year \nbudget when the requirement of the law is a 10-year budget. The \nPresident submitted a 10-year budget. We passed a 10-year budget \nthrough the Senate Budget Committee. The House passed a 5-year budget, \neven though they cut taxes and committed to spending money outside the \n5-year window.\n  In addition to that, they used rosy scenario forecasts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not yield.\n  They used an estimate of Medicare expenses in the House that says \nMedicare is going to rise at the lowest percentage in the history of \nthe program.\n  Now, how are we ever going to reconcile a 10-year budget in the \nSenate, which is what the law requires, with a 5-year budget in the \nHouse, when we used Congressional Budget Office estimates, which we are \nsupposed to do, and they used Office of Management Budget estimates \nbecause it made it easier for them to cover up the raid on Social \nSecurity in which they were engaged?\n  That is a fundamental reason that we have passed a budget resolution \nthrough the committee and not brought it to the floor because we know \nwe would spend a week of the Senate's time and never be able to \nreconcile with the House because they have adopted rosy scenario \nforecasts, and they have adopted a 5-year budget when a 10-year budget \nis required.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I will not yield.\n  We hear, over and over, this is more money than the President's \nbudget. Well, the President's budget is exactly the same amount as in \nthis amendment. The President called for $768 billion in discretionary \nspending. It is true, we did not adopt his policy. There is a $9 \nbillion difference because he wanted to transfer money from mandatory \nspending to discretionary.\n  Do you know what he wanted to transfer? He wanted to transfer the \ncost of Federal employees' retirement and claim it was discretionary \nrather than mandatory. I have not found anybody who thinks that is a \nwise policy. Clearly, it is required that we pay the retirement costs \nof Federal employees. That is not discretionary.\n  The fact is, the President's discretionary number is exactly the same \nas the number we have. We didn't adopt his policy, but that is his \nnumber.\n  Now, let's look, in comparison, to last year. Last year we spent $710 \nbillion in discretionary. These are the increases: $45 billion for \ndefense, every penny of it requested by the President; $5.4 billion in \nhomeland security, every penny requested by the President. The only \ndifference is $7 billion, the difference between last year and this \nyear, that is going to other things. All of the rest of the increase is \nfor defense and homeland security, every dollar requested by the \nPresident.\n  There is $7 billion more, 1 percent, for all the rest of Government. \nThat doesn't even keep pace with inflation. Between 2003 and 2004, we \nare capping spending at $786 billion, an $18 billion increase, a 2-\npercent increase, for total discretionary spending by the Federal \nGovernment. That does not even keep pace with inflation, either. For \nthose who say this is spending, spending, that doesn't pass the laugh \ntest. This is a cap on spending, a cap on spending at the same number \nthe President proposed, a cap on spending for the second year that \nallows a 2-percent increase\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nfor all of domestic spending. That is defense, parks, law enforcement--\nall the rest.\n  The fact is, without this amendment passing, there will be no budget. \nThere will be no budget disciplines. They expire on September 30. That \nis the reality.\n  This is a choice that really matters. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds remaining. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 8 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I want to respond. Our dear \ncolleague from North Dakota said that the President submitted a budget \nthat actually cut some programs. Can you imagine it? Can you imagine \nit? In $2 trillion of spending, the President was able to find some low \npriority items so that when a vicious set of terrorists attacked and \nkilled thousands of our people we could redirect some of that money.\n  Our colleagues are shocked. In fact, our colleagues can give you 100 \ntaxes that they are willing to raise. They can give you dozens of tax \ncuts they are willing to take back. But they can't give you one \nGovernment program that they are willing to cut. And they are stunned \nthat in a $2 trillion Government, the President was able to come up \nwith about $10 billion of things that we might defer or do without so \nwe could instead grab a few terrorists by the throat and break their \nnecks.\n  I am not stunned. I am proud. We are the only people in the world who \nnever set a priority, who never had to make a hard choice. The \nPresident is willing to make choices. That is one of the reasons I am \nsupporting the President.\n  It is true that this amendment before us does have some things from \nthe budget resolution considered in committee. But basically three of \nthe things are things that spend more money. The President said last \nnight and the OMB Director wrote us this morning, asking us to oppose \nthis amendment to help the President hold the line on spending. That is \nwhat this issue is about.\n  It is not just about $9 billion that our colleagues want to spend and \nthe President doesn't want to spend. It is also about $25 billion more \nspending now that won't count until next year. And then there is the \nwhole issue about this delayed obligation where you can play these \ngames when you start a program.\n  It is true that the amendment before us has some support, but when I \nlook at the President's position and when I look at the position before \nus, if our colleagues had offered the President's number without this \ndelayed obligation and without the $25 billion of spending that doesn't \ncount until next year, I would have voted for it. I would have been a \ncosponsor of it. But it spends $9 billion more than the President \nwants. He is pretty adamant about it. It opens up a floodgate for \nadvanced appropriations where we spend it now so that when next year \ncomes we say, we can't possibly hold the line on spending because we \nhave already committed to spend part of it. Only Government could get \naway with that. No person in the real world could possibly get away \nwith that.\n  The issue before us is, Are you with the man, or are you against the \nman? The President asked us to hold the line on spending. He asked us \nto enforce his budget. Now are we going to go on record and say: Thank \nyou, Mr. President, we appreciate your letting us know what you think, \nbut we are going to raise spending $9 billion above what you want \nwhether you like it or not? That is not part of any budget. It is part \nof a 2-year deal where we increase spending, but it really boils down \nto that.\n  I raised a point of order. So the question is, Are there 60 Members \nof the Senate willing to say to the President: We are going to \nbasically commit ourselves and condone $9 billion of spending you \ndidn't ask for? Or are we going to stand with the President.\n  I urge my colleagues, this is a good day to start fiscal \nresponsibility. This is a good day to start saying no to business as \nusual in Washington, DC.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry: Do we have an agreement to get the \nvote at 3 on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes controlled by the \nSenator from Texas; 21 seconds controlled by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself some time out of my leader \ntime to comment on this issue.\n  First, this situation has been caused by the fact that we don't have \na budget resolution. I think that is very unfortunate. Ordinarily, we \ntry to get a budget resolution by April 15 or as soon thereafter as \npossible. Usually we get one done by May. Here we are in June. We have \nnot heard anything about when it might come up. Apparently it never \nwill. That presents us problems in terms of what is the aggregate cap, \nwhat are the enforcement mechanisms that we are going to use to try to \ncontrol spending, keep it within some reasonable amount.\n  I also recognize without these caps, some orderly disposition to the \nsubcommittees, it is going be very difficult to hold the line when \nthese various appropriations bills come to the floor.\n  I don't know when that might be. We need to get going on the \nappropriations bills. Usually in June we do anywhere between two and \nfive appropriations bills. Then in July we usually do anywhere between, \nI guess, five and as many as nine. Right now I see none anywhere in \nsight. We have done a supplemental after a very difficult time. It is \nnot clear when we will get going on appropriations.\n  I believe the House is going to pass the Defense appropriations bill \nand then the military construction appropriations bill before the \nFourth of July recess. So that will begin the process. That is good.\n  I think to do this number and this procedure on this bill at this \ntime is a mistake. First, this is the Defense authorization bill. You \nneed some vehicle on which to put this. If not here, then where, \nsomebody might ask. But now that this door is open, we are being \nadvised that we are going to have all kinds of nongermane amendments on \nthe Defense authorization bill. I had been pleading with Senator \nDaschle to call this issue up. And to his credit, he did. He could have \ngone to other issues, but he did the right thing and moved to Defense \nauthorization.\n  Now we will be off on a discussion of taxes and Mexican trucks and \nperhaps an abortion amendment. I am hearing all kinds of things. At \nsome point we will have to get back to Defense authorization \nitself. That is point No. 1. I believe this is the wrong place to do \nit.\n\n  Secondly, while the mechanisms have been improved--there is a \nfirewall in here now, and also some clarification with regard to \nadvanced appropriations--the number, 768, is still a problem. That is \nabout $9 billion above the President's request. Some people maintain--\nand I am sure it has been maintained--we are going to have to have more \nthan what was asked for in the original budget as we try to move to a \nconclusion this year. Somebody even said: ``You are fighting over \ntwosies and threesies here.'' It is $2 billion here, or $3 billion for \nthe supplemental, and $9 billion there. Pretty soon, all those billions \nadd up to real money.\n  So while I understand what we are trying to accomplish, I am \nconcerned about how we go forward from here. I think the number is \nstill too high. I think this is the wrong bill on which to be putting \nthis. It is similar to the debt ceiling. If we are going to do this, \nprobably we need to do it clean. That won't be easy. But a lot of \npeople were shocked that we were able to move the debt ceiling the way \nwe did in a bipartisan vote; 15 or so Democrats voted with most of the \nRepublicans. We didn't do a budget resolution, and I think that is a \ntravesty, but we are going to have to come to some agreement on how we \nproceed and how we get to a conclusion at the end of this fiscal year.\n  My urgent plea is that we look for a number that is closer to what \nthe President and his advisers have indicated they could accept.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin controls 21 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield that remaining time to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we cannot very well have it both ways. You \ncan't, on the one hand, decry not having budget discipline and a \nbudget, and, on the other hand, oppose those very provisions. That is \nwhat this vote is about. It is a budget and it is budget discipline \nprovisions. They are critically needed. I hope colleagues will support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe my colleague is right on one \npoint. You can't have it both ways. You can't say I am for fiscal \nrestraint and then say we are going to make the President take $9 \nbillion he doesn't want.\n  I think this boils down to a question, Are you with the President or \nare you against him? The President asked us to hold the line on \nspending. I am with the President, and therefore I am going to vote \nagainst waiving the budget point of order. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take the floor to alert my colleagues in \nthe Senate and those who are following this debate that at a hearing \nthis afternoon before the Transportation Subcommittee----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator will \nsuspend.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I am glad my colleague, the \nSenator from West Virginia, is in the Chamber because he attended this \nhearing. He may not have been present when the questions came. We asked \nthe administrator of Amtrak what was ahead in the days to follow. At \nthis moment in time, Amtrak needs $200 million interim financing to \ncontinue operations across America. Mr. Gunn, who testified before \nChairman Patty Murray's Transportation Subcommittee, alerted us this \nafternoon that unless the interim financing of $200 million is secured \nby Wednesday of next week, Amtrak will cease all operations--all \noperations--not scaled back but cease all operations.\n  Mr. Gunn explained it was necessary in order for them to park the \ntrains, take the precautions necessary to guard them, and to prepare \nfor the ultimate shutdown, which could begin as early as the middle of \nnext week.\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\n  We then asked Mr. Rutter, who is the head of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, what was the status of the Amtrak request for $200 \nmillion. He alerted us that they were in the process of evaluating it, \nand he believed they would be able to get back to Amtrak with the \nanswer early next week.\n  If you will do the math, you will understand we are talking about 24 \nto 48 hours separating the decision by the Bush administration on \ninterim financing for Amtrak and the suspension of all Amtrak service \nacross the United States.\n  I said to Mr. Gunn that I believed we had a moral obligation to \nnotify Governors across the United States with Amtrak service of this \nlooming transportation disaster. Let me say for many of us who believe \nin Amtrak and national passenger rail service that it is absolutely \ndisgraceful that we have reached this point.\n  At some point, this administration should have stepped forward to \nwork with Congress to make certain that Amtrak service was not in \njeopardy. Now we face the very real possibility of a disastrous \ntransportation situation as early as next week.\n  We heard this morning from Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta, a \nspeech he gave to the Chamber of Commerce about his vision of the \nfuture of Amtrak. It is a vision which is not new. It is the same \nvision that Margaret Thatcher had in England when she took a look at \nBritish rail service and decided to privatize it, to separate it, and \nto try to take a different route. It turned out to be a complete \nfailure--not only a failure in the terms of the reliability of service \nbut a failure in terms of safety.\n  The administration's proposal on Amtrak is a disaster waiting to \nhappen. It is literally a train wreck when it comes to the future of \nnational passenger rail service.\n  If you believe, as I do, that our Nation should seek energy security, \nthat we should try to find modes of transportation to reduce pollution \nand traffic congestion, which is getting progressively worse and we \ncan't ignore it, then we cannot and should not walk away from Amtrak.\n  This administration's position at this point is going to create a \ncrisis in transportation. We need to maintain not only the very best \nhighways and the safest airports in America, but we need national \npassenger rail service. We need leadership in the White House and at \nAmtrak with a vision of how to turn that rail service in the 21st \ncentury into something that we can point to with pride and \neffectiveness.\n  We don't have that today. Mr. Gunn has been drawn out of retirement \nand has been heading Amtrak for just a few weeks. This didn't occur on \nhis watch. He is a competent administrator who wants the resources to \nmake Amtrak work. Instead, what this administration has given him is a \ndoomsday scenario where literally Amtrak service could be terminated \nacross America next week. What it means for the Northeast corridor is \nprobably a dramatic change in terms of the way the families and \nbusinesses would have to operate. What it means in my home State of \nIllinois is that thousands of passengers and thousands of employees \nwill have their future and their transportation in jeopardy. It didn't \nhave to reach this point, but it has.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in urging the Bush White \nHouse to respond tomorrow--not next week but tomorrow--favorably for \nfinancing of Amtrak so we can tell the Governors across America that \nthis emergency is not going to happen.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, a moment ago spoke of the dilemma now faced by Amtrak, the \ncompany that provides rail passenger service.\n  The Secretary of Transportation earlier today provided a glimpse into \nhis and the administration's view of what to do about Amtrak. It is \nclearly devastating, if you believe that we ought to have rail \npassenger service.\n  I confess, I like trains. I grew up in a small town where a train \ncalled the Galloping Goose used to come through. We gathered to watch \nthe train come through our little town. I like trains. This isn't about \nbeing nostalgic or liking trains. It is about whether you think our \ncountry should have rail passenger service. The testimony this morning \nby Mr. Gunn was that by mid next week, unless the financing is made \navailable, Amtrak will shut down. By mid next week, we will have no \nrail passenger service because it will shut down, unless the Department \nof Transportation and the other relevant agencies get together on the \nfinancing package necessary.\n  It is important that we have rail passenger service. Aside from the \nurgent circumstances that face us next week, the other question is \nthis: What will the long-term plan be for an Amtrak rail passenger \nsystem that works?\n  The Secretary of Transportation said today that this is his plan: \nLet's take the Northeast corridor and cut it off and sort of \nsemiprivatize it and sell it--I am not quite sure to whom--and then we \nwill let the rest of the system work on its own. That is a quick, \neffective way to kill Amtrak. Yes, there will be Amtrak service from \nBoston to Washington; that will continue. And the rest of the Amtrak \nrail passenger service will die. Just as certainly as I am standing \nhere, we will see the collapse of rail passenger service in the rest of \nthe country.\n  Last year, over 80,000 people boarded Amtrak in North Dakota. Anybody \nwho wonders is Amtrak important, ask yourself what happened on \nSeptember 11 following the devastating attacks by terrorists. Every \nsingle commercial airplane, every private airplane was\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nforced to land. They had to find an airport and land and stop that \nairplane. But Amtrak kept moving across the country, hauling people \nback and forth across the country. Rail service is an important part of \nthis country's transportation system. It is that simple.\n  To come up with a plan that says, by the way, what we will do is cut \noff the Northeast corridor, which is the most lucrative part of the \nsystem, and separate it from the rest of the country, is a way of \nsaying, let's kill Amtrak in most of America.\n  Talk about a thoughtless public policy proposal. This is it.\n  This Congress has some work to do. This administration needs to \naddress next week. Mr. Gunn says that Amtrak is going to shut down. The \nPresident of Amtrak says he is going to shut down midweek unless the \nDepartment of Transportation and others get their act together and \nprovide the interim financing necessary. They have an application \nfiled.\n  One of my colleagues asked the people when they will act on that \napplication. Answer: Maybe next week.\n  It ought to be now. This is not exactly a surprise. This problem with \nAmtrak has been lingering for a long time, and this Congress seems \nincapable, unwilling, or unable to make decisions that will put this \nrail passenger system on a sound financial footing. Some of my \ncolleagues believe we just should kill Amtrak; let it die. What they \nforget is that we subsidize every other form of transportation. You \nname it, we subsidize it.\n\n  They say: But we don't want to have a rail passenger service that is \nsubsidized. Everyone has the right to their opinion. But I think this \ncountry is well served, strengthened, and we are improved by having a \nnational system of rail passenger service. No, it does not go \neverywhere. It does not connect every city to every other city. But it \nis a national system that connects the Northeast corridor to routes \nthroughout our country in a way that is advantageous to millions of \nAmericans.\n  This Congress and this administration have to wake up, and they have \nto wake up now. If we don't, and if they don't, we could find mid next \nweek a country in which all rail passenger service is gone. If we \ndon't, and if they don't, we could find beyond that, if they find the \ninterim financing for next week, we could find a rail passenger system \nin which we have this crazy scheme of cutting off the Northeast \ncorridor, creating some sort of quasi-private or quasi-public system \nwith that, and saying the most lucrative portion of Amtrak shall not be \navailable to assist in offsetting other revenues from other parts of \nthe system. And we will inevitably create an Amtrak system that dies \neverywhere in the country except for the Northeast corridor. That is \nnot a vision that is good for our country.\n  This is not the kind of issue that ought to hang up the Congress. It \nis not complicated. We deal with a lot of complicated issues. This is \nnot one of them. It is very simply a question to this administration \nthat has been sitting on its hands for a long time on this issue. It \nought to stop. It ought to take some action. And this Congress ought to \ntake action for the long term.\n  The question is this: Do you believe in rail passenger service or \nnot? Do you believe this country is strengthened by having a national \nsystem of rail passenger service? If you believe it is not and you \ndon't like rail passenger service and you want to kill Amtrak, just go \nahead and do it, if you have the votes.\n  But what is happening is inaction, both by the administration and \ninaction by Congress, which is slowly but surely strangling the life \nout of this system called Amtrak.\n  It makes no sense to me. Let's make a decision.\n  I count myself on the ``aye'' side. I say aye when you call the roll \nto ask do we want to support Amtrak; do we want to have a national rail \npassenger system in our future. The answer is clearly yes. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree. I hope we can all agree to stop all of the foot \ndragging going on on this important question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5823-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5823-S5824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there was an interesting piece in the \nWashington Post this morning, a senior aide to Republicans on the House \nside saying we want to--something to the effect of--write a \nprescription drug plan that basically is what the pharmaceutical \nindustry wants.\n  I look at the House bill, and I report to the Senate that is exactly \nwhat we have: A bill that is made for the industry. The White House has \nno plan. They are talking about a discount comparable to going to the \nmovie and you get a dollar or two off the ticket, but it has nothing to \ndo with whether or not we will have prescription drugs that will be \naffordable.\n  The House Republicans have said low-income people earning roughly \nunder $11,000 are not going to have to pay anything. But when you look \nat the fine print, that's not true. If you have burial expenses worth \n$1,500 or more, if you have a car that is worth more than $4,500, then \nall of a sudden you might not be eligible for the protections for the \nlow-income. That is stingy.\n  Then the thing that people are worried about is the catastrophic \nexpenses. We must have a prescription drug plan that really responds to \nwhat we are hearing from all of our constituents: ``Senator you must \nkeep the premiums low; you have to keep the deductibles and the copays \naffordable; and you have to cover catastrophic expenses''--that is what \npeople are terrified of, big expenses they can't afford.\n  What this Republican plan says is: We will provide a little coverage, \nup to $2,000. But between $2,000 and $3,800 we won't cover anything.\n  That is nonsensical. It certainly is not a step forward for \nMinnesotans; it is a huge leap backwards.\n  I also want to mention to colleagues that the Republicans basically \ndon't want to have a plan built into Medicare.\n  Now, I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from South Dakota, \nyou can appreciate this with a smile. The Republicans don't want to \nhave anything built into Medicare because they are scared that it might \nput restrictions on drug companies' price gouging. That is what \nRepublicans are scared of. As a result, they say: We are going to farm \nit out to Medicare HMOs and to private insurance plans. But the private \ninsurance plans are saying: We are not going to do this because the \nonly people who will buy the prescription drug only plans are the ones \nwho need it, and we need some people in the plan who don't need it; \notherwise, we cannot make any money on it; it won't work.\n  Then they say the monthly premiums will be $35 and the deductibles \nwill be $250. It turns out that this is not the case. Those numbers are \nmerely suggestions. It could be that the deductible in one part of my \nstate is $250, and $500 in another part of Minnesota, and $750 in some \nother state.\n  I want to say on the floor of the Senate that you have these \npharmaceutical companies pouring in all this money at the $30 million \nfundraising extravaganza last night--$250,000 a crack, or whatever, \nthat I am reading about. Then you have some of the people saying we are \ngoing to basically write something that suits their interest. This is \nwhat we are dealing with.\n  I will keep pushing hard. I know you have to get 60 votes, and I know \nsome people are going to be reluctant about this because we are going \nto have to take on the prerogatives of drug companies. But I think we \nought to do the following: First of all, for low-income people, we \nought to say, you are not going to pay anything, because they cannot \nafford it. Then we should set a 20 percent beneficiary copay. I would \nrather see us do that. Then we should set a catastrophic cap at $2,000 \na year; after that, you don't have to pay anymore of the cost of your \nprescription drugs. That is good catastrophic coverage. That makes \nsense.\n  How is it affordable? In two ways. First: Prescription drug \nreimportation from Canada, with strict FDA safety guidelines. There is \nno reason that Minnesotans, and people all over the United States, \nshould not be able to reimport prescription drugs that were made in the \nU.S. back to the U.S. Pharmacists could do it, and families could too \nand get a 30-, 40-, 50-percent discount. There is no reason to vote \nno--except the pharmaceutical companies don't want it.\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n  Second: and the Chair is interested in this as well--there is no \nreason the Federal Government's Department of Health and Human Services \ncannot represent senior citizens to become a bargaining agent and say: \nWe represent 40 million Americans, and we want the best buy. We want a \ncommitment from the industry to reduce the prices. Give us the best \nbuy. Charge us what you charge other countries, charge us what you \ncharge veterans, charge us what you charge Medicaid. We can get huge \nreductions in costs and huge savings.\n  Mr. President, I have been talking about a book and Tom Wicker wrote \nit--it's fictional, but based on the life of Senator Estes Kefauver and \nthe way the pharmaceutical industry did him in. The companies have \nbecome too greedy, arrogant, and people in this country have had it, \nand it is time for us to make it crystal clear that this Capitol and \nthis political process belong to the people of South Dakota and \nMinnesota, not these pharmaceutical companies.\n  The House plan is not a great step forward. It is a great leap \nbackward. We are going to have a big debate on the floor in July. I \ncannot wait for it. I think a lot of these positions we take are going \nto be real clear in terms of whom exactly do we represent, the \npharmaceutical industry or the people in our States.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about an amendment I am \nintending to propose to the armed services bill, although I understand \nthere may be an agreement that everyone will oppose amendments that are \nnot considered germane.\n  I want to talk about the amendment because I think it is very \nimportant. We now have the House making permanent the marriage tax \npenalty relief. We passed marriage tax penalty relief last year in our \nTax Relief Act, and it was signed by the President. It would begin the \nprocess of giving marriage tax penalty relief to the 40 million couples \nin our country who now suffer from a marriage penalty. In fact, it is \n21 million couples across the country--over 40 million people--who are \ntaxed simply because they are married.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that 48 percent of married couples \npay this additional tax. According to a study by the Congressional \nBudget Office, the average penalty paid is $1,400. Fortunately, last \nyear we took a step in the right direction. We are in the process of a \nrepeal of the marriage tax penalty, with a full repeal to occur in \n2009. It does this by equalizing the size of the standard deduction. So \nif you are single and you have the standard deduction and you get \nmarried, that will just be double rather than about two-thirds of the \ntotal, as it is today.\n  We also increase the width of the 15-percent bracket, so that if two \npeople in the 15-percent bracket get married or if two people in the \n28-percent bracket get married, the 15-percent tax bracket will be \ndoubled, so that you will at least have an equalization in the first \ntax bracket. Unfortunately, that will sunset in 2011.\n  Last week, the House passed a permanent repeal of the marriage tax \npenalty. Now it is the Senate's turn. Senator Brownback, Senator Gramm, \nand I would like to make the marriage tax penalty repeal permanent, \njust so that married couples will know what to expect not only from now \nuntil 2009 or 2011 but beyond, to eliminate forever this kind of \npenalty, with the standard deduction--at least in the 15-percent \nbracket.\n  Now I want to talk about how this affects military families. There \nare more than 725,000 members of the military who are married. That \nrepresents more than half of the Armed Forces. Of these, 79,000 are \nmarried to another member of the military. So these 40,000 ``military \ncouples'' represent almost 6 percent of the Armed Forces.\n  Consider the effect of the marriage tax penalty on two people who \nrisk their lives every day to protect us. I will show this chart \nbecause I think it is very important. A lance corporal and a private \nfirst class in the Marine Corps will pay $218 more in taxes if they \nmarry today. An important provision of the authorization bill we are \ndebating is military pay raises. The same lance corporal and private \nfirst class will receive a 4-percent pay raise, according to the \nauthorization bill we are debating today. But the marriage penalty \nwould take back 16 percent of that increase. So of the $218, 16 percent \nis going to go in marriage penalty taxes.\n  If a technical sergeant and a master sergeant in the Air Force get \nmarried, they will pay a penalty of $604. That eats up 17 percent of \nthe pay raise we are debating today. Two Army warrant officers would \npay $852 more to Uncle Sam, or 25 percent of their pay raise.\n  Two Navy lieutenants who marry would pay more than $1,500 in \nadditional taxes annually, giving up 34 percent of their pay raise.\n  We are trying to make life better for those in our military. To give \nthem a pay raise with this hand and on the other hand penalize 79,000 \nof the people who are already sacrificing to be married to someone else \nin the military, possibly having to be in a separate part of the world \nfrom that spouse, to ask them to endure a marriage tax penalty that \nwould take away as much as 34 percent of the pay raise we are giving \nthem to make their lives better because they are out there in the field \nprotecting our freedom, which does not make sense to me.\n  That is why I had hoped I would be able to offer this amendment. \nHowever, it is my understanding there are now talks about taking away \nany nongermane amendments from this bill. I do not disagree that we \nwant to pass the armed services bill, that we want to make sure the \nbill goes through. I certainly applaud that. I do, however, think that \neliminating the marriage tax penalty would be a huge help for our \nmilitary, particularly since we are giving them the pay raises with \nthis bill that we hope will make life better for them.\n  I know there are a lot of negotiations ongoing. I hope at some point \nwe will be able to eliminate the marriage tax penalty not only for the \n40 million people who are now paying, but for our military personnel \nespecially. We are trying to give them this better quality of life to \ntell them how much we respect and appreciate the job they are doing for \nour country.\n  I would like to offer this amendment. I think I am going to be kept \nfrom doing that, but I want an up-or-down vote on making the marriage \ntax penalty permanent so that people will not have to wonder if the \nyear 2011 is going to give them another big marriage tax penalty.\n  We have spoken in Congress; the President has signed the tax relief \nbill. It is essential we go forward and make these tax cuts permanent \nso people can make plans. Whether it is the death tax, whether it is \nthe bracket tax cuts, whether it is the adoption tax credit, whether it \nis marriage tax penalty relief--we had a balanced package of tax relief \nfor all the people who pay taxes in our country.\n  At a time such as this, with our economy teetering--and certainly if \nanyone is watching the stock market and corporations and the whole \nskittishness of our economy, they should see that we need some \nstability--we need the ability to free up consumer spending by taking \nthe money out of the Government coffers, where hard-working people are \nputting it, and let them keep more of the money they earn in their \npocketbooks.\n  I hope very much I can offer this amendment--if not on this bill, \ncertainly on a bill we will be able to pass this year. There is no \nreason not to make the tax cuts we have already made permanent so \npeople know how much they are going to have to pay the Government from \ntheir hard-earned dollars. So many people are losing their jobs; so \nmany people are having a hard time making ends meet today. I certainly \nwant to make sure our armed services bill passes. I do not want to load \nit with extraneous amendments. I do not think this is extraneous. I \nthink being able to give them pay raises they can keep is certainly \nsomething we should do for our military, but to take away 34 percent of \nthe pay raise we are\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\ngiving them in a marriage tax penalty does not make sense to me.\n  I certainly hope I will be able to offer this at the appropriate \ntime. I want to make sure we are doing everything we can for the Armed \nForces of our country. I hope the distinguished majority leader will \nallow making permanent the marriage tax penalty bill a priority for \nthis session of Congress.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the course of the last hour or so, I \nhave had a number of conversations with the distinguished Republican \nleader and the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have been discussing how we might proceed on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who have \namendments they would like to have considered, and they are certainly \nwithin their rights to offer these amendments.\n  My concern is that if we find ourselves in debates on unrelated \nissues for an extended period of time, there is the real danger that we \nwill not finish our work prior to the time we leave next week. I have \nalready indicated publicly and privately to anyone who is interested in \nthe schedule that we must finish this bill before we leave. That is an \nabsolute necessity. So I do not want any Senator to complain about any \nmisunderstanding they may have. I want to be as clear and unequivocal \nabout that as I can: We will finish this bill before we leave.\n  As we have discussed how we might ensure that happens, of course one \noption would be to file cloture. Unfortunately, there are defense-\nrelated amendments that may be relevant and may be related to the \nDefense bill but not technically germane.\n  I have consulted with the Republican leader, and we have concluded, \nwith the support of the chairman and ranking member--and I thank both \nof them for their willingness to support this effort--we have concluded \nthat we will move to table or make a point of order against any \namendment which is not defense related from here on out in this debate. \nWe do it regretfully because we oftentimes are supportive of some of \nthese amendments on both sides.\n  I know an amendment was going to be offered on marriage tax penalty, \nand I know some of my Republican colleagues and perhaps Democratic \ncolleagues would be interested in the amendment. There are amendments \non this side that I will move to table that I would otherwise support.\n  We have come to the conclusion that the only way we can complete our \nwork is by taking this action. So I am announcing at this point that \nfrom here on out, all amendments that are not related to the Defense \nbill are amendments that either Senator Lott or I or our colleagues on \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senators Levin and Warner, will move to \ntable or will file a point of order against.\n  I want to notify all of our Senators that will restrict significantly \nthe opportunities they have to offer additional amendments, but we \nintend to follow through, and we hope that sends a clear message. We \nwant to complete our work. While we respect Senators' rights to offer \namendments, we need to get this legislation done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I concur with this agreement, and I will \nsupport it. The leadership on both sides of the aisle and the managers \nof the legislation on both sides of the aisle will support this effort.\n  There is no more important issue for us to deal with right now than \nto pass the Defense authorization legislation that is necessary for our \nmilitary men and women to do their job, including the equipment they \nneed, the pay they need, and the quality of life they need, both here \nand when they are abroad. So we need this Defense authorization bill.\n  We have already passed the supplemental appropriations to pay for \nsome of the costs of the war against terror, particularly with regard \nto our efforts in Afghanistan but other places also. Now this will do \nthe Defense authorization for the next fiscal year.\n  These bills are never easy. In fact, they are always hard. Year after \nyear, though, under the leadership of Senator Warner and now with \nSenator Levin, we have done it. We need to do it again. It should be \nour highest priority.\n  I have urged that this legislation be moved at a time when we can get \nit done before the July 4 recess. Senator Daschle has called it up in a \ntimely way. Now we see that without this agreement between now and when \nSenator Daschle would probably have to file cloture and then get \ncloture sometime next week, the amendments that would be brought up on \nboth sides of the aisle would be, more often than not, nongermane to \nthe Defense bill.\n  Senator Daschle is right, one of the first ones right out of the box \nI am for. I think we ought to make the cuts in the marriage penalty tax \npermanent, unequivocally. There are young men and women who are married \nor want to get married and want to know what they can count on. We \nought to do that, and I am looking forward to finding a way to vote on \nthat again as I did last year.\n  Having said that, it is not germane to this bill. There will be other \namendments that can be offered on both sides of the aisle that are not \ngermane. They may be good and we need to consider them, and maybe we \ncan find a way to consider them, but we have important work to do. It \nis not as if this Defense authorization bill does not have more \namendments that will need to be considered. There are a couple of big \nones that I know of, maybe more than a couple--I would say more like \nfive or six. So we have our work cut out for us to finish this bill on \nits substance, on relevant amendments, in order to finish this work in \na reasonable time on Thursday and hopefully in such a way that we could \nget an agreement to proceed on the Yucca Mountain issue.\n  I know Senator Reid would just as soon I talked all day and not said \nthat, but we have work to do and then we have work to do after that.\n  I support this effort. I think it is the right thing. I thank Senator \nWarner for going to Senator Levin. They talked about this and then came \nto us and suggested this was the right thing to do, and I certainly \nconcur. I commend them for being willing to take that stand.\n  By the way, this is good precedent. We might want to consider \nmanagers doing this on other bills when they are basically attacked by \nnongermane amendments to the underlying bills. If the manager will \nstand up on both sides of the aisle and say we are going to table this \nor we are going to make a point of order because it does not relate to \nthis very important issue we are considering, we can move our \nlegislation a lot quicker. There are culprits on both sides, and \nsometimes I am one of them, but in this case it is the right thing to \ndo and maybe it will set a pattern for us for the rest of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not wish to precede my chairman, but \nI want to make sure I say this while both leaders are on the floor. The \ndistinguished majority leader talked in terms of relevancy; the \nminority leader spoke in terms of germaneness. My understanding is that \nthe standard is relevancy to be decided by the chairman and the ranking \nmember in this case, and we will exercise that fairly but very firmly. \nWe are committed. When I approached the chairman with this proposition, \nI said I will move to table on our side, he will move to table on his \nside or make points of order, as the case may be.\n  The distinguished Republican whip participated in the conversations, \nand I judge that what I am saying is consistent with all who are \nlistening at this time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leadership. This goes back to the days when\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\nI was privileged to be in the Senate with Senator Stennis, who will \nalways be the person who started me on this course of action; that is \nthe way he worked. That is the way John Tower, Barry Goldwater, Scoop \nJackson, and those who preceded us worked when it came to the issues of \nnational defense. They managed those bills with great skill, and less \ndependence, of course, on cloture. I hope this will be the direction in \nwhich we will move.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield for two points?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think Senator Daschle was very careful to say this would \nnot apply to the Defense authorization relevant amendments. There are \nsome that could be offered that they might prefer they not be offered, \nbut they would relate to military hospitals, for instance, as opposed \nto germane ones, which would clearly be eliminated by a cloture vote. \nSeveral of the amendments that have been pending or are being \nconsidered, or suggested would be offered, clearly were not relevant or \ngermane.\n  The other thing is, I really was impressed when the Senator referred \nto a fellow Mississippian, John Stennis, whom I had the honor of \nsucceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank our leaders. It is a very \ndifficult and challenging job to be leaders in this instance. They have \nproven so many times over the years and proven it again this afternoon \nthe importance of taking a very difficult step, but it is a necessary \nstep if we are going to get the bill passed.\n  I heard Senator Warner with his commitment, and I join him in making \nthat commitment that we will move to table or otherwise make a point of \norder against amendments which are not relevant to this Defense bill. \nIt is a better approach than a cloture approach because at least \nrelevant amendments which are not technically germane but are relevant \nto defense will be offered and will not be tabled because of any \nagreement between us.\n  I also thank our whips. Senator Reid, as always, is right there \nhelping to make the wheels move and to grease those wheels, as well as \nSenator Nickles. I thank the two of them, but again thank our two \nleaders for taking this very difficult step and committing to either \ntable or make a point of order against amendments which they may very \nstrongly support. That will go for Senator Warner and myself. I know of \na bunch of them already that I very strongly support but because of the \nneed to get this bill passed I will be constrained to move to table or \nmake a point of order.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments \nand their support for this agreement. The Senator from Virginia made a \nconstructive suggestion that the two of them be the determinants of \nrelevance, and I think that is a very appropriate way to proceed. We \nwill have our managers make that decision, and I will stand behind the \ndecision our managers make on these amendments.\n  Given that understanding, let me say it is our understanding Senator \nMurray's amendment having to do with military hospitals will be offered \nshortly. I would not expect that the debate on the amendment would be \ncompleted tonight, but I would expect that the vote would be sometime \ntomorrow morning. I do not want that amendment to be all we do for the \nremainder of the week. So hopefully we can dispose of the amendment \neither tonight or tomorrow. We will consult with her on how much time \nmay be required. We have debated this before. We have had votes on this \non many occasions. So it would be my hope that we would not have to \ndebate it at length, but we will return to the floor to make some \nannouncement about the remainder of the evening and a vote on the \nMurray amendment either tonight or tomorrow morning.\n  Given the fact that it is late in the afternoon, I would not be \nsurprised if we would have to wait until tomorrow morning, but there \nmay be hope we can complete it within a couple of hours. So we will \nconsult with colleagues on both sides of the aisle with regard to the \nMurray amendment.\n  Senators may lay their amendments down. We will see if we can get a \nunanimous consent agreement on the Murray amendment. If there is the \npossibility of reaching agreement on time on the amendment, that vote \nwill still occur tonight.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3927\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am hoping we will have an agreement and \nI will be able to offer my amendment shortly, so we can have a time \nagreement tonight and hopefully move to a vote on this quickly.\n  To save time, I will now begin a discussion of the amendment I will \noffer. I hope to shortly send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Snowe, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Boxer.\n  Every day since the attacks of September 11, the men and women of our \nArmed Forces have been working overtime--often in hostile, dangerous \nenvironments--to protect our citizens and to secure the freedoms and \nvalues that we cherish.\n  This Department of Defense authorization bill will ensure they have \nthe equipment and resources they need to protect us.\n  Surprisingly, as the women of our military fight for our freedoms \noverseas, they are actually denied some of those freedoms during their \nservice. Here at home, women have the right to choose. They have \nconstitutionally protected access to safe and legal reproductive health \nservices. But that is not the case for military women serving overseas.\n  So I will this evening offer an amendment to ensure that military \npersonnel serving overseas have access to safe and legal abortion \nservices. As many of you know, I have offered this amendment for the \npast several years, and I continue to urge my colleagues to support \nthese efforts.\n  Under current restrictions, women who have volunteered to serve their \ncountry--and female military dependents--are not allowed to exercise \ntheir legally guaranteed right to choose--simply because they are \nserving overseas. These women are committed to protecting our rights as \nfree citizens, yet they are denied one of the most basic rights \nafforded all women in this country.\n  This amendment does not--and let me stress does not--require any \ndirect Federal funding of abortion related services. My amendment would \nrequire these women to pay for any costs associated with an abortion in \na military facility.\n  In addition, this amendment does not--and again let me stress does \nnot--compel a medical provider to perform abortions. All branches of \nthe military allow medical personnel who have moral, religious or \nethical objections to abortion not to participate. This amendment would \nnot change or alter conscience clauses for military medical personnel.\n  This is an important women's health amendment.\n  Women should be able to depend on their base hospital and military \nhealth care providers to meet all of their health care needs. To single \nout abortion-related services could jeopardize a women's health.\n  Opponents of this amendment will argue that the military does now \nensure access for women. But under current practices, a woman who \nrequires abortion related services can seek the approval of her \ncommanding officer for transport back to the United States. Once in the \nUnited States, she can seek these services at her own expense, but she \nis not afforded medical leave.\n  In addition to the serious risk posed by delaying an abortion, this \npolicy compromises a woman's privacy rights by forcing her to release \nher medical condition and needs to her superiors. She must seek and \nreceive the approval of her commanding officer with no guarantee that \nthis information will be kept confidential.\n  This policy also forces women to seek abortions outside of the \nmilitary establishment in foreign countries. Many\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nwomen have little or no understanding of the laws or restrictions in \nthe host country and may have significant language and cultural \nbarriers as well.\n  In this country, we take for granted the safety of our health care \nservices. When we seek care in a doctor's office or clinic, we assume \nthat all safety and health standards are adhered to. Unfortunately, \nthis is not the case in many countries.\n  From 1995 until 2000, the previous administration and former \nSecretary of Defense Cohen supported this amendment. They argued it was \nan important protection for military personnel and dependents. They did \nnot assume there would be any difficulty carrying out this requirement. \nThey were confident that the Defense Department would be able to \ndetermine the cost of these services as well as ensure the availability \nof providers.\n  The Department of Defense has been on record in the past in support \nof this amendment by stating that it was unfair for female service \nmembers serving in overseas location to be denied their constitutional \nright to the full range of reproductive health care. Despite the \nsupport of the previous administration, opponents still argued that \nallowing privately funded abortions in overseas military facilities was \nsomehow beyond the abilities of the Department.\n  Opponents have argued that there is no way to determine the costs of \nthese services, despite the fact that private hospitals must determine \nper-unit costs of per-procedure costs, every single day. Opponents also \nargued that the military might have to contract for these services and \nassume liability for these contractors. This is no different from what \nthe Department does for all military personnel. If a neurosurgeon or \nhighly trained specialist is required to meet the needs of our military \npersonnel, the Department can and does contract for these services and \nof course insures the quality of these services by assuming the \nliability.\n  I remind my colleagues that prior to 1988, the Department of Defense \ndid allow privately funded abortions at overseas military facilities. \nClearly, it can be done. I should also point out that it must be done \ntoday in certain circumstances.\n  Under current law, the Department allows for privately funded \nabortions in the case of rape or incest. It also may pay for abortions \nin case of life endangerment.\n  For our opponents to argue that the Department cannot handle or does \nnot want to be responsible for providing privately funded abortions at \noverseas military facilities, is to argue that the Department cannot \nprotect military personnel and dependents who have been raped, who are \na victim of incest, or whose life is endangered.\n  Is this what we are saying to the estimated 100,000 women who live on \nmilitary bases overseas?\n  Regardless of one's view on abortion, it is simply wrong to place \nwomen at risk. Ensuring that women have access to safe, legal, and \ntimely abortion related services is an important health guarantee. It \nis not a political statement. It is essential that women have access to \na full range of reproductive health care services.\n  This amendment has been supported by: the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, Planned \nParenthood of America, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health \nAssociation, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. These \norganizations support this amendment because of its importance to \nwomen's health care.\n  I would also like to read a letter I recently received from retired \nGeneral Claudia Kennedy, the Army's first woman three-star general. \nBefore she retired in June 2000, she was the highest ranking female \nofficer of her time. She writes:\n\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Murray: I am writing to express my \n     support of your efforts to amend the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to ensure that \n     servicewomen and military dependents stationed overseas have \n     the ability to obtain abortion services in U.S. military \n     medical facilities using their own, private funds.\n       The importance of access to abortions for military women \n     has not been discussed in public media very often, since many \n     of the issues that related to non-military women also are a \n     part of the social and medical environment of military women. \n     However, some distinctions do exist, making it imperative \n     that our soldiers have access to safe, confidential abortion \n     services at U.S. military hospitals overseas. Let me just \n     relate an experience of one of my soldiers about 15 years \n     ago.\n       I was a battalion commander of an intelligence battalion in \n     Augsburg, Germany from 1986 until 1988. One day a non \n     commissioned officer (NCO), who was one of the battalion's \n     senior women, came into my office and asked for permission to \n     take a day off later in the week and to have the same day off \n     for a young soldier in the battalion. She said the soldier \n     was pregnant and wanted an abortion--yet had no way to have \n     an abortion at the U.S. Army medical facility in Augsburg. \n     She had gotten information about a German clinic in another \n     city, and they were going there for the procedure. The \n     soldier did not have enough money to return to the USA for \n     the abortion. Further, she did not want to have to tell her \n     predicament to her chain of command in order to get the time \n     and other assistance to go to the States. I told the NCO to \n     go with her and to let me know when they had returned.\n       Later the NCO told me that the experience had been both \n     mortifying and painful. . . . no pain killer of any sort was \n     administered for the procedure; the modesty of this soldier \n     and the other women at the clinic had been violated (due to \n     different cultural expectation about nudity); and neither she \n     nor the soldier understood German, and the instructions were \n     given in almost unintelligible English. I believe that they \n     were able to get some follow up care for the soldier at the \n     U.S. Army medical facility. But it was a searing experience \n     for all of us--that in a very vulnerable time, this American \n     who was serving her country overseas could not count on the \n     Army to give her the care she needed.\n       During that same time frame, and in the early 1990's when I \n     was a brigade commander of an intelligence brigade in Hawaii, \n     I noticed that there were Army doctors who displayed posters \n     which were extremely disapproving of abortion . . . creating \n     a climate of intimidation for anyone who might want to \n     discuss what is a legal option. Since the doctors are \n     officers and far out-rank enlisted soldiers, and since the \n     soldiers have no way to choose which doctor they see on sick \n     call, it was only with good luck that a young soldier might \n     be seen by someone who would treat her decision with the \n     respect she deserved.\n       What makes the situation of a soldier different from that \n     of a civilian woman? She is subject to the orders of the \n     officers appointed over her. Every hour of her day belongs to \n     the U.S. Army, and she must have her seniors' permission to \n     leave her place of duty. She makes very low pay and so relies \n     on the help of friends and family to pay for travel for \n     medical care that is not given by the Army.\n       Of all the reasons we lose soldiers we lose soldiers from \n     their place of duty (for training, injuries, temporary duty \n     elsewhere, and other reasons), pregnancy accounts for only 6% \n     of all reasons for soldier absence. Yet, this feature of \n     women (that they sometimes become pregnant) is offer cited as \n     an attribute that makes them less desirable as soldiers. \n     While I believe that the difficult decision to end a \n     pregnancy should be completely individual, the institution \n     cannot have it both ways: to deny women safe and reasonable \n     access to abortion (in a world in which there is no 100% \n     effective birth control), and at the same time to complain \n     that women are pregnant.\n       I commend your efforts to remove this irrational and \n     harmful barrier to the health and well-being of our soldiers \n     serving America.\n\n  Madam President, I could not have said it better myself. Our female \nmilitary personnel deserve better than what they are getting. As we \nsend out troops into the war on terrorism to protect our freedoms, we \nshould ensure that female military personnel are not asked to sacrifice \ntheir rights and protections as well.\n  I recognize the urgency in passing the fiscal year 2003 Defense \nauthorization bill. It provides important support for our military \npersonnel and infrastructure.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for their efforts to move this legislation.\n  I stand ready to support whatever measures we need to consider to \nensure that our military is ready to respond to this new world threat.\n  I only ask that female military personnel and their dependents be \ngiven the support they deserve when serving in overseas military \nlocations.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Again, I will offer my amendment as soon as we have a time agreement. \nHopefully, that can be very soon because I know we want to vote on this \nand move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of Members, what we \nare going to try to do tonight is make sure that everyone who has \nanything to say about this amendment has the opportunity to speak. \nWhether you are for it\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nor against it, come over and tell us how you feel. The majority leader \nhas indicated we will schedule a vote in the morning. We are trying to \nwork that out now with him, but probably around 9:45 in the morning.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 \nminutes for debate tonight with respect to the Murray amendment No. \n3927, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form; \nthat no amendment be in order to the amendment, prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that when the Senate resumes consideration \nof the bill on Friday, June 21, following the opening ceremony, the \ntime until 9:45 be equally divided and controlled in the usual form; \nthat at 9:45 a.m., without further intervening action or debate, the \nSenate vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I just \ngot a call in of somebody who may want to speak. If we can hold this \nfor a minute, I think we can check it out.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we just increase the time to 90 minutes?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I need to check this out, if I can. I will object at \nthis point, but I hope we can get it done quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we require an awful lot from our service \nmen and women. First of all, we urge them to volunteer to serve in the \nmilitary. Then, we send them all over the world to serve our Nation's \ninterests. When we ask them to serve in foreign countries, the least we \ncan do is ensure that they receive medical care equal to what they \nwould receive in the United States.\n  Servicewomen and dependents who are fortunate enough to be stationed \nin the United States and who make the difficult decision to have an \nabortion can, at their own expense, get a legal abortion performed by \nan English speaking doctor in a modern, safe American medical facility.\n  Military women stationed overseas do not have the same opportunity. \nThey can seek the permission of their commanders to return to the \nUnited States to obtain an abortion, or they can seek an abortion in \nforeign hospitals by foreign doctors, many of whom don't speak English, \nand who may have different medical standards. These choices are not \nacceptable.\n  I can only imagine how difficult it would be for a female officer or \nenlisted person to have to go to her commander and ask for time off to \ntravel to the United States to get an abortion. This is a very personal \nand difficult decision even under normal circumstances.\n  The alternative of seeking an abortion from a host nation doctor, who \nmay or may not be trained to U.S. standards, in a foreign facility, \nwhere the staff may not even speak English, is an equally unacceptable \nalternative. Our servicewomen deserve better.\n  Our laws recognize the right of women to choose. This amendment would \nrestore the ability of our female service members stationed overseas to \nexercise their constitutional right to choose safe abortion services at \nno cost to DOD.\n  The amendment to be offered does not require the Department of \nDefense to pay for abortions. All expenses would be paid by those who \nseek the abortion. The abortions would be performed by American \nmilitary doctors who volunteer to perform abortions.\n  Military women should be able to depend on the military for quality \nhealth care, no matter where we may ask them to serve their country. \nThis amendment gives service women stationed overseas the same range \nand quality of medical care available in the United States. We owe them \nat least that much.\n  I hope soon there will be a unanimous consent agreement entered into \nthat would allow Senator Murray then to offer her amendment on this \nsubject. I hope tomorrow morning we can expect a vote on this amendment \nand that the Senate will adopt the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I just received a communication from the \nleadership. May I have another 3 or 4 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Of course. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be \na period of 60 minutes for debate with respect to the Murray amendment \nNo. 3927; that the debate be completed tonight; that the time be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that no amendment be \nin order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; \nthat on Friday, June 21, when the Senate resumes consideration of the \nbill at 9:30 a.m., the Senate vote, without any intervening action or \ndebate in relation to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Members, the \nchairman and ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction of this \nmatter have a very important committee meeting at 9 o'clock tomorrow \nmorning. We asked them if they would allow us to go forward with the \nvote at 9:45 a.m., and they said they have a very important witness, \nSecretary Wolfowitz. They agreed to that 15 minutes.\n  I indicate to the two managers of the bill, we will drag this vote \nout so they can stay at their meeting until 9:45 a.m. or a little \nlonger. We are not going to stick to our usual iron-fast rule that the \nvotes are completed quickly. This vote might take 30 or 40 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished leader. Yes, \nwe are having a very important hearing, but I am certain we could \ndetermine a point during the course of that hearing and the time \nnormally allowed for the vote for us to adjourn for, say, 10 minutes, \nso that all of our members could vote and return to the hearing. I am \nsure the chairman would agree to that.\n  Mr. REID. We hope everyone will get here as quickly as possible. That \nbeing the case and this having been agreed to, there will be no \nrollcall votes tonight. The majority leader asked me to make that \nannouncement.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time under our control will be controlled by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. REID. And the time on this side will be controlled by the sponsor \nof the amendment, Senator Murray.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3927\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3927 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself and Ms. Snowe, \nproposes an amendment numbered 3927.\n\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore a previous policy regarding restrictions on use of \n                   Department of Defense facilities)\n\n       On page 154, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``Restriction on Use of \n     Funds.--''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask the Senator from New Jersey how \nmuch time he wants.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Five minutes at the most.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey, and then we will go to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Murray-\nSnowe amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  As the Senate considers this authorization bill of great importance \nto our military, one that I support, and I think most Members will, it \nis critical to guarantee U.S. servicewomen and military dependents \naccess to safe and comprehensive reproductive health care services.\n  Current law prevents women in the military from using their own money \nto access abortion services at overseas Department of Defense \nfacilities, except in the cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest.\n  Frankly, I think it is an outrage that women in the military--who \nmake the ultimate commitment to this county--are in turn denied a \nfreedom protected by the Constitution and afforded all women in this \ncountry. It is hard for me to imagine.\n  This ban discriminates against women and their families by \nrestricting their legally protected right to choose simply because they \nare stationed overseas.\n  Surely we do not believe that American citizens who risk their lives \nin service to this country deserve fewer rights than other Americans \nenjoy?\n  Because of the ban on access to abortion services at military base \nhospitals, women are forced to choose between often-inadequate local \nhealth care facilities or sometimes extensive and costly travel. In \nboth cases, the current ban has the effect of severely jeopardizing \nwomen's health.\n  Let there be no exaggeration about the scope of the Murray-Snowe \namendment. This is not about federal funding of abortion. This \namendment would simply allow women to use their own private funds to do \nwhat they would have the right to do at home, to access services at \noverseas U.S. military hospitals.\n  In addition, it will not force providers, doctors or others, to \nperform abortion services. All three branches of the military already \nhave conscience clauses that will remain intact.\n  Finally, this amendment respects the laws of host countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our women in the military by \nsupporting this amendment. Surely, women who serve our country have the \nsame rights as those who are here at home in private life. I thank \nSenators Murray and Snowe for their leadership on the issue. I think it \nis extremely important that we respect the right of choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray \namendment. I think it is regrettable that we would tie up the DOD \nauthorization bill with one of the most contentious issues of our day. \nYet that is what is regrettably taking place in this legislation.\n  On February 10, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1996 was signed into law by then-President Clinton with a \nprovision to prevent the Department of Defense medical treatment \nfacilities from being used to perform abortions, except where the life \nof the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. This \nprovision refers to the Clinton administration policy instituted in \nJanuary 1993 permitting abortions to be performed at military \nfacilities. From 1988 to 1993, the performance of abortions was not \npermitted at military hospitals except when the life of the mother was \nin danger. That had been the longstanding policy.\n  The Murray amendment, regrettably, which would repeal this culture of \nlife provision, attempts to turn taxpayer-funded Department of Defense \nmedical treatment facilities into, unfortunately, abortion clinics. \nFortunately, the Senate has refused to let this issue of abortion \nadversely affect our armed services and rejected this amendment in the \nyear 2000 by a vote of 51 to 49. We should reject it again this year. \nIt is I think very harmful and wrong that we would hold America's armed \nservices hostage to abortion politics using the coercive power of \ngovernment to force American taxpayers--that is who pays for these \nfacilities, the American taxpayers--to fund health care facilities \nwhere abortions are performed. This would be a horrible precedent and \nwould put many Americans in a very difficult position.\n  Americans are being asked to use their taxpayer dollars to fund \nsomething that many people find absolutely wrong and completely \ndisagree with, and we are asking people to use taxpayer dollars to fund \nthe Department of Defense medical facilities to do something with which \nthey disagree.\n  I realize we are terribly divided as a nation on the issue of \nabortion. That is painfully obvious and has been so for the past 30 \nyears, but here we step into the issue of taxpayer funding, the use of \ntaxpayer-funded facilities for abortions, and that is generally a \nterrain where most of the public has been quite in agreement we should \nnot use taxpayer dollars.\n  They may say privately you can go ahead with abortion, other people \nsay no, you should not do that, but generally when you are saying use \ntaxpayer-funded facilities, most people have said we should not go \nthere, we should not use taxpayer-funded facilities for something that \nmany people in the public believe is terribly wrong. That is why I \noppose this amendment.\n  When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was \nfirst promulgated, military physicians, as well as many nurses and \nsupporting personnel, refused to perform or assist in elective \nabortions. In response, the administration sought to hire civilians to \ndo these abortions. Indeed, there is a CRS study we have on this topic \nwhich said that in the 6 years preceding the 1988 ban--I am reading \ndirectly from this CRS report dated June 5, 2000--military hospitals \noverseas have performed an average of 30 abortions annually. \nLast spring, though, when the military medical officials surveyed 44 \nArmy, Navy, and Air Force obstetricians and gynecologists stationed in \nEurope, they found that all but one doctor adamantly refused to perform \nthe procedure. That one holdout, too, quickly switched positions. No \nmilitary medical personnel willing to perform abortions have stepped \nforward in the sprawling Pacific theater either.\n\n  We can look at that and say there is not access to the service or we \ncan say that the military personnel are just very uncomfortable and \nthey do not want to do this in the medical facilities that are paid for \nby taxpayer dollars.\n  Military facilities around the world operate as outposts of the U.S. \nGovernment. These are our facilities. They are seen as our facilities. \nThey operate in many countries with differing ideas, with differing \nfaiths, and with differing views on abortion. They do not want to be, \nas military personnel, having those abortions performed in these \nfacilities operated and controlled by the U.S. Government. They do not \nwant to perform the abortions themselves either.\n  This amendment would allow doctors to use U.S. Government military \npersonnel to perform a procedure that many countries and many cultures \nview very negatively and as wrong. I think we should listen to what \nsome of our doctors are saying and, in the military, what some of them \nare saying by\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\ntheir actions. Therefore, if the Murray amendment were adopted, not \nonly would taxpayer-funded facilities be used to support abortion on \ndemand, but resources would be used to search for, hire, and transport \nnew personnel simply so abortions could be performed, and this is \nabortion on demand.\n  I want to make that clear as well because the current law provides \nfor the use of these facilities for abortions when the life of the \nmother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. So we are talking \nabout the issue of abortion on demand.\n  One argument used by supporters of abortions in military hospitals is \nthat women in countries where abortion is not permitted will have \nnowhere else to turn to obtain an abortion. However, DOD policy \nrequires military doctors to obey the abortion laws of the countries \nwhere they are providing services, so they still cannot perform \nabortions in those locations if they are in a country that has those \nlaws.\n  Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing and \nnurturing life, dedicated to a culture of life, should not be forced to \nfacilitate the taking of innocent human life, the child in a womb, \nabortion on demand, where the life of the mother is not at stake or it \nis not a case of rape or incest. We already provide for that.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to table the Murray amendment and to free \nAmerica's military from abortion politics. American taxpayers should \nnot be forced to fund the destruction of innocent life when many are \ndeeply affected and believe this is not the sort of thing for which \ntheir taxpayer dollars should be used. Enough people are disappointed \non some things we spend taxpayer dollars on without going into such a \ndivisive area in our country, using taxpayer-funded facilities to allow \nabortions to take place.\n  If passed, this amendment will have a tremendously detrimental impact \non this DOD authorization bill, probably effectively killing it if this \namendment is included. I therefore urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment, for the benefit of the DOD authorization bill and the \nbenefit of the taxpayers who do not view this as the right way to use \ntheir facilities, paid for at taxpayer expense, turned over as abortion \nclinics.\n  It is a very divisive issue and an issue that is difficult for most \nMembers to discuss. It is an issue on which we all have taken a \nposition. All positions are clear on this topic. I hope we do not hold \nhostage this very important bill that is needed for this country in the \ntime of this war on terrorism. Do not hold it hostage to such a \ndifficult, divisive issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I see my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, a \ncosponsor of this amendment, who has worked diligently with me. I ask \nhow much time she needs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As much time as I may consume.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Maine as much time as she \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her \nleadership, once again, on this most important amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization. I commend her for her commitment \nand perseverance on this issue. Ultimately, we will prevail. I hope \nthat will occur on this reauthorization. I am pleased to join my \ncolleague in support of this amendment to repeal the ban on abortions \nat overseas military hospitals, an amendment whose time has long since \ncome.\n  Year after year, time after time, debate after debate, we revisit the \nissue of women's reproductive freedoms by seeking to restrict, limit, \nand eliminate a woman's right to choose. Think of Yogi Berra: I have \nthe feeling of deja vu all over again. To that, I add: The more things \nchange, the more they stay the same. Here we are debating the issue \nagain.\n  The most recent changes ought to truly give Members pause; all the \nmore impetus to ensure that things don't stay the same. We must \nremember that when we are considering this Defense authorization during \na time of war, when Americans, both civilian and military are fighting \nterrorism all across the globe, both men and women. In fact, more than \n34,000 women were serving overseas as of April this year. We have \ncombined, between women in the service and dependents, more than \n100,000 abroad. We recognize the impact that the failure to repeal this \nban has on so many of these women.\n  Think of the changes that have occurred since 1973 when the Supreme \nCourt affirmed for the first time a woman's right to choose. That \nlandmark decision was carefully crafted to be both balanced and \nresponsible while holding the rights of women in America paramount in \nreproductive health decisions.\n  Importantly, while it has not always been easy, that right stands \nprotected today; that is, unless, you happen to be a female member of \nthe Armed Forces or a female dependent of a military member stationed \noverseas. How ironic it is that the very people who are fighting to \npreserve our freedoms, those who are on the front lines defending this \nwar on terrorism or other parts of the globe, are supporting those who \nare fighting, are currently the least protected in terms of the right \nto make choices about their own personal health and reproductive \ndecisions.\n\n  That is why I stand to join my colleague, Senator Murray, once again, \nin overturning this ban on privately funded abortion services in \noverseas military hospitals, for military women and dependents based \noverseas, which was reinstated in the fiscal year 1996 authorization \nbill, as we all know. It is a ban without merit or reason that put the \nreproductive health of these women at risk.\n  Specifically, as we know, the ban denies the right to choose for \nfemale military personnel and dependents. It effectively denies those \nwomen who have voluntarily decided to serve our country in the armed \nservices safe and legal medical care simply because they were assigned \nduty in another country. What kind of reward is that? Why is it that \nCongress would want to punish those women who so bravely serve our \ncountry overseas by denying them the rights that are guaranteed to all \nAmericans under the Constitution?\n  Our task in this debate is to make sure that all of America's women, \nincluding those who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces and military \ndependents, are guaranteed the fundamental right to choose.\n  Let's review the history of this issue. First and foremost, I remind \nmy colleagues since 1979 the Federal law has prohibited the use of \nFederal funds to perform abortions at military hospitals. However, from \n1979 to 1988, women could use their own personal funds to pay for the \nmedical care they need.\n  In 1988, the Reagan administration announced a new policy prohibiting \nthe performance of any abortions at military hospitals even if it was \npaid for out of a woman's private funds--a policy which truly defies \nlogic.\n  In January of 1993, President Clinton lifted the ban by Executive \norder, restoring a woman's right to pay for abortion services with \nprivate, non-Defense Department funds.\n  Then, in 1995, through the very bill we authorize today, the House \nInternational Security Committee reinstated this ban which was retained \nin the conference. That effort kicked off the debate which we are now \nhaving today.\n  Let me reiterate--and it is a point that needs to be made perfectly \nclear--President Clinton's Executive order did not change existing law \nprohibiting the use of Federal funds for abortion, and it did not \nrequire medical providers to perform those abortions. In fact, all \nthree branches of the military have conscience clauses which permit \nmedical personnel with moral, religious, or ethical objections to \nabortion not to participate in the procedure. I believe that is a \nreasonable measure.\n  With that chronology fresh in everyone's mind, we should state for \nthe record to the opponents of this amendment that the argument that \nchanging current law means that military personnel and military \nfacilities are charged with performing abortions, and that this, in \nturn, means that American taxpayer funds will be used to subsidize \nabortions, is wholly and fundamentally incorrect. Every hospital that \nperforms the surgery, every physician that performs any procedure on\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\nany patient must determine the cost of that procedure. That includes \nthe time, the supplies, the materials, the overhead, the insurance, \nanything that is included in the expense of performing that procedure \nis included in the cost that is paid by private funds. Public funds are \nnot used for the performance of abortions in this instance. That is an \nimportant distinction to reinforce today. I know it is easy to confuse \nthe debate, to obfuscate the issues when, in fact, what we are talking \nabout is a woman using her own private insurance or money in support of \nthat procedure. We are not talking about using Federal funds.\n  This amendment we are fighting for is to lift the ban on privately \nfunded abortions paid for with a woman's private funds. That is what we \nneed to understand today. That is what this issue is all about. A woman \nwould have the ability to have access to a constitutional right when it \ncomes to her reproductive freedom to use her own funds, her own health \ninsurance, for access to this procedure.\n  I think when it comes to health care and safety of an American \nsoldier, sailor, airman, marine, or their dependents, our armed \nservices should have no better friend and ally than the Congress. I \nwould argue that is the case in most situations, but obviously there is \na different standard when it comes to the health of a woman and her \nreproductive decisions.\n  Timing is everything because for those women who are in the military \nor were military dependents overseas between 1993 and 1996, they were \nable to have access to abortion services using their own private funds \nat a military hospital.\n  If it is true that timing is everything, all those women who served \noverseas since 1996 have lost everything when it comes to making that \nmost fundamental, personal, difficult decision. I repeat that--it is a \nvery difficult decision. It is a very personal decision. It is a \ndecision that should be made between a woman, her doctor, her family. \nIt is a constitutional right. It is a constitutional right that should \nextend to women in the military overseas, not just within the \nboundaries of the United States.\n  I cannot understand how anyone could rationalize that we could \nsomehow discriminate against our women who are serving in the military \nbecause they happen to be abroad. I think it is regrettable because it \nis shortchanging women in the military and the military depends on \nwomen serving. We could not have an all-volunteer force without women \nserving in the military.\n  I think it is regrettable that somehow we have demeaned women, in \nterms of this very difficult decision that they have to make. There has \nbeen example upon example given to us, to my colleague Senator Murray, \nabout the trying circumstances that this prohibition has placed on \nwomen who serve in the military abroad. I do not think for one moment \nanybody should minimize or underestimate the emotional, physical \nhardship that this ban has imposed, a ban that prohibits a woman from \nusing her own private health insurance, her own private funds to make \nher own constitutional decision when she happens to be in the military \nserving abroad.\n  The ban on abortions in military hospitals coerce the women who serve \nour country into making decisions and choices they would not otherwise \nmake. As one doctor, a physician from Oregon, recalls his days as a \nNavy doctor stationed in the Philippines, he describes the experiences \nand hardships that result from this policy. Women have to travel long \ndistances in order to obtain a legal abortion. Travel arrangements were \ndifficult and expensive. In order to take leave, they had to justify \ntaking emergency leave to their commanding officer. Imagine that \ncircumstance. So that everybody knows.\n  Some women, alternatively, have turned to local illegal abortions. In \nother circumstances, their dignity was offended and often their health \nwas placed at risk, which was certainly reinforced by the letter that \nwas sent to both Senator Murray and me from Lieutenant General Kennedy, \nwho is now retired. She was the highest ranking woman in the military. \nShe talked about the humiliation and the demeaning circumstances in \nwhich many women were placed, not to mention putting their health at \nrisk.\n  I hope we can reconcile the realities of the existing ban by \noverturning this prohibition in law and granting to women in the \nmilitary the same constitutional right that is afforded women who live \nwithin the boundaries of the United States of America.\n  I never thought that women should leave their constitutional rights \nat the proverbial door, but that is what this ban has done. These \nconstitutional rights are not territorial. Women who serve their \ncountry should be afforded the same rights that women here in America \nhave.\n\n  I think this ban is not consistent with the principles which our \nArmed Forces are fighting to protect, and which the American people so \noverwhelmingly support. I hope we move forward, and I hope we would \nunderstand that women in the military and their dependents overseas \ndeserve the same rights that women have here in this country. They have \nand should have the protections of the Constitution, no matter where \nthey live.\n  I hope the Senate will overturn that ban and will support the \namendment offered by Senator Murray and myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Maine for her excellent \nstatement, and I yield to my colleague from North Carolina such time as \nhe should consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Levin and Warner for \ntheir leadership on this important bill. It is an important bill for \nthe country and we need to move forward on it. It is important work \nthey have done. I also thank my colleague from Washington, Senator \nMurray, for her leadership on this amendment. Women who serve our \ncountry in the military should have a right to use their own private \nmoney to pay for safe, legal medical care that they themselves choose. \nI wish to express my strong support for Senator Murray's amendment. We \nappreciate very much her leadership on this issue.\n  I also want to take a minute to talk about the issue of homeland \nsecurity. In the last couple of weeks, everybody in Washington has been \ntalking about the administration's plan to reorganize a whole range of \nGovernment bureaucracies into a new Department of Homeland Security. \nNow Congress is rushing to complete this massive reshuffling in just a \nmatter of weeks.\n  I do not oppose this reorganization effort. In fact, I think it might \ndo some real good in the long run. I applaud the very serious people on \nboth sides of the aisle who are trying to make the plan the best it can \npossibly be. But I am troubled that Washington is becoming so caught up \nwith reorganization that we are losing sight of our most urgent \npriorities. Everybody is asking who will report to whom? Who will be in \nwhat building? Who will get the corner office?\n  We are beginning to convince ourselves that by reshuffling the \nbureaucracy, we are going to solve the real problem--that Government \nreorganization can win the war on terrorism.\n\n  We cannot allow preoccupation with reorganization to distract us from \nthe clear and present danger from terrorists who are in our midst as we \nspeak. Our most urgent priority is simple: to find the terrorists, \ninfiltrate their cells, and stop them, stop them cold. In order to do \nthat, I think we need to address three critical questions directly \nrelated to prosecuting the war on terrorism today.\n  No. 1, are we doing enough, everything in our power, to track al-\nQaida, Hezbollah, Hamas, and every other terrorist organization within \nour own borders? To be more specific, are we doing enough to develop \nand deploy the human intelligence needed to infiltrate these \norganizations?\n  No. 2, does the FBI know foreign intelligence information when they \nsee it? And do they recognize all the uses of that information? For \nexample, if the FBI acquires foreign intelligence information in the \ncourse of a criminal investigation, do they see the importance of that \ninformation, not just for their criminal prosecution but also in\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\nthe ongoing effort to disrupt terrorists in their activities?\n  No. 3, having recognized the importance of information, is the FBI \neffectively sharing that information, both within the FBI itself and \nwith other elements of the intelligence community?\n  No. 1, are we getting the information we need about the terrorists in \nthis country? No. 2, are we recognizing all the uses of that \ninformation? No. 3, are we effectively sharing that information among \nthose who need to have it in order to react to it?\n  I believe the answer to all three of those questions is no. As a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, I believe these issues are \nfundamental to our ability to fight terrorism. They must be fixed now. \nAnd they do not require reorganization of existing bureaucracy.\n  There is no question that we should reorganize the Government to meet \nthe challenges of the future. But there is no substitute for the urgent \nsteps we must take now, immediately, to meet the dangers of the \npresent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to our colleague \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas for leading the opposition to this ill conceived \namendment. I thank him for his courage and conviction in this area of \nhuman life. I thank him for yielding time.\n  I rise today in very strong opposition to the amendment that is being \nput forward by the Senator from Washington. This amendment would allow \nabortion on demand on military facilities overseas. In fact, it would \nforce the American people--including those millions who are strongly \nopposed to abortion and who are pro-life--to help pay for abortions. I \nknow the opponents of this amendment argue otherwise. But I think a \nlittle thought shows the fallacy in that proposition and that, in fact, \nit would force those who have very deep conscientious convictions \nagainst abortion to help pay for abortion on our military bases.\n  Abortion is an issue that continues to divide our Nation. The Defense \nauthorization bill should be focused on ensuring that our military has \nall the resources to fight and win our Nation's wars. It is unfortunate \nthat this bill has year after year been the vehicle to attempt to \nadvance a pro-abortion agenda.\n  In 1976, Congress adopted what has come to be known as the Hyde \namendment. This amendment essentially prohibits the use of Federal \nfunds for performing abortions. It has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt as constitutional.\n  I share the view of millions of Americans that abortion is a \ndestruction of human life and that it represents one of the great moral \noutrages of our day and one of the great moral questions of our \ngeneration.\n  The Hyde amendment ensures that the tax dollars of these citizens who \ndeeply believe abortion is something that is morally objectionable--it \nensures that those citizens are not forced to pay for something to \nwhich they so object. It ensures that their money is not used for what \nthey consider to be the murder of the unborn.\n  This is the foundation of my objection to the Murray amendment. My \ncolleagues claim that no public funds will be used for these overseas \nabortions. However, military facilities overseas were built with \nFederal tax dollars. The medical equipment was paid for by the U.S. \nGovernment. The military personnel facilities are paid from the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Under the Murray amendment, will a portion of the cost of the \nconstruction of the military facility be charged to the woman seeking \nan abortion or will this funding come from the pockets of the \ntaxpayers, millions of whom believe abortion is a reprehensible \npractice?\n  It would be impossible--technically impossible--to accurately \ncalculate the cost of reimbursing DOD for an abortion. It is not \nfeasible with existing information systems and support capabilities to \ncollect billing information relevant to a specific encounter within the \nmilitary health care system. Military infrastructure and overhead costs \ncannot be allocated on a case-by-case basis. It is clear that the \nMurray amendment runs counter to both the letter and the spirit of the \nHyde amendment.\n  A military health care professional cannot be forced to perform a \nprocedure, such as abortion, that runs against their moral beliefs. \nThat is a good thing. But it is a recognition we have had in the U.S. \nmilitary that physicians who have moral convictions against abortion \ncan't be forced to do that to which they morally object. In these \ncases, the military will be forced under the Murray amendment to \ncontract out to civilian physicians.\n  In 1993, President Clinton issued an Executive order allowing \nprivately funded abortions at military facilities. That is what we are \nvoting on tomorrow morning. Every military medical professional \nstationed in Europe and Asia refused to perform an abortion--every \nsingle one; all of our military. I think it speaks very highly of them. \nEvery one of these military medical professionals in all of the \ncontinent of Europe and all of the continent of Asia, to a person, \nrefused to perform abortions. Think about that.\n  Military funding will have to be used to pay a nonmilitary doctor to \ncome into a military hospital to perform an abortion. That, I think, is \nobjectionable to most Americans, regardless of how you feel about \nabortion. It is unconscionable that this body is considering pushing \nthe military into the business of performing abortions.\n  We are engaged in a global war unlike any in our Nation's history. \nThe Defense authorization bill should be a vehicle to ensure that our \nmilitary has all the resources it requires to protect the American \npeople. Unfortunately, in this case it is being used to advance a pro-\nabortion agenda.\n  This amendment addresses a problem that does not exist. \nServicemembers can use military air at virtually no cost to travel back \nto the United States for any medical procedure--any medical procedure.\n  As the former chair and current ranking member of the Personnel \nSubcommittee, I have spoken with thousands of our military personnel \nall over the world. They have concerns about many things--concerns \nabout military pay, about housing, and about vaccines against \nbiological weapons--but not once have I heard a complaint about not \nbeing able to get an abortion on a military base overseas.\n  It is the policy of the Department of Defense to follow the laws of \nthe nations in which our bases are located. Many nations ban abortion. \nThe Murray amendment would subvert the laws of those countries that \nhost American military personnel. South Korea bans abortions. Saudi \nArabia bans abortions. Essentially, the Murray amendment would require \nDepartment of Defense personnel to perform crimes in the nations that \nare hosting our military.\n  This amendment was defeated in the House of Representatives on May 9 \nby a vote of 215 to 202. Should this amendment pass the Senate and be \nadded to the Senate Defense authorization bill, it will be a heavy \nweight on this bill. The conference committee will be sharply divided \non this issue, as are the American people. This amendment will become \nthe bone of contention in the conference committee, as it has been in \nprevious years and as abortion issues have been in previous years. It \nwill complicate what many of us already believe and anticipate will be \na difficult conference. It will complicate this conference on the DOD \nauthorization bill at a critical time in our Nation's history, when we \nneed to speak with one mind and one voice and when we need to move \nahead in unity to fight this war on terrorism. To see the DOD \nauthorization bill bogged down on an emotional and divisive issue, \nwhich should not be in this legislation, is a disservice to those men \nand women who are fighting this war on terrorism around the world.\n  The Defense authorization bill includes the funding that our military \ndesperately needs to fight the war on terrorism. It includes the pay \nraise of our troops. It includes funding for important initiatives \naimed at improving the quality of life for military families. This bill \nis not the forum for a fight on abortion.\n  I regret that the amendment is being offered. It will place the \nSenate and the\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nconferees in the position of having to fight this issue out in what \nwill undoubtedly be a protracted, prolonged debate in the conference \ncommittee.\n  Our military medical facilities are designed to save lives, not \ndestroy them. I ask my colleagues to not turn them into abortion \nclinics. Please do not place this very heavy burden on the men and \nwomen of our military, especially while they are risking their own \nlives in defense of the American people against international \nterrorism.\n  I remind my colleagues, it violates the spirit and the letter of the \nHyde amendment. No matter how you simplistically present it, you cannot \nallocate all of the various costs involved in this procedure to \nmilitary personnel, to a tax-funded facility with tax-funded personnel, \nand to equipment purchased by the taxpayers. You simply cannot \ndetermine what that individual would have to pay to privately pay for \nthe abortion.\n\n  It is really not a problem. It is not something we hear a hue and cry \nabout from men and women in the military. And it violates, in many \ncases, the host country's laws and will put our own military in a \nposition of violating the current Department of Defense policy, and a \nright policy, that we should recognize and respect the laws of the \ncountries in which we are being hosted.\n  Frankly, and finally, it creates a great practical problem in \nbringing this legislation to finality and getting it to the President's \ndesk and moving on at a critical time, as our Nation continues to fight \nthis war on terrorism.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of \nthe abortion issue to think long and hard about the wisdom of attaching \nthis amendment to the DOD authorization bill.\n  I thank the Chair. And I thank the Senator from Kansas for yielding \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will be brief and allow the Senator \nfrom Washington to speak.\n  Some comments have been made. I certainly appreciate the excellent \ncomments my colleague from Arkansas made. I think he very succinctly \nput forward that this is not a major problem. It could create problems \nin host countries.\n  We do not need to turn our military facilities into abortion clinics \nand use Federal funds to pay for something a lot of taxpayers believe \nis deeply wrong, the killing of life.\n  There is one argument that has been raised that I want to address \ndirectly, and that is that we are denying women their constitutional \nright if they can't use a military facility to have abortion on demand.\n  Remember, currently, women are allowed to have an abortion in cases \ninvolving the life of the mother, rape, or incest. That is allowed at \nmilitary facilities today. So we are strictly talking about the \ncategory of abortion on demand at military facilities.\n  It has been raised that we are denying women a constitutional right. \nThat is not the case. What we are talking about here is the use of \ntaxpayer-funded military facilities. If that is denying women their \nconstitutional right to an abortion, I would presume you would have to \nsay we are denying that here because we do not provide abortions in \nfederally funded facilities in the United States. We do not do that. \nThat would be contrary to the Hyde amendment.\n  This is not denying women a constitutional right. They can have an \nabortion in other places. The Senator from Arkansas was commenting \nabout how that could occur. This is strictly about the use of \nGovernment-paid facilities which we do not allow anywhere else in the \nworld because of the Hyde amendment.\n  The Hyde amendment says you cannot use federally funded facilities, \nFederal dollars to pay for abortions. It is well-established U.S. law, \na well-established U.S. position. We would now cut an exception to that \nif we allowed abortions in military facilities. The Clinton \nadministration had done that for a period of time, but that has not \nbeen the law in this country for some period, since 1996.\n  So we are not denying women a constitutional right. This is about the \nuse of federally funded facilities, which we do not allow anywhere, for \nthe conducting of an abortion. I think that is a point we should make \nvery clear in this debate.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have \ncosponsored this amendment with me--Senator Snowe, Senator Mikulski, \nand Senator Boxer--and remind my colleagues that what we are simply \nasking for is that the women who serve us in military uniforms overseas \nhave access to safe, legal, reproductive health care systems.\n  This system today does not let them have that. They are serving in \nthe Philippines or Germany or wherever we have asked them to go, and \nthey want access to affordable health care.\n  I would remind my colleagues that it is not just the women who are in \nthe services; it is the dependents of these who are in the services, as \nwell, who are being denied. They have to go to their superior officer \nto ask permission--usually an older person, usually a man--for leave to \ncome back to the United States.\n  They have to wait for transport on a C-17 or other military \nequipment, which could take time, putting their health in jeopardy. \nThey have to be subjected to giving up their privacy rights because, \nmost likely, they will have to tell their officer why they want to come \nback to the United States. So they are putting their life and their \nhealth and their health care at risk. And these are women who are \nserving us overseas.\n  All we are asking with this amendment is that they have the ability \nto go to a military hospital--where we have health care equipment, \nwhere we have safe equipment, where we have good doctors--to pay for \ntheir own health care for which they are asking.\n  I have heard over and over again that these are taxpayer expenses. \nThe women will pay for the services. We are not asking for them to have \ntaxpayer support.\n  Mr. President, this makes complete sense. It is common sense. We \nshould treat our military women who are serving us as equal citizens to \nthe women who live in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment tomorrow morning.\n  I am more than willing to yield back my time. I see our whip is on \nthe floor. And I see Senator Brownback is in the Chamber. I am willing \nto yield back our time if he is ready to end this debate as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments \nof the Senator from Washington when she talks about the demeaning \nsituation that women in our military have to go through and \noperationally discuss what her amendment would do.\n  She is saying they have to go to a superior officer, frequently a \nmale, to ask for permission. If the Murray amendment were to pass, we \ncurrently do not have any military doctors--according to the last \nsurvey we received from CRS--who are willing to conduct abortions. This \nwas the CRS statement I cited and the Senator from Arkansas cited.\n  The Senator from Washington is saying, OK, we are going to use U.S. \nmilitary bases as an abortion clinic. The abortion is going to be \nperformed there. Somebody is going to have to recruit a medical doctor \nwho is not on the military base because you cannot force the military \ndoctors to perform the abortion. Somebody is going to have to get the \napproval for that to take place. Somebody is going to have to secure \nthe medical facility there at the military base for use in performing \nthe abortion.\n  The notion that women have given up all their rights to privacy or \ntheir dependents have given up all their rights to privacy without \nhaving the Murray amendment--I would say that it is exactly the \nopposite, that it is more likely if they do have the Murray amendment. \nThey are going to have to get the military facility, recruit a \nphysician in that host country for them to then conduct the abortion \nthere on the base. Do you think there will not be\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nsignificant military personnel who will know all this is taking place, \nthat there will not be more people who will know this is taking place \nrather than under the current situation?\n  Again, this is strictly the issue of abortion on demand. It is not \nabout the life of the mother, rape, or incest.\n  So I would submit that the argument that a woman has given up her \nright to privacy by virtue of not having the Murray amendment and the \nuse of a military facility--it is the exact opposite. If we go this \nway, there are going to be a lot more people who will be knowledgeable \nthat a woman associated with the military is having an abortion. So \nthis is not a legitimate argument on the use of a military facility.\n  Mr. President, I hope we do not tie the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill up with abortion politics by inserting this \nlanguage. I think if we do, it is going to ensure that there is going \nto be protracted negotiations with the House, which disagrees adamantly \nwith this language. And it would ensure protracted discussions with the \nPresident, the administration, which adamantly disagrees with the \nproviding of abortions on military bases. And it would really, I think, \nupset a number of people in the military who do not agree with \nabortion. They are there to protect and to honor life, not to take it.\n  To add this language is the wrong way for us to go, the wrong way for \nus to direct our military personnel to proceed. And it is going to \nprotract the negotiations, if not even kill the overall Department of \nDefense authorization bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues, wherever they are on the issue of abortion, \nto simply look at the issue of providing for the common defense at a \ntime we need to be united in that, and to not insert something like \nthis that is so divisive in this country.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Murray, I yield back her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate approved a Committee \namendment that authorizes military retirees to concurrently receive \nboth military retired pay and veterans disability compensation. I am \nglad it did so. This is a matter of fundamental fairness.\n  This is an important issue for veterans. About 530,000 military \nretirees either are or could eventually be impacted by this issue.\n  Current law requires that military retired pay be reduced dollar-for-\ndollar by the amount of any VA disability compensation received.\n  There is no reasonable excuse for this offset. By faithfully \nfulfilling their required length of service, veterans earned their \nretired pay. That retired pay is for service performed in the past. It \nshould not be reduced because a veteran is awarded disability \ncompensation by the Department of Veterans Affairs because he or she \nwas wounded on active duty or otherwise lost earning capacity due to \nservice-connected disabilities.\n  It is absurd that today, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, military \npersonnel risk losing their retirement pay if they are wounded or \nseriously injured. A military career is filled with hardships, family \nseparations, personal sacrifices, and all too often being placed in \nharm's way. Denying a military retiree an earned benefit, his or her \nmilitary retirement pay, is unconscionable.\n  Last year, the Senate approved legislation authorizing concurrent \nreceipt. However, the final version of the Fiscal Year 2002 National \nDefense Authorization Act that came out of conference authorized \nconcurrent receipt only if the President proposed legislation that \nwould provide offsetting budgetary cuts. Unfortunately, the \nAdministration opposes concurrent receipt, so this essentially doomed \nconcurrent receipt in 2002.\n  This year, the Committee bill for fiscal year 2003 that we are \nconsidering phases in concurrent receipt over five years for retirees \nwith disabilities rated at 60 percent or more. The Committee amendment \nthat we passed extends that benefit to all disabled veterans.\n  The Administration has issued a statement threatening a presidential \nveto of the Defense Authorization Bill if it authorizes concurrent \nreceipt of both retired pay and disability compensation. The Senate \nshould not be swayed by that threat.\n  Taking care of our veterans should be considered a part of our \nnational security. That is why I am concerned that, while the President \nhas proposed increasing military spending in fiscal year 2003 by about \n$48 billion, his budget increases spending on veterans health care by \nless than $2 billion, which is far less than needed.\n  This country made a promise to the men and women who risked their \nlives in defense of this nation. They were promised that their needs \nwould be met by a grateful nation. Authorizing concurrent receipt will \nbe a big step toward fulfilling that promise.\n  More than 200 hundred years ago, George Washington warned that ``The \nwillingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, \nno matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they \nperceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our \nnation.'' He could not have been more right. That is why we need to \nmake sure that the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense Authorization Act \nauthorizes current receipt.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, In 1959, the City of Mesa, AZ wrote the Navy \nasking for an aircraft to display at one of its parks. In 1965, the \naircraft, a Navy Panther, was donated for static display to Mesa Parks \nand Recreation from the Naval Air Station at Litchfield Park. The \naircraft was used as a centerpiece for a children's playground.\n  In 1994, the City of Mesa auctioned off the relic as surplus \nequipment to Richard Oldham for $100. The City of Mesa sold the \naircraft to Mr. Oldham in an open bidding process, and he has \ntemporarily lodged it at the USS Hornet Museum in California. He \nintends for it to be transferred to the Women's Airforce Service \nPilots, (W.A.S.P.), Museum in Quartzite, AZ.\n  According to the Naval Historical Center, it is a common for the Navy \nto conditionally donate aircraft, in what amounts to a long-term loan, \nto municipalities and museums. Donation of aircraft to city parks is \nconditional upon Congressional termination of title. Absent evidence of \nthe U.S. Government's intent to make the donation unconditional, (a \npermanent transfer), the Navy would still hold title to the aircraft. \nUnder section 3, article 4 of the United States Constitution, only \nCongress can make laws pertaining to the disposal of Federal property. \nSince there is no evidence in the Navy's or the City of Mesa's files \nthat the Navy intended to give away the aircraft permanently, the \naircraft still legally belongs to the Navy, and it would appear that \nMesa did not have the right to sell the aircraft to Mr. Oldham.\n  I understand the Navy is willing to enter into a long-term loan \nagreement with the USS Hornet Museum and with the W.A.S.P. Museum; \nhowever, it would still be in the possession of the government.\n  Congress has in the past approved legislation to permanently transfer \nownership of Federal property. One recent example is in the FY98 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Section 1023 transferred two \nobsolete Army tugboats to the Brownsville Navigation District, \nBrownsville, TX. Section 1025 of the same act transferred naval vessels \nto the governments of Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, \nand Thailand. Congress does not transfer property to individuals, but \nto organizations, muncipalities, and countries. The W.A.S.P. Museum is \na non-profit museum and is eligible to receive such a relic aircraft. \nAircraft 125316 will find an appropriate and welcome home in the \nW.A.S.P. museum where it may continue to serve the nation as an \nimportant piece of our nation's military history.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to address two amendments I will \nsoon offer to S. 2514, the Defense authorization bill. The first \namendment is critical to the training and future deployments of the \nInterim Brigade Combat Teams, and is, therefore, vital to both \nLouisiana and our national security. This amendment designates \nLouisiana Highway 28 between Alexandria, LA, and Leesville, LA, a road \nproviding access to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, \nas a Defense Access Road.\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n  Fort Polk has been designated as a home for one of the new, \ntransformational Interim Brigade Combat Teams IBCTs. Furthermore, I am \nproud to say that Fort Polk will serve as the training site for all \nIBCTs.\n  Louisiana Highway 28 is one of the primary access roads into and out \nof Fort Polk. Highway 28 is the direct route from Fort Polk to the \nformer England Air Force Base in Alexandria, Louisiana. I mention this \nbecause any military equipment designated for Fort Polk that is \ntransported via C-130 must be trucked to Fort Polk if it is non-wheeled \nor non-tracked from the former England AFB. If military vehicles are \ntracked or wheeled, they then trek the forty miles from England to Fort \nPolk along Hwy. 28. No matter how the equipment arrives at Fort Polk, \nthe heavy trucks and military vehicles cause tremendous wear and tear \nto Highway 28.\n  With the coming of the IBCTs to Fort Polk, the stresses on Hwy. 28 \nwill only be exacerbated. Louisiana Highway 28 is a two lane highway \nthat currently operates over capacity, as it already has a traffic \nvolume of 2,000 cars per day. When you add 2,000 cars a day and 10 \ntraining rotations a year to a two-lane highway, the deterioration of \nthe road surface and the congestion of the roadway will lead to \nnumerous accidents, and possibly fatalities.\n  The commanding general of Fort Polk, Brigadier General Jason Kamiya, \nand the people of Louisiana want to see Hwy. 28 expanded to four lanes. \nA four lane highway will improve the safety conditions on the roadway, \nand four lanes will allow for faster deployment of units stationed and \ntraining at Fort Polk. During times of war, like we find ourselves in \nnow, it is critical that units can deploy to the battlefield as quickly \nas possible. But, it is also important that our military achieve quick \ndeployments in training because our service men and women will fight \nonly well as they train.\n  The designation of Highway 28 as a Defense Access Road will allow the \nDepartment of Defense to work with the State of Louisiana to pool funds \nto make necessary repairs to the highway and increase the road surface \nto four lanes to best accommodate the IBCTs. DOD will only be required \nto participate in funding to the degree to which usage of the highway \nis out of the ordinary due to the military installation or military \nactivity. It only makes sense that the Federal Government would aid \nState Governments to make repairs caused by federal usage or \nalterations to the highway requested by the Federal government. \nFinally, there is no cost associated with the authorization.\n  The second amendment pertains to the most crucial problem facing our \nUnited States Navy, both today and in future generations, the dwindling \nsize of the Navy fleet. The 2001 Quadrennial Review stated that the \nNavy must maintain a fleet size of least 310 ships to achieve its \nmission. This amendment makes it the policy of the United States for \nthe budget of the United States for fiscal years after FY 2003, and for \nthe future-years defense plan, to include sufficient funding for the \nNavy to maintain a fleet of at least 310 ships. Additionally, the \nPresident must certify within the budget of the United States that \nsufficient funding has been allocated to maintain a fleet of 310 ships. \nIf such a certification is not made, the President must explain within \nthe budget of the United States why the certification cannot be made. \nToday, Navy ships sail globally to ensure a world-wide American \npresence and to immediately respond to threats against America's \nnational security. This amendment will make certain that the President \nfunds a fleet at least capable of meeting the Navy's current mission \nobjectives or explains why the Navy will fall shy of a 310 ship fleet.\n  Without the Navy, the United States could not have prosecuted the war \nin Afghanistan as successfully as we have. On numerous occasions \nthroughout the war, our armed forces have been denied access to land \nbases in foreign countries from which our forces could operate. \nNevertheless, when our armed forces cannot forward deploy because there \nare no willing host countries, the U.S. Navy provides our military with \nacres of floating sovereign territory from which the U.S. military can \ndeploy. Without the firepower, logistics, and transport capabilities of \nthe Navy, our ability to retaliate to the terrorist actions of \nSeptember 11th would have been compromised.\n  However, if Congress and the President do not allocate critical \nresources to shipbuilding, the Navy will soon fall well below the \nminimum level of ships required for the Navy to properly provide for \nAmerica's defense, a job the Navy has performed so admirably. Today, \nthe Navy has approximately 315 ships in its fleet, a number which \ncannot dwindle or the Navy's operations will be gravely challenged. \nThis year, the President's budget funded only 5 ships. The Senate has \ntaken needed action to provide an additional $690 million in advance \nprocurement funding for 2 surface ships and a submarine. If current \nshipbuilding rates are sustained, the Navy will only have a fleet of \n238 ships within 35 years. That is simply unacceptable. 310 ships is \nthe lowest allowable floor, but Congress and the President should \nstrive to maintain a Navy of at least 350 ships to guaranty America's \nsovereign needs on the high seas.\n  Accordingly, this amendment makes it the national defense policy of \nthe United States to uphold a Navy of at least 310 ships, as spelled \nout in the Quadrennial Defense Review of 2001. Moreover, shipbuilding \nmust be a priority of the President, and the President must certify in \nfuture budgets and in future year defense plans, beginning with FY \n2004, that sufficient funds have been made available to sustain a fleet \nof at least 310 ships or explain why such funds have not been made \navailable. I hope the Senate will support this amendment to provide for \nour Navy which has provided for the American people since the \nRevolutionary War.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5835-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I love to read. I love to especially read \nhistory. One of the fine experiences I have had was reading a book by \nJames Michener entitled ``Caravans.'' It was about the history of \nAfghanistan. I read this book many years ago. Michener had already \nwritten ``Hawaii'' and some other books that were very famous, but this \nwas a bestseller, and rightfully so.\n  I really developed a strong, positive feeling about the people of \nAfghanistan after having read that book.\n  As a result of what has happened to our country being so heavily \ninvolved in Afghanistan in the last 15 years, 20 years, I have \nreflected many times, since I read that book and since we have been so \nheavily involved in Afghanistan, about the people of Afghanistan and \nwhat has happened to them. Of course, I have given speeches on the \nSenate floor about how the reign of terror of the Taliban was a reign \nof terror to everyone in Afghanistan, but especially women. And during \nthat period of time, women suffered irreparably in many instances.\n  The reason I mention this today is that during and since the Loya \nJirga that has been held in Afghanistan, delegates who have spoken out \nfor human rights, including the Minister of Women's Affairs, have been \nthreatened and in many instances intimidated.\n  These threats going on in Afghanistan today, along with continued \nreports of violence and intimidation in the provinces, point to the \nimperative need for U.S. support for the immediate expansion of peace \ntroops in Afghanistan. We need peacekeepers. I am disappointed that the \nadministration is saying: Fine, we will make sure we have a presence in \nKabul, but the rest of Afghanistan can try to fend for itself.\n  As I have indicated, in the provinces outside of Kabul, there are bad \nthings happening to a lot of Afghan people but especially the women. \nDespite pleas from the United Nations, the Afghan interim government, \nand the women's rights community and people from throughout the world, \ngovernments throughout the world, the Bush administration has refused \nto expand the international security assistance force\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nbeyond Kabul. The restoration of democracy and of rights for women in \nAfghanistan depends on maintaining security, reestablishing democracy, \nand creating a functional central government that can provide services \nand oversee reconstruction to that country that needs reconstruction.\n  Without an expansion of the International Security Assistance Force \nand without adequate resources for reconstruction, Afghanistan will \nagain descend into chaos--not ``could'' or ``might,'' but ``will.'' The \nUnited States cannot again abandon the Afghan people, especially Afghan \nwomen who have suffered so much. We cannot allow terrorism, al-Qaida, \nthe Taliban, and human rights violators to thrive again in Afghanistan.\n  As I reflect back as I stated when I started my remarks today to \nreading this book of these people who are so strong and had such a \ngreat tradition and see what has happened to them, it is sad.\n  I urge President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Secretary Powell to \nprovide full U.S. support for the expansion of an international peace \nforce in Afghanistan. To do less is to indicate that we do not care \nabout Afghanistan and to underscore that we do not care what is \nhappening to the women of Afghanistan as we speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Clearly, the Department has, and plans to retain, a \n     sufficient cadre of logistics specialties to meet this \n     objective. Specifically, we will retain sufficient supply, \n     maintenance and repair, and logistics program management \n     capabilities to sustain our essential equipment over its \n     entire life cycle with the appropriate mix of government \n     personnel, contractor personnel, and public-private \n     partnerships. The specific identification of these skills \n     will be documented through the ongoing Department of Defense \n     core competency review, through implementation of the Future \n     Logistics Enterprise (FLE) initiative, and with supporting \n     policies. I will report to the committee once the requirement \n     for these skills is appropriately documented.\n       We also understand that there is concern that the Air Force \n     has not yet completed a long-term depot strategy. The Air \n     Force will submit its long-term depot strategy to the \n     Congress in September 2002.\n       Thank you for considering our views in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                E.C.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to \nreauthorize the Arsenal Support Program Initiative, ASPI, for 2 more \nyears. This program has been successful but the need continues.\n  Both the Rock Island Arsenal and the Watervliet Arsenal are now \nsuffering from underutilization. Both are currently at under 30 percent \nof their capacity. This underutilization has greatly affected overhead \nrates at both arsenals, making it increasingly difficult to compete \nwith private industry. At the same time, the base of skilled arsenal \nworkers has steadily eroded.\n  I strongly believe that an organic industrial base must be maintained \nif we are to be prepared to meet future, unanticipated national \nsecurity needs. Arsenals provide a valuable rapid manufacturing \ncapability for specialized\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nand unique defense manufacturing needs. The decline in skilled arsenal \nworkers is therefore particularly troubling in light of the new threats \nour forces will face in the war on terrorism.\n  The ASPI addresses the problem of underutilization of arsenals by \nencouraging private industry to utilize the arsenals. This provides a \nway to help keep the arsenal industrial base warm, while helping to \nsave taxpayer dollars by supplementing arsenal overhead costs. The ASPI \nhas already helped initiate many beneficial relationships with private \nindustry. For instance, the Rock Island Arsenal currently has a \ncontract with the Quad City Labor Management Partnership, which \nprovides training to Rock Island Arsenal personnel in return for the \nuse of administrative space. Another company, TDF Corp., is currently a \ntenant at the Rock Island Arsenal and the Arsenal is in discussions \nwith a cellular telephone company and others. The Watervliet Arsenal is \ncurrently in the process of executing contracts with three different \nprivate manufacturers and is exploring other possibilities. Pine Bluff \nArsenal has also taken advantage of contracts with the private sector \nto provide additional revenue.\n  The Arsenal Support Program Initiative opens up new opportunities for \nsavings at our arsenals as well as making them more self-sufficient. \nThis program is a win-win situation for the Army, the arsenals and \nindustry, and I urge my colleagues to allow this program to continue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be offering with Senator \nGrassley and with our colleagues from Illinois, New York, and Arkansas, \na bipartisan amendment of importance to Rock Island Arsenal. This \namendment is needed for the continuation of the Arsenal Support Program \nInitiative, or ASPI.\n  In 1992 we passed the ARMS initiative to help the ammunition plants, \nincluding the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, bring in commercial tenants \nthat would pay part of the cost of these large plants. The initiative \nhas been very successful and has saved taxpayers money. ASPI brings a \nsimilar program to the Rock Island, Watervliet, and Pine Bluff \narsenals. Rock Island and the other arsenals have extraordinary \nworkforce, space, and equipment that are underutilized in peacetime \noperations but are needed for wartime surge capabilities as well as \nsmaller critical emergencies. The costs of the underutilized space and \nequipment must be paid for directly by taxpayers, or charged as \noverhead to work at the arsenals, causing high prices to military \ncustomers and, in an unfortunate spiral, decreasing utilization of the \narsenals. ASPI is intended to help bring in commercial firms to use the \navailable workforce, buildings, and equipment and help pay for their \ncosts.\n  ASPI was first passed in the fiscal year 01 Defense Authorization \nbill as a two-year pilot program. It was funded for the first time last \nyear with $7.5 million in the fiscal year 02 Defense Appropriations \nbill. This has not given enough time to get the program fully underway. \nThus this amendment would extend the program for two additional years, \nthrough 2004. It also would update reporting requirements to help \nCongress evaluate the program.\n  The arsenals have never been more important to our military \ncapabilities and have never faced more difficult times. Rock Island \nArsenal has a highly skilled and dedicated workforce, impressive \nmanufacturing capabilities, and a great history of service, but is not \nbeing used enough. I am pleased that this bill has funding for the \nunutilized capacity, but even better, this amendment should reduce the \nneed for such funds in the future. I have every hope that ASPI will be \nas successful as the ARMS initiative, and will help Rock Island Arsenal \nthrive in its mission to protect the national security. I am pleased \nthat Chairman Levin has agreed to accept this amendment, and as it is \nidentical to a provision in the House bill, I hope it will soon be \nenacted into law.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe this has been cleared on the \nother side, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3945) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering, along \nwith Senator Sessions, deals with two issues relating to the Western \nHemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Both of these issues \ncame to light during the first ever meeting of the Board of Visitors of \nthe Institute. Both Senator Sessions and I are members of the Board.\n  During the first Board meeting, which incidentally was an \norganizational meeting, the Board was informed that there was a \nquestion as to the authority of the Secretary of Defense to accept \nforeign gifts or donations, including lecture services and faculty \nservices, on behalf of the Institute. The Board was further informed \nthat the loss of the foreign faculty instructors would severely hamper \nthe ability of the Institute to perform its mission.\n  Additionally, the Board of Visitors learned that its annual report to \nthe Secretary of Defense would not necessarily be submitted to \nCongress. The Board considered that its annual report, which would \ninclude its views and recommendations pertaining to the Institute, \nincluding the curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal \naffairs, and academic matters, should be submitted to Congress by the \nSecretary of Defense along with the Secretary's comments.\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\n  Accordingly, the amendment we are offering would authorize the \nSecretary of Defense to accept foreign gifts and donations for the \nInstitute, and would require the Secretary of Defense's annual report \nto Congress on the Institute to include the annual report of the Board \nof Visitors along with the Secretary's comments on the Board's report. \nI ask my colleagues for their support for this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President and fellow Senators, have you noticed how \neveryone seems a little happier today? Their smiles are brighter, their \ngreetings are a little more gracious and their thank yous are more \nsincere. Have you noticed how the sun seems to be shining brighter \ntoday and food tastes better today? The air seems sweeter today.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania does not know what a great day this is.\n  That is, no doubt, because today is June 20, and that means it is \nWest Virginia Day. All over the country, it is June 20th. All over the \nworld, it is June 20th. That means all over the country, and all over \nthe world, it is West Virginia Day.\n  It was 139 years ago today that West Virginia, by an act of Congress \nand the signature of President Abraham Lincoln, became the thirty-fifth \nstate of our Union.\n  The birth of the State of West Virginia was not an easy delivery. It \ninvolved great labor pains, and blood, sweat, and tears. West Virginia \nwas born in the middle of our country's bitter, divisive, and bloody \nCivil War, and there were serious constitutional questions involved in \nher delivery.\n  But goodness and righteousness prevailed and West Virginia, \npredicated upon its allegiance to the Constitution and the republic, \nbecame a State, and here I am. Had that not happened, I would not have \nbeen here. This Union may not have survived.\n  It all began on that great and glorious day of June 20th, 1863--and \nwhat a great and glorious day it was. It was a day a local newspaper, \nthe Wheeling Intelligencer, called a ``great gala day.'' The newspaper \nreported that ``thousands of people from abroad'' joined with the new \nstate officials and the ``entire population'' of Wheeling, the city \nwhere the official ceremony took place, to celebrate the occasion.\n  Business was suspended. Workers were given the day off.\n  Flags were everywhere--everywhere, on all the street corners, along \nall the streets. Flags of all sizes were flown from every housetop and \nevery business in the city. It was reported that flags were as ``thick \nas the locusts that were then occupying the suburbs and surrounding \ncountryside.''\n  The ceremonies included brigade bands playing patriotic songs, and \nunits of the West Virginia militia parading through the town. There \nwere countless toasts and even more cheers for the United States and \nfor its new state, the State of West Virginia.\n  And, of course, there were political speeches.\n  The man considered the ``father of West Virginia,'' Francis H. \nPierpont, declared:\n  May we [meaning West Virginia]--may we from this small beginning \ntoday, grow to be the proudest state in all the glorious galaxy of \nStates that form the Nation.\n  Waitman T. Willey, one of the State's first two U.S. Senators, \nproclaimed:\n  What we have longed for and labored for and prayed for is [now] a \nfixed fact. West Virginia is a fixed fact.\n  West Virginia is a fixed fact.\n  The first Governor of the State, Arthur Boreman, a 39-year-old man \nwith a full-flowing black beard, promised to do everything in his power \n``to advance the agricultural, mining, and manufacturing, and \ncommercial interests of the State.''\n  After the speeches, 35 little girls representing the 35 states of the \nUnion, sang more patriotic songs and the band played the ``Star \nSpangled Banner.''\n  The day closed with a ``brilliant display of fireworks'' over the \nOhio River.\n  The next day, the New York Post reported:\n  [B]orn amid the turmoil of the Civil War and cradled by the storm . . \n. the 35th State is now added to the American union.\n  The New York Times echoed the words of Senator Willey with the \nheadline that read ``West Virginia is now a fixed fact.''\n  The State of West Virginia was a ``fixed fact,'' but its future was \nnot. The State's childhood and adolescence were to be as difficult and \ntumultuous as its birth.\n  The State of West Virginia soon became an economic colony of \nnortheastern, absentee landlords, the infamous Robber Barons of the \nlate nineteenth century, who ruthlessly exploited the State for its \nrich natural resources.\n  Other problems came piling on. From the Monongah mine disaster of \n1907, when I believe 361 miners lost their lives, the worst coal-mine \ndisaster in American history, to the Marshall University plane crash of \n1970, the worst sports tragedy in American history, the people of West \nVirginia came to know and suffer many and various forms of tragedy, \nincluding the Silver Bridge collapse at Point Pleasant, the Buffalo \nCreek Slag Dam collapse in Logan County, as well as a multitude of \ndeadly mine explosions and disastrous floods.\n  And for too long, the State suffered from economic backwardness.\n  Through it all, the courageous, patriotic, and dedicated people of \nWest Virginia have remained loyal to their country and their \ngovernment.\n  They have continued to supply the nation with the energy it needs to \nheat our homes, to light these Chambers, fuel our battleships, and \npower our massive industries.\n  And the people of West Virginia have served our country in times of \nwar as well as peace. West Virginians have fought and died in our \nnation's wars, including World War II, Korea and Vietnam, far beyond \nproportion to West Virginia's population size.\n  Meanwhile, the people of West Virginia have struggled to overcome \nexploitation and oppression by joining unions and electing political \nleaders who would better represent them. It took decades and it took \ntremendous effort, but, as I have said, the spirit of West Virginia is \nto ``endure and to prevail.'' The people of West Virginia endured and \nthey have prevailed.\n  One of my favorite Roman philosophers, Seneca, said, ``Fire is the \ntest of gold; adversity, of strong men.''\n  Today, many strong men and women have brought West Virginia to the \nbrink of vast social and economic change. The State is cultivating new \neconomic growth and prosperity as a result of a bumper crop of better \nroads, new technology, and forward-looking leadership. Traditional \nindustries are being augmented by fresh business activity, flexible \nmanufacturing, leading-edge and information-age high technology.\n  People across America are discovering West Virginia. They are coming \nto West Virginia to camp, hike, fish, raft our white waters, and ski \nour slopes.\n  They are discovering the natural wonders of my State--that West \nVirginia is truly one of the most beautiful states in the union. With \nits rushing, trout-filled mountain streams, its majestic rolling green \nhills, picturesque villages and towns, magnificent forests, scenic \nState parks, no wonder the\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nState has been depicted in song and verse as being ``almost heaven.''\n  People are discovering what West Virginians already knew, that the \nState is a great place to just relax and enjoy life. In the early \nmorning hours, you can sit back in your favorite chair looking east, \nand enjoy the most beautiful sight in the world: the sun rising over \nthe beautiful, rolling green hills of West Virginia. A few hours later, \nyou can turn your chair around and look to the west, and enjoy the \nsecond most beautiful sight in the world, the sun setting over those \nbeautiful, rolling green hills of West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, in the inaugural ceremony on June 20, 1863, the \nReverend J.T. McLure offered the inaugural prayer, in which he stated:\n\n       We pray Thee, almighty God, that this State, born amidst \n     tears and blood and fire and desolation, may long be \n     preserved and from its little beginning may grow to be a \n     might and a power that shall make those who come after us \n     look upon it with joy and gladness and pride of heart.\n\n  Mr. President, this child of ``tears and blood and fire and \ndesolation'' did grow.\n  Today, on this anniversary of the birth of West Virginia, as the \nReverend Mr. McClure predicted, one may look upon my state of West \nVirginia ``with joy and gladness and pride of heart.'' I am reminded of \nthe words of the English poet, William Blake, who wrote: ``Great things \nare done when men and mountains meet.''\n  Congratulations, West Virginia! Happy birthday, West Virginia! You \nhave not merely endured, you have prevailed!\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, 139 years ago today, on June 20, \n1863, West Virginia became the 35th State admitted to the Union. The \nonly State born of Civil War, West Virginia was signed into existence \nby the hand of Abraham Lincoln.\n  I am both proud and grateful to be a West Virginian and to represent \nmy State in the U.S. Senate. I am also glad to have this opportunity to \nreflect on some of the features that make my home State so very \nspecial. Aside from my State's distinct heritage of industry and \nagriculture, one of its most defining characteristics is its \nextravagant natural beauty. Blessed with icy native trout streams, \nmajestic deep-forest hardwood stands, and lush groves of rhododendron, \nWest Virginia is almost heaven to many people.\n  West Virginia is home to three of the Nation's most famous rivers: \nThe Shenandoah and Potomac to the east, and the Ohio River along the \nState's entire western border. These and many other rivers, streams, \nand mountain lakes provide great places to fish or canoe on a relaxing \nweekend or sunny afternoon.\n  The New River, which is thought to be the world's oldest river, \ntumbles through ancient limestone canyons and provides some of the \nworld's premier whitewater rafting. The more serene waters at Harpers \nFerry were praised by our Nation's third President when he wrote: ``The \npassage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the \nmost stupendous scenes in Nature. This scene is worth a voyage across \nthe Atlantic.'' President Jefferson was right, and the millions of \npeople who visit the Mountain State regularly to ski our mountains, \nraft our rivers, marvel at the brilliant autumn foliage, and enjoy our \nhospitality agree.\n  Thousands of miles of trails and scenic roads wind through the \nState's National Forest, State Parks, and countless mountain passes, \nluring hikers and bikers of all ages and from around the world. Seneca \nRocks, the most dramatic rock formation in the east, is a visual feast \nand rock climbers' paradise. The State is also home to a wide variety \nof wild vegetation and animal life found nowhere else in America, and \nprotests 20 threatened and endangered plant and animal species. West \nVirginia truly earns its label of ``wild and wonderful.''\n  The people of West Virginia remain its greatest asset. West \nVirginians are industrious, hard-working, unpretentious, \nstraightforward, open and fun-loving. They value common sense and \nfairness, and have a deeply rooted connection to the land and \nattachment to home.\n  On this West Virginia Day, I am joining all West Virginians in \ncelebrating the abundance of our natural beauty. We are truly blessed \nin West Virginia to have such a bounty of natural resources. As we \nstrive to promote our economic growth, I hope we will also be mindful \nof our responsibilities to the land. West Virginia's environment is a \nspecial resource, a national treasure that must be preserved and \nprotected for future generations.\n  I am proud to represent my home State of West Virginia, and deeply \nhonored to stand here today to recognize the 139th anniversary of the \nMountain State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5842-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5842-S5844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FBI REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post provides yet \nanother example of why it is so urgent that we act to pass S. 1974, the \nLeahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act.\n  This bill was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee on \nApril 25, 2 months ago. Apparently an anonymous Republican Senator has \noperated to block Senate passage of this bill which, as I said, passed \nunanimously from the Judiciary Committee.\n  Normally, I would be willing to wait for the time when some of these \nholds finally get dropped off, but I thought it was important for my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to know about this. It is \ntroubling to me that an anonymous Republican Senator would block \npassage of what is a bipartisan bill, a bipartisan bill to improve the \nFBI, the Nation's leading counterterrorism agency, at the same time the \nPresident has sought bipartisan efforts to pass his proposed homeland \nsecurity reorganization.\n  I hope the White House will ask their fellow party members why they \nwould hold up this legislation.\n  I urge the Republican Member or Members with the hold on this \nlegislation to remove the hold and allow us to discuss whatever issue \non the merits they may have.\n  The press reported yesterday that two new FBI whistleblowers have \ncome forward and provided information which might be crucial to the \nFBI's antiterrorism efforts. At least one of those whistleblowers has \nalso provided information to the staff of the Judiciary Committee that \nsuggests that, in its rush to beef up its translation capabilities \nafter September 11, the FBI may have relaxed both quality control and \nits own security standards.\n  The Post also reports that some of the allegations made by this \nwhistleblower have been verified, but still, even though verified, the \nwoman who raised these concerns, who raised these legitimate security \nissues post-September 11, was fired by the FBI for ``disruptiveness,'' \ntheir words.\n  Because the Department of Justice inspector general is looking into \nthis matter, Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to his office based \nupon what we learned about the incident. This whistleblower makes \nallegations that amount to far more than just a ``he-said, she-said'' \ninternal office dispute. Rather, her allegations raise significant \nsecurity issues that should be addressed as part of the inspector \ngeneral's review.\n  The letter Senator Grassley and I sent posed specific questions we \nhope the inspector general will examine as part of his investigation, \nincluding whether the reaction to this woman's report is likely to \nchill further reporting of security breaches by FBI employees.\n  What we are concerned about is, if you have an FBI agent who is aware \nof a security breach, will they be willing to come forward and tell \nabout that, or will they fear they may be fired? It is not a good \nmanagement practice for the FBI to fire the person who reports a \nsecurity breach while nothing happens to the person who allegedly \ncommitted the breach. That could mean if you commit a breach, you might \nget away with it, but if you report it, you are out of here. That is a \nconcern we have. That is not the way it should be.\n  That is precisely the kind of culture Judge Webster found helped FBI \nSupervisory Agent Robert Hanssen to get away with spying for the \nRussians. He got away with that spying for 20 years.\n  Since the attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks last fall, \nwe have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic \nterrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the \ninstitutions of our\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\ncountry. FBI reform was already important, but the terrorist attacks \nsuffered by this country last year have imposed even greater urgency on \nimproving the FBI. The Bureau is our front line of domestic defense \nagainst terrorists. It needs to be as great as possible.\n\n  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight \nhearings revealed some very serious problems at the FBI that needed \nstrong congressional action to fix. We continue this oversight of the \nDepartment of Justice and the FBI. We heard about a double standard in \nevaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information \nmanagement problems and communications breakdowns between field offices \nand headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the \nOklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured \nmoney--billions of dollars--into the FBI over the last 5 years, we \nheard the FBI's computer systems were in dire need of modernization.\n  In fact, most children in grade school in my State have access, many \ntimes, to better computer systems.\n  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to \nsell critical secrets to the Russians, undetected for years, and he \nnever even had a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 \ndifferent areas of security the Justice Department needed to fix at the \nFBI.\n  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved \naccountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI, and \nrequired planning to ensure that the FBI is prepared to deal with a \nmultitude of challenges we are facing.\n  As I said, it was unanimously reported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee. It reflects our determination to \nmake sure the FBI is as good and strong as it can be--probably more \nimportant, as good and as strong as America needs it to be. That reform \nbill is a long stride toward the goal.\n  The case reported in yesterday's Washington Post and the matters \nraised by Minneapolis Field Office Agent Coleen M. Rowley in her May \n21, 2002 letter and subsequent testimony critiquing the handling of the \nMoussaoui case by FBI Headquarters personnel provide case studies for \nmany of the precise issues that S. 1974, the FBI Reform Act, addresses \nand why its passage is so critical in the FBI's effort to fight \nterrorism. The Leahy-Grassley bill expands whistle-blower protections \nto ensure that FBI whistle-blowers get the same protections as other \ngovernment employees.\n  The FBI is currently exempted from the Whistleblower Protection Act, \nand its employees are only protected by internal Department of Justice \nregulations. For example, while Special Agent Rowley's letter to the \nFBI Director and the Inspector General is protected under these \nregulations, three of the five people to whom she sent her letter were \nMembers of Congress and are not covered under the current regulations. \nMoreover, her testimony at the June 6 Judiciary Committee oversight \nhearing, and before any other committee or subcommittee of the \nCongress, is not protected under the current regulations. Even a report \nor complaint to her immediate FBI supervisors would not be protected \nunder the current regulations. That is why the FBI Director's personal \nguaranty, and the Attorney General's assurances, that she would be \nprotected against retaliations is so important. The Leahy-Grassley FBI \nReform Act would extend whistleblower protection for FBI employees to \nall these disclosures.\n  The FBI Reform Act would also put an end to statutory restrictions \nthat contribute to the ``double standard,'' where senior management \nofficials are not disciplined as harshly for misconduct as line agents \nare. Agent Rowley complained about this double standard, as have other \nFBI agents who have helped the Judiciary Committee craft solutions to \nthe FBI's problems.\n  The bill would provide expanded statutory authority for the DOJ \nInspector General to investigate internal problems at the FBI and help \ndesign comprehensive, systematic solutions. It would create the Career \nSecurity Officer Program that Judge Webster and FBI officials have \nendorsed to prevent security breaches.\n  These are not partisan provisions. The FBI Reform Act is the result \nof bipartisan oversight hearings which the Judiciary Committee has \nconducted over the last year. It was reported out of Committee \nunanimously. Now, when it reaches the Senate floor, it is being blocked \nanonymously. The future of the FBI is too important for politics. Too \nmany Americans depend on it for their safety.\n  On June 7, 2002, I delivered a statement that highlighted Republican \nholds on four important bipartisan pieces of legislation, including \nimportant anti-terrorism legislation aimed at curbing terrorist \nbombings.\n  Less than a week later, the United States Embassy in Karachi, \nPakistan was bombed. The next morning, the Senate passed my bill, S. \n1770, to deal with that issue.\n  I now appeal to the Republican Senator or Senators blocking the FBI \nReform Act to remove your hold so that we may pass this bill. The \nAmerican people deserve action, not politics as usual.\n  Senator Grassley and I would never be seen as ideological soulmates, \nbut we are joined together in wanting to improve this aspect of the \nFBI, and we have had key Republicans and key Democrats join us.\n  Let the bill go forward. The American people deserve this action, not \npolitics as usual.\n  I ask unanimous consent that yesterday's Washington Post article and \nthe letter I sent with Senator Grassley to the Justice Department \ninspector general be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2002.\n     Hon.

Fine,\n     Inspector General, Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Fine: The Senate Judiciary Committee has received \n     unclassified information from the FBI regarding allegations \n     made by Ms. Sibel D. Edmonds, a former FBI contract linguist, \n     that your office is currently investigating. We request that, \n     as this investigation progresses, you consider the following \n     questions on this matter:\n       (1) Ms. Edmonds has alleged, and the FBI has confirmed, \n     that the FBI assigned a contract language ``monitor'' to \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, contrary to clear FBI policy that only \n     more qualified ``linguists'' be assigned to Guantanamo Bay. \n     What circumstances led to the contract language monitor being \n     considered qualified for this assignment, and what were the \n     consequences, if any, for the effectiveness of the \n     interrogation of those being detained at Guantanamo?\n       (2) Ms. Edmonds has alleged, and the FBI has confirmed, \n     that another contract linguist in the FBI unit to which Ms. \n     Edmonds was assigned failed to translate at least two \n     communications reflecting a foreign official's handling of \n     intelligence matters. The FBI has confirmed that the contract \n     linguist had ``unreported contracts'' with that foreign \n     official. To what extent did that contract linguist have any \n     additional unreported or reported contacts with that foreign \n     official? What counterintelligence inquiries or assessments, \n     if any, were made with respect to those contacts? Do you plan \n     to interview field office and headquarters \n     counterintelligence personnel regarding this matter?\n       (3) The FBI has said that, to review the other contract \n     linguist's work that Ms. Edmonds questioned, it used three \n     linguists in its language division, a supervisory special \n     agent, and special agents who worked on the case that \n     generated the communications under review. Was this a \n     ``blind'' review by the linguists, or did they know the \n     person whose work was under review? Were the linguists \n     sufficiently independent to make objective judgments about \n     the translations in question? Would it have been appropriate \n     to use linguists from outside the FBI?\n       (4) The FBI has said a determination was made by the \n     supervisory special agent that the contract linguist whose \n     work was reviewed made a mistake and that the matter was a \n     training issue. Did this agent's position affect his ability \n     to render an objective judgment? What input did the other \n     special agents provide? Did their involvement in the case \n     that generated the communications affect their ability to \n     make an objective judgement about a person with whom they had \n     worked on the case? Would it have been better to ask other \n     counterintelligence agents to assess the importance of the \n     untranslated information and the reason it was not \n     translated?\n       (5) To what extent is the credibility of witnesses \n     regarding Ms. Edmonds' allegations affected by their \n     continuing employment in the same translation unit and under \n     the same supervisor where the contract linguist discussed in \n     question (2) is employed.\n       (6) The FBI has said that Ms. Edmonds prepared two \n     classified documents with respect to her allegations on her \n     home computer without authorization and that one witness \n     reported Ms. Edmunds discussed classified\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\n     information regarding her allegations in the presence of \n     three uncleared members of her family without authorization. \n     Would these actions disqualify her from a security clearance, \n     given the circumstances of her concern about a foreign \n     attempt to penetrate or influence FBI operations at her \n     workplace?\n       (7) What guidance is provided to FBI contract linguists as \n     to the steps they should take if they are concerned about a \n     possible foreign attempt to penetrate or influence FBI \n     operations? How well is this guidance understood by contract \n     linguists in the FBI translation centers and other FBI \n     personnel who would handle such matters?\n       (8) What improvements, if any, are needed to encourage FBI \n     contract linguists and other FBI contract personnel to come \n     forward with such counterintelligence concerns and to ensure \n     that they are not adversely affected as a result of seeking \n     to assist FBI counterintelligence efforts? Was Ms. Edmunds' \n     case handled in a manner that would encourage such reporting \n     in the future?\n       Please let us know the timetable for your investigation and \n     advise us of the results.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Chairman.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2002]\n\n     2 FBI Whistle Blowers Allege Lax Security, Possible Espionage\n\n                         (By James V. Grimaldi)\n\n       In separate case, two new FBI whistle-blowers are alleging \n     mismanagement and lax security--and in one case possible \n     espionage--among those who translate and oversee some of the \n     FBI's most sensitive, top-secret wiretaps in \n     counterintelligence and counterterrorist investigations.\n       The allegations of one of the whistle-blowers have prompted \n     two key senators--Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT) \n     and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa)--to pose critical questions \n     about the FBI division working on the front line of gathering \n     and analyzing wiretaps.\n       That whistle-blower, Sibel Edmonds, 32, a former wiretap \n     translator in the Washington field office, raised suspicions \n     about a co-worker's connections to a group under \n     surveillance.\n       Under pressure, FBI officials have investigated and \n     verified the veracity of parts of Edmonds' story, according \n     to documents and people familiar with an FBI briefing of \n     congressional staff. Leahy and Grassley summoned the FBI to \n     Capitol Hill on Monday for a private explanation, people \n     familiar with the briefing said.\n       The FBI confirmed that Edmonds' co-worker had been part of \n     an organization that was a target of top-secret surveillance \n     and that the same co-worker had ``unreported contacts'' with \n     a foreign government official subject to the surveillance, \n     according to a letter from the two senators to the Justice \n     Department's Office of the Inspector General. In addition, \n     the linguist failed to translate two communications from the \n     targeted foreign government official, the letter said.\n       ``This whistleblower raised serious questions about \n     potential security problems and the integrity of important \n     translations made by the FBI,'' Grassley said in a statement. \n     ``She made these allegations in good faith and even though \n     the deck was stacked against her. The FBI even admits to a \n     number of her allegations, and on other allegations, the \n     bureau's explanation leaves me skeptical.''\n       The allegations add a new dimension to the growing \n     criticism of the FBI, which has centered in recent weeks on \n     the bureau's failure to heed internal warnings about al-Qaida \n     leading up to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Last month, FBI \n     agent Coleen Rowley also complained about systemic problems \n     before the attacks. Rowley works in Minneapolis, where agents \n     in August unsuccessfully tried to get a search warrant to \n     look into the laptop computer of a man now described as the \n     ``20th hijacker.''\n       Finding capable and trustworthy translators has been a \n     special challenge in the terrorism war. FBI officials told \n     government auditors in January that translator shortages have \n     resulted in ``the accumulation of thousands of hours of \n     audio tapes and pages'' of untranslated material. After \n     the attacks, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III issued a \n     plea for translators, and hundreds of people applied.\n       Margaret Gulotta, chief of language services at the FBI, \n     said the bureau has hired 400 translators in two years, \n     significantly reducing the backlog on high-priority cases \n     while upholding strict background checks. ``We have not \n     compromised our standards in terms of language proficiency \n     and security,'' Gulotta said.\n       In the second whistle-blower case, John M. Cole, 41, \n     program manager for FBI foreign intelligence investigations \n     covering India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, said \n     counterintelligence and counterterrorism training has \n     declined drastically in recent years as part of a continuing \n     pattern of poor management.\n       Cole also said he had observed what he believed was a \n     security lapse regarding the screening and hiring of \n     translators. ``I thought we had all these new security \n     procedures in place, in light of [FBI spy Robert P.] \n     Hanssen,'' Cole said. ``No one is going by the rules and \n     regulations and whatever policy may be implemented.''\n       Edmonds and Cole have written about their concerns to high-\n     level FBI officials. Edmonds wrote to Dale Watson, the \n     bureau's counterterrorism chief, and Cole wrote to Mueller. \n     Both cases have been referred to Justice's Office of the \n     Inspector General, which is investigating, government \n     officials confirmed.\n       The FBI said it was unable to corrobate an allegation by \n     Edmonds that she was approached to join the targeted group. \n     Edmonds said she told Dennis Saccher, a special agent in the \n     Washington field office who was conducting the surveillance, \n     about the co-worker's actions and Saccher repled. It looks \n     like espionage to me.'' Saccher declined to comment when \n     contacted by a reporter.\n       Edmonds was fired in March after she reported her concerns. \n     Government officials said the FBI fired her because her \n     ``disruptiveness'' hurt her on-the-job ``performance.'' \n     Edmonds said she believes she was fired in retaliation for \n     reporting on her co-worker.\n       Edmonds began working at the FBI in late September. In an \n     interview, she said she became particularly alarmed when she \n     discovered that a recently hired FBI translater was saying \n     that she belonged to Middle Eastern organization whose taped \n     conversations she had been translating for FBI \n     counterintelligence agents. Officials asked that the name of \n     the target group not be revealed for national security \n     reasons.\n       A Washington Post reporter discovered Edmonds' name in her \n     whistle-blowing letters to federal and congressional \n     officials and approached her for an interview.\n       Edmonds said that on several occasions, the translator \n     tried to recruit her to joint the targeted foreign group. \n     ``This person told us she worked for our target \n     organization,'' Edmonds said in an interview. ``These are \n     the people we are targeting, monitoring.''\n       Edmonds would not identify the other translator, but The \n     Post has learned from other sources that she is a 33-year-old \n     U.S. citizen whose native country is home to the target \n     group. Both Edmonds and the other translator are U.S. \n     citizens who trace their ethnicity to the same Middle Eastern \n     country. Reached by telephone last week, the woman, who works \n     under contract for the FBI's Washington field office, \n     declined to comment.\n       In December, Edmonds said the woman and her husband, a U.S. \n     military officer, suggested during a hastily arranged visit \n     to Edmonds' Northern Virginia home on a Sunday morning that \n     Edmonds join the group.\n       ``He said, `Are you a member of the particular \n     organization?' '' Edmonds recalled the woman's husband \n     saying. ``[He said,] `It's a very good place to be a member. \n     There are a lot of advantages of being with this organization \n     and doing things together'--this is our targeted \n     organization--`and one of the greatest things about it is you \n     can have an early, an unexpected, early retirement. And you \n     will be totally set if you go to that specific country.' ''\n       Edmonds also said the woman's husband told her she would be \n     admitted to the group, especially if she said she worked for \n     the FBI.\n       Later, Edmonds said, the woman approached her with a list \n     dividing up individuals whose phone lines were being secretly \n     tapped. Under the plan, the woman would translate \n     conversations of her former co-workers in the target \n     organization, and Edmonds would handle other phone calls. \n     Edmonds said she refused and that the woman told her that her \n     lack of cooperation could put her family in danger.\n       Edmonds said she also brought her concerns to her \n     supervisor and other FBI officials in the Washington field \n     office. When no action was taken, she said, she reported her \n     concerns to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, \n     then to Justice's inspector general.\n       ``Investigations are being compromised,'' Edmonds wrote to \n     the inspector general's office in March. ``Incorrect or \n     misleading translations are being sent to agents in the \n     field. Translations are being blocked and circumvented.''\n       Government officials familiar with the matter who asked not \n     to be identified said that both Edmonds and the woman were \n     given polygraph examinations by the FBI and that both passed.\n       Edmonds had been found to have breached security, FBI \n     officials told Senate investigators. Edmonds said that two of \n     those alleged breaches were related to specific instruction \n     by a supervisor to prepare a report on the other translator \n     on her home computer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5844-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5844-S5845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 29, 2000 \nin Mahwah, NJ. Two gay men were beaten in an apartment complex parking \nlot. The assailant, William Courain, 26, was at an apartment complex \nparty when he began making obscene remarks to several of the guests \nabout their sexual\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\norientation. He left the party and confronted two men in the parking \nlot, making derogatory comments about their sexual orientation before \nattacking them.

Mr. Courain was arrested and charged with \naggravated assault, bias harrassment and bias assault in connection \nwith the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join in celebrating World \nRefugee Day and the many contributions of refugees around the world. \nThe United Nations High Commission on Refugees works tirelessly to \nprovide hope and opportunity to many of the world's most vulnerable \npeople, and I commend High Commissioner Lubbers for his leadership in \nthis area.\n  The focus of this year's celebration is on the critical situation of \nrefugee women and children, who make up 70 percent of the refugee \npopulation. More must be done to address the special needs of these \nindividuals, and World Refugee Day celebrations are an important step \nin the right direction.\n  To celebrate this day, United Nations Goodwill Ambassador, Angelina \nJolie has commissioned a national poster competition and I am proud to \nsay a fifth-grade student from Newton, MA, Lev Matskevich, is one of \nthe winners. I would like to congratulate all of the winners, Lev, \nSarah Rahmani from Edmunds, WA, and Roxann Acuna from San Antonio, TX \nfor their hard work not only on the posters, but in bringing needed \nattention to the plight of refugees.\n  The theme of this year's poster contest, as it says proudly on Lev's \nposter, is tolerance. As a nation of immigrants we must remember that \nour tolerance toward immigrants has been a principal source of our \nprogress and achievement.\n  With this year's celebration of World Refugee Day and these wonderful \nposters, we continue the important tradition of recognizing the \ncontributions of refugees and encouraging the United States' continued \ncommitment to providing a safe-haven to those in need around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5845-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5845-S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SUPREME COURT RULING THE EXECUTION OF THE MENTALLY RETARDED \n                            UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, earlier today, the United States Supreme \nCourt issued one of the most significant decisions curtailing the death \npenalty since the Court first found capital punishment unconstitutional \nin 1972, and then reinstated it four years later. In a six to three \ndecision in Atkins v. Virginia, the Court ruled that the execution of \nthe mentally retarded is unconstitutional. The Court concluded that \nsuch executions are cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the \nEighth Amendment.\n  This decision is a notable turning point for our Nation.\n  Indeed, a national consensus opposing such executions has been \ngrowing for some time. In 1989, when the Supreme Court upheld the \nexecution of mentally retarded persons, only two of the 38 States that \nauthorize the use of the death penalty had banned executions of the \nmentally retarded. Since then, 16 more States have enacted laws \nprohibiting the practice. Now, 18 of the 38 States that use the death \npenalty have banned the practice. And of the 20 States in the country \nthat continue the practice, nearly half have pending legislation to \nhalt executions of the mentally retarded. In addition, the Federal \nGovernment, which re-enacted the death penalty in 1988, has banned \nexecutions of the mentally retarded.\n  A recent poll by the National Journal found that only 13 percent of \nAmericans favor the death penalty for the mentally retarded. As this \npoll indicates, Americans recognize that it is cruel and unusual to \napply the death penalty to adults who have the minds of children. In \nmany cases, mentally retarded adults accused of crimes cannot fully \nunderstand what they have been accused of, and often do not comprehend \nthe severity of the punishment that awaits them. Accused adults with \nlow mental capacity are often characteristically eager-to-please, and \nmore likely to falsely confess to a crime.\n  Indeed, as Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, stated, \nconcerning mentally retarded defendants, ``Their deficiencies do not \nwarrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish \ntheir personal culpability.'' He wrote: ``Mentally retarded defendants \nmay be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are \ntypically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted \nimpression of lack of remorse for their crimes.'' Justice Stevens \ncontinued: ``Mentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a \nspecial risk of wrongful execution.''\n  The Court also reasoned that the usual justifications for capital \npunishment, retribution and deterrence, do not apply to mentally \nretarded defendants. With respect to retribution, Justice Stevens wrote \nthat ``the severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends \non the culpability of the offender.'' But ``[i]f the culpability of the \naverage murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction \navailable to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded \noffender surely does not merit that form of retribution,'' Justice \nStevens wrote. He concluded: ``Thus, pursuant to our narrowing \njurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of \nexecution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is \nappropriate.''\n  With respect to the other justification for capital punishment, \ndeterrence, Justice Stevens wrote that ``executing the mentally \nretarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.'' The \nCourt reasoned:\n\n       The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is \n     predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the \n     punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out \n     murderous conduct. Yet it is the same cognitive and \n     behavioral impairments that make these defendants less \n     morally culpable . . . that also make it less likely that \n     they can process the information of the possibility of \n     execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their \n     conduct based on that information.\n\n  Today the Supreme Court reflected the sentiments of our nation on \nthis important issue. As the majority stated: ``The practice [of \nexecuting the mentally retarded] . . . has become unusual, and it is \nfair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.'' The \nmajority concluded: ``Construing and applying the Eighth Amendment in \nthe light of our `evolving standards of decency,' we therefore conclude \nthat such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution `places a \nsubstantive restriction on the State's power to take the life' of a \nmentally retarded offender.' ''\n  The Court's decision confirms that our Nation's standards of decency \nconcerning the ultimate punishment are indeed evolving and maturing. \nEven before today's decision, we have known that the current death \npenalty system is broken and plagued by errors, including the risk of \nexecuting the innocent and racial and geographic disparities.\n  As evidence mounts that the administration of capital punishment is \nplagued by inexcusable flaws, the American people are taking notice, \nand taking action. Illinois Governor George Ryan took the courageous \nand extraordinary step of placing a moratorium on executions two years \nago. He also created an independent, blue ribbon commission to review \nthe Illinois death penalty system. The commission released its report \nearlier this year and made 85 recommendations for improving the \nadministration of the death penalty.\n  More and more Americans are realizing that they can no longer simply \nlook the other way when confronted with glaring injustices. And today, \na majority of the justices on our nation's highest court have joined \nthis growing chorus of Americans.\n  I am proud of our Court today. I am proud of a justice system that \nrecognizes that the execution of the mentally retarded is \nunconstitutional, inhumane, and simply wrong. Today we can declare an \nimportant and historic victory for justice.\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\n  But, while the Supreme Court must continue to scrutinize the capital \ncases before it, Congress and the American people also have a \nresponsibility to act. Today's ruling presents us with further evidence \nof the urgent need for a moratorium on executions and a full and \nthorough nationwide review of the administration of the death penalty. \nIt is time for Congress to support passage of my bill, the National \nDeath Penalty Moratorium Act. We simply cannot continue to look the \nother way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5846-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ACCESS FOR AFGHAN WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been pleased to join with Senator \nOlympia Snowe in introducing the Access for Afghan Women Act, S. 2647.\n  After the horror that women endured under the Taliban, it is critical \nthat U.S. assistance to that country promotes women's participation and \nleadership in the political and economic life of Afghanistan, while \nprotecting women's rights.\n  In fact, throughout the world, it is clear that the role of women is \nkey for successful economic development and a reliable indicator of \nwhether development programs will succeed. I am not talking about some \nradical agenda, rather I refer to the basic ability of women to \nparticipate in education, society, government, and the economy.\n  Afghanistan under the Taliban was an extreme example of the failure \nto include women in the economy, in fact relegating half the population \nto virtual house arrest. No country will succeed if it refuses to \neducate half its population. No economy will grow that restricts half \nits population from the work force, from credit, and from private \nproperty. And the government that does such things is no government at \nall but a travesty.\n  Economic development programs benefit everyone, but certain programs \nhave a particularly strong impact on the lives of women. Microcredit \nprograms, for example, tend to benefit women who may need only a small \nloan to buy a goat to sell milk, a sewing machine to make clothes, or \nvegetables to sell in the village market. These tiny businesses often \nprovide the financial independence that women need to pay school fees, \ntake in an orphan, or simply survive.\n  U.S. programs are providing books to newly reopened schools in \nAfghanistan will have a major impact on the education of girls, who \nwere not allowed to go to school under the Taliban.\n  This bill sets out broad requirements for U.S. assistance to \nAfghanistan for governance, economic development, and refugee \nassistance.\n  Among other provisions, bill calls for U.S. programs to include U.S. \nand Afghan-based women's groups in planning for development assistance, \nencourages U.S. groups to partner or create Afghan-based groups, and \nsupports for the Ministry of Women's Affairs. It calls for programs \nthat increase women's access to credit and ownership of property, as \nwell as long-term financial assistance for education and health. It \nrequires U.S.-sponsored police and military training to include the \nprotection of women's rights and that steps be taken to protect against \nsexual exploitation of women and children in refugee camps.\n  I believe that these requirements will fit well with the development \nassistance programs that the United States plans to pursue, but I \nbelieve that it is still particularly useful to lay them out in detail, \nespecially with regard to Afghanistan, to be certain that U.S. programs \nhelp remedy the abuses suffered by the women of Afghanistan.

Today I join the Democratic Leadership Council, DLC, former \nPresident Clinton, DLC Chair Senator Evan Bayh, and New Democrats \nacross the country in calling for the expansion of national service \nopportunities in a ``National Service Day.''\n  Creating a strong system of voluntary national service has been a \nsignature New Democrat idea from the founding of the Democratic \nLeadership Council to President Clinton's AmeriCorps initiative. In the \nwake of the surge of patriotism following the events of September 11, \nnational service is squarely at the center of national debate.\n  To build on this momentum, the DLC's Clinton Center is hosting \n``National Service Day,'' during which former DLC Chair President \nClinton will participate in three service projects in New York City, \nand DLC Chair Evan Bayh, Representatives Harold Ford, Jr. and Rep. Tim \nRoemer will host a roundtable discussion with Members of Congress and \nAmeriCorps members from across the country. Other elected officials, \nincluding Virginia Governor Mark Warner, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzalez, \nand Wisconsin State Representative Antonio Riley will join the DLC in \npromoting the New Democrat tradition of opportunity, responsibility and \ncommunity through national service.\n  In recognition of National Service Day, I am hosting Britt Eichner \nfrom Bear, DE, today. A rising senior at Archmere Academy with a 4.0 \nGPA, Britt embodies a commitment to service. As Hugh O'Brian Youth \nFoundation Ambassador, she volunteered more than 100 hours of service \nto the community. Last spring, she mobilized faculty and student \nmentors to adopt neighborhood families in need. As proof that living \nwith diabetes doesn't have to slow anyone down, Britt just completed \nher fifth Bike-a-Thon for the American Diabetes Foundation Tour de \nCure. And she recently spent a weekend in western Philadelphia \nrevitalizing neighborhoods in a community cleanup. Students like Britt \nrepresent the real promise of community service.\n  While every American should be asked to consider setting aside time \nfor service, be it mentoring a student or volunteering at a community \ncenter, it is also time to make sure we give those who are willing to \nserve, as Citizen-Soldiers in the Armed Forces or as AmeriCorps or \nPeace Corps volunteers, the opportunity to serve their country full-\ntime.\n  I am proud to say that in Delaware, people of all ages and \nbackgrounds are helping to solve problems and strengthen communities \nthrough 23 national service projects across the state. This year, \nAmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps, will provide more than 170 \nindividuals the opportunity to spend a full year serving in Delaware \ncommunities. More than 230 students in Delaware colleges and \nuniversities will help pay their way through school while aiding their \ncommunity through service opportunities that are part of the Federal \nWork Study Program. And more than 3,300 seniors in Delaware will \ncontribute their time and talents to one of three programs that make up \nthe Senior Corps: Foster Grandparents, who serve one-on-one with more \nthan 1,200 young people with special needs; Senior Companions, who help \nmore than 100 other seniors live independently in their homes; and \nRetired and Senior Volunteer Program, RSVP, volunteers, who work with \nmore than 330 local groups to meet a wide range of community needs.\n  These numbers, though inspiring as they are, represent just a small \nfraction of our population and are much smaller than the number of \npeople who want to serve. If we are to make national service a culture-\nchanging rite of passage in America, we must do more. National service \nshould not be a special chance for a few, but a way of life for many.\n  At a time when Americans from all walks of life are asking what they \ncan do to help make our Nation safer and stronger, national service \noffers an answer that points us towards a higher politics of national \npurpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5846-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5846-S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BETHEL REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL DRILL TEAMS\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a group of \nAlaska High School students from Bethel, Alaska who recently won the \nNational Championship in Drill Team/Color Guard competition held in \nDaytona, Florida, May 3rd.\n  It is not unusual for a U.S. Senator to rise on the Senate floor and \nhonor a national championship team from their\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nhome state. What is unusual in this case is that a Drill Team, Color \nGuard, JROTC unit from such a remote community won the national \nchampionship.\n  You see, Bethel is a moderate-sized town by Alaska standards, but \nsmall by anyone else's definition. Located along the Kuskokwim River in \nSouthwest Alaska--roughly 400 miles west of Alaska's largest town, \nAnchorage--the community has a current population of 5,471. The Bethel \nRegional High School contains 250 students, smaller than some classes \nin many high schools. The school draws mainly Yupik Eskimo students \nfrom dozens of smaller villages such as Akiachak, Akiak, Tuluksak, \nNapakiak, Kasigluk and Tantutuliak to name just a few. The majority of \nthe team, 11 of 13 members, are Alaska Natives.\n  It is truly heart warming to see students from a small Alaska town do \nso well in the national competition. At Daytona, the Bethel team \ncompeted against more than 70 schools from across the nation, as well \nas against Department of Defense schools from Japan to Puerto Rico.\n  Practicing drill formations in Alaska's ``Bush'' is a bit more \ndifficult than in Southern California or Florida. Teams need to \npractice indoors, a lot, since the average January temperature is 6 \ndegrees Fahrenheit. It also is a tad dark in winter, Bethel getting \nonly about five and one-half hours of daylight a day in winter.\n  But more challenging practice conditions didn't stop the students \nfrom Bethel Regional from competing and winning in the national \ncompetition. Let me mention the members of the Unarmed Regulation \nInspection Drill Team that finished first in their competition: Curtis \nNeck, Michael Carroll, Wallen Olrun, James Miles, Christina Smith, Paul \nAnvil, Justin Lefner, Mark Charlie, Kimberly Cooper, Jocelyn Tikiun, \nJason Noatak, Michael Glore and Lisa Typpo. The team was led by \nCommander Dexter Kairaiuak.\n  I'd like to also name the members of the Color Guard that finished in \nfourth place in its individual competition: Nation Colors, Commander \nCurtis Neck, State Colors Dexter Kairaiuak, Nation Guard Michael \nCarroll and State Guard Wallen Olrun.\n  The Unarmed Regulation Drill Team, containing the same members as the \nchampionship inspection team, also competed and took 12th place in its \ncompetition. The 10-member Unarmed Exhibition Drill Team took third \nplace in the national competition. It included: Commander Curtis Neck, \nMichael Carroll, Wallen Olrun, Dexter Kairaiuak, Christina Smith, Lisa \nTyppo, Justin Lefner, Mark Charlies, Kimberly Cooper and Jocelyn \nTikiun.\n  I also want to publicly thank Army Instructor MSG (Retired) Barbara \nW. Wright, who was the Army Instructor and Coach of the team this year. \nShe did a wonderful job training her students and helping them to their \nchampionship and deserves the thanks not just of the students and their \nparents, but of all Alaskans for her dedication and commitment. I also \nwant to thank the chaperones who accompanied the students to the \ncompetition: Major (RET) Carl D. Bailey, assistance coach; Mr. Scott \nHoffman and Mrs. Donna K. Dennis.\n  To be national champions at any endeavor requires long hours of \npractice and sacrifice. It requires dedication and true commitment. I \nknow all members of the U.S. Senate will join me in honoring these \nstudents and their faculty advisors for a job very well done. All \nAlaskans--all Americans--honor you today for your hard work and your \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5847-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETIREMENT OF DR. JAMES LARE, OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, On the occasion of his retirement, \nI would like to take a moment to reflect on the outstanding \naccomplishments of Dr. James Lare during his tenure as a professor at \nOccidental College.\n  Dr. Lare's commitment to Occidental College goes back more than 50 \nyears, when he was an undergraduate student at the college. In 1962, he \nbecame a faculty member and has now served the college for 40 years. \nMany of Dr. Lare's colleagues can attest to his extraordinary years of \nservice and contributions to the college and its students.\n  An expert in American government, European comparative politics, \npublic administration, urban politics and public policy, Dr. Lare has \nserved as a mentor and inspiration to his students, many of whom have \nflourished on Capitol Hill and in local government. His work on many \ndifferent projects and on many different committees has strengthened \nthe school and has touched the lives of his colleagues and students.\n  In addition to his professional career, Dr. Lare is a model community \nleader. He is a member of many diverse organizations, including CORO \nAssociates, the Public Affairs Internship Support Group; the Sierra \nClub; the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and he serves as Treasurer \nof the California Center for Education in Public Affairs, Inc. Dr. Lare \nalso served our Nation in the United States Army Reserve.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that Dr. Lare has been an outstanding \nteacher and is an exceptional citizen who has enhanced the lives of \nthose privileged to cross his path. I extend my very best wishes to him \nas he begins his much deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5847-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING ANNA MICHELLE MILES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly \nexceptional member of the Kentucky nursing community. Mrs. Anna \nMichelle Miles (Missy) of Covington, Kentucky was recently nominated \nfor the Florence Nightingale Award by two of her superiors for her \nselfless devotion to her co-workers, community, and patients.\n  The Florence Nightingale Award, presented by the University of \nCincinnati Medical Center, honors excellence in the delivery of direct \npatient care. During her lifetime, Florence Nightingale reformed and \nbasically created the modern profession of nursing, establishing an \neducational system where women could properly learn about medicine and \npatient care. During the Crimean War, she bravely and selflessly \nvolunteered her services for the front line. Her request was granted \nand along with 38 nurses, she was able to greatly reduce the mortality \nrate among the sick and wounded. Her combination of medicinal knowledge \nand compassion is what this award is founded upon.\n  Nurse Miles and the seven other nominees for this year's award \nrepresent the best of what nursing has to offer. They place patient \ncare as their top priority and always know how to cheer a patient up by \nmaking them smile or just simply listening to them. They may not always \nhave a physical cure for a patient's particular condition, but they \nwill continually work to ensure that each and every patient is cared \nfor in a loving and compassionate manner.\n  In terms of what Nurse Miles has done for her patients and fellow co-\nworkers, I do not believe any award or statement could properly honor \nher. While a nurse at St. Elizabeth Medical North in Covington, KY, \nNurse Miles has been an invaluable and irreplaceable resource. She \nhelped start the Sunshine Fund in the ER in an effort to bring about a \npositive and warm atmosphere for doctors, nurses, families, and \npatients. She regularly volunteers to cover other floors when they are \nlow on staffing and picks up extra shifts whenever she has the \nopportunity. As a social worker once wrote about Nurse Miles, ``My \npersonal feeling is that Missy treats all her patients with dignity and \nrespect. She is a true nurse in all the roles she fulfills.'' She has \nalso been very active in aiding those less fortunate individuals \nresiding in the Covington community; collecting food for the shelters \nand food kitchens as well buying hats and gloves with her own money to \ndistribute to children for those long, cold nights. Her patients adore \nand co-workers cannot imagine life without her.\n  I kindly ask that my fellow colleagues join me in thanking Anna \nMichelle Miles for her endless love and enduring commitment to her \npatients. She is a tribute to the memory of Florence \nNightingale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5847-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5847-S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DIABETES EPIDEMIC\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to tell you about a \nremarkable young man I met two years ago. His name is Cullinan \nWilliams, he is 10 years old and he lives in the beautiful little town \nof Cazenovia in upstate New York.\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\nWhen Cullinan was 6, he was diagnosed with diabetes. He gives himself \ninjections of insulin and pricks his finger to test his blood glucose \nlevel several times a day. Unless we find a cure for diabetes, he will \nneed to do this for the rest of his life. Diabetes is a very serious \ndisease but Cullinan is not sad or defeated. Quite the opposite: \nCullinan is a strong advocate for increased diabetes research funding. \nI first met Cullinan when he asked my husband and me to sponsor him in \nAmerica's Walk for Diabetes. This year he served as the American \nDiabetes Association's National Youth Advocate. He traveled all across \nthe country talking to patients, providers and legislators. Every year \nhe lobbies Congress and he tells other young people that they too can \nhave a voice on Capitol Hill and in the halls of their state \nlegislatures.\n  Cullinan has important things to say. There are 17 million Americans \nwith diabetes; 6 million don't even know they have it. The prevalence \nof diabetes in the U.S. has grown by 50 percent since 1990; the Center \nfor Disease Control has called it an epidemic. At the current rate, by \nthe year 2010, 10 percent of all Americans will have diabetes.\n  Diabetes is a very serious disease. Life expectancy for people with \ndiabetes is reduced by 15 years. People with diabetes have health \nproblems. Many go on dialysis or need a transplant because their \nkidneys fail. Some lose their limbs and others lose their sight. Many \nhave a heart attack or a stroke. More than 200,000 people die of \ndiabetes every year. It is the fifth leading cause of death by disease \nand it is the third leading cause of death for some minority groups.\n  Diabetes costs a lot. In addition to human pain and early death, the \nfinancial cost exceeds $100 billion every year. Fourteen percent of all \nof our health care dollars goes to caring for people with diabetes; 25 \npercent of medicare expenditures goes to diabetes care. If the epidemic \nof diabetes continues, the expenditures for diabetes care will become \nastronomical and bankrupt our healthcare system.\n  Diabetes can be stopped but we need research to do it. While deaths \nattributed to diabetes have increased by 40 percent since 1987, the \nproportion of the NIH budget that goes to diabetes research has \ndecreased by 20 percent.\n  We also have to promote a healthy lifestyle across all ages. Obesity \nis reaching epidemic proportions in our country and is one of the \nreasons why Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, is \nincreasing. Type 2 diabetes used to be diagnosed in older adults. Now \nwe see it in overweight children. This form of diabetes can be \nprevented by eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and \nmaintaining a normal weight. As a society, we must face the fact that \nour sedentary lifestyle, fast food, and ``super size'' portions are \nkilling us. Stopping Type 2 diabetes means we must make a commitment as \na nation to encouraging and supporting a healthy lifestyle in our \nfamilies, our communities and our work environment.\n  Cullinan does not have Type 2 diabetes. He has Type 1 diabetes. \nHowever, both Cullinan and I know that Type 1 diabetes can be prevented \nor cured through research. Science has produced many recent \nbreakthroughs in our understanding of this disease. We know how to \nidentify the genes that put children like Cullinan at-risk for \ndiabetes. Scientists are now searching for the environmental triggers \nthat cause diabetes in genetically at-risk children. Once they identify \nthose triggers, prevention of Type 1 diabetes will be possible. \nScientists also understand that Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune \ndisease; the body destroys its own insulin producing islet cells. \nScientists are now studying ways to transplant islet cells or to \nregenerate islet cells. This will cure diabetes in people with the \ndisease. We need to provide these scientists with the research funding \nthey need to make a difference in Cullinan's life and to stop Type 1 \ndiabetes in future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5848-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF FONTANA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to reflect \non the 50-year history of the City of Fontana, which is celebrating its \nofficial 50th anniversary on Tuesday, June 25.\n  Incorporated in 1952, the City of Fontana has every reason to be \nproud of its rich history. One can just look at its intricately \ndetailed city seal for a glimpse of Fontana's heritage. On the right \nside of the seal appears a vineyard, representing the time when Fontana \nhad one of the largest vineyards in the world. Also illustrated are \nchicken ranches and citrus groves, reminding us of the agricultural \ncommunity Fontana once was.\n  Although land in the Fontana area was secured as early as 1813, it \nwas not actively developed until the early 1900's, when the Fontana \nDevelopment Company acquired it and began a community called \n``Rosena.'' The name was changed to ``Fontana'' in 1913.\n  In 1913, A.B. Miller founded the town-site of Fontana, and made it \ninto a diversified agricultural community. Nearly 30 years later, as \nAmerica geared up for World War II, Fontana was selected as the site \nfor a West Coast steel mill and soon became Southern California's \nleading producer of steel and other related products. The mill operated \nuntil 1984. Today, Fontana is a growing community and is the home of \nthe California Speedway, a world class track for auto racing.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the City of Fontana has truly thrived \nsince its early beginnings. Its population has grown from 13,695 to \n139,100, and the city provides a full range of valuable services to its \nresidents.\n  I am proud to serve the people of Fontana, and wish them all a \nwonderful anniversary celebration and many more years of \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5848-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5848-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5848-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5848-S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-256.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     Transboundary Hazardous Waste Agreement with Canada; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 389\n\n       Whereas, Michigan has long been frustrated in efforts to \n     regulate solid waste imported into our state. Our state is \n     especially concerned about waste that is brought here from \n     Ontario. Our citizens feel strongly that our environment \n     should not be placed at additional risk from municipal solid \n     waste and other materials that are generated elsewhere and \n     transported here for disposal; and\n       Whereas, The volume of waste that comes into Michigan each \n     year represents a significant portion of all trash handled \n     here. As much as 20 percent of all solid waste in Michigan is \n     from out or state, and the amount has increased significantly \n     in recently years; and\n       Whereas, Congress has authority for regulating the \n     transportation and disposal of solid waste between states and \n     nations by virtue of the United States Constitution's \n     interstate commerce clause. To protect the public health, \n     safety, and welfare of our environment and citizens, Congress \n     must take action to provide states with the express means to \n     regulate or prohibit the importation of trash. Congress has \n     before it now a bill that would provide the appropriate \n     authority to the states. Under H.R. 1927, states could \n     prohibit or impose certain limitations on the receipt of \n     foreign municipal solid waste; and\n       Whereas, Hazardous waste and solid waste transported \n     between Canada and the United States are provided for in the \n     Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government \n     of the United States Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \n     Hazardous Waste. It has been reported, however, that the \n     notification requirements and procedures set forth in the \n     agreement have not been followed. It is most disturbing to \n     think that the protections provided in the agreement between \n     our nations are not working. The people of this state have \n     every right to know that all prudent measures are being \n     enforced to protect our citizens and environment; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to authorize states to prohibit or restrict \n     foreign municipal solid waste and to urge the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to ensure full compliance with the \n     Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government \n     of the United States Concerning the Transboundary movement of \n     hazardous Waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-258. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Federal \n     transportation funding for highway and transit programs; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 419\n\n       Whereas, Michigan faces a difficult task in maintaining a \n     transportation network that meets the many needs of the \n     individuals and businesses of this state. This challenge is \n     made more difficult because of the fact that Michigan \n     receives in return from the federal government far less in \n     highway funding than we send to Washington; and\n       Whereas, Under the provisions of the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st century, Michigan currently receives \n     approximately 90.5 cents in return for every highway dollar \n     we send to the federal government. While this is a notable \n     improvement from the amounts received in prior years, it \n     remains inadequate for our state's considerable overall \n     transportation needs. In the area of transit, the deficiency \n     of funding received from Washington is much more severe, with \n     Michigan receiving only about 50 cents for each dollar we \n     send through taxes; and\n       Whereas, For Fiscal Year 2003, proposed federal \n     transportation funding for Michigan is expected to be $222 \n     million less than Fiscal Year 2002. This shortfall will \n     present significant problems to certain aspects of our \n     transportation infrastructure. As discussions take place on \n     future funding mechanisms and the next federal transportation \n     funding bill, it is imperative that a fairer approach be \n     developed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     minimum rate of return of 95 percent of Michigan's federal \n     transportation funding for highway and transit programs; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-259. A House concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the TANF \n     Reauthorization Act of 2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, on October 12, 2001, Representative Patsy Mink \n     introduced the TANF Reauthorization Act of 2001 with thirty \n     Democratic cosponsors, three of whom are on the committee of \n     referral, the Ways and Means Committee; and\n       Whereas, the bill would also make it clear that its \n     principal focus is the long-term reduction of poverty, rather \n     than a short-term, impermanent, immediate reduction in the \n     welfare rolls; and\n       Whereas, the bill would reform the Temporary Aid to Needy \n     Families program to make it clear that postsecondary \n     education is a work activity under TANF, for example, by \n     providing access to postsecondary education for women TANF \n     recipients as an allowable work activity; and\n       Whereas, in the United States, education has always been a \n     route to economic self-sufficiency and social mobility; and\n       Whereas, in the twenty-first century, at least one year of \n     postsecondary education will become increasingly more \n     essential for all workers; and\n       Whereas, yet, TANF does not currently extend our nation's \n     commitment to educational opportunity to women who are living \n     in poverty with their children but who are ready, willing, \n     and able to benefit from postsecondary education; and\n       Whereas, data from several studies have demonstrated that \n     the additional earning capacity that a postsecondary \n     education provides can make the difference between economic \n     self-sufficiency and continued poverty for many women TANF \n     recipients; and\n       Whereas, among families headed by African American, Latino, \n     and white women, the poverty rate declines from fifty-one, \n     forty-one, and twenty-two per cent to twenty-one, eighteen \n     and-a-half, and thirteen per cent, respectively, with at \n     least one year of postsecondary education; and\n       Whereas, further data have found that postsecondary \n     education not only increases women's incomes, it also \n     improves their self-esteem, increases their children's \n     education ambitions including aspiring to enter college \n     themselves, and has a dramatic impact on their quality of \n     life; and\n       Whereas, now, more than ever, TANF recipients need \n     postsecondary education to obtain the knowledge and skills \n     they will require to compete for jobs and enable them to lift \n     themselves and their children out of poverty in the long-\n     term; and\n       Whereas, without some postsecondary education, most women \n     who leave welfare for work will earn wages that place them \n     far below the federal poverty line, even after five years of \n     working; and\n       Whereas, allowing TANF recipients to attend college, even \n     for a short time, will improve their earning potential \n     significantly, in fact, the average person who attends a \n     community college, even without graduating, earns about ten \n     per cent more than those who do not attend college at all; \n     and\n       Whereas, women who receive TANF assistance clearly \n     appreciate the importance and role of postsecondary education \n     in moving them out of poverty to long-term economic self-\n     sufficiency; and\n       Whereas, as of November 1999, at least nineteen states had \n     considered or enacted strategies to support women's efforts \n     to achieve long-term economic self-sufficiency through \n     pursuit of a postsecondary education; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2002, the Senate concurring, That the Legislature supports \n     the TANF Reauthorization Act of 2001 (HR 3113); and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation to support the passage of the TANF Reauthorization \n     Act of 2001 (HR 3113); and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, the Governor of \n     Hawaii, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-260. A House concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     General Assembly of the State of Ohio relative to federal \n     funding for character education and program development; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Concurrent Resolution No. 28\n\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State \n     of Ohio (the Senate concurring):\n       Whereas, The members of the 124th General Assembly of Ohio, \n     recognizing the importance of fostering citizens with \n     honorable character qualities that are based upon the moral \n     standards exemplified by our nation's founders and with which \n     they established our nation and legal system, find it wise to \n     intentionally designate Ohio as a character-building state; \n     and\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n       Whereas, It is imperative that we continue to build upon \n     our heritage to make Ohio a community where families are \n     strong, homes and streets are safe, education is effective, \n     business is productive, neighbors demonstrate care for one \n     another, and citizens are free to make wise choices for their \n     lives and families; and\n       Whereas, Because citizens are responsible for their \n     actions, and their daily decisions need to be based upon \n     universally recognized ethical standards and upon universally \n     recognized positive character qualities including integrity, \n     responsibility, respect, compassion, honesty, justice, \n     generosity, kindness, and courage; and\n       Whereas, Individual irresponsibility and lack of commitment \n     to moral principles results in an increasing number of family \n     problems that have personal, social, and financial \n     consequences not only for individual family members, but also \n     for this state and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas, If people increasingly fail to demonstrate \n     positive character qualities and if they make wrong moral \n     choices, the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of \n     this state are endangered, resulting in a financial burden \n     upon the taxpayers of this state for increased costs of law \n     enforcement; and\n       Whereas, Many current societal problems will be alleviated \n     when more of the citizens of this state exemplify in their \n     lives positive character qualities that distinguish between \n     right and wrong; and\n       Whereas, There is a need for ever-increasing numbers of \n     positive role models among our youth to prevent juvenile \n     rebellion and delinquency, and among our leaders to encourage \n     an example-setting culture; and\n       Whereas, Teaching positive character qualities to juvenile \n     delinquents in particular has been shown to produce a \n     positive change in behavior and to reduce recidivism rates; \n     and\n       Whereas, Schools need to be environments where positive \n     character qualities are exemplified, taught, and strengthened \n     and where learning character-focused behaviors is encouraged; \n     and\n       Whereas, Encouraging employees to recognize positive \n     character qualities has resulted in an increase in workplace \n     ethics, employee safety, and organizational performance; and\n       Whereas, An emphasis upon positive character qualities in \n     every sector of society can only occur as institutions and \n     individuals mutually commit themselves to exemplify positive \n     character qualities in their public and personal lives and to \n     collaborate with one another to establish character as a \n     foundational community asset; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 124th General \n     Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, pledge our \n     commitment to positive character qualities by recognizing \n     Ohio to be a character-building state, by increasingly \n     viewing our decisions in light of their character impact, by \n     encouraging the advancement of positive character qualities \n     in state government, in city, township, and county \n     governments, in the media, and in schools, businesses, \n     community groups, worship centers, and homes; and by urging \n     the citizens and civic and community leaders of this state to \n     mutually pursue character as a vital leadership and \n     citizenship priority; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the 124th General Assembly of \n     Ohio commend the United States Congress for its support of \n     character education and development through the passage of \n     House Resolution 1, the ``No Child Left Behind Act of 2001''; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the 124th General Assembly of \n     Ohio request that the Ohio Department of Education take all \n     steps necessary to secure available funding for character \n     education and development programs provided for by Congress \n     in Sec. 5431 of House Resolution 1, the ``No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this Resolution to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker and Clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, to the President \n     Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, to the \n     members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news \n     media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-261.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2650. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nstudent loan borrowers with a choice of lender for loan consolidation; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce to my \ncolleagues, the Consolidation Student Loan Flexibility Act of 2002, a \nbill of great importance to the hundreds and thousands of students \nworking to make the dream of a college education a reality. According \nto a recent report published by the National Center for Higher \nEducation, the cost of attending two- and four-year public and private \ncolleges has grown more repidly than inflation, and faster than family \nincome. Poor families spent as much as 25 percent of their annual \nincome to send their children to a public, four-year colleges in 2000, \ncompared with 13 percent in 1980. What's worse, the Federal Pell Grant \nprogram, designed to help alleviate the financial burden on low income \nfamilies, covered only 57 percent of the cost of tuition at public \nfour-year colleges in 1999, compared with 98 percent in 1986.\n  The most widespread response to the increasing costs, according to \nthe report, involves debt, more students are borrowing more money than \never before. Since 1980, Federal financial assistance has been \ntransformed from a system characterized mainly by need based grants to \none dominated by loans. In 2000, loans represented 58 percent of \nFederal student financial aid, and grants represented 41 percent. \nStudies show that a major factor influencing a student's choice of \ncollege and degree program is the amount of debt connected with the \ntype of institution or profession. Make no mistake, these choices not \nonly affect the lives of the students themselves but also impact \nsociety as a whole. Efforts to attract college graduates into needed, \nbut not necessarily high paying careers, such as teaching, may be \nundermined by substantial debt burdens.\n  School loans are an important and legitimate aspect of attending \ncollege for many students, but it also raises several policy concerns. \nOne area of growing concern surrounds what is called the single lender \nrule. The single lender rule is a provision in the Higher Education Act \nthat affects the ability of college graduates to consolidate multiple \nstudent loans into a single new loan for the purpose of getting a lower \nrate. Specifically, it provides that borrowers having all of their \nloans held by a single lender have to consolidate with that lender, so \nlong as it offers consolidation loans. Therefore those borrowers with \nall of their loans in one place can't go to other lenders offering \nbetter rates or benefits, they have to stay where they are.\n  I would like to submit for the Record some numbers which demonstrate \nhow damaging the single lender rule is for students. Last year, 143,504 \nstudents were denied the benefits of loan consolidation because of the \nsingle lender rule. In my home State of Louisiana, 3,329 students were \nprevented from obtaining a lower-rate or more generous benefits because \nof this rule. Many of these students are studying to be doctors, \nnurses, teachers, and lawyers. These are conservative numbers, \ncollected from student loan providers, the reality is even more \nstaggering.\n  This restriction makes no sense and while it may benefit those \noffering student loans, it sure isn't designed to provide students with \nthe power that choice and competition can bring. A few months ago we \nacted to pass a package designed to stimulate the economy and secure \nlong term economic stability in America. I would be hard pressed to \nthink of a better way to ease the burden on our States and to secure a \nbrighter future for the U.S. economy than to make a college degree\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nan affordable option for all who seek to obtain one.\n  The Census Bureau has released new figures on the earnings gap \nbetween people with a high school education and those with bachelor's \ndegrees. It's wide and growing. The bureau said that college graduates \nmade an average of $40,500 last year, while the average high school \ngraduate earned $22,900. People with bachelor's degrees now earn an \naverage of 76 percent more than high school graduates. In 1975, the gap \nwas 57 percent. One does not have to have a Ph.D. in math to understand \nthe impact that closing this gap would mean for the economy, more \npeople with college degrees means higher consumer spending and lower \nunemployment.\n  Some of my colleagues may be asking, why now? Why not wait until next \nyear when we will be re-addressing the Higher Education Act? Here are \nsome of the reasons why I believe this is not a good idea for us to \nwait until next year or the year after. To delay repealing the rule \nuntil the H.E.A. Reauthorization would unnecessarily victimize hundreds \nof thousands of student loan borrowers, depriving them of the ability \nto manage their debt in an optimal way. Today's graduates are entering \na workplace where jobs are hard to get and salaries for starting \npositions are lower than they have ever been before. In this \nenvironment, we need to be building up opportunities for them to reduce \ntheir debt not increase it.\n  This bill is an important first step to making college more \naffordable for all American families. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin making the dream of a college education a reality for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 2652. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to sell or \nexchange certain land in the State of Florida, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, when the Spanish explorers surveyed \nFlorida in the early 16th century, this is what they saw: Massive \npines, measuring two to three feet in diameter that climbed into the \nskies over 100 feet.\n  This was the landscape of the Apalachicola National Forest.\n  You could walk through the forest, especially early in the day as the \nmorning fog was rising, look up and see these silent giants create a \ndense canopy overhead.\n  Some likened the forest's natural beauty to a cathedral of trees.\n  The sheer enormity of these tall stately trees was magnified by the \nclose cut landscape of wiregrass on the forest floor.\n  This pattern of tall stately trees and lawn like underbrush, as the \nfirst Spanish explorers described this impressive habitat, was common \nthroughout the southeast of North America--over 90 million acres of \npines and wiregrass.\n  Today, all but a fraction of these acres of the longleaf pine \necosystem have been destroyed or altered.\n  The forest character has been transformed by thick palmetto and other \ngrowth from that which was encountered by Florida's earliest settlers.\n  Why? Because of fires, or more precisely--the absence or containment \nof fires to protect businesses and their property.\n  Natural fires created by thunderstorms are part of nature's cycle. \nThe longleaf pines and wiregrass have natural qualities which allowed \nthem to survive the fires while other plant life perished.\n  The result is dramatically depicted in this painting by Jacksonville, \nFL artist Jim Draper who captures the landscape as it once looked and \nhow it looks in limited areas today.\n  I bring to the intention of my colleagues the landscape painting by \nMr. Draper of the area to be affected by the adoption of the \nlegislation by allowing us to bring into public ownership outholdings \nwhich represent a potential threat through the possibility that they \nmight cause resistance to the necessary controlled fires which are \nnecessary in order to maintain this small piece of what had been 90 \nmillion acres of the southeastern United States.\n  It is an important part of our Nation's natural history, which we \nhave the opportunity to take a step to protect for future generations \nduring this session of Congress.\n  The painting is of one of those areas in the Apalachicola National \nForest in the eastern section of the Florida Panhandle. It is known as \nPost Office Bay and retains the heritage of the American southeast of \nthe pre-Columbian era.\n  Like its predecessors, this special part of the Apalachicola is \npreserved due to fires, now both natural and prescribed.\n  But those fires are now threatened by man. Private inholdings \nadjacent to Post Office Bay are being considered for sale as small \nacreage second homes and vacation sites. Should this occur, managed \nfires would likely encounter serious resistance from the new owners and \nthe fires required to sustain this vestige of America's natural history \nwould be ended.\n  The 564,000 acre Apalachicola National Forest has a unique \nopportunity to acquire the remainder of a 2,560 acre inholding within \nthe forest.\n  As of last month, 1,180 acres of this property has been acquired \nthrough a land swap.\n  Now we need to finish the job, to permanently protect Post Office \nBay.\n  The Florida National Forest Lands Management Act of 2002 will do just \nthat.\n  The United States Forest Service has been left with several \nnoncontiguous parcels of land in Okaloosa County, further west in \nFlorida's Panhandle--that it must manage because former portions of the \nChoctowahatchee National Forest were returned to the Forest Service by \nthe Department of Defense.\n  These parcels are high in value, some have potential buyers, and \nseveral are encumbered with urban structures, such baseball fields and \nthe county fairgrounds.\n  Our legislation will allow the Forest Service to sell these parcels \nand purchase the remainder of the Apalachicola inholdings and other \nsensitive lands with the proceeds.\n  The land sale would have several benefits.\n  This legislation will make it easier for nature and man to continue \nits cleansing process by fire without endangering private land or its \noccupants.\n  By connecting the lands of the longleaf pine ecosystem, the regular \ncourse of natural fires can resume safely, optimizing Mother Nature's \nmethod of keeping this area beautiful.\n  Also, by allowing the regular cycle of fire to resume freely, the \nregeneration process will continue.\n  Ultimately, the forest would be more easily and effectively managed.\n  The Florida National Forest Lands Management Act of 2002 is a \nsensible way for the Apalachicola National Forest to acquire these vast \nand important inholdings and preserve a natural treasure.\n  It will aid in expanding the 3 million acres of longleaf pine that \nnow cover the Southeastern United States.\n  This measure has the support of the Forest Service, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it was well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 2653. A bill to reduce the amount of paperwork for special \neducation teachers, to make mediation mandatory for all legal disputes \nrelated to individualized education programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to announce the \nintroduction, along with my colleague Senator Miller, of the bipartisan \nTeacher Paperwork Reduction Act of 2002. During the 107th Congress, we \nhave been successful in legislating sweeping reforms in education with \nthe passage last year of the No Child Left Behind Act. We also hope to \ncomplete reauthorization of another important Federal education \ninitiative, the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA, this year. As we consider this legislation, our \ngreatest responsibility is to improve the quality of the education that \nstudents with special needs receive.\n  One of the problems fostered by the current system, which stands in \ndirect contrast to our purpose, is the excessive paperwork burden \nimposed on our special education teachers. This burden takes valuable \ntime away from classroom instruction and is a source of ongoing \nfrustration for the special education teachers working on the\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nfrontlines. As a result, this undermines the goal of providing the best \nquality education possible to all children. The Teacher Paperwork \nReduction Act addresses this problem and seeks to offer solutions that \nwill benefit special education teachers and most importantly the \nchildren they instruct.\n  This bipartisan legislation includes four main provisions to correct \nthe problem of burdensome paperwork. First, the Department of \nEducation, in cooperation with state and local educational agencies, \nwould be required to reduce the amount of paperwork by 50 percent \nwithin 18 months of enactment of the legislation and would be \nencouraged to make additional reductions. Second, the General \nAccounting Office GAO, would conduct a study to determine how much of \nthe paperwork burden is caused by Federal regulations compared to State \nand local regulations; the number of mediations that have been \nconducted since mediations were required to be made available under the \n1997 IDEA amendments; the use of technology in reducing the paperwork \nburden; and GAO would make recommendations on steps that Congress, the \nU.S. Department of Education, and the states and local districts can \ntake to reduce this burden within six months of the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Third, mediation would be mandatory for all legal disputes related to \nIndividual Education Programs IEPs to better empower parents and \nschools to focus resources on a quality education for children rather \nthan unnecessary litigation within one year of enactment of this \nlegislation. Fourth, the Department of Education is directed to conduct \nresearch to determine best practices for successful mediation, \nincluding training practices, that can help contribute to the effort to \nreduce paperwork, improve student outcomes, and free up teacher \nresources for teaching. The Department would also provide mediation \ntraining support services to support state and local efforts. The \nresources to fund these requirements would come from money appropriated \nthrough Part D of IDEA.\n\n  The Council for Exceptional Children, CEC, states, ``No barrier is so \nirksome to special educators as the paperwork that keeps them from \nteaching.'' According to a CEC report, concerns about paperwork ranked \nthird among special education teachers, out of a list of 10 issues. The \nCEC also reports that special education teachers are leaving the \nprofession at almost twice the rate of general educators. Statistics \nconcerning the amount of time special education teachers spend \ncompleting paperwork are telling. 53 percent of special education \nteachers report that routine duties and paperwork interfere with their \njob to a great extent. They spend an average of five hours per week on \npaperwork, compared to general education teachers who spend an average \nof two hours per week. More than 60 percent of special education \nteachers spend a half to one and a half days a week completing \npaperwork. One of the biggest sources of paperwork, the individualized \neducation program, IEP, averages between 8 and 16 pages long, and 83 \npercent of special education teachers report spending from a half to \none and a half days each week in IEP-related meetings.\n  There are three primary factors associated with burdensome paperwork. \nThe first factor is federal regulations. The 1997 IDEA regulations set \nforth the necessary components of the IEP and require teachers to \ncomplete an array of paperwork in addition to the IEP. According to the \nNational School Boards Association, NSBA, ``These requirements result \nin consuming substantial hours per child and cumulatively are having a \nnegative impact on special educators and their function.'' Second, \nthere are misconceptions at the state and local levels regarding \nfederal regulations that result in additional requirements imposed by \nthe states and local school districts. The U.S. Department of Education \ncompiled a sample IEP with all the necessary components, and it is five \npages long. However, most IEPs are much longer. The third factor is \nlitigation and the threat of litigation. In order to be prepared for \ndue process hearings and court proceedings, school district officials \noften require extensive documentation so that they are able to prove \nthat a free appropriate public education (FAPE) was provided to the \nspecial education student.\n  A key provision of the bill makes mediation mandatory for all legal \ndisputes related to IEPs. There are several benefits to using mediation \nas an alternative to due process hearings and court proceedings. \nAccording to the Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in \nSpecial Education, CADRE, mediation is a constructive option for \nchildren, parents, and teachers and allows families to maintain a \npositive relationship with teachers and service providers. Parents have \nthe benefit of working together with educators and service providers as \npartners instead of as adversaries. If an agreement cannot be reached \nas a result of mediation, parties to the dispute would retain existing \ndue process and legal options.\n  Mediation is also a much less costly, less time consuming alternative \nfor all parties concerned. Parents do not have to pay for mediation \nsessions, because under the 1997 IDEA amendments, states are required \nto bear the cost for mediation. States and local districts save a lot \nof money as well. According to the Michigan Special Education Mediation \nProgram, MSEMP, the average hearing cost to the state is $40,000; it \npays approximately $700 per mediation session. The NSBA reports that \nattorney fees for school districts average between $10,000 to $25,000. \nIn contrast, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Education says that it pays \nmediators $250 per session. The cost effectiveness of mediation is \napparent. Not only does mediation save money, it saves time as well. \nAccording to the Washington State Department of Education, a mediation \nsession may generally be scheduled within 14 days of a parental \nrequest, whereas it may take up to a year to secure a court date.\n  Most importantly, mediation is a successful alternative to due \nprocess hearings. At least some form of agreement is reached in 80 \npercent of sessions nationwide. In Pennsylvania, 85 percent of \nvoluntary special education mediations end in agreement in which both \nparties are satisfied. According to the New York State Dispute \nResolution Association, mediation ending in resolution of the conflict \noccurs for 75 percent of referrals, and in Wisconsin, approximately 84 \npercent of those who chose mediation would use it again.\n  The Teacher Paperwork Reduction Act is meant to alleviate a serious \nproblem that causes frustration and discouragement among dedicated \nspecial education teachers who expend energy and countless hours in \norder to give students with disabilities an equal opportunity to learn. \nIt is only fair and right to find ways to reduce paperwork in order to \ngive teachers more time to spend educating our students and changing \ntheir lives, and less time wading through inanimate stacks of paper. I \nwould invite my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation \nto help teachers, schools, and parents provide a better education for \nall students so that no child is left behind.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2654. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income loan payments received under the National Health \nService Corps Loan Repayment Program established in the Public Health \nService Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Craig Thomas \nto introduce legislation that would exclude loan repayments made \nthrough the National Health Service Corps from taxable income. I am \npleased that Senators Cleland, Snowe, Johnson, Gordon Smith, Landrieu, \nHagel, Conrad, Roberts, Durbin, Torricelli, Rockefeller, and Wyden are \nalso cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  There have been many developments in the area of health care in the \nlast few years from managed care reform, to increases in biomedical \nresearch, the mapping of the human genome, and the use of exciting new \ntechnologies in both rural and urban areas such as telemedicine. In \nfact, it seems that almost every day we hear of astounding new \nscientific breakthroughs. But unfortunately, while we are making great\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nstrides in the quality of health care, we are losing ground on the \naccess to health care for so many.\n  The sad truth is that there are currently 38.7 million Americans \nwithout health insurance coverage, 9.2 million of whom are children. In \nWashington, 13.3 percent of the population, and 155,000 children, lacks \nhealth insurance. Many of the 42.6 million uninsured Americans are \nlower-income workers who do not have employer-sponsored coverage for \nthemselves, but earn too much to be eligible for public programs like \nMedicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Access to health insurance for the uninsured is of the utmost \nimportance, we know that at the very least, health insurance means the \ndifference between timely and delayed treatment and at worst between \nlife and death. In fact, the uninsured are four times as likely as the \ninsured to delay or forego needed care, and uninsured children are six \ntimes as likely as insured children to go without needed medical care.\n  But even insurance isn't enough if there are no available providers. \nHospitals and other health care providers across the country are facing \nan increasingly uncertain future. The sad truth is that it is \nincreasingly more difficult to recruit health care providers to work \nwith underserved communities, especially in rural areas. In addition to \neconomic pressures, rural areas must overcome the environmental issues \ninvolved with recruiting a doctor who may have been raised, educated, \nand trained in an urban setting.\n  The National Health Service Corps was created in 1970 by Senator \nWarren Magnuson, one of the most distinguished Senators to come from \nWashington State. He saw the need to put primary care clinicians in \nrural communities and inner-city neighborhoods, and developed this \nprogram to fill that need.\n  Since then, the Corps has placed over 22,000 health professionals in \nrural or urban health professions shortage areas. There is no doubt \nthat National Health Service Corps has been extremely successful. In \nfact, the most recent available data show that more than 70 percent of \nproviders continued to provide services to underserved communities \nafter their Corps obligation was fulfilled, 80 percent of these health \ncare providers stayed in the community in which they had originally \nbeen placed.\n  Under current law, the National Health Service Corps provides \nscholarships, loan-repayments, and stipends for clinicians who agree to \nserve in urban and rural communities with severe shortages of health \ncare providers. In 1986 the IRS ruled that all payments made under the \nprogram are considered taxable income. Understanding the immediate \ndetriment to scholarship recipients, who were forced to pay the tax out \nof their own pockets, Congress eliminated the scholarship tax in 2001. \nAnd while the scholarship program is now not considered taxable income \nto the IRS, the loan-repayments and stipends are.\n\n  By statute, the current loan program awards also include a tax \nassistance payment equal to 39 percent of the loan repayment amount, \nwhich is to be used by the recipient offset his or her tax liability \nresulting from the loan repayment ``income.'' This means that nearly 40 \npercent of the federal loan repayment budget goes to pay taxes on the \nloan repayment ``income'' alone. If these federal payments were not \ntaxed, and the funding was freed up, more health professions students \ncould take advantage of the loan repayment program, and could be placed \nin shortage areas, thereby increasing access to health care in both \nurban and rural areas.\n  This is not a new problem. The tax burden that accompanies the \nNational Health Service Corps loan payments is a significant deterrent \nto increasing the number of clinicians enrolling in the Corps. I do not \nwant to see a situation where, as happened several years ago, over 300 \napplicants actually left underserved areas because the Corps could not \nfully fund the loan repayment program.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, the National Health Service \nCorps Loan Repayment Act, would address this disincentive, making the \nCorps available to more medical and health professionals, and thereby \nbringing more providers into underserved areas. If loan repayments are \nexcluded from taxation, the National Health Service Corps will have \ngreater resources to provide aid to health professionals seeking loan \nrepayment, and will be able to increase the number of providers in \nunderserved areas.\n  There is no doubt that strengthening the National Health Service \nCorps is a ``win-win'' situation. Corps scholarships help finance \neducation for future primary care providers interested in serving the \nunderserved. In return, graduates serve those communities where the \nneed for primary health care is greatest.\n  This bill is supported by over 20 national organizations including \nthe National Rural Health Association, the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers, the Association of American Medical Colleges, \nand the American Medical Student Association. I am especially pleased \nthat the Washington State Medical Association is supporting this bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that the complete list be included in the \nRecord after my statement.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this bill and to join me in expanding \nthis vitally important and imminently successful program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Act Endorsements\n\n       American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.\n       American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.\n       American Academy of Physician Assistants.\n       American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine.\n       American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.\n       American Association for Dental Research.\n       American College of Nurse-Midwives.\n       American College of Nurse Practitioners.\n       American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians.\n       American Counseling Association.\n       American Dental Association.\n       American Dental Education Association.\n       American Medical Student Association.\n       American Optometric Association.\n       American Organization of Nurse Executives.\n       American Osteopathic Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       American Student Dental Association.\n       Association of Academic Health Centers.\n       Association of American Medical Colleges.\n       Association of Clinicians for the Underserved.\n       Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry.\n       National Association of Community Health Centers.\n       National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.\n       National Rural Health Association.\n       Washington State Medical Association.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am pleased to rise today to introduce the National \nHealth Service Corps Loan Repayment Act of 2002 with my colleague from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell. Specifically, this legislation will exclude \nloan repayments made through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) \nprogram from taxable income. Enactment of the National Health Service \nCorps Loan Repayment Act of 2002 would increase the amount of federal \ndollars available so more students could participate in the NHSC \nprogram.\n  Under current law, the NHSC provides scholarships, loan-repayments, \nand stipends for clinicians who agree to serve in national designated \nunderserved urban and rural communities. The tax law changes in 1986 \nresulted in the IRS ruling that all NHSC payments were taxable. \nCongress eliminated the tax on the scholarship in 2001, but the loan-\nrepayments and stipends continue to be taxed.\n  To assist loan repayment recipients with their tax burden, the NHSC \nloan program includes an additional payment equal to 39 percent of the \nloan repayment amount so the loan repayment recipient can pay his or \nher taxes. Close to 40 percent of the NHSC Federal loan repayment \nbudget goes to pay taxes on the loan repayment ``income.'' The current \nsituation should not be allowed to continue. Given the fiscal \nrestraints we are facing, we must ensure that federal dollars are spent \nefficiently and effectively. It is obvious that today's NHSC loan \nrepayment structure does not meet that goal. Our legislation resolves \nthis issue.\n  For over 30 years, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program \nhas literally been a lifeline for many underserved communities across \nthe country that otherwise would not have a health care provider. I \nknow this program is critically important to my\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\nstate of Wyoming and to many other rural states that has difficulties \nrecruiting and retaining primary health care clinicians.\n  There are 2,800 Health Professional Shortage Areas, 740 Mental Health \nShortage Areas and 1,200 Dental Health Shortage Areas now designated \nacross the country. However, the NHSC program is meeting less than 13 \npercent of the current need for primary care providers and less than \nsix percent of need for mental health and dental services. The National \nHealth Service Corps Loan Repayment Act of 2002 would increase the \nnumber of students in the program and allow more provides to be placed \nin these shortage areas.\n  The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Act of 2002 is \ncrucial to the future well being of many of our rural communities. I \nstrongly urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2655. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to improve access to long-term care services under the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce ``A First \nStep to Long-Term Care Act of 2002.'' This is a targeted long-term care \npackage--a first step in the direction of long-term care reform. This \nlegislation is about protecting assets, expanding home care, and \nmodestly expanding Medicare to address the need for adult day health \ncare.\n  Government coverage for nursing home care operates primarily, and \nmost substantially, through the Medicaid program the safety net for the \npoor. Despite what many Americans believe or hope, Medicare is not \ndesigned or financed to cover long-term care needs. Medicare is, in \nfact, the universal health care program for the elderly, which covers \nall health care needs, save prescription drugs and long-term care.\n  Just this morning, I testified before the Senate Special Committee on \nAging about the need to find real solutions to attack the issue of \nlong-term care coverage. This legislation is a step in that direction.\n  Today, the home care benefit under Medicare offers skilled care and \npossibly home health aides on a part-time or intermittent basis. \nBeneficiaries also must be confined to the home, despite the fact that \nmany could leave the home with assistance. ``A First Step to Long-Term \nCare Reform'' retains the requirement that leaving the home requires a \nconsiderable and taxing effort, but it obviates the difficult choice \nthat patients face: either be imprisoned in their home or risk losing \nMedicare coverage.\n  We also need to begin to provide options to nursing home care under \nthe Medicare benefit, such as the payment for adult day health care. \nThis is something Senator Santorum has been working on as well. Doing \nso would provide a measure of respite and will reduce the bias towards \ninstitutionalizing those who can, with the right circumstances--stay at \nhome.\n  Giving states relief from the mandate that they must pursue and sell-\noff the estates of Medicaid beneficiaries is another first step. In the \nshort-term, we can provide states with the option of whether or not to \ndo so. West Virginia is one State, in particular, which is seeking \nrelief from this harsh and unnecessary mandate. I recognize Congressman \nNick Rahall, my good friend and colleague from West Virginia, for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, there are few issues that are as challenging as \nproviding a solution for the long-term care problem, but we simply must \nhave the courage to find solutions. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2655\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Transportation to develop \nand implement plan to provide security for cargo entering the United \nStates or being transported in intrastate or interstate commerce; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed \nat closing the dangerous cargo security loophole in our Nation's \naviation security network.\n  Last year, with the passage of the Aviation and Security Act of 2001, \nwe reinvented aviation security. We overturned the status quo, and I am \nproud of the work we did. We put the Federal Government in charge of \nsecurity and we have made significant strides toward restoring the \nconfidence of the American people that it is safe to fly.\n  We no longer have a system in which the financial ``bottom line'' \ninterferes with protecting the flying public. We also addressed the \ngamut of critical issues, including baggage screening, additional air \nmarshals, cockpit security, and numerous other issues.\n  But there is more work to be done. We must not lose focus. If we are \nto fully confront the aviation security challenges we face in the \naftermath of September 11, we must remain aggressive. We need a ``must-\ndo'' attitude, not excuses about what ``can't be done'', because we are \nonly as safe as the weakest link in our aviation security system.\n  I believe one of the most troubling shortcomings, which persists to \nthis day, is the lax cargo security infrastructure. The Department of \nTransportation Inspector General will warn in a soon-to-be-released \nreport that the existing system is ``easily circumvented.'' This must \nnot be allowed to stand.\n  Moreover, according to a June 10 Washington Post report, internal \nTransportation Security Administration documents warn of an increased \nrisk of an attack designed to exploit this vulnerability because TSA \nhas been focused primarily on meeting its new mandates to screen \npassengers and luggage.\n  This is clear evidence that cargo security needs to be bolstered. And \ntime is not on our side. We must act now. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is designed to tackle this issue by directing the \nTransportation Security Administration to submit a detailed cargo \nsecurity plan to Congress that will address the shortcomings in the \ncurrent system.\n  And while the TSA is designing and implementing this plan, my bill \nwould require interim security measures to be put in place immediately. \nThe interim security plan would include random screening of at least 5 \npercent of all cargo, an authentication policy designed to ensure that \nterrorists are not able to impersonate legitimate shippers, audits of \neach phase of the shipping process in order to police compliance, \ntraining and background checks for cargo handlers. and funding for \nscreening and detection equipment.\n  On September 11, terrorists exposed the vulnerability of our \ncommercial aviation network in the most horrific fashion.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to increase the number of children participating in the summer food \nservice program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act that will \nstreamline, nationwide, management of the Summer Food Service Program. \nThe proposed administrative changes are expected to increase the number \nof local organizations stepping forward to sponsor a summer feeding \nprogram in their communities and, thus, serve many more children in \npoor neighborhoods.\n  Children in low-income communities are eligible to receive free or \nreduced price meals during the school year through the National School \nLunch and Breakfast Programs. During the 2000-2001 school year, 15.3 \nmillion children received such assistance. But, unless children attend \nschool during the summer, access to meals through these programs ends.\n  The Summer Food Service Program, which is administered at the federal \nlevel by USDA, helps to fill the resulting hunger gap and helps \nchildren get the nutrition they need to learn, play and grow throughout \nthe summer months. This is an entitlement program which funds the meal \nand snack service provided by the sponsors of diverse, summer activity \nprograms.\n  Although the Summer Food Service Program is the largest Federal \nresource used to feed children during the summer months, we know that \nthere is substantial unmet need. Among the more than 15 million \nchildren getting free and reduced-price meals during the school year, \nonly about 20 percent of these three million children received free \nmeals during the summer months.\n  State administering agencies report that a major obstacle to serving \nmore low-income children is the relatively small and static number of \nlocal organizations serving as program sponsors or meal providers. \nDuring the last several years, the total number of Summer Food Service \nProgram sponsors across the country ranged between 28,000 and a little \nover 31,000.\n  Two important factors contribute to this situation. Many schools and \nsummer recreation programs remain unaware that federal funding is \navailable to provide free meals and snacks to needy children. Others \nfind the requirements for budget and cost reporting, which are \ndifferent from those used in the School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, \nto be unusually complex and burdensome.\n  The administrative obstacles are both familiar to the Congress and \none we have taken an initial step to address. In early fiscal year \n2001, I authored a provision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act \nthat authorizes a pilot to try out simpler accounting and reimbursement \nprocedures. The pilot replaces a sponsor's usual obligation to provide \ndetailed and separate documentation of actual administrative and \noperating costs up to specified limits. In practice, this documentation \nhas little effect, since a large majority of sponsors qualify for the \nmaximum reimbursement. In the pilot states, sponsors report the number \nof meals and are reimbursed at a flat rate of $2.50 per meal. This \nallows sponsors in the 13 pilot States to combine both cost categories \nand follow procedure used in the school meals programs for \nreimbursement.\n  Although the pilot test is not over, the initial results are \npositive. The Food Research Acton Center released findings today in \ntheir annual summer nutrition status report, Hunger Does Not Take a \nVacation. The number of sponsors increased by eight percent in the \npilot areas compared to one percent across all other states. Most \nimportant, children's participation in the Summer Food Service Program \nincrease by 8.9 percent across the pilot States. This contrasts with a \n3.3 percent decline for the rest of the nation.\n  USDA's Secretary Veneman and Under Secretary Bost used their \nauthority to facilitate sponsorship and announced, last March, that all \nstates may seek waivers to adopt more streamlined administrative \nprocedures.\n  I think it is now time for Congress to step up and take action to \nfurther improve the capacity of the Summer Food Service Program. I am \nintroducing a new bill, along with Senator Harkin, the Chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. Our proposed legislation makes the procedural \nsimplifications in the pilot a part of the Program's regular operating \nrules. This eliminates the need for waiver requests and waiver \napproval.\n  If we are truly committed to the principle that no child will be left \nbehind, this is a small step that can make a large difference in \nencouraging local organizations to sponsor a summer feeding program and \nin meeting the nutrition needs of low-income children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise to introduce \nthe Teacher Tax Relief Act 2002.\n  I am joined with my colleagues, Senator Warner, Senator Landrieu, and \nSenator Allen in introducing this legislation to help our teachers who \nselflessly reach deep into their own pockets to purchase supplies for \ntheir classrooms or to engage in professional development.\n  Senators Warner, Landrieu, and I have long led the effort to \nrecognize the invaluable services that teachers provide each and every \nday to our children and to our communities. We were very pleased when \nearlier this year the economic recovery package included our provision \nto create an above-the-line deduction for teachers who purchase \nclassroom supplies.\n  This tax relief is significant in that it recognizes for the first \ntime the extra mile that our dedicated teachers go in order to improve \nthe classroom experience for their students.\n  Today, we introduce legislation that builds upon the relief enacted \nearlier this year. Our bill would double the amount that a teacher can \ndeduct--from $250 to $500--and includes professional development \nexpenses in the deduction. Our bill would also make this modest tax \nrelief permanent whereas the provision in the economic stimulus package \nis scheduled to sunset in 2 years.\n  While our bill provides financial assistance to educators, its \nultimate beneficiaries will be our students. Other than involved \nparents, a well-qualified teacher is the single most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \ndemonstrated, time and again, the strong correlation between qualified \nteachers and successful students. Moreover, educators themselves \nunderstand just how important professional development is to \nmaintaining and expanding their level of confidence.\n  When I meet with teachers from Maine, they repeatedly tell me of \ntheir desire and need for more professional development. But they also \ntell me that, unfortunately, school budgets are so tight that \nfrequently the school districts cannot provide that assistance that a \nteacher needs in order to take that additional course or pursue that \nadvanced degree. As President Bush aptly put it: ``Teachers sometimes \nlead with their hearts and pay with their wallets.''\n  A recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics \nhighlights the benefits of professional development. The survey found \nthat most teachers who had participated in more than 8 hours of \nprofessional development during the previous year felt ``very well \nprepared'' in the area in which the instruction occurred. Obviously, \nteachers who are taking additional course work, and pursuing advanced \ndegrees, become even more valuable in the classroom.\n  Increasing the deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies is \nalso a critical component of my legislation. So often teachers in \nMaine, and throughout the country, spend their own money to improve the \nclassroom experiences of their students. While most of us are familiar \nwith the National Education Association's estimate that teachers spend, \non average, $400 a year on classroom supplies, a new survey \ndemonstrates that they are spending even more than that. According to a \nrecent report from Quality Education Data, the average teacher spends \nover $520 a year out of pocket on school supplies.\n  I have spoken to dozens of teachers in Maine who have told me of the \nbooks, rewards, supplies, and other materials they routinely purchase \nfor their students.\n  Idella Harter, president of the Maine Education Association, is one \nsuch teacher. She told me of spending over $1,000 in 1 year, reaching \ndeep into her pocket to buy materials, supplies, and other treats for \nher students. At the end of the year, she started to add up all of the \nreceipts that she had saved, and she was startled to discover they \nexceeded $1,000. Idella told me, at that point she decided she better \nstop adding them up.\n  Debra Walker is another dedicated teacher in Maine who teaches \nkindergarten and first grade in Milo. She has taught for over 25 years. \nYear after year, she spends hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin \nboards, computer software, crayons, construction paper, tissue paper, \nstamps and ink pads. She even donated her own family computer for use \nby her class. She described it well by saying: ``These are the extras \nthat are needed to make learning fun for children and to create a \nstimulating learning environment.''\n\n  Another example is Tyler Nutter, a middle school math and reading \nteacher from North Berwick. He is a new recruit to the teaching \nprofession. After teaching for just 2 years, Tyler has incurred \nsubstantial ``startup'' fees as he builds his own collection of needed \nteaching supplies. In his first years on the job, he has spent well \nover $500 out of pocket each year, purchasing books and other materials \nthat are essential to his teaching program.\n  Tyler tells me that he is still paying off the loans that he incurred \nat the University of Maine-Farmington. He has car payments and a \nwedding to pay for. He is saving for a house. And he someday hopes to \nget an advanced degree. Nevertheless, despite the relatively low pay he \nis receiving as a new teacher, he says: ``You feel committed to getting \nyour students what they need, even if it is coming out of your own \npocket.''\n  That is the kind of dedication that I see time and again in the \nteachers in Maine. I have visited almost 100 schools in Maine, and \neverywhere I go, I find teachers who are spending their own money to \nimprove their professional qualifications and to improve the \neducational experiences of their students by supplementing classroom \nsupplies.\n  The relief we passed overwhelmingly earlier this year was a step in \nthe right direction. As Tyler told me, ``It's a nice recognition of the \ncontributions that many teachers have made.'' We are committed to \nbuilding on this good work.\n  Again, I thank the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for \nbeing a leader with me on this bill. We invite all of our colleagues to \njoin us in recognizing our teachers for a job well done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nMaine. We have fought together for this measure for several years now. \nOne of the great rewards has been an inducement for this Senator. The \nSenator just spoke of visiting 100 schools.\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nI cannot claim 100, but it is growing in number. And what a joy it is.\n  For those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate, and are \nsuccessful in a piece of legislation, what a pleasure it is to go back \nand tell others, and thank them for their support which has enabled us \nto succeed.\n  The teachers associations have been instrumental in backing this. \nThey even ran a little advertisement in the papers of Virginia thanking \nme, for which I really humbly am very deeply touched and grateful.\n  But Senators Collins, Landrieu, Allen, and I have worked closely for \nsometime now in support of legislation to provide our teachers with tax \nrelief in recognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as \na part of their duties.\n  It is not required by law. It is not required by regulation. It is \nnot required by the principals or the school districts. They just do it \nout of the generosity of their own hearts and the love and affection \nthey have for their students. What a lesson this has been to this \nSenator.\n  Earlier this year we were successful in providing much needed tax \nrelief for our Nation's teachers with the passage of H.R. 3090, the Job \nCreation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush early \nthis year, included the Collins-Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001, \nproviding a $250--which the Senator mentioned--above-the-line deduction \nfor educators who incur out-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring \ninto the classroom to better the education of their students.\n  These important provisions will provide almost half a billion \ndollars' worth of tax relief to teachers all across America over the \nnext 2 years.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $521 out of their \nown pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as pens, \npencils, and books. First year teachers spend even more, averaging $701 \na year on classroom expenses.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the nation's teacher shortage by \nproviding a $250 above the line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pocket to better the education of our \nchildren.\n  Accordingly, Senator Collins, Senator Landrieu, Senator Allen, and I \nhave joined together to take another step forward by introducing the \nTeacher Tax Relief Act of 2002.\n  This legislation will build upon current law in three ways. The \nlegislation will: increase the above-the-line deduction for educators \nfrom $250 allowed under current law to $500; allow educators to include \nprofessional development costs within that $500 deduction. Under \ncurrent law, up to $250 is deductible but only for classroom expenses; \nand make the Teacher Tax relief provisions in the law permanent. \nCurrent law sunsets the Collins-Warner provisions after 2 years.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. And, in my view, the Federal \nGovernment should recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make in \ntheir career.\n  The Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2002 is another step forward in \nproviding our educators with the recognition they deserve.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for her work on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2663. A bill to permit the designation of Israeli-Turkish \nqualifying industrial zones; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, Senators Breaux, McCain, and I \nintroduce the Turkish-Israeli Economic Enhancement Act of 2002.\n  This legislation will allow qualified products from Turkey to be \neligible for duty-free entry into the United States under the Qualified \nIndustrial Zone program. Congress first established the Qualified \nIndustrial Zone program in 1996 to facilitate economic cooperation \nbetween Israel, Egypt and Jordan. The impetus behind this program was \nto help create the economic basis for sustained peace in the region. \nWhile peace still eludes us today, there is little doubt that the \nprogram has helped to foster greater economic cooperation in the \nregion. Allowing Turkey to participate in the program will foster even \ngreater economic growth and stability in the region.\n  The Israeli-Turkish Economic Enhancement Act would amend Section \n9(e)(1) of the United States Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act \nof 1985, as amended, the ``FTA Act, by expanding the definition of \n``qualifying industrial zones'' to include portions of the territory of \nIsrael and Turkey. Under the FTA Act, the President may proclaim duty-\nfree benefits for certain products produced within the qualifying \nindustrial zones. The bill would allow the President to proclaim duty-\nfree benefits for certain products, excluding certain import sensitive \nproducts, of qualifying industrial zones established jointly by Israel \nand Turkey. The bill would foster cooperation between Israel and Turkey \nand help promote economic growth, opportunity and development in \nTurkey, a vital security partner in NATO and a key ally in the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues and the President to \nenact the legislation as soon as practicable. Enabling Turkey to \nparticipate in the Qualified Industrial Zone program can help attract \nforeign investment to Turkey and build greater regional stability.\n  I understand that there is strong interest in supporting high-\ntechnology investment in Turkey. The investment potential for high \ntechnology products and services in Turkey has not gone unnoticed by \nmajor U.S. investors. Microsoft has installed a subsidiary in Istanbul \nresponsible for sales and support to all of the Middle East, Central \nAsia and Northern Africa. By creating a qualified industrial zone, \nTurkey may be able to attract even more foreign investment in this \nimportant sector.\n  Turkey has been a staunch, long-time ally of the United States. \nAmerican and Turkish troops fought together in Korea. Today we are \nfighting a different war on a different front in Afghanistan. But our \nfriendship and joint commitment to freedom and democracy remains the \nsame.\n  By enacting this legislation, the U.S. Congress can send a strong \nmessage to the people of Turkey that we appreciate and value their \nfriendship and support and that we will continue to work with them to \npromote freedom and prosperity for all of our people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation with \nSenators Breaux and Grassley that would expand the U.S.-Israel Free \nTrade Agreement to recognize Turkey's critical role as a key American \npartner in the Middle East conflict, the war on terrorism, and the NATO \nalliance.\n  Turkey has a deepening strategic relationship with Israel, with which \nit has enjoyed military cooperation since 1994. It is a force for \nstability in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Today, it assumed \ncommand of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in \nAfghanistan. It is one of our best NATO allies. Turkish troops have \nfought alongside U.S. forces from Korea to Kabul. Turkey's support was \ninstrumental during the 1991 gulf war; it hosts operation Northern \nWatch, in which American and British aircraft patrol the no-fly zone \nover northern Iraq; and it will be central to any American military \ncampaign against\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\nIraq. As a Muslim nation and a secular democracy that has embraced \nmodernity, Turkey puts to rest the myth that America's war on terror is \na war on Islam.\n  Turkey's economy shrank by over 8 percent last year. Its ability to \ncontribute to the war effort in Afghanistan and elsewhere faces serious \neconomic constraints. Turkey has shown a strong commitment to economic \nreform and to working with the International Monetary Fund. A Qualified \nIndustrial Zone for Turkey, under the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, \nwould help Turkey attract foreign investment, diversify its exports, \nand boost trade. It would also help Israel and Turkey develop the \neconomic dimension of their strong security relationship, which is \nunique in the region.\n  I know this issue is important to the administration and to the \nGovernments of Turkey and Israel. I am sorry we were unable to pass \nlegislation authorizing a QIZ for Turkey as part of the TPA package \nlast month. I am confident that the measure we have introduced today \nwill enjoy wide bipartisan support and will make a tangible, \nsubstantive contribution to Israeli-Turkish cooperation and to American \ninterests in the region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n\n  S. 2664.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish a program of fees relating to animal drugs; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  MR. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nAnimal Drug User Fee Act of 2002, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senator Harkin, who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and Senator Gregg, who is ranking member of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Modeled after the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act, which has successfully reduced approval \nand review times by over half, the Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2002 \nwould authorize the Food and Drug Administration to collect user fees \nfrom animal pharmaceutical manufacturers to increase the amount of \nresources devoted to reviewing new animal drug applications and \ninvestigational applications.\n  Right now, nearly 90 percent of new animal drug applications are \noverdue,\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nmany by over a year. These unprecedented delays in the review and \napproval process are both frustrating and problematic to the industry, \nveterinarians, as well as countless farmers who depend on cutting edge \ntools to combat and prevent animal disease and enhance the safety of \nour food supply.\n  Under the Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2002, user fees would be \ncontingent upon the Food and Drug Administration's Center for \nVeterinary Medicine reducing its review times to a maximum of 180 days \nover a period of five years. The user fees generated by the Act would \namount to $5 million in fiscal year 2003, $8 million in fiscal year \n2004, and $10 million for each of the last three years, for a total of \n$43 million over 5 years. The Secretary may determine the user fee \namount and grant waivers in cases where such fees would inhibit \ninnovation or discourage the development of animal drug products for \nminor uses or minor species.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Hutchinson, with whom I am pleased \nto work with on the Agriculture Committee and the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Senator Gregg, who is also a \nmember of the HELP Committee, in introducing the Animal Drug User Fee \nAct of 2002. The Animal Drug User Fee Act would authorize the Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, to collect user fees from animal drug \nmanufacturers to support new animal drug applications and \ninvestigational applications. This important legislation is modeled \nafter the successful Prescription Drug User Fees Act, which after a few \nyears of implementation has reduced approval and review times by half.\n  The need for expedited review of animal drug applications is \nsubstantial. Nine out of ten new animal drug applications are overdue. \nPrompt approval of safe and effective animal drugs is critical to the \nimprovement of not only animal health but public health as well. Our \nanimal health professionals need the newest and most effective drugs to \ncombat dangerous animal diseases.\n  Under the Animal Drug User Fee Act, the collection of user fees from \nanimal drug manufacturers would be contingent on FDA's Center for \nVeterinary Medicine, CVM, reducing its review times to a maximum of 180 \ndays over five years. The user fees generated by the Act would amount \nto $5 million in Fiscal Year 2003, $8 million in Fiscal Year 2004, and \n$10 million for each of the last three years, totaling $43 million over \n5 years. The Secretary may determine the user fee amount and grant \nwaivers in cases where such fees would inhibit innovation or discourage \nthe development of animal drug products for minor uses or minor \nspecies. Such user fees would be considered an\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\naddition to, not a replacement for, the annual appropriations amount \ndesignated for CVM through the annual appropriations process.\n  This legislation enjoys broad support from pharmaceutical, livestock \nand poultry producers and from the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation, the Animal Health Institute, the National Pork Producers \nAssociation, the National Turkey Federation, the National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association, the National Milk Producers Federation, and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/20/senate-section/article/S5866-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3917.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Private sector business concerns, which are free to \n     respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace, \n     constitute the strength of the American economic system.\n       (2) Competitive private sector enterprises are the most \n     productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and \n     services.\n       (3) Government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy is detrimental to all businesses and the American \n     economic system.\n       (4) Government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in scope and \n     in dollar volume.\n       (5) When a government engages in entrepreneurial activities \n     that are beyond its core mission and compete with the private \n     sector--\n       (A) the focus and attention of the government are diverted \n     from executing the basic mission and work of that government; \n     and\n       (B) those activities constitute unfair government \n     competition with the private sector.\n       (6) Current laws and policies have failed to address \n     adequately the problem of government competition with the \n     private sector of the economy.\n       (7) The level of government competition with the private \n     sector, especially with small businesses, has been a priority \n     issue of each White House Conference on Small Business.\n       (8) Reliance on the private sector is consistent with the \n     goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n     (Public Law 103-62).\n       (9) Reliance on the private sector is necessary and \n     desirable for proper implementation of the Federal Workforce \n     Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-226).\n       (10) It is in the public interest that the Federal \n     Government establish a consistent policy to rely on the \n     private sector of the economy to provide goods and services \n     that are necessary for or beneficial to the operation and \n     management of Federal Government agencies and to avoid \n     Federal Government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy.\n       (11) It is in the public interest for the private sector to \n     utilize employees who are adversely affected by conversions \n     to use of private sector entities for providing goods and \n     services on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 1303. RELIANCE ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\n\n       (a) General Policy.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, except as provided in subsection (c), each agency shall \n     procure from sources in the private sector all goods and \n     services that are necessary for or beneficial to the \n     accomplishment of authorized functions of the agency.\n       (b) Prohibitions Regarding Transactions in Goods and \n     Services.--\n       (1) Provision by government generally.--No agency may begin \n     or carry out any activity to provide any products or services \n     that can be provided by the private sector.\n       (2) Transactions between governmental entities.--No agency \n     may obtain any goods or services from or provide any goods or \n     services to any other governmental entity.\n       (c) Exceptions.--Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to \n     goods or services necessary for or beneficial to the \n     accomplishment of authorized functions of an agency under the \n     following conditions:\n       (1) Either--\n       (A) the goods or services are inherently governmental in \n     nature within the meaning of section 1306(b); or\n       (B) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     determines that the provision of the goods or services is \n     otherwise an inherently governmental function.\n       (2) The head of the agency determines that the goods or \n     services should be produced, provided, or manufactured by the \n     Federal Government for reasons of national security.\n       (3) The Federal Government is determined to be the best \n     value source of the goods or services in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed pursuant to section 1304(a)(2)(C).\n       (4) The private sector sources of the goods or services, or \n     the practices of such sources, are not adequate to satisfy \n     the agency's requirements.\n\n     SEC. 1304.

As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the \ninjunction of secrecy by removed from the following treaty transmitted \nto the Senate on June 20, 2002, by the President of the United States: \nMoscow Treaty (Treaty Document 107-8).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time, that it be referred with accompanying papers to the \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed, and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the Treaty Between the United States of America and the \nRussian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions, signed at Moscow \non May 24, 2002 (the ``Moscow Treaty'').\n  The Moscow Treaty represents an important element of the new \nstrategic relationship between the United States and Russia. It will \ntake our two nations along a stable, predictable path to substantial \nreductions in our deployed strategic nuclear warhead arsenals by \nDecember 31, 2012. When these reductions are completed, each country \nwill be at the lowest level of deployed strategic nuclear warheads in \ndecades. This will benefit the peoples of both the United States and \nRussia and contribute to a more secure world.\n  The Moscow Treaty codifies my determination to break through the long \nimpasse in further nuclear weapons reductions caused by the inability \nto finalize agreements through traditional arms control efforts. In the \ndecade following the collapse of the Soviet Union, both countries' \nstrategic nuclear arsenals remained far larger than needed, even as the \nUnited States and Russia moved toward a more cooperative relationship. \nOn May 1, 2001, I called for a new framework for our strategic \nrelationship with Russia, including further cuts in nuclear weapons to \nreflect the reality that the Cold War is over. On November 13, 2001, I \nannounced the United States plan for such cuts--to reduce our \noperationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level of between \n1700 and 2200 over the next decade. I announced these planned \nreductions following a careful study within the Department of Defense. \nThat study, the Nuclear Posture Review, concluded that these force \nlevels were sufficient to maintain the security of the United States. \nIn reaching this decision, I recognized that it would be preferable for \nthe United States to make such reductions on a reciprocal basis with \nRussia, but that the United States would be prepared to proceed \nunilaterally.\n  My Russian counterpart, President Putin, responded immediately and \nmade clear that he shared these goals. President Putin and I agreed \nthat our nations' respective reductions should be recorded in a legally \nbinding document that would outlast both of our presidencies and \nprovide predictability over the longer term. The result is a Treaty \nthat was agreed without protracted negotiations. This Treaty fully \nmeets the goals I set out for these reductions.\n  It is important for there to be sufficient openness so that the \nUnited States and Russia can each be confident that the other is \nfulfilling its reductions commitment. The Parties will use the \ncomprehensive verification regime of the Treaty on the Reduction and \nLimitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the ``START Treaty'') to \nprovide the foundation for confidence, transparency, and predictability \nin further strategic offensive reductions. In our Joint Declaration on \nthe New Strategic Relationship between the United States and Russia, \nPresident Putin and I also decided to establish a Consultative Group \nfor Strategic Security to be chaired by Foreign and Defense Ministers. \nThis body will be the principal mechanism through which the United \nStates and Russia strengthen mutual confidence, expand transparency, \nshare information and plans, and discuss strategic issues of mutual \ninterest.\n  The Moscow Treaty is emblematic of our new, cooperative relationship \nwith Russia, but it is neither the primary basis for this relationship \nnor its main component. The United States and Russia are partners in \ndealing with the threat of terrorism and resolving regional conflicts. \nThere is growing economic interaction between the business communities \nof our two countries and ever-increasing people-to-people and cultural \ncontacts and exchanges. The U.S. military has put Cold War practices \nbehind it, and now plans, sizes, and sustains its forces in recognition \nthat Russia is not an enemy, Russia is a friend. Military-to-military \nand intelligence exchanges are well established and growing.\n  The Moscow Treaty reflects this new relationship with Russia. Under \nit, each Party retains the flexibility to determine for itself the \ncomposition and structure of its strategic offensive arms, and how \nreductions are made. This flexibility allows each Party to determine \nhow best to respond to future security challenges.\n  There is no longer the need to narrowly regulate every step we each \ntake, as did Cold War treaties founded on mutual suspicion and an \nadversarial relationship.\n  In sum, the Moscow Treaty is clearly in the best interests of the \nUnited States and represents an important contribution to U.S. national \nsecurity and strategic stability. I therefore urge the Senate to give \nprompt and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and to advise and \nconsent to its ratification.\n                                                      George W.
