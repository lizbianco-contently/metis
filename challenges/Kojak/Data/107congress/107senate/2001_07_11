Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to \ncomment about the confirmation hearings which are scheduled later this \nmonth for Mr. Robert Mueller to be Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. That position arguably is as important as any position \nin the United States of America, perhaps even the most powerful \nposition.\n  The statutory 10-year term is 2 years longer than the maximum a \nPresident may serve under the Constitution. The Director of the FBI has \npower over the largest investigative organization in the world, global \nin its exposure.\n  There are an enormous number of problems which have befallen the \nagency in recent years. The confirmation hearing will provide a unique \nopportunity for oversight for the U.S. Senate to seek to establish \nstandards as to what the FBI should be doing in cooperating with \ncongressional oversight.\n  The FBI is a well-respected organization. I have had very extensive \nopportunities to work with the FBI. After graduation from college, I \nwas in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations for 2 years and \nhad training from the FBI. The commanding officer of the OSI was a \nformer top aide to Director J. Edgar Hoover. I worked with the\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nFBI on the prosecution of the Philadelphia Teamsters, an investigation \nwhich was conducted by the McClellan committee, with then-general \ncounsel, Robert Kennedy, and saw their very fine work. Then, as \nAssistant Counsel to the Warren Commission, I worked with the FBI; then \nas district attorney of Philadelphia and for the last 20 years \nextensively on the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have great respect for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. At the \nsame time, my experience has shown me that there is an over concern by \nthe personnel of the FBI with their so-called institutional image and \nthat there cannot be a concession of any problems, which is really \nindispensable if problems are to be corrected.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Sergeant at Arms restore \norder in the galleries.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have a nominee who has been put forward by the \nPresident who has very impressive credentials: United States Attorney \nin Boston, United States Attorney in San Francisco, 3 years as \nAssistant Attorney General in the Justice Department, where I had \ncontacts and saw his impressive work.\n  He will be succeeding a man, Director Louis Freeh, who came to the \nBureau with extraordinary credentials and overall did a good job, \nalthough he presided over the Bureau at a time when there were many \ninstitutional failures.\n  I analogize Director Freeh to the little boy on the Netherlands dike \nrunning around putting his finger in all the holes to try to stop the \nwater from coming through. With so many holes and so many problems, it \nwas not possible.\n  I believe similarly that the Congress, including the Senate and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, has not been sufficiently active on \noversight. These hearings will give us an opportunity to set standards \nas to what the FBI should be doing in response to oversight activities \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I had an opportunity to talk for the better part of an hour yesterday \nto FBI Director-designee Mueller and went over quite a number of issues \nthat I intend to ask him in the public forum.\n  I comment about these today because the Senate ought to be preparing \nfor this hearing with unique care for this very important position.\n  One of the matters I intend to discuss with Mr. Mueller in the \nconfirmation hearings is the failure of the FBI to turn over for \ncongressional Senate oversight a memorandum dated December 9, 1996, \nwhich was written at a time when there was a question as to whether \nAttorney General Reno was going to be reappointed by President Clinton. \nAt that time, the campaign finance investigation was just being \nstarted. There was a conversation by a top FBI official Esposito, with \na top Department of Justice official Lee Radek, and FBI Director Freeh \nwrote this memorandum to the file to Mr. Esposito actually. Referring \nto a meeting that he had with the Attorney General on December 6, \nDirector Freeh wrote this memo December 9:\n\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and the \n     Public Integrity Section regarding this case because the \n     ``Attorney General's job might hang in the balance'' (or \n     words to that effect).\n\n  This memorandum did not come to the attention of the Judiciary \nCommittee until April of 2000, some 3\\1/2\\ years later, when, in my \ncapacity as chairman of the subcommittee on Department of Justice \noversight, a subpoena was issued for all of the FBI records and \nwritings relating to the campaign finance investigation. When this memo \nwas discovered, Director Freeh was questioned as to why he hadn't \nturned it over for Judiciary Committee oversight, because it was the \nview of many that it absolutely should have been done.\n  Director Freeh defended his inaction on the ground that it would have \ncompromised his relationship with Attorney General Reno. But \nnotwithstanding that fact, it is my view that this is the sort of \noversight the Judiciary Committee must undertake. This will be the \nsubject of my questioning of Mr. Mueller during the confirmation \nhearing.\n  Director Freeh declined to appear voluntarily before the Judiciary \nCommittee or the subcommittee to comment about this memorandum, and the \ncommittee decided not to issue a subpoena, which I thought should have \nbeen done.\n  It is my view that when a matter of this importance comes to light \nthere ought to be a public inquiry as to what happened between the \nAttorney General and the Director of the FBI. It takes a congressional \ncommittee to get to the bottom of that. When Attorney General Reno \ntestified, she said, ``I don't recall that, but if that had come to my \nattention, I certainly would have done something about it.'' In my \nview, anybody who is going to be confirmed for FBI Director has to have \na commitment to making this sort of information available to Senate \noversight.\n  Another matter which I intend to question Mr. Mueller about is the \ninsistence of the FBI on not cooperating with Senate oversight where \nthere is a pending criminal investigation. Now, I understand the \nsensitivity of a pending criminal investigation, having some experience \nas a prosecutor myself, but the case law is plain that congressional \noversight is so fundamental and so important that it may proceed even \nas to pending criminal investigations. But that has not been honored by \nthe Department of Justice or by the FBI. And in the case involving Dr. \nWen Ho Lee, the subcommittee on the Department of Justice oversight was \nstymied at every turn by the FBI refusing to make available \ninformation, citing a pending criminal investigation.\n  Now, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, or \nchairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee, have standing, it \nseems to me, on a discrete inquiry, carefully controlled, where the \nprosecution would not be compromised. That is the role of oversight. \nBut when Wen Ho Lee was indicted on December 11, 1999, immediately, the \nFBI used that as a reason to resist any further Senate oversight. And \nthere was a real question of why the FBI and the Department of Justice \nallowed Dr. Lee to remain at large after a search of his premises in \nApril of 1999 was conducted, and then he was at liberty, at large, \nuntil December when an arrest warrant was issued. Suddenly, he became \nmore problematic than public enemy No. 1, when he was put in manacles \nand solitary confinement, in a situation which had all the earmarks of \nan effort at the top of the Justice Department and FBI to coerce a \nguilty plea.\n\n  After the guilty plea was entered, Judiciary Committee oversight had \nbeen further stymied by the refusal of the FBI to allow access to what \nwas going on because Dr. Lee was still being debriefed. Here again, I \nbelieve the Judiciary Committee is entitled to a commitment that \noversight will be respected, and the case law will be respected, and \nthat there may be oversight even on pending criminal investigations.\n  In the case of Hanssen, who has just entered a guilty plea on an \narrangement to be spared the death penalty, raises some very \nfundamental questions that need to be answered as to procedures in the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. Although this matter did not come to \nlight until very recently, in August of 1986, Hanssen's voice was \nrecorded by an FBI wiretap on his Soviet contact's telephone. In 1992, \nHanssen improperly accessed his supervisor's computer. In 1997, Hanssen \nbegan to search the FBI computerized case database for his name, his \nhome address, and for terms referring to espionage activities.\n  A question arises, what steps have been taken by the FBI to detect a \nspy such as Hanssen? There was a very probing report issued by the \ninspector general of the CIA after Aldrich Ames was detected as a spy, \nand the inspector general of the CIA, Fred Hitz, wrote this in the \nreport:\n\n       We have no reason to believe that the directors of Central \n     Intelligence who served during the relevant period were aware \n     of the deficiencies described in this report.\n\n  That relates to Aldrich Ames.\n\n       But directors of Central Intelligence are obligated to \n     ensure that they are knowledgeable of significant \n     developments relating to crucial agency missions. Sensitive \n     human source reporting on the Soviet Union and Russia during \n     and after the Cold War clearly was such a mission, and \n     certain directors of Central Intelligence must therefore be \n     held accountable for serious shortcomings in that reporting.\n\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n\n  Now, what that does essentially is to say that the Directors are at \nfault, even though they didn't know about Aldrich Ames, or have reason \nto know about Aldrich Ames, because the presence of spies in the \nCentral Intelligence Agency so threatens national security that the \nDirectors have an obligation to find out about it. If you make it an \nabsolute responsibility, that, according to the CIA inspector general, \nwould put the pressure on the Directors to find out about it.\n  The three Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency who were in \noffice during the time Aldrich Ames functioned--Judge Webster, Gates, \nand Woolsey--responded with a very hot letter denying responsibility \nand saying that the standard set by the CIA inspector general was too \nhigh. Well, this is a subject I have discussed preliminarily with Mr. \nMueller and intend to ask him about.\n  It is a very tough standard to say that a public official is liable \nfor matters that he didn't know about or didn't have reason to know \nabout. But if our Nation's secrets are to be guarded, and if we are to \nbe secure from spies such as Ames and Hanssen, this is a matter that we \nare going to have to determine as to what is the appropriate standard.\n  When I talked to Mr. Mueller, I didn't ask him for a response, but \nthis is another subject that will be probed during the course of the \nconfirmation hearings. The issues of management in the FBI are just \ngigantic; they are enormous. We have seen repeated failures by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to come forward with documents in a \ntimely manner. In the McVeigh case, for example, the FBI had reason to \nknow as early as January of this year that all of the documents \nrelating to McVeigh had not been turned over to McVeigh's lawyers. Yet \nthose documents were not made available until May. And then there was \nthe issue about the fairness to McVeigh. No doubt he was guilty; he had \nconfessed to the most horrendous crime in American history, where 168 \npeople were killed in a Federal building in Oklahoma City--women, \nchildren, men, going there for official business, blameless, and it was \ndone in a cold, calculated way.\n  There was no doubt as to guilt or as to the justification for the \ndeath sentence which was imposed, but there was an obligation on the \npart of the prosecution to turn over all the papers. There may have \nbeen something which bore on sentencing. Here you had a 5-month delay \nwhere the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reason to know that all \nthose documents were not turned over.\n  The question is: What is to be done in the management of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation to avoid this sort of an error? In an age of \ncomputerization and mechanization, we search for an answer and really \nmust find a way that the FBI will correct these kinds of problems.\n  A similar issue was confronted in the Waco matter. It was an incident \nwhich occurred on April 19, 1993, where the compound was attacked and \nwhere so many people lost their lives in one of the most controversial \nincidents in American history, but it was not until August of 1999 that \nthe FBI suddenly found a whole ream of records. Here again, management \nresponsibilities require something much, much better than that.\n  The incident at Waco is really a very sad chapter in American history \nfor many reasons: The confrontation, the deaths, the failure of \ncongressional oversight, the failure of candid disclosure by the \nofficials who were in charge.\n  On April 28 of 1993, Attorney General Reno and then FBI Director \nWilliam Sessions testified before Congress that no pyrotechnic tear gas \nrounds were used at Waco. The hostage rescue team commander, Richard \nRogers, who was present for their testimony but who did not testify, \ndid not correct them.\n  Regrettably, that is an occurrence which has happened too often where \nthere is a concern about the FBI institutional image which blinds \npeople who ought to be coming forward and who ought to be making a \ndisclosure as to what the facts were when there is congressional \noversight and you have critical testimony by the Attorney General of \nthe United States and by the Director of the FBI.\n  When Mr. Mueller and I talked yesterday, we discussed at some length \nthe culture of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the difficulties \nof even the Director finding out what is going on in the FBI. That is a \nchallenging task which Robert Mueller is going to have to confront.\n  In the context of what has happened with Wen Ho Lee, Waco, McVeigh, \nHanssen, and the campaign finance investigation, these are issues which \nneed to be very thoroughly explored in the confirmation hearing, and we \nought to come to some common understanding between those of us who have \noversight responsibilities on the Judiciary Committee and the Director \nof the FBI as to what his standard will be and what we think the \nstandard should be so that we can come to a meeting of the minds or so \nthat we may not confirm a Director who does not measure up to what \nCongress thinks is required as a matter of legitimate oversight.\n  At the same time, as I suggested before, Congress has not done its \njob on oversight. We had the incident at Waco on April 19 of 1993. In \nmy view, there should have been a prompt, detailed, piercing oversight \ninvestigation of what went on there. It was not until former Senator \nDanforth undertook that investigation in 1999 that anything really was \ndone.\n  Who can say as to the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building 2 \nyears to the day after the Waco incident, when the Oklahoma City \nbombing occurred on April 19, 1995, whether that was related to the \nWaco incident or whether it might have been prevented had there been \nvigorous congressional oversight?\n  In 1995, I served as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism \nand moved to have oversight hearings at that time on both Waco and Ruby \nRidge because I thought a great deal more needed to be done. Finally, \nthe subcommittee was permitted to have oversight as to Ruby Ridge.\n  That was an incident where Randy Weaver was on the mountain and \nrefused to come down. There was a veritable army which approached him \nand had a firefight, and a U.S. marshal was killed in the process.\n  The oversight in which the Terrorism Subcommittee got to the bottom \nof the matter, and to the credit of FBI Director Louis Freeh, the FBI \nchanged the rules of engagement related to the use of deadly force in \nwhat was a very important matter.\n  When we finished the hearings, Mr. Weaver said in the hearing room, \nhad he known there was going to be this kind of congressional \noversight, he would have come down from the mountain if he had believed \nthere would be an inquiry and an appropriate resolution.\n  It was at that time that militia were springing up in some 40 States \nacross the United States. If Congress exercises appropriate oversight, \nit is my view that will do a great deal to quell public unrest and \npublic doubts as to what is happening with Federal action in a place \nsuch as Ruby Ridge and Federal action in a place such as Waco.\n  In summary, these are matters which are of the utmost importance when \nwe will be confirming the next Director of the FBI, an occurrence which \nhappens only once every 10 years because it is a 10-year turn, although \na Director may leave earlier. Louis Freeh is leaving after 8 years, a \nterm of office longer than the maximum a President may serve under the \nConstitution. The Justices of the Supreme Court have enormous power on \n5-4 decisions establishing the law of the land, but there are four \nothers who go with the one deciding vote.\n  The FBI, with all of its power--most of what it does is necessarily \nconfidential and secret--requires that there be very profound changes \nin FBI management on the items which have been mentioned and an \nattitude that will not emphasize the institutional image to the \nsacrifice of not having appropriate congressional oversight, not having \nappropriate congressional disclosure of the memorandum referred to, \nhaving appropriate congressional disclosure when a matter is pending, \neven if it is a criminal matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nmemorandum from Director Freeh, dated December 9, 1996, be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\n\n                                                 December 9, 1996.\n     To: Mr. Esposito.\n     From: Director, FBI.\n     Subject: Democratic National Campaign Matter.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n       As I related to you this morning, I met with the Attorney \n     General on Friday, 12/6/96, to discuss the above-captioned \n     matter.\n       I stated that DOJ had not yet referred the matter to the \n     FBI to conduct a full, criminal investigation. It was my \n     recommendation that this referral take place as soon as \n     possible.\n       I also told the Attorney General that since she had \n     declined to refer the matter to an Independent Counsel it was \n     my recommendation that she select a first rate DOJ legal team \n     from outside Main Justice to conduct the inquiry. In fact, I \n     said that these prosecutors should be ``junk-yard dogs'' and \n     that in my view, PIS was not capable of conducting the \n     thorough, aggressive kind of investigation which was \n     required.\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS \n     regarding this case because the ``Attorney General's job \n     might hang in the balance'' (or words to that effect). I \n     stated that those comments would be enough for me to take him \n     and the Criminal Division off the case completely.\n       I also stated that it didn't make sense for PIS to call the \n     FBI the ``lead agency'' in this matter while operating a \n     ``task force'' with DOC IGs who were conducting interviews of \n     key witnesses without the knowledge or participation of the \n     FBI.\n       I strongly recommend that the FBI and hand-picked DOJ \n     attorneys from outside Main Justice run this case as we would \n     any matter of such importance and complexity.\n       We left the conversation on Friday with arrangements to \n     discuss the matter again on Monday. The Attorney General and \n     I spoke today and she asked for a meeting to discuss the \n     ``investigative team'' and hear our recommendations. The \n     meeting is now scheduled for Wednesday, 12/11/96, which you \n     and Bob Litt will also attend.\n       I intend to repeat my recommendations from Friday's \n     meeting. We should present all of our recommendations for \n     setting up the investigation--both AUSAs and other resources. \n     You and I should also discuss and consider whether on the \n     basis of all the facts and circumstances--including Huang's \n     recently released letters to the President as well as Radek's \n     comments--whether I should recommend that the Attorney \n     General reconsider referral to an Independent Counsel.\n       It was unfortunate that DOJ declined to allow the FBI to \n     play any role in the Independent Counsel referral \n     deliberations. I agree with you that based on the DOJ's \n     experience with the Cisneros matter--which was only referred \n     to an Independent Counsel because the FBI and I intervened \n     directly with the Attorney General--it was decided to exclude \n     us from this decision-making process.\n       Nevertheless, based on information recently reviewed from \n     PIS/DOC, we should determine whether or not an Independent \n     Counsel referral should be made at this time. If so, I will \n     make the recommendation to the Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an extract \nof a report from CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We have no reason to believe that the DCIs who served \n     during the relevant period were aware of the deficiencies \n     described in this report. But DCIs are obligated to ensure \n     that they are knowledgeable of significant developments \n     related to crucial Agency missions. Sensitive human source \n     reporting on the Soviet Union and Russia during and after the \n     Cold War clearly was such a mission, and certain DCIs must \n     therefore be held accountable for serious shortcomings in \n     that reporting.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7440-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to express grave disappointment \nand concern that yesterday the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nTommy Thompson, indicated he would not implement a bipartisan law \npassed by this Congress last session. This legislation would open the \nborders of our country so that American citizens, who pay for a good \nshare of the research done on prescription drugs in this country, to \nsupport the development of medications that are desperately needed, \ncould get the best price for American-made, FDA-safety-approved \nmedications from other countries such as Canada.\n\n  Last year, Congress passed a bill that says we will no longer protect \nthe prices charged in this country that disadvantage our citizens by \nstopping us from free commerce across the border. I supported this \neffort in the House of Representatives. I find it ironic, at a time \nwhen our President talks about wanting free trade authority and \nexpanding free trade, that we stop our citizens at the border from \nbeing able to benefit from free trade regarding the purchase of \nprescription drugs.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services said he was \nconcerned about the safety of reimported prescription drugs. We \naddressed those concerns in the previously approved legislation. \nFurther, I have introduced legislation called the Medication Equity and \nDrug Savings Act, S. 215, the MEDS Act, that addresses the safety \nconcerns expressed by former Secretary Shalala. My bill guarantees in \nthe clearest terms that American labels will be used on the wholesale \nproducts that come from another country and that there will be complete \nsafety precautions to make sure Americans will be receiving American-\nmade, safe, FDA-approved drugs.\n  What is the difference in cost for prescription drugs? The difference \nis clear when I stand in Detroit, MI, and I look across the river, I \nknow that prices for American-made prescription drugs can be cut in \nhalf for my constituents with a quick 5 minute drive across the bridge \nto Canada. In some cases, the savings are even greater. Tamoxifen, a \nbreast cancer treatment drug, is $136 a month in Michigan. Last year, \nwe drove across the bridge with a group of seniors to purchase the \nexact same medicine; the price was only $15. There is something wrong \nwith this picture.\n  The bill the Secretary chose not to implement would have begun to \naddress this price difference by opening the borders, to make sure our \nhospitals, our businesses, and our pharmacists, could develop business \nrelationships with wholesalers in other countries to bring back drugs \nat a lower cost and make sure our citizens could get medication at \nlower prices.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to join together again in a bipartisan way \nto act. We must guarantee that this law will be put into effect this \nyear, whether it be by passing my legislation, making changes on \nanother bill, or including it in Medicare prescription drug legislation \nwhich is so critical. We must act now. Over and over again I hear from \nfamilies in my State and States across our country. Families, seniors, \nindividuals with disabilities, and working people with ailments are all \nconcerned about the high costs of prescription drugs. People are having \nto choose between paying the electric bill, getting their food, or \ngetting their medicine. In the great United States of America, this \ngreat country, that should not be happening.\n  I express grave concern and disappointment about the decision and the \ninformation released yesterday by the Secretary. I urge him and invite \nall my colleagues to join with me to address this issue in a way that \nwill allow opening of the borders to reaffirm competition for the best, \nlowest price for the safest prescription drugs that are manufactured in \nthis country, that our citizens help to subsidize. Whether through the \nR tax credit, through funding the Federal labs, or through other \nefforts, taxpayers help to develop these prescriptions. We helped fund \nthe development of the medication, and Americans pay top dollar \ncompared to anybody in the world for these same prescription drugs. It \nis not right.\n  It is time now to act to make sure we can truly reduce the costs of \none of the most important parts of the health care system today--\nmedicines for our people, for the families of America. We deserve a \nbreak. Unfortunately, the roadblock was maintained yesterday. It is \ntime to take down the barrier at the border and allow our people to buy \nprescription drugs wherever they can get the best price. I urge we act \nas quickly as possible.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7441-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7441-S7459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2002\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

None of the funds in this Act may be used to \n     support Government-wide administrative functions unless such \n     functions are justified in the budget process and funding is \n     approved by the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       Sec. 320. None of the funds in this Act may be used for \n     planning, design or construction of improvements to \n     Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House without the \n     advance approval of the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       Sec. 321. Amounts deposited during fiscal year 2001 in the \n     roads and trails fund provided for in the fourteenth \n     paragraph under the heading ``FOREST SERVICE'' of the Act of \n     March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 843; 16 U.S.C. 501), shall be used by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, without regard to the State in \n     which the amounts were derived, to repair or reconstruct \n     roads, bridges, and trails on National Forest System lands or \n     to carry out and administer projects to improve forest health \n     conditions, which may include the repair or reconstruction of \n     roads, bridges, and trails on National Forest System lands in \n     the wildland-community interface where there is an abnormally \n     high risk of fire. The projects shall emphasize reducing \n     risks to human safety and public health and property and \n     enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest \n     productivity, and biological integrity. The projects may be \n     completed in a subsequent fiscal year. Funds shall not be \n     expended under this section to replace funds which would \n     otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber salvage \n     sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     exempt any project from any environmental law.\n       Sec. 322. Other than in emergency situations, none of the \n     funds in this Act may be used to operate telephone answering \n     machines during core business hours unless such answering \n     machines include an option that enables callers to reach \n     promptly an individual on-duty with the agency being \n     contacted.\n       Sec. 323. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar: Provided, That sales which are \n     deficit when appraised under the transaction evidence \n     appraisal system using domestic Alaska values for western red \n     cedar may be advertised upon receipt of a written request by \n     a prospective, informed bidder, who has the opportunity to \n     review the Forest Service's cruise and harvest cost estimate \n     for that timber. Program accomplishments shall be based on \n     volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2002, the \n     annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity \n     called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan in \n     sales which are not deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar, all of the western red cedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal \n     year 2002, less than the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit \n     when appraised under the transaction evidence appraisal \n     system using domestic Alaska values for western red cedar, \n     the volume of western red cedar timber available to domestic \n     processors at prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 \n     United States shall be that volume: (i) which is surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska; and (ii) is that \n     percent of the surplus western red cedar volume determined by \n     calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which has \n     been sold on the Tongass to the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be \n     calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is \n     sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' \n     shall mean that the determination of how much western red \n     cedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be made \n     at the time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be \n     deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in \n     Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the \n     Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western \n     red cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska \n     processors at price equal to or greater than the log selling \n     value stated in the contract. All additional western red \n     cedar volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United \n     States domestic processors may be exported to foreign markets \n     at the election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow \n     cedar may be sold at prevailing export prices at the election \n     of the timber sale holder.\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n       Sec. 324. None of the funds appropriated by this Act shall \n     be used to propose or issue rules, regulations, decrees, or \n     orders for the purpose of implementation, or in preparation \n     for implementation, of the Kyoto Protocol which was adopted \n     on December 11, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan at the Third Conference \n     of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, which has not been submitted to the Senate \n     for advice and consent to ratification pursuant to article \n     II, section 2, clause 2, of the United States Constitution, \n     and which has not entered into force pursuant to article 25 \n     of the Protocol.\n       Sec. 325. The Forest Service, in consultation with the \n     Department of Labor, shall review Forest Service campground \n     concessions policy to determine if modifications can be made \n     to Forest Service contracts for campgrounds so that such \n     concessions fall within the regulatory exemption of 29 CFR \n     4.122(b). The Forest Service shall offer in fiscal year 2002 \n     such concession prospectuses under the regulatory exemption, \n     except that, any prospectus that does not meet the \n     requirements of the regulatory exemption shall be offered as \n     a service contract in accordance with the requirements of 41 \n     U.S.C. 351-358.\n       Sec. 326. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 327. The authority to enter into stewardship and end \n     result contracts provided to the Forest Service in accordance \n     with section 347 of title III of section 101(e) of division A \n     of Public Law 105-277 is hereby expanded to authorize the \n     Forest Service to enter into an additional 28 contracts \n     subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in that \n     section: Provided, That of the additional contracts \n     authorized by this section at least 9 shall be allocated to \n     Region 1 and at least 3 to Region 6.\n       Sec. 328. Any regulations or policies promulgated or \n     adopted by the Departments of Agriculture or the Interior \n     regarding recovery of costs for processing authorizations to \n     occupy and use Federal lands under their control shall adhere \n     to and incorporate the following principle arising from \n     Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-25; no charge \n     should be made for a service when the identification of the \n     specific beneficiary is obscure, and the service can be \n     considered primarily as benefiting broadly the general \n     public.\n       Sec. 329. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \n     fiscal year 2002, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized \n     to limit competition for fire and fuel treatment and \n     watershed restoration contracts in the Giant Sequoia National \n     Monument and the Sequoia National Forest. Preference for \n     employment shall be given to dislocated and displaced workers \n     in Tulare, Kern and Fresno Counties, California, for work \n     associated with the establishment of the Giant Sequoia \n     National Monument.\n       Sec. 330. The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the \n     Chief of the Forest Service shall:\n       (1) extend the special use permit for the Sioux Charlie \n     Cabin in the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness Area, Montana, \n     held by Montana State University--Billings for a period of 50 \n     years; and\n       (2) solicit public comments at the end of the 50 year \n     period to determine whether another extension should be \n     granted.\n       Sec. 331. Section 323 of the Department of the Interior and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, as included in \n     Public Law 105-277, Division A, section 101(e), is amended by \n     striking ``and 2001,'' and inserting ``, 2001 and 2002,''.\n       Sec. 332.

Local Exemptions From Forest Service \n     Demonstration Program Fees. Section 6906 of Title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before \n     ``Necessary''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Local Exemptions From Demonstration Program Fees.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Each unit of general local government \n     that lies in whole or in part within the White Mountain \n     National Forest and persons residing within the boundaries of \n     that unit of general local government shall be exempt during \n     that fiscal year from any requirement to pay a Demonstration \n     Program Fee (parking permit or passport) imposed by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture for access to the Forest.\n       ``(2) Administration.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     establish a method of identifying persons who are exempt from \n     paying user fees under paragraph (1). This method may include \n     valid form of identification including a drivers license.''.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002''.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be terminated.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am very honored to join with my colleague, \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, in bringing before \nthe Senate H.R. 2217, the Interior and related agencies bill for fiscal \nyear 2002, as amended, by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  This is the first of the 13 annual appropriations measures to be \nconsidered by the Senate this year. In my opinion, this is a well-\ncrafted bill. It balances both the needs of the American people and the \nresources available to the committee. We only have so much money \navailable and ``we ain't going to spend what we ain't got.''\n  That being the situation then, I urge my colleagues to adopt this \nbill in a timely fashion so we can proceed to conference with the House \nof Representatives. We have gotten a late start this year and we have \nto work hard and long to catch up. Darkness may have fallen, from time \nto time, before we catch up on these appropriations bills.\n  H.R. 2217 provides more than $1.2 billion in much-needed funding to \nattack the deferred maintenance problems at our national parks, our \nnational wildlife refuges, our national forests, and other federal \nrecreational facilities across this nation. The bill would provide $480 \nmillion to the National Park Service, $108 million to the Fish and \nWildlife Service, $78 million to the Bureau of Land Management, and \n$541 million to the Forest Service for literally hundreds, hundreds and \nhundreds of important maintenance projects.\n  In addition, the bill restores $35 million in abandoned mine clean-up \nfunds that were unwisely proposed to be cut by the administration. We \nare not going down that road, Mr. President. It restores nearly $80 \nmillion in proposed cuts to the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, a \nmatter of great importance to many of our colleagues. The bill fully \nfunds the construction needs of the next six schools on the priority \nlist of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, while increasing funding for the \nIndian Health Service. It increases funding for important energy \nresearch programs overseen by Department of Energy, another issue of \nparticular importance to those from the West. Finally, this bill \nprovides nearly $895 million in funding for various cultural agencies: \nagencies such as the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of \nArt, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Office \nof Museum Services.\n  I am proud of the fact that the committee has kept its previous \ncommitment and has fully funded the Conservation Spending Category \nestablished in title VIII of last year's Interior appropriations bill. \nIncluded in that amount is $406 million for federal land acquisition; \n$221 million for State and other conservation programs such as \nendangered species programs and wetland conservation programs; $137 \nmillion for historic preservation programs; an additional $50 million \nfor the Payment-In-Lieu-of-Taxes program; and $180 million for Federal \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  This is a well-balanced bill, given the demands placed on the \ncommittee as a result of 1,799 Member requests versus the resources \navailable to it. Despite that, I know there are Members who are \npassionate about some of the programs funded in this bill, and they \nwould like to increase funding in one area or another. I appreciate \nthat. I respect the right of every Member to come to the floor and \noffer such an amendment. But let me unfurl the warning flag. As \nreported by the Appropriations Committee, this bill is\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nfully consistent with the 302(b) allocation provided to the Interior \nSubcommittee.\n  In short, in plain, simple, mountain language, that means there is no \nextra money on the table waiting to be spent--none, no extra money \nwaiting on the table, waiting to be spent.\n  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears: There is no extra \nmoney on the table. Any amendment proposing to increase spending in one \narea of the bill will have to be offset with a cut in some other area. \nAny Senator who wishes to add money may have to think whether or not he \nwants to take that money away from Conrad Burns or the minority leader \nor the majority leader or the humble slave, Robert C. Byrd.\n  With respect to offsets, let me add that Senator Burns and I, as \nmanagers of this bill, will generally oppose amendments which propose \nto cut the so-called travel and administrative expenses accounts.\n  The agencies funded in this bill have done a good job generally in \ntrimming these expenses to the bone, and unless Members are willing to \noffer real, honest to goodness programmatic cuts as a way to pay for \ntheir amendments, we will oppose all bogus offsets.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor. I have heard it said that \nsome Senators think we are working too hard in the Senate. Let the \nrecord show that a great stillness fell over the Chamber upon my saying \nthat. I have heard rumors that some Senators are concerned that we are \nworking too late, too long, too hard.\n  It is mortifying to hear such rumors. I can remember when for Easter \nSunday we were out on Friday and came back here on Monday. We didn't \nused to have so-called ``breaks.'' We were also in session Mondays \nthrough Fridays, and sometimes we were in on Saturdays.\n  God made the universe--all of creation, the beasts of the fields, the \nfowl of the air, fruits and herb yielding seed--and he made man, not in \n3 days. He didn't have a 3-day work week.\n  We have gotten used to 3-day workweeks here; come in late on Tuesday, \nvote late on Tuesday, vote on Wednesday, vote Thursday, and be out \nFriday, out Saturday, and out Sunday. God said keep the Sabbath day \nholy. But that is not why the Senate lets out on Sunday.\n  Let us not be stunned if we are asked to work a little later or a \nlittle longer. I would be happy to start voting on Monday and vote late \non Friday. I would just as soon be here as to be at home on Saturday \nmopping the floor.\n  Let some of these Senators learn how to mop the floor for their \nwives. Then they, too, will probably be married 64 years, as I have \nbeen. Mop the floor, keep the wrists and the fingers strong. There is \nno arthritis in my fingers. They tremble, but the bones are strong. The \nwrists are strong, You would be surprised how many men I can wrestle to \ntheir knees with these strong wrists. These strong wrists come from \nmopping the floors. Yes. I mop the bathroom. I mop the kitchen floor. I \nmop the utility room. I vacuum. I dust. It is good for me. It keeps me \nhumble. I even clean the commodes around my house. Things have changed \nin this country. It used to be that we ate on the inside of the house \nand went outside to the toilet. But anymore we eat on the outside of \nthe House and go inside to the toilet.\n  A Senator? Surely, a Senator wouldn't be concerned about working a \nlittle longer or a little later. We have become spoiled. It is all \nright for Senator Reid and me to become spoiled on Fathers' Day. But to \nsay that we don't want to vote on Mondays, and we don't want to vote on \nTuesdays until after the conference--we didn't even have weekly \nconferences here when I was majority whip. We Democrats didn't have \nconferences every Tuesday. We didn't need them.\n\n  But when I ran for the office of United States Senator for the eighth \nconsecutive 6-year term, I didn't say just sign me up for 3 days a \nweek. I didn't tell the majority leader when I was sworn in here, don't \ncount on me on any Fridays or Saturdays. I didn't say that.\n  I hope this is mere rumor that I hear that certain Senators have been \ncomplaining that they have been working too long, too late, too many \ndays a week. I hope the majority leader will keep us in late tonight. I \nhope he will keep us in late tomorrow night, if we don't finish this \nbill. I hope he will say we will be in Friday, and with votes, if we \ndon't finish this bill today. And if we aren't finished by Saturday, I \nhope the leader will say: Let's go at it, boys. We will be in Saturday.\n  But if there is a Senator who is complaining about working too hard, \nMr. Majority Whip, tell them where my office is. While we are on this \nbill, I am for working. I want to get this bill finished. We have 12 \nmore appropriations bills behind this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor today to offer any \namendment they may have and to allow us to conclude debate on this \nmeasure no later than tomorrow so I can be with Lady Byrd and my little \ndog, Billy Byrd. The bill and report have been available for more than \na week, and Senator Burns and I are here ready and willing to work with \nour colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank, at this time, my colleague, Mr. Burns, for \nhis steady hand and for the leadership he has demonstrated in the \nmarkup, in the hearings on the bill, and for his splendid cooperation, \nfor his always charitable attitude toward other Senators, and for his \nfairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia, the chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I am recommending that this body pass the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  I join my colleague in what he said in relation to folks who would \ncomplain about working too much. I come from an agricultural \nbackground. I was raised on a small farm in northwest Missouri. My dad \nalways had a little saying: When you look like a mule, you've got to \nwork like one. So I guess I have hired on for the duration.\n  We will get this bill completed. I was lucky enough to hold the \nchairmanship of this Interior Subcommittee earlier this year, and I \nmade it a priority to move this bill forward in a noncontroversial and \nbipartisan way. I was extremely pleased to learn, when the Senator from \nWest Virginia took control of the gavel, that he also shared this \nvision. He and his staff have been extremely gracious in dealing with \nall the requests before the subcommittee.\n  The bill up for consideration is a delicate balance of meeting our \nNation's needs while remaining fiscally responsible.\n  Not everyone will be happy with every portion of this bill--it has \nnever happened with this particular piece of legislation since I have \nbeen in the Senate for the last 12 years--but I can guarantee you, the \nbill is extremely fair. We had to make some tough choices, but I \nbelieve those who have worked with us to put this bill together will \nagree that the chairman has done an exemplary job in dealing with the \nresources we had available to us in the subcommittee.\n  The bill before us provides over $18.5 billion in budget authority. \nThis number is $343 million above the President's request; however, it \nis over $470 million less than has been requested by the House of \nRepresentatives and almost $420 million below last year's \nappropriations for the same activities.\n  The unprecedented and unsustainable increases of previous years have \nbeen checked, but we have still upheld our commitments as stewards to \nour public lands.\n  If time will allow, I would like to highlight some of the \naccomplishments in this bill.\n  The Bureau of Land Management receives a substantial increase in \nfunding to help address our Nation's energy needs while balancing these \nneeds with the ongoing maintenance necessary to keep our public lands \nhealthy.\n  Initiatives of which I am especially proud include an increase in \nexcess of $15 million over last year's level for energy and minerals \nmanagement to help address the current backlog in energy-related \npermitting, an increase above the budget request for noxious weed \nresearch, control, and outreach, and the highest funding level ever for \nthe payments in lieu of taxes account.\n  Let me tell you, I am especially thankful to our chairman. Noxious \nweeds is not a great--for the lack of another word--``sexy'' issue. \nWhen you\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nstart talking about things around Washington, DC, folks do not think a \nlot about weeds, but they are something that we deal with across this \nNation on a daily basis; and also payments in lieu of taxes, which \nmeans in the areas of counties that have a big preponderance of BLM \nland, they are paid, as if taxes will be collected on that land, by the \nGovernment. In other words, if the Federal Government has made the \nchoice they want to own that land, then they have to pay taxes like \neverybody else--county taxes--that go to support schools, public \nservices, roads, and other demands of local government.\n  Our commitment to the Nation's wild spaces is continued in the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service budget, which has received a $62 million \nincrease over last year's level. This level allows us to address \nhabitat needs while working with private landowners through brand new \ninitiatives such as the Landowner Incentive Program. These new \ninitiatives will allow us to focus on a new idea of working across \nland-ownership lines to do what is best to help the species and their \nneeds.\n  The National Park Service remains one of my top priorities. After \nall, I have two of the really crown jewels of the National Park System \nin my State: Yellowstone Park, of which part is in the State of our \nfriends to the south, in Wyoming, and Glacier National Park. It \nreceives an increase of almost $161 million above a year ago. This \nfunding helps address our crumbling infrastructure in our most \ntreasured public areas while increasing our assistance to States to \nprotect the areas that are high on their priority lists.\n  I am also pleased the bill provides $11 million for grants to \npreserve Civil War battlefields.\n  Also, within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, no other priority is \nhigher on my list than the education of our Native American children. \nWe have been able to continue our aggressive attack on the construction \nbacklog of schools in Indian country by providing funds to replace the \nnext six schools on the Bureau of Indian Affairs' replacement list. \nAgain, the chairman has done an admirable job in attempting to meet my \nrequest for a substantial increase in the operating funds available to \ntribally controlled community colleges. It remains one of my top \npriorities, and I hope to work with the chairman to increase the \nfunding level even further in future years.\n\n  We have seen great strides made, especially in the 2-year colleges on \nour reservations. In fact, the gentleman who operates one of the tribal \ncolleges in our State is probably one of the best educators I have ever \nknown, and the impact he has had on his people on that reservation has \nbeen tremendous.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that we have been able to match the \nPresident's request for trust reform and management issues. And there \nare many.\n  The Forest Service's largest initiative in recent years is the new \nInteragency Fire Plan. We have continued to support the efforts of the \nBureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to address the \ndangerous buildup of fuel in our national forests and adjacent lands.\n  Fire operations will continue to drain hundreds of millions of \ndollars again this year as we enter another historic fire year, but the \ninvestment in hazardous fuel reductions will pay off tenfold in future \nyears.\n  Last year was a devastating fire year in the West. We are still \nexperiencing drought in those areas. We can expect fires again this \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Energy received massive proposed \ncuts in this year's budget request. However, I believe the chairman has \nrestored these accounts in a very responsible manner. Working with the \nrest of the committee and me, he has focused the fossil energy accounts \ntoward technologies that will increase efficiency and the cleanliness \nof our aging power infrastructure, while addressing the negative \nimpacts of power generation.\n  We have started a new clean fuels initiative and increased our \nresearch in methods to control and capture greenhouse gases. The \nconservation accounts under the Department of Energy also receive \nsubstantial increases over last year, including an addition of over $60 \nmillion from last year's weatherization assistance, and large increases \nto make our buildings and transportation methods more efficient.\n  Finally, the conservation spending category created in last year's \nfinal appropriations negotiations has been retained, and the compromise \nof last year has been upheld both in the spirit and in the execution. \nThe bill contains $1.32 billion for the conservation spending category, \ncontinuing our focus on protecting our wild areas while taking care of \nour publicly owned facilities.\n  Clearly, a bill of this magnitude is difficult to craft, especially \nconsidering the volume of requests that we field in this subcommittee \nevery year and those with which we have to deal. I thank the chairman \nfor his willingness to address the requests of all Members to the best \nof his ability. I urge our colleagues to recognize his generosity and \ntake a hard look at the bottom line prior to attempting to amend this \nbill.\n  I also ask our colleagues to respect our collective request that \nlegislative riders be avoided so we can get this bill to the President \nas soon as possible.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nH.R. 2217, the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for \nFiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate provides $18.5 billion in nonemergency discretionary \nbudget authority including an advance appropriation into 2002 of $36 \nmillion, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $11.5 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $17.6 billion in 2002. \nOf that total, $1.32 billion in budget authority and $1.03 billion in \noutlays falls under the new cap for conservation spending. The \nremaining amount counts against the general purpose cap for \ndiscretionary spending. The Senate bill is within its Section 302(b) \nallocations for budget authority and outlays for both general purpose \nand conservation spending.\n  In addition, the Senate bill provides new emergency spending \nauthority of $235 million for wildland fire management, which will \nresult in outlays of $167 million. In accordance with standard budget \npractice, the budget committee will adjust the appropriations \ncommittee's allocation for emergency spending at the end of conference.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for their \nbipartisan effort in moving this and other appropriations bills \nquickly, in order to meet our responsibilities to maintain an effective \nfederal government. Their bill limits the use of the contentious \nlegislative riders that have hampered its predecessors, and provides \nvital funding to manage our nation's natural resources, to support \nbetter and more efficient use of our energy supplies, and to meet our \ncommitments to Native American tribes.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying \nthe budget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 H.R. 2217, INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES, 2002\n                      [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      General\n                                                                      purpose  Conservation  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.................................................   17,150       1,320            59   18,529\n  Outlays..........................................................   16,539       1,029            77   17,645\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority.................................................   17,151       1,376            59   18,586\n  Outlays..........................................................   16,626       1,030            77   17,733\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.................................................   17,621       1,320            59   19,000\n  Outlays..........................................................   16,726       1,031            77   17,834\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.................................................   16,857       1,226            59   18,142\n  Outlays..........................................................   16,396         823            77   17,296\n \n                 SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority.................................................

The Senate\n  Budget Committee increases the committee's 302(a) allocation for emergencies when a bill is reported out of\n  conference. Prepared by SBC Majority Staff, 7-10-01.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, around here it is easy for us to forget \npeople. I want the record to reflect what a good job Slade Gorton did \non this bill during the time he was the chairman of this subcommittee. \nSlade is not in the Senate anymore. The record should be spread with \nthe fact that he did an outstanding job when he was chairman of the \nsubcommittee.\n  He was always willing to listen to us. He held meetings and was very \ninclusive. I don't want to dwell on it other than to say that I have \nnot forgotten Slade Gorton and the good work he did on this bill. I am \nconfident that his successor, the Senator from Montana, will do just as \nwell.\n  I know as a Senator I learned a lot from Senator Gorton from the way \nhe handled things. I hope we will all remember Slade Gorton for his \ndedication to the Senate and the good work he did.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Democratic whip in \nrecalling Slade Gorton. Slade Gorton was an outstanding chairman of \nthis subcommittee. On many occasions, I lauded Slade Gorton's \nchairmanship. He was eminently fair, preeminently knowledgeable of the \nbill. In conferences, he knew everything that a Senator ought to know \nabout the projects and the items at issue between the two Houses. I \nhave never seen a subcommittee chairman who was better than Slade \nGorton when he was chairman of this subcommittee.\n  He was also very kind and good to me. I am glad the distinguished \nmajority whip has had the thoughtfulness to mention Slade Gorton today.\n  Along this line, let me say that on yesterday, and the day before, we \nworked hard to complete the supplemental appropriations bill. Senator \nStevens is the former chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate, about whom I have no hesitancy in saying, he was the best \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee that I have seen in my 43 \nyears in the Senate, including Robert Byrd. I have no hesitancy, not a \nbit, in lauding a Republican. I have no hesitancy in saying, ``He is a \nbetter man than I am, Gunga Din.''\n  I have seen some great chairmen of this committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee. Senator Russell, to me, was the finest Senator, the best \nSenator with whom I have ever served in my 43 years in the Senate. He \nwas chairman of the Appropriations Committee at one time. There have \nbeen other great Senators, such as Senator Stennis of Mississippi. He \nwas always courteous, always the gentleman. Then there was Senator Mark \nHatfield.\n  But times have changed and chairmen have to change in accordance with \nthe times and the circumstances. So in our time, in our day, Ted \nStevens is the best. I don't mind thinking I might have been second. \nBut I won't dare say that. It is a bit like Publius Cornelius Scipio \nAfricanus Major, who defeated Hannibal in the Battle of Zama in 202 \nB.C. He met Hannibal at Ephesus, and they walked together upon one \noccasion and he asked Hannibal, ``Who was the greatest general?'' \nHannibal thought for a moment, and then he said, ``Pyrrhus the Greek \nfrom Epirus was the greatest. The second was Alexander. The third was \nI, Hannibal.'' Whereupon, Scipio Africanus Major asked, ``Where would \nyou have placed yourself if I had not defeated you at Zama?'' Hannibal \nthought for a moment, and then said, ``I would have been first.''\n  I did have the good fortune to chair this committee for 6 years. But \nTed Stevens I salute. He is a Republican, yes, but a great one, a fine \ngentleman, a gentleman always, somebody who keeps his word. And he \ndoesn't put politics at the apex of all things that matter. Well, with \nhis assistance and his leadership, on yesterday we passed the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The President requested $6.5 billion \nand that bill did not exceed that request one thin dime.\n  The Senators' amendments were offset. The amendments that Senators \noffered and were considered, if they were adopted, if they had to do \nwith money, were offset. Senators had offsets--meaningful offsets, not \n``waste, fraud and abuse.'' There is no doubt but that there is some \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the budget in every department, I would say, \nin this Government. But we don't offset with false offsets. We had \neverything appropriately offset.\n  There wasn't a single amendment designated as an ``emergency'' in \nthis Senate. The President had complained about the use of \n``emergencies.'' Mr. Stevens and I believe there is a time and place \nfor emergencies, yes, but there is no question but that the designation \nof ``emergency'' has been overdone in both Houses. And in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that passed the House, there are $473 \nmillion in emergencies. Not $1 in the bill that passed the Senate was \ndesignated as an emergency.\n  Where is the President going to stand on this when the bill goes to \nconference? I hope he will let us know. What is his position going to \nbe with regard to the emergencies that were in the Republican-\ncontrolled House bill? The first question that was ever asked in the \nhistory of the human race was, when God entered the Garden of Eden in \nthe shadow of the evening, in the cool of the day, and he started \nlooking for Adam. Adam had hidden himself, and God said: ``Adam, where \nart thou?'' That was the first question ever asked in the history of \nmankind. ``Adam, where art thou?''\n  So, if I might, in my small way as a direct descendent of Adam, let \nme ask the question of the President: Mr. President, where art thou in \nregard to the $473 million in emergencies that are contained in the \nHouse-passed bill? Let us know, Mr. President, where art thou? If I get \na chance to ask the President, I am going to say: Mr. President, where \nart thou with respect to the $473 million that was added as emergencies \nin the House bill? Where art thou? Let us know. We would like to know.\n  In any event, that is the kind of bill we passed in this Senate. No \nemergencies, not one Indianhead copper penny above the President's \nrequest, not one! Mr. Stevens and I had cooperation of the Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. I could not resist the opportunity to say that \nwithout Ted Stevens and his help, his assistance, his leadership on \nthat bill, the cooperation of Senators and staff on both sides, the \nhelp of our distinguished Democratic whip, and our leaders, we could \nnot have accomplished that. So I take this opportunity to compliment \nour colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 877\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 877.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 152, line 4, strike ``$17,181,000'' and insert \n     ``$72,640,000''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the amendment and that it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 877) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Burns and I are here. We are at our \nposts of duty. We are ready to entertain any requests for an amendment \nby any Senator. The clock is running.\n  Mr. BURNS. We are open for business.\n  Mr. BYRD. The sign is out: Open for business. Senator Burns and I \njoin in urging the leadership and all Senators to let us know of any \namendments Senators intend to offer by no later than 4 p.m. today, and \nit will be my hope that at 4 p.m. we can close out the window for \namendments. I hope all Senators within the sound of my voice and all \nstaffs within the reach of our joint voice will be alerted to the fact \nthat when the clock strikes 4 this afternoon, we expect to close out \nthe window on all amendments.\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely; gladly.\n  Mr. REID. As directed by the two managers of this bill, we have asked \nboth Cloakrooms to clear their request: that there be a filing of \namendments by 4 o'clock today, which gives people ample time, many \nhours. It was announced even prior to the break that the Interior bill \nwould be the first bill brought up, and we even indicated when it would \nbe brought up. So I hope we can get this cleared right away.\n\n  I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Montana, who has done \nsuch a good job in getting this bill to this point, the holdup now is \non that side. Maybe if we go into a quorum call Senator Burns will be \ngracious enough to see if he can move this along. Until that happens, \nmy experience is this bill is in a flounder.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished whip.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my hope that we can do this by 4 \no'clock this afternoon. There is no need for us to dillydally around \nhere when we have other things to do. I only have one thing I have to \ndo at 2 o'clock this afternoon. I have to introduce a couple of judges \nwho have been nominated to the Montana district court system. By the \ntime I get that done, 4 o'clock should be our cutoff.\n  We should be talking about amendments right now. There is no reason \nwhy we cannot move this bill to final conclusion tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. I believe the Senator from West Virginia still has the \nfloor, if I can make another comment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. It is my thought, if the two managers agree, that at 12:30 \np.m., if there is still a problem with hotlining, a unanimous consent \nrequest be made and if anybody objects to it, they are going to have to \ncome here in person to object to it. That is my suggestion. On a bill \nas important as this, we need to have the Senators, not the staff \nlurking in some of these rooms around the Capitol complex making \nobjections for their Senators.\n  After we go into a quorum call, upon consulting with the two \nmanagers, I make the suggestion that perhaps that is what we should do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, the majority whip, for his suggestion. I like it. We have just \nheard Senator Burns voice his opinion.\n  Mr. BURNS. We will do everything we can to get that taken care of. We \ndo not want to close anybody out either, understanding the sensitivity \nof that. I believe we have made a reasonable request. I thank the \nchairman.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the conduct of preleasing, \n leasing, and related activities within national monuments established \n                     under the Act of June 8, 1906)\n\n       On page 194, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1   . PRELEASING, LEASING, AND RELATED ACTIVITIES.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to conduct any preleasing, leasing, or other related activity \n     under the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundary (in effect as of January 20, 2001) of a \n     national monument established under the Act of June 8, 1906 \n     (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.), except to the extent that such a \n     preleasing, leasing, or other related activity is allowed \n     under the Presidential proclamation establishing the \n     monument.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I note that the Republican ranking \nmember is not on the floor at this time. I will proceed and, of course, \nafford all opportunity for him for comment or rebuttal or perhaps a \nspeech in support of my amendment. I want to make sure I extend that \ncourtesy to him since he is not currently in the Chamber.\n  The amendment I bring before us today is one that is very \nstraightforward. I suppose I could have had it read, and it would have \nmade it very clear what I am setting out to do. It basically will \nprohibit any preleasing or other related activity within the boundaries \nof a national monument.\n  What it boils down to is, there are certain lands in the United \nStates which have been designated as important national treasures. We \ncall them national monuments. Virtually every President in the last \ncentury, save three, decided to designate certain areas of land in \nAmerica that were so important they wanted to preserve them so that \nfuture generations could enjoy the bounty which God has left us.\n  There are those, of course, who see that land not as a great treasure \nto be valued but as a resource to be used. The purpose of my amendment \nis to stop oil and gas drilling on national monuments across the United \nStates.\n  We owe the existence of many of America's natural treasures to \npioneers of yesterday. Their appreciation of our rugged, untamed new \ncountry gave them the foresight to preserve many of our natural \nresources and public lands for future generations to enjoy.\n  Theodore Roosevelt was one such pioneer. In 1906, he established \nDevils Tower in Wyoming, the first national monument.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\n  Right outside this Chamber in the hallway is one of the most \nremarkable busts of a former Vice President--the bust of Theodore \nRoosevelt. Every time I walk by it, I can just feel the life in that \npiece of stone. He has his jaw stuck out as if he is ready to take on \nthe world. I can imagine in 1906 when Teddy Roosevelt said to a lot of \npeople in this country: You know what. We have resources in this \ncountry that are worth fighting for and worth preserving, and we are \ngoing to do it. There were probably people standing on the sideline \nsaying that Teddy Roosevelt was crazy, that he certainly did not want \nto set aside land that might have had great value to our future. Yet he \ndid it. Not only did he do it; he established a standard that President \nafter President followed.\n  The Republican Party, of which Theodore Roosevelt was a proud member \nat one time, certainly was that party of preservation and conservation. \nIt set a standard that the Democratic Party followed, and I am glad \nthey did. It was a bipartisan idea. These are treasures that don't know \nthe difference between parties, the treasurers which our children and \nfuture generations should enjoy. Roosevelt said this at one point, and \nhis words I think tell the story: ``We must ask ourselves if we are \nleaving for future generations an environment that is as good or better \nthan what we found.''\n  That is simple. That inspired him in 1906 to create the first \nnational monument at Devils Tower, WY. Unfortunately, not every \nPresident has been inspired by Teddy Roosevelt. Sadly, I come to the \nfloor today because of threats by this new administration in Washington \nto at least consider the option of drilling for oil and gas in these \nnational monuments across the United States.\n  Some leaders in Washington lack the foresight of our Founding Fathers \nand pioneers. They hide today behind the shield of an ``energy \ncrisis''--an energy crisis, which they believe means that we have to \nchange all the rules, saying we can no longer keep this land at least \nprotected so future generations can enjoy it. They say because of our \nneed for energy we have to break a lot of rules; we have to start \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; we have to start \ndrilling in the national monuments; we have to start looking for oil \nand gas in places that a lot of Americans honestly believed we had \ndeclared off limits.\n  President Bush and Interior Secretary Gale Norton have publicly \nstated they believe that some of our national monuments would be good \nplaces for oil and gas drilling or coal mining. Oddly, the monuments \nbeing targeted have one thing in common: Every single one was \ndesignated by one President, President William Jefferson Clinton. So \nwhen they look at monuments across the United States that they want to \ngo drilling on, they have only picked one group--those designated by \nPresident Clinton.\n  President Bush needs to realize that damaging these irreplaceable \nlands is not going to solve America's energy crisis, but it could cause \na crisis in conservation. Americans are rightfully concerned about \nenergy security. But I don't think that most Americans believe that we \nare in such dire straits that we should invite the big oil and gas \nproducers into these protected lands.\n  My amendment would simply prohibit new mineral leases from being \nissued in designated national monuments. My amendment does not affect \nany valid existing rights or prevent leasing in any area that was \nauthorized for mineral activity when the monument was established. I \nwant to make that point clear. Some will come before us and say: You \nare going to shut down oil and gas drilling and mining in these \nmonuments, and it has been going on for years. If it took place before, \nif it is existing, if it has been approved, this amendment has no \nimpact whatsoever. But it is the new drilling, the new mining, this new \nexploration in these national monuments that would be prohibited by \nthis amendment.\n\n  When a President issues a proclamation designating a national \nmonument, it is not unusual for existing rights to drill to be \nmaintained. The real intent of this amendment is to preserve the \nexisting boundaries of monuments so this administration can't shrink \nthem to make even more lands available for energy exploration.\n  Since 1906--the day of Teddy Roosevelt that I noted earlier--14 of \nthe next 17 Presidents of the United States, Democrat and Republican \nalike, unapologetically and proudly designated national monuments under \nthe Antiquities Act, for a total of 118 national monuments. Only three \nPresidents in the 20th century did not designate national monument \nterritory--Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and the elder George Bush.\n  People say, well, I have heard of national parks and national \nforests. What is a national monument? Half of our national parks \nstarted out as national monuments. Let me tell you what they include. \nThe Grand Canyon was designated as a national monument; Glacier Bay; \nZion; and Acadia National Park. The national monument is the first \ndesignation of a piece of land in America that can have lasting values \nas part of our national heritage. Can you imagine, for a moment, if \nthose who preceded us did not have the foresight to protect those \nlands, what America would have given up not to have these resources \navailable, so that families of today and tomorrow can take their \nchildren and look out at that magnificent expanse of the Grand Canyon \nand stand in awe and wonder of God's creation? Thank God, someone had \nthe foresight to think ahead and believe it was worth designating that, \nfirst, as a national monument and then as a national park, to be \nprotected.\n  This amendment is addressing a new mindset that says when it comes to \ntoday's national monuments, it is a different story; they are up for \ngrabs. We are involved in an energy crisis. People can drill for oil \nand gas on these new monuments designated by President Clinton. That is \nso shortsighted. It loses vision when it comes to what our country is \nall about and should be all about.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has the responsibility of managing \npublic lands across the United States, and we have thousands and \nthousands of acres. I see Senator Harry Reid from Nevada is here. I \ndon't know what percentage of his home State is Federal land----\n  Mr. REID. It is 87 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is 87 percent. Many Western States have similar \npercentages of Federal land within their boundaries. In the earliest \ndays of our country, of course, there wasn't a great hue and cry to \nhave private ownership in this land. The Federal Government owned it, \nand some of it may never have any real practical value when it comes to \nresidential or commercial development. But the Federal Government took \nthe responsibility under an agency known as the Bureau of Land \nManagement. This is kind of the landlord for America's public lands. \nThe Bureau of Land Management has determined that 95 percent of the \nlands they manage across the United States are already available for \noil and gas leasing. So if you hear an argument from the other side \nthat we now have to go and drill into the national monument lands \nbecause we have nowhere else to look for oil and gas and precious \nminerals, that is just not the fact. Ninety-five percent of the Federal \nlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management are already available \nfor oil and gas leasing.\n\n  Instead of hopping onto the drilling bandwagon, we should first focus \non energy exploration in existing areas before we turn to these \nprecious national monuments. I am afraid that the President and many of \nthe people in the energy industry talk about oil and gas development as \nthough it were the cure for all of our energy woes in America--drill \nand burn, drill and burn, drill and burn. There is much more to the \nchallenge that faces our Nation.\n  The President has to acknowledge that the longstanding supply and \ndemand and balance in the United States will not be solved overnight, \nand it won't be solved with 19th and 20th century thinking. Our Nation \nconsumes 9.1 million barrels of oil a day. We import about half of \nthat--more than half, frankly. Oil production from Federal lands--all \nFederal lands--supplies about 10 percent of our total oil needs. This \nisn't enough to bring U.S. energy independence or significantly meet \nthe U.S. demand. It is interesting that the Wilderness Society----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. First, I ask the Senator to list me as a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that that be the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, is the Senator aware that the U.S. \nGeological Survey has estimated that the reserves within the 15 \nnational monuments designated since 1996 would produce 15 days' worth \nof oil and 7 days' worth of natural gas for our country? Is the Senator \naware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is right. Those are the numbers I was about \nto quote.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to have the Senator add that to the debate. \nFrankly, if we are talking about energy needs in America and drilling \nin places we never would have considered drilling before, whether in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or national monuments, certainly \nsomeone has to make a compelling argument there is so much energy there \nthat America cannot turn its back. The statistics the Senator from \nNevada has quoted and an analysis by the Wilderness Society come to the \nsame conclusion.\n  The total economically recoverable oil from the monuments that I \nprotect in this amendment is the equivalent of 15 days, 12 hours, 28 \nminutes' worth of energy for the United States. Economically \nrecoverable gas, as a portion of total U.S. consumption, is 7 days, 2 \nhours, 11 minutes.\n  What would we give up for that small opportunity to bring that much \nenergy into the picture in the United States? Frankly, we would be \ndrilling in areas which have been designated as special and important \ntreasures that the United States should preserve.\n  I am glad we are having this national debate about energy \nconservation and energy efficiency. It is important that we have it, \nbut it is also important that we do not believe the answer to all of \nour energy problems is to find new places to drill.\n  Just last week I joined my colleagues, Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois \nand Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, at a press conference on the \nbanks of Lake Michigan on a rainy Tuesday before the Fourth of July. As \nhard as it is to believe, there is one Governor of a State adjoining \nLake Michigan who now believes we should drill for oil and gas in Lake \nMichigan and the Great Lakes. There are those of us who think that, \ntoo, is a rash judgment and one we can come to regret.\n  A lot of people say: It would only be a small little derrick or a \nsmall drill out there. I had the experience, I guess it has been over \n15 years ago or close to it, of going up to Alaska after the Exxon \nValdez spill. Exxon Valdez, if I remember correctly, was about the size \nof three football fields. It was a long vessel. When it ran ashore and \nwhen its tanks and all its crude oil spread out across the area, it \ndevastated wildlife and left contamination for decades to come.\n  When we talk about drilling for oil and gas, we have to be careful \nthat we do it in a responsible environmental way so that we do not run \nthe risk of contamination or ruination of important national treasures, \nsuch as the Great Lakes, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or the \nnational monuments designated by President Clinton.\n  As we can see from the situation in California, energy conservation \ndoes work. When they saw the high prices, they reduced their \nconsumption by over 11 percent in a short period of time. It is a \nlesson to all of us. We can all do better, every single one of us. \nBefore we start drilling into these pristine areas, should we not have \na national policy that talks about sustainable, renewable fuels and \nenergy conservation?\n  I am afraid this administration focuses on drilling and drilling and \ndrilling, and that just is not the answer to all of our challenges.\n  This land is protected as national monuments because we realize all \nof the Nation's public landscapes are not appropriate for oil and gas \ndrilling. These lands have intrinsic value. Just because there may be \nsome energy there, even if it is very limited, does not mean we need to \ndrill for it and run the risk of contamination and ruining these great \nnational treasures.\n\n  The national monuments belong to the American people. The Government \nhas agreed to hold these lands in trust for our generation and future \ngenerations to appreciate. The President of the United States, as a \nsuccessor to George Washington, as a successor to previous Presidents, \nwas given the responsibility of protecting these lands--first and \nforemost, protect our national natural heritage--not destroy them.\n  This energy crisis should not be used as an excuse for us to do \nthings we will rue in the days and years to come. Exploiting our \nnational monuments for a tiny bit of mineral resources will not ease \nenergy prices today, tomorrow, or even next year.\n  Let's not be misguided. Let's focus the energy debate on responsible \nenergy development, renewable energy, efficiency, and conservation \nefforts. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I leave my colleagues with this quote, again from Theodore Roosevelt \nwhose words still ring true today:\n\n       Conservation means development as much as it does \n     protection. I recognize the right hand duty of this \n     generation to develop and use the natural resources of our \n     land, but I do not recognize the right to waste them or to \n     rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I oppose this amendment. It seems we want \nto make a blanket assertion on what we should do with our monuments. We \nhave to remind ourselves that we are energy deficient.\n  As for Montana, where there was a national monument created, there \nare 77,000 acres of privately held land. Even the former Secretary of \nthe Interior, Bruce Babbitt, recommended that oil and gas production in \nthat area should be sustained.\n  There was a public process. The resource advisory committees in each \nof these areas made the same recommendation: Gas and oil production \ncould be sustained without harming the land in that national monument.\n  These areas have also been studied. They have been studied by \ndifferent committees whose members live in the area. They understand \nthat land and the recommendations that were made.\n  We in Montana want to contribute something to the energy situation in \nthis country. So far, no one has come up with any solid replacement to \noil and gas production for transportation or power generation fuels.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise today to support the Durbin amendment that \nwill protect our national monuments from energy exploration. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of this important amendment, and I thank \nSenator Durbin from Illinois for his work and tremendous efforts on \nbehalf of our national heritage and our national monuments.\n  The truth is, we should not need an amendment to protect our \ncountry's national monuments from energy exploration. These unique \nlandscapes, including the Hanford Reach National Monument in my home \nState of Washington, were designated as national monuments because they \nare important in their own right and they deserve to be protected.\n  We should not need an additional amendment to keep oil derricks out \nof these lands, but unfortunately that is where we find ourselves \ntoday. The Bush administration has proposed exploring for energy even \nin our national monuments.\n  When I go home every weekend and talk to my friends and neighbors and \ngo to the grocery store, my constituents come up to me and ask: Is \nnothing sacred anymore? Drilling in our national monuments is just \nwrong. This amendment says the Federal Government should not promote \nenergy exploration on our most precious lands, on our heritage.\n\n  I recognize the need to find new sources of energy. The Federal \nGovernment has always actively promoted the extraction of new energy \nresources. This can and will continue. During the Clinton \nadministration, thousands of new drilling permits were actually issued \nfor Federal lands. Since the early 1980s, the projection of natural\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\ngas on Federal lands has been increasing steadily. Efforts to find \nenergy on our Federal lands must continue. But attempts to find energy \nin our national monuments must never begin.\n  Today, 95 percent of Bureau of Land Management lands in the Western \nStates are open to coal, oil, and gas leasing. We do not need to open \nup our national monuments, as well. I realize this is a challenging \ntime because we are facing an energy crisis. In my home State of \nWashington, we are experiencing dramatic rate increases because of the \nmany factors involved, including a drought and too little energy \nproduction and a spike in gas prices.\n  Thousands of my constituents are out of work because of high energy \ncosts. No one needs to tell anyone in Washington State we have to \nincrease energy production. We know we need to increase capacity and \nthat is what we are doing. We are working to site new generation \ncapacity. On the Oregon and Washington border, we are constructing the \ncountry's largest wind farm. We have natural gas plants going up. We \nhave a proposal for a coal-fired plant. We are upgrading our \ntransmission system to deliver new generation supplies.\n  We know what we need to do and we are taking action. But we know we \ndon't need to drill for natural gas in our national monuments.\n  The Hanford Reach National Monument is a national treasure. It \nincludes the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River. It is the \nmost productive spawning ground for threatened salmon in the entire \nColumbia River Basin. It is home to threatened sage grouse and 2 plant \nand 40 insect species that are brand-new to science.\n  The monument also includes and borders important historic and \ncultural features. The area is rich in important Native American, early \npioneer, and nuclear production history. The Hanford Reach National \nMonument may be the most unique monument in the entire country.\n  I have heard some people suggest that the national monument \ndesignations made by President Clinton were made too quickly, without \npublic involvement, and without consideration of energy production \nvalues. That is simply not true. I have been working since my first \nyear in the Senate, 9 years ago, to protect the Hanford Reach. I \nintroduced legislation in the previous three Congresses to protect that \narea. We held numerous public meetings, we got lots of local input from \nlocal leaders, local folk, and we debated a lot of different proposals.\n  The administration had 8 years of knowledge developed by the \nconsideration of various protection proposals. The plans considered \nirrigation, farming, and the potential for gas outside the monument's \nboundaries. The plan considered commercial development of lands by \nports and cities. In fact, the final designation even included a \nprovision ensuring a new right-of-way for energy transmission lines to \ngo across the Hanford Reach. All of those considerations helped define \nthe final boundaries of that national monument. So for some to suggest \nnow that we never thought about our future energy needs is just plain \nwrong.\n\n  In the end, the final decision was that the ecological and historical \nvalues of the Hanford Reach merited protection as a national monument. \nWe knew what we were doing by that designation. We knew we were \nchoosing to protect the unique and vital habitats. We knew we were \nhonoring important cultural sites, and we intended to leave this legacy \nto future generations.\n  Protecting certain areas for generations to come is an admirable \ngoal. These designations were made after full consideration. This \nCongress should not now in any way undermine those legacies in favor of \nthe energy industry. We should not have to fight back these attacks on \nour very limited protected lands.\n  I believe we should preserve these ecological and historic treasures \nfor future generations. These lands belong to all of us. We are \nresponsible for protecting them. That is why the Durbin amendment is so \nimportant. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to support also the \namendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. I am proud \nto join him in this effort and to be an original cosponsor of his \namendment.\n  My colleague from Illinois seeks to make certain that amendment \nlanguage offered by the Congressman from West Virginia, Mr. Rahall, \nwhich would prohibit drilling for oil and gas and mining in our \nnational monuments is included in the Senate bill. The Rahall amendment \npassed the House overwhelmingly by a vote of 242-173.\n  Madam President, I support this amendment because I believe that to \nnot speak loudly against the Bush administration's proposals to re-open \nmany of these monuments under the guise of our present energy concerns \nis a dereliction of responsibility for this body and this Senator.\n  It is the responsibility of this body to review areas designated as \nnational monuments to determine whether or not additional designations \nshould be conferred--such as creating a national park or a wilderness \narea out of lands administratively protected as a monument.\n  Presidents have designated about 120 national monuments, totaling \nmore than 70 million acres, and given that Congress has done its \nreview, most of this acreage is no longer in monument status. For \ninstance, Grand Canyon National Park initially was proclaimed a \nnational monument but was converted by Congress into a national park.\n  Congress should responsibly exercise its authority, and be clear \nabout its intent, which this amendment does. This amendment prohibits \nthe administration from proceeding with drilling for oil and gas and \nmining in our national monuments. This amendment will prevent these \nactivities which are incompatible with many of the federal land use \ndesignations Congress might confer until we truly examine these areas. \nMonument designations create expectations on behalf of our \nconstituents, Madam President, that these areas are protected and we \nshould work to make certain that is so.\n\n  I am aware that Presidential establishment of national monuments \nunder the Antiquities Act of 1906 has protected valuable sites but also \nhas been contentious. President Clinton used his authority 22 times to \nproclaim 19 new monuments and to enlarge 3 others. The monuments were \ndesignated during his last year in office, with one exception, and I \nwill speak about that exception in greater detail. President Clinton's \n19 new and 3 enlarged monuments comprise 5.9 million Federal acres. \nOnly President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used his authority more \noften--28 times--and only President Jimmy Carter created more monument \nacreage--56 million acres in Alaska.\n  The monument actions, regardless of one's position on them, were \nneeded because Congress had not acted quickly enough to protect these \nFederal lands. The best response to concerns about the monument process \nis to support my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and not allow \nmodifications to the monuments that some perceive were created unfairly \nto be made in an equally concerning fashion.\n  My constituents do not support expansion of oil and gas drilling and \nmining in lands designated by Presidential declaration as national \nmonuments. I personally know the value of wild areas, and the threats \nthat mineral, coal and oil and gas exploration pose. Though I have not \nbeen to all the monuments designated by President Clinton, I have hiked \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, an area that the \nSenator from Illinois and I believe should be designated as wilderness.\n  I hiked down a 65-degree slope to Upper Calf Creek Falls in the Grand \nStaircase. It was a challenging and spectacular trip. Calf Creek \nmeanders along a shallow valley with several deep clear pools before \nthe upper falls, where the creek drops 88 feet over a cliff face at the \nhead of Calf Creek Canyon. This deepens gradually for 2.5 miles south \nthen doubles in size below the 126-foot lower falls. The path to the \nfalls is down a steep slope of white slickrock marked by cairns of \ndark, volcanic pebbles then across flatter sandy ground to the canyon \nedge, with a total elevation loss of almost 600 feet. My experience is \nthat this monument is a spectacular place and one with now tremendous \nrecreational value and use. I should be preserved that way.\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n  I use my Upper Calf Creek trip as an example of why the Senator's \namendment is needed. We should be preserving our options with these \nlands, not opening them for development. I support this amendment and \nurge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if any Senators are here to speak in \nopposition. If there are, I will yield to them. I would like to speak \nand close debate, but I want to make certain the other side has ample \nopportunity to express its point of view.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask the Senator from Illinois, as I understand it, the \namendment prevent any further drilling, or does it bar all drilling, \neven though there are rights there in the first place?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The amendment clearly states if there is existing \ndrilling, existing rights, it does not in any way infringe upon those. \nIt is a question of new drilling, new leasing in these areas.\n  Mr. BURNS. If that resource is there and it can be done in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way, why is that bad or wrong?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Montana, I don't believe either \nof us would consider drilling on the Capital Mall or perhaps in the \nGrand Canyon or near it. There are certain things where we draw the \nline and say we know there may be energy resources, but if we are so \ndesperate in this country that we have to reach that point, we have \ngone too far.\n  I think when you look at the estimated resources available in these \nmonuments, they are so minuscule in terms of our national energy \npicture, many of us believe it is far better to say to future \ngenerations: Listen, we found another way to find energy, to conserve \nenergy. We didn't spoil something that future generations will \ntreasure.\n  Mr. BURNS. We had the Secretary of the Interior up in Montana. In the \nupper Missouri, which was designated as a national monument, I tell my \ngood friend from Illinois, we asked the Secretary, No. 1, to find the \ngas well and then find the pipeline that carried the gas from the \nwellhead into the main pipeline. He could not find it. He could not \nfind either one of them--he tried by air and by land--until we showed \nhim where they were.\n  What I am saying is we should consider the new technologies and how \nwe regard our lands, especially the big open lands. I am not talking \nabout a monument such as The Mall; I am talking about land that is in \nbigger country that is very seldom ever walked upon by the people who \nprobably own the grazing lease. We still allow grazing in national \nmonuments. Very seldom are those lands ever walked on by anybody else.\n  We have an area in Montana that is going to demand some more \nattention in the next 2 or 3 years because it is along the Missouri \nRiver and that was the route of Louis and Clark. Of course, this will \nbe the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase, and the trek of \nLouis and Clark will draw a little more attention to that area.\n  But tell me why we would completely close out the possibility, even \nunder emergency conditions, in areas where we could develop that \nenergy--and especially natural gas, which is the cleanest of all energy \nthat is coming from the fossil fuels we take from the Earth--why we \nwould close out that possibility.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say this to the Senator from Montana, whom I respect. \nWe come at this with a different attitude towards national monuments \nand national lands. I think we do have a genuine difference of opinion. \nI am aware, and I am sure my colleague is, too, that 95 percent of the \nFederal public lands under the management of the Bureau of Land \nManagement are currently open for oil and gas drilling. I do believe it \nis not unreasonable to say that 5 percent of the Federal lands that we \nown are so important to our national heritage that we are not going to \ngo in and drill.\n  No matter whether you can sneak in there and come out again and folks \nsay, ``We were not even sure they were there,'' every time you do that \nyou run a risk--I am sure the Senator from Montana knows that--that it \nwill not be as clean an operation as you want it to be. You run a risk \nyou will change an ecological balance in an area that has been the same \nfor centuries.\n  I think it is not unreasonable for us to say, as we do in our normal \nlives, there are certain places that are treated differently than \nothers. We treat our churches a little differently than we treat our \nshopping malls. We just view them differently. I think when it comes to \nour national treasures, our national monuments, it is not unreasonable \nto say these are areas which will be treated differently.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I tell my good friend, it is that kind of mind-set that \nsaid we are going to save the suckerfish in Klamath Falls, OR, and it \ntakes precedence over 1,500 families and their future and our ability \nto provide food and fiber for this country. It is a trash fish. That is \ngoing on right now in that basin.\n  That is what I am saying. When we take a look at what our attitude is \nabout a certain thing and hide behind the screen of green and throw out \nall logic on the management of those lands, then we may have to \nreassess how we look at all lands, even those that exist in the State \nof Illinois. That is what I am saying. It is something that creeps into \nthe mind-set, that it is all right to disrupt our lives and our \nfamilies--even though we do it right and in an environmentally \nsensitive manner--because of a mind-set. I think that is where we have \na basic philosophical difference on how we manage land.\n  I look at it much differently. I know you come from down there not \ntoo far from where I was raised. I was raised in Missouri. I never \nthought about water rights until I went west, where there wasn't any. \nThere wasn't any water. Those things become very important. But they \nnever entered our life when I lived in the lower Midwest.\n  I just think it is a mistake whenever we close up an area because of \na mind-set that we cannot do it right and we here in Washington, DC, \nare basically in a better position to make the decision, more than \nhaving the decision made locally. Even the Senator from Washington says \nwe had local input. We did the boundaries originally. We looked at the \nland that was sensitive, and we set it aside.\n  I agree with that. There are areas in the Missouri Breaks that I \nthink should be set aside and even made wilderness. The river is \nalready a protected river. I agree with that.\n  But whenever you take one broad swipe across a huge amount of land, \nespecially when you have 77,000 acres of in-holdings and you have to \ncross public lands just to get to them, then we make a decision here \nthat impacts people's lives in a real way. Those people have faces. \nThat is why I oppose this amendment. I am not calling for the repeal of \nthe Antiquities Act. What I am saying is we are impacting our own \nNation's ability to produce food and fiber and energy because of a \nmind-set that sounds warm, green, and fuzzy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Montana. I know his opinions are \nheartfelt. He and I have talked about this on the floor on previous \noccasions. But I hope we can put this in some perspective.\n  America is a great nation. God has blessed us with resources that \nmany nations around the world envy. Fortunately, leaders in this \ncountry with foresight decided long ago that there were certain \ntreasures, national treasures in America, that needed to be protected \nand preserved.\n  Mark my words, when they made those suggestions they were not always \npopular. There were people who had ideas that something else could be \ndone with that national park or that national monument. But those \nleaders stood their ground and said: We can find other ways to provide \nfor the occupations and professions of people living in these States. \nWe can find other sources of energy. We do not have to spoil a national \nasset, part of our national heritage that we can never, ever again \nreclaim.\n  The Senator from Montana talked about national monuments, and, I \nguess, the energy potential that they offer to the United States. Here \nis a summary from the U.S. Geological Service about the economically \nrecoverable oil and gas from national monuments.\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n  I might remind those following the debate that it is now President \nBush who wants to initiate new drilling for oil and gas in national \nmonuments--protected lands set aside by the previous administration to \nbe preserved for future generations. This President wants to let the \noil and gas companies come in and drill on these lands.\n  When the Senator from Montana talked about trash fish, I can't argue \nthe story. I don't know that side. This is not trash. This is a \nnational monument. This is a beautiful span of land set aside for \nfuture generations by the previous President.\n  Picture, if you will, in this rare piece of real estate in America, \noil and gas drilling. Have we reached that point? This is not trash. \nThis is a treasure. We shouldn't take it lightly when it comes to oil \nand gas drilling in America's treasures.\n  Let me give you an example of some of the national monuments and what \nthe geological survey estimates is available there if we follow \nPresident Bush's recommendation to go ahead and keep drilling; let's \nfind new areas for oil and gas drilling in these national monuments.\n  In the Upper Missouri River Breaks in Montana, which the Senator from \nMontana made reference to earlier, the economically recoverable oil \nfrom that entire national monument is the equivalent of one hour's \nworth of gas consumption in the United States.\n  I didn't take those numbers because the Senator mentioned his own \nState but just to put this in some perspective.\n  We are going to go drilling in these national monuments to try to \nrecover one hour's worth of energy for our country. And what do we \nleave behind? If we are lucky, not much--maybe a few footprints in the \nsoil. But we can never be certain that we haven't spoiled or changed \nthat forever.\n  All of the economically recoverable oil from all of the national \nmonuments--where President Bush now wants to go drill--is the \nequivalent of 15 days, 12 hours, and 28 minutes of America's energy \nconsumption. All of the economically recoverable gas as a portion of \nthe total U.S. consumption from these monuments where the President now \nwants to go drilling is the equivalent of 7 days, 2 hours, and 11 \nminutes' worth of America's energy.\n  I listened to the news this morning. I hear there is a bill over in \nthe House of Representatives on energy, and they are talking about \nperhaps for the first time that we are going to start establishing \nfuel-efficient standards for SUVs and trucks in this country. That is \nnot radical thinking. I think it is sensible. I voted for it in the \nSenate. Just a little bit of energy conservation and a little bit of \nfuel efficiency makes this debate totally meaningless. With just a \nlittle change in Detroit we can save more oil than we can possibly \nderive from monuments. But the oil and gas companies want to get in \nthere, and they want to make a profit. They have put these national \ntreasures in the United States on the altar of greed and profit and the \nbottom line. That is just plain wrong.\n  I don't think I will prevail on this amendment. But I tell you that, \nas Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, Senator Murray from Washington, and \nSenator Reid from Nevada said, this is worth a fight.\n\n  You don't get many opportunities to cast a vote while on the floor of \nthe Senate that have a lasting impact for generations to come. This is \nworth a fight. This is worth a vote.\n  I hope some of the Republican Members who come to the floor will \nremember one of the greats in their political party, Teddy Roosevelt--\nwhose bust is right outside this door--who really defended conservation \nfor America and made his party the proud patriarch for conservation in \nAmerica. I hope they will remember when they come to the floor and take \nreal pride in that rather than the oil and gas companies that just want \nto get their dirty hands on our national monuments.\n  We can do a lot better in this country. The oil and gas people have \n95 percent of the Federal land to deal with. They do not need the 5 \npercent that we should be preserving and protecting for future \ngenerations. This amendment says to them: Keep your hands off of it. \nLeave it for future generations. Let's find other ways to meet our \nenergy needs that are environmentally sensible and responsible.\n  If I lose on this amendment, and if the Bush administration goes \nforward with the oil and gas drilling, a lot of people will, frankly, \nnever know it. How many of us visit all these national monuments? But \nsome people will--some who go to look for that treasure that was set \naside will find it is no longer the treasure it once was; it has been \nused; It has been exploited; it has been spoiled and perhaps even \nruined in the name of profit.\n  The starting point, for those following the debate, is these are \npublic lands. This is not private property. These are national \nmonuments and public lands. They are lands that belong to all of us as \nAmericans. It is not just the 285 million alive today but our children \nand grandchildren as well. If we don't have the courage to stand up and \nsay protect and preserve a small part of it for future generations, \nthen we are turning our back on the legacy of wise stewardship that has \nguided this country for so many years. It has been 95 years since a \nRepublican President named Teddy Roosevelt had the courage to stand up \nand say they were going to protect that heritage. Ninety-five years \nlater, another Republican President says, no; we are going to drill for \noil and gas in that heritage.\n  What a difference. We will put an end to it with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, there is a great deal of what my \ncolleague from Illinois has said that I just won't disagree with at \nall. This is an important thing to be corrected, though, in his \nstatement because we must deal with facts here when we are talking to \nthe American people about the choices they will have to make depending \non the policies we create.\n  First, the Bush administration is not advocating drilling in all of \nthe monuments of the lower 48 States. That is a falsehood. What is \nimportant to say is that the Bush administration is proposing an energy \npolicy that would open up public lands to be explored for the purpose \nof finding additional energy resources to determine whether or not they \nought to be developed. That is a very real and different statement than \nthe one my colleague from Illinois just made.\n  What is important about this debate is a choice that we are asking \nthe American people to make. I think it is an important choice. I think \nit is worthy of the debate that we are having.\n  Energy security, the right of the family to know that their energy is \nsecure, that their lights won't go out, or the cost of driving their \nminivan or their SUV is going to double or triple over the next couple \nof years, or the right and the power of big oil and OPEC to dictate \nthat because policymakers were asleep at the switch or used false \narguments to cause fear amongst the American people--if that is true, \nthen shame on those policymakers. But bravo to the policymaker that is \nwilling to stand up for the security of our country and the security of \nthe American family.\n  That is what is important. Should the mom have to pay three or four \ntimes what she is paying now to drive her son or her daughter to a \nsoccer game? Well, her costs have doubled in the last year. The reason \nthey have doubled is because this country has not had a national energy \npolicy. We had to go begging to the thieves in the Middle East, the \nOPEC crowd. That was the policy of the past administration--grab my tin \ncup and beg and let mom pay at the gas pump.\n  Was it the right policy? I don't think it was. I am not even going to \nsuggest that drilling or allowing exploration in monuments is the right \npolicy.\n  But what I will suggest to you today and to my colleague from \nIllinois is, do we have to make very hard-line choices in a world of \nmodern technology and the talent that we possess today? Can we not \nshape an environment and shape a national economy that are compatible?\n  I agree with my colleague from Illinois. If you want to step back 30 \nyears and use the argument of 30 years ago, he wins. If he is opposed \nto drilling or if he is opposed to exploration, that is correct. And I \nlose, if I am for it being based on 30-year-old technology. If you want \nthe technology of today and tomorrow, then my guess is that it is a bit \nof a tossup.\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n  We have preserved and protected the environment. But most \nimportantly, we haven't forced mom to go to the gas pump and double her \nprices.\n  I recently talked to a young man who is vice president of a new \ntechnology company out in California. We know what has gone on out in \nCalifornia, and we can pick losers and winners and those to blame. I \nwill tell you what was wrong with that young man. He had not made any \nbad choices. He was frightened. He drives a minivan; He has an economy \ncar; and he has a house. But he said: Senator Craig, I am frightened I \nam going to lose my job. I have spent 20 years building a retirement, \nand the company I work for is teetering today because their energy \ncosts have tripled, their profitability is disappearing, and they are \nlaying off people.\n\n  That is as a result of this Senate, and others, not making the right \npolicy choices over the last decade. That is why that young man in \nCalifornia is frightened today about his future.\n  What does that have to do with national monuments or the 23 new \nmonuments that former President Clinton created in the lower 48? I \nbelieve it has something to do with it. I believe it has to do with the \nfundamental question that is being asked of my colleague from Illinois \ntoday, and that I ask of all of us: Can we live together compatibly in \nan environment in which we can apply new technologies to have abundant \nenergy or do we have to pick winners and losers?\n  I totally disagree with him on his using Teddy Roosevelt as a facade \nto argue. Yes, you are right, Teddy Roosevelt, in 1908, created the \ngreat forest preserves of our country. I know. I am a bit of a student \nof Teddy Roosevelt. I do not use him when it is comfortable. I study \nhim, and I believe in him. And he went on to create some of the grand \nnational parks. But my guess is, he would not have run around the \ncountry in his last 5 years creating all kinds of monuments for the \nsake of developing environmental votes. He did it because he saw the \nneed to create and protect the true jewels of our country's \nenvironment. What Teddy Roosevelt also knew was that you had to have \nsomething that was in balance.\n  I will tell you, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely right: If we \ntake all of these monuments off the table and we do not drill in them, \nwe will not feel it tomorrow, and we will not feel it the next day, and \nour dependency on foreign oil will grow from 50 percent to 60 percent \nto 70 percent. If we can play games with the OPEC boys and we can keep \nthem at about $28 a barrel, then we are OK--probably.\n  Now your gas prices have doubled. For a family making $15 to $25,000 \na year, that means 30 percent of their income gets spent on energy. But \nfor somebody such as the Senator from Illinois or myself--we are making \npretty good money--it probably will not affect our lives very much \nbecause it is a smaller percentage of our total spendable income.\n  Shame on a country today that understands technology and understands \nthe environment and isn't willing to try to make both of them work \ntogether. The Senator from Illinois and I want clean air, we want clean \nwater, and we are going to insist on it because we think that is the \nright public policy. And we want to preserve the crown jewels of our \nNation because that is the right public policy.\n  But when a President comes to my State and carves out 250,000 acres, \nit is not the Washington Monument; it is 250,000 acres of sagebrush \nland with a few rocks on it and a few unique geologic features. \nInterestingly enough, there is no hydrocarbon because it is a volcanic \nformation, and they were all burnt out about 2\\1/2\\ million years ago. \nSo the argument does not apply to Idaho.\n  But my guess is, the Senator from Illinois has picked something that \nis very popular, if you argue it only on one side. But I challenge my \ncolleague from Illinois to tell the American household and the American \nmom that they will forever be secure in that the lights will never go \nout or the gas bills will never go up much more than they have gone up \nnow, and we will work collectively together to build a national \nenergy policy that includes conservation and modernization and \ntechnology, and that we become self-reliant, and that we build a \nnational security that says we can produce our own energy and we do not \nhave to ask the world at large to provide it for us.\n\n  That is a part of this debate. It really is a part of what we ought \nto be considering today when we decide whether we are going to deny the \nright to explore on public lands in this country. I think that is a \nworthy debate. I thank my colleague from Illinois for bringing the \nissue to this Chamber because it is important for all of us to \nunderstand: 20 years ago, you bet, lock it up to protect it; today, \nmodernization and technology says--and I think America believes--that \nwe have come a long way and we can do a better job of balancing the \nenvironment and the economy and the use of it all together in an \neffective manner. And today's debate is just a little bit about a lot \nof that.\n  I am concerned about the families of America and their energy \nsecurity. I do not want them paying more and more of their hard-earned \nmoney on energy. But I am not sure that the kind of policy that is \nbeing advocated today in this amendment will guarantee that. And I am \nnot at all confident that the Senator from Illinois can assure it. But \nthat is the crux of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nIdaho. We clearly have a different point of view. If you listened to \nhis argument, you would think the Durbin amendment would prohibit oil \nand gas exploration on 95 percent of Federal lands saying that we can \nonly use 5 percent for that purpose. Exactly the opposite is true.\n  Currently, we can explore for oil and gas on 95 percent of lands \nunder the Bureau of Land Management--Federal public lands which are \nopen to find energy resources to serve our Nation's needs. I am not \narguing with that. I accept that.\n  This amendment says that for 5 percent--1 acre out of 20--we are \ngoing to treat it differently. These are national monuments. These are \nspecial lands. These are not your run-of-the-mill pieces of real \nestate. These are lands designated by President Clinton, and monuments \nthat have been designated by previous Presidents, that are being \nprotected and treated differently.\n  The Durbin amendment says: No oil and gas drilling or mining in the \nnew national monuments designated by the previous administration--a \nrelatively small piece of real estate that has special important value.\n  The Senator from Idaho has said I am trying to come up with a hard-\nline choice here. Guilty as charged. It is a hard-line choice. It is a \nchoice that says there are certain pieces of real estate in America \nworth fighting for and worth protecting and worth saying to private \nindustry--whether it is big oil or big gas--keep your hands off. You \nhave plenty of other real estate to look at. Don't go up to the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and don't go into the national monuments \ndesignated by President Clinton because I want to be able to take my \ngrandson one day to take a look at them and see the beauty that God \ncreated and not have to duck the pipelines and the trucks and all the \neconomic activity of people trying to make a buck off Federal public \nlands.\n\n  Ninety-five percent of the Federal public lands are open to this \nexploration. For 5 percent there should be a different standard. Yes, \nthere should be a hard-line choice.\n  Let me address for a second the issue that has been brought up over \nand over again: What about our energy crisis? We do face an energy \nchallenge. There is no doubt about it. In my home State of Illinois, \nand across the United States, in the last calendar year we have seen \nsome terrible examples. Home heating bills have gone up dramatically in \nmy home State of Illinois, and other places; electric bills in the \nState of California; gasoline prices between Easter and Memorial Day--\nthat has now become the play period for big oil companies. They run the \ngasoline prices up a buck a gallon between Easter and Memorial Day, and \nthen after every politician gets a head of steam and starts screaming \nat them, they bring them back down. I would like to believe this has \nsomething to do with whether or not we are going to drill for oil in a \nnational monument, but honestly I do not.\n  We are victims of oil companies now that are making decisions that \nhave\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\nlittle or nothing to do with supply and demand. This is the only \nindustry I know that can consistently guess wrong in terms of the \nsupply available to sell and make record profits. And they have done it \nconsistently for 2 straight years.\n  So to argue that the only way to deal with our energy challenge and \nthe OPEC stranglehold is to start drilling for oil and gas in precious \nlands set aside as national monuments is so shortsighted. Are we so \nbereft of original and innovative ideas in Congress and in Washington \nthat we cannot think of another way to help provide modern, \nsustainable, reliable energy to America other than to drill for oil and \ngas in our national monument lands? I do not think so.\n  I think there are other ways--sustainable, renewable fuels, \nconservation; things that work, things you will be proud of, 21st \ncentury thinking--not the drill-and-burn thinking of the 20th century \nand the 19th century that has inspired this administration to decide \nthat, unlike President Teddy Roosevelt, this Republican President is \nready to start exploring and looking for oil and gas in these national \nmonuments.\n  We can end our dependence on foreign oil, but we don't have to do it \nat the expense of America's national and natural treasures. I urge my \ncolleagues in both political parties to agree with me that setting \naside 5 percent of Federal lands, keeping them separate and sacred, is \nworth the investment. We can find another answer, an answer that \npreserves those lands for future generations and still meets the energy \nneeds of America.\n  If there are other Senators seeking recognition on this amendment, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there has been a lot of historic revision \ngoing on with respect to the creation of national monuments. I rise to \nset the record straight.\n  The record is available for those who will research it, but for those \nwho may have been listening to this debate, it needs some accuracy in \nterms of what happened.\n  I was involved in it right from the public beginning, but I cannot \nsay I was involved in it from the real beginning because the creation \nof the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument was done in the \ndark. It was done without consultation with any member of the Utah \ndelegation. And when members of the Utah delegation called the \nadministration and asked what was going on, we were told: It is not \nhappening.\n  To be very specific, in one example, let me describe to the Members \nof the Senate and to the Chair an exchange I had with Katie McGinty, \nchairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.\n  First, to put this in historic context, a story appeared in the \nWashington Post saying that President Clinton was considering a major \nnational monument in the State of Utah. Immediately after that story \nappeared, the administration denied it and said it was just a \nconsideration, just an idea, and under no circumstances were they that \nfar along in serious consideration of a national monument.\n  Understand that the law required, under NEPA and appropriate \nenvironmental laws, that there be full public examination and \nconsultation. The administration knew that. So they said, no, there \nwill be no consultation because this is just an idea.\n  I had had experience. I called Bruce Babbitt. Bruce Babbitt and I had \na very frank relationship. Even though we disagreed on many things, we \ncould be honest with each other. I called Bruce Babbitt. He was \nappropriately professional; he didn't let out any secrets. But he let \nme know that it was perhaps more than just an idea.\n\n  I said: What should we be worried about? He told me some things we \nshould be worried about in a theoretical sense. In case this was a real \nmonument, we should be worried about the following. I wrote him a \nletter about them.\n  Finally he called me. He said: Come on down to the Department of the \nInterior and we will talk about this. And with the other members of the \nUtah delegation, Senator Hatch and Congressman Hansen, I went down to \nDepartment of the Interior. It was on a Saturday morning when there was \nnobody else around. We sat in his conference room. Katie McGinty was \nthere, along with a large number of his staff.\n  I asked him repeatedly and directly: Mr. Secretary, will the \nPresident announce the creation of a national monument on Wednesday of \nthis coming week, as the press is speculating that he will?\n  Bruce Babbitt, being a careful lawyer, looked at me and said: No \ndecision has been made. He didn't say yes and he didn't say no. He just \nsaid: No decision has been made.\n  I took that, from my experience with the Clinton administration, to \nmean ``yep, it is a done deal; I can't tell you about it, but it is \ndone.''\n  So convinced that the monument was going to be created, on Monday \nmorning, in my office, Katie McGinty was there as the leading \nadministration spokesperson on this issue. And I said: Ms. McGinty, you \nsay this is under consideration but no decision has been made. Given \nthe consideration, can you give me a copy of the map so that I can see \nwhat lands are under consideration?\n  She looked me in the eye and said: Senator, there is no map. We are \nnot that far along. This is just an idea. There is no map.\n  I said: As soon as there is a map, can I have a copy?\n  Oh, yes, Senator, as soon as we have a map, but we are not that far \nalong.\n  That was Monday morning. On Wednesday morning I get a phone call from \nLeon Panetta, Chief of Staff to President Clinton.\n  Leon Panetta said: Senator, I am calling to tell you that this \nafternoon in Arizona, President Clinton will announce the formation of \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the details of where \nit will be and everything with respect to it.\n  I held my anger because Mr. Panetta obviously had nothing to do with \nthis. This was a done deal outside even the office of the Chief of \nStaff of the White House.\n  I said: National monuments require--and I listed all of the things \nthat were involved in the creation of a national monument.\n  He said: Yes, national monuments require all those things. There will \nbe a 3-year period after the creation of the monument in which we will \ndeal with those issues.\n  Every one of those issues should have been dealt with publicly and \nopenly prior to the creation of the national monument, but all of them \nhad been held in secret.\n  I expressed my disappointment in that. Mr. Panetta, in a moment of \ncandor said: Well, Senator, we have 3 years in which to try to clean it \nall up.\n  When Katie McGinty appeared before the appropriations subcommittee, I \nsat with the subcommittee and I said to her: I want to see all of the \ndocuments relating to this decision. You didn't create this out of \nwhole cloth in a 24-hour period.\n\n  I made it very clear that I did not believe her earlier statement \nthat there was no map and no consideration if, in less than 48 hours, \nthe President made a complete public disclosure of it. Presidents don't \ndo things in 24-hour periods. Something as major as this doesn't just \nhappen overnight. It isn't an immediate decision. It is staffed out \nsomewhere.\n  I said to her: I want to see all of the documents relating to the \ndecision to create this national monument.\n  Oh, yes, Senator. I will provide this. It was a completely open \nprocess.\n  And then we got a map. I discovered, by the way, that the map had \nbeen in circulation among environmental groups for 3 months prior to \nthe time when I asked her for a copy, and she told me none existed.\n  We looked at the map to see how carefully drawn the boundaries were \nof this national treasure we were hearing about. In one of the towns in \nUtah, the high school football field was in the national monument. The \nmap was drawn in secret. The map was drawn with people who would not \nconsult with those who knew what was going on, and they had drawn the \nline so wildly that they had picked up the football field of a high \nschool, thinking that was part of the national monument.\n  One of my constituents found his front driveway in the national \nmonument. He had to drive across national\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nmonument lands to get to his house because they had ignored the \nprocedures so fully, they were so anxious to do this in secret and not \nconsult with anybody so that they would have a political coup to \nannounce in the middle of a Presidential campaign, that they made those \nkinds of mistakes.\n  Is it now so sacred a land that we cannot take the football field out \nand turn it back to the high school?\n  Is it so sacred a piece of land that we can't give the man his \ndriveway back? I ask those questions rhetorically because we did that. \nIn one of the previous Congresses, we redrew the boundaries and took \nout the football field and the driveway and some other mistakes that \nwere made. I got my first set of documents from Katie McGinty, which \nwere a speech made 3 years before and a travel bureau brochure. I went \nback to the Appropriations subcommittee meeting. It is not usually my \nstyle, but I am afraid I embarrassed her by holding these up and \nsaying, ``You are suggesting that these are the basis of a decision to \nlock up 1.7 million acres in my home State? You are saying this is the \ncomplete record? I am sorry, I cannot accept that.''\n  Finally, at a later time, we got the complete file that she had with \nrespect to the creation of this monument. I will say this in her \ndefense. She did not shred any documents. When she turned the documents \nover to me, the file was complete. It contained the following documents \nin it: One dated several months before, where she says, ``We will have \nto abandon the project of trying to find lands in Utah that qualify for \na national monument because it is clear there are none that do. Let's \nforget the Utah project because we can't find any lands that will \nqualify.'' And then, what I consider the smoking gun, there was a 5\\1/\n2\\ by 8\\1/2\\ piece of paper in which she had written in her own hand a \nnote to the Vice President. The Vice President had been her boss. She \nwas on his staff while he was a Senator. That would explain the \nfamiliarity of the note. It said: Al, the enviros have $500,000 to \nspend on this campaign, either for us or against us, depending on what \nwe do in Utah. Signed, Katie.\n  I can't vouch for that being the exact language, but that is close \nenough. I read and reread that note many times. The national monument \nwas being created in southern Utah in the dark to stimulate the \nexpenditure of $500,000 of campaign activity on behalf of the Clinton-\nGore ticket in 1996. There was the entire motivation following on the \nearlier document where she said there aren't any lands that qualified.\n  Now, the Senator from Illinois has said these are special lands and \nthat they can explore for oil and gas on 95 percent of the public \nlands. This is reminiscent of a statement President Clinton made when \nhe announced that monument. He said, ``Mining jobs are good jobs, but \nwe can't have mines everywhere. So we will set this land apart so there \nwon't be any mines here.''\n  If I had been there and had the opportunity to have an exchange with \nPresident Clinton, I would have said: President Clinton, you are \nexactly right. We cannot have mines everywhere. We can only have mines \nwhere there are minerals. Sure, you say 95 percent of the land is open \nfor exploration. But nobody wants to explore lands where there is \nnothing to look for. Nobody wants to explore lands where there are no \nmineral resources. Why was this land set aside in a national monument?\n  The Senator from Illinois says he wants to take his grandson out some \nday to look at the beauty of the land. I suggest to him, bring your \ngrandson to look at it right now. You will have the same reaction we \nare getting from tourists who are coming. We were told when this was \ncreated that we would have an economic bonanza of tourists coming to \nlook at this magnificent piece of scenery. I have gone to the county \ncommissioners of the counties around there and said, ``How much tourism \nhave you had?'' They said, ``None.'' None? This has had so much \npublicity, surely people have come from all over the world to see this \nscenic wonder. Yes, they come--once. They say we have come to see this \nmagnificent scenery President Clinton talked about on the rim of the \nGrand Canyon. He picked that as his backdrop to make the announcement. \nThat is scenic and it is worth coming from all over the world to see. \nThat was his visual aid when he talked about the land in Utah. The \nfolks show up from Germany and Japan and elsewhere to look at the land \nin Utah, but they say: This doesn't look any different than any of the \nother BLM land we can see. What is the big deal?\n\n  They don't come back. We have seen two counties be destroyed \neconomically since the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nMonument, as people were afraid to invest in those counties. They were \nnot very viable to begin with and have no tourism. With all of the \npublicity, there is no tourism.\n  All right. I suggest to the Senator from Illinois, if he wants to \ntake his grandchild to see this grand scenery, he can do it, and it \nwill be there in future generations because it will look like all the \nrest of the scenery around it. Why was this monument created? It was \ncreated for one purpose, and one purpose only, and the documents I got \nfrom Katie McGinty that are made part of the public record make this \nabundantly clear, along with the smoking gun saying we are going to \nhave $500,000 spent on our behalf if we do this, or spent against us if \nwe don't.\n  The reason the environmental groups were so anxious to see to it that \nthis monument was created was because of the coal on the Kaiparowits \nPlateau. Let me describe to you how much coal there is there. It is not \navailable on any of the other 95 percent of public lands. It is only \navailable on the Kaiparowits Plateau. The average coal seam is about 4 \nto 6 feet high. You go into a mine that has a coal seam in West \nVirginia--and I see the senior Senator from West Virginia here, and he \nknows more about coal than any of the rest of us--you are going to \nthink you have a pretty good seam if it is 6 feet high. The coal seam \nin Kaiparowits is 16 feet high. It runs back from where the mine mouth \nwill be, over 160 miles. There is enough energy in that coal to heat \nand light the city of San Francisco for 300 years. And it has been \nknown for decades. You don't have to explore this. You don't have to go \nlooking for it. People have known about it.\n  Over and above the coal generated by that incredible seam of coal is \na pool of methane gas--coal methane gas, which, if tapped, would \nproduce even more energy than the coal itself. There are no reliable \nestimates as to how much coal-based methane gas there is, other than \n``huge.''\n  Now, neither the coal nor the coal methane gas can be used to deal \nwith America's energy crisis. Instead, we are told: Go look someplace \nelse. You have 95 percent of the public lands to look for. Don't look \nhere where the coal is. Don't talk about a pipeline for methane gas \nhere, where the methane gas is. Go look on lands we don't care about.\n  The sole purpose of the monument was to prevent the development of \nthat resource at Kaiparowits. Here I go way back in history and share \nwith you this insight: When my father was here--he came here in 1951, \nelected in 1950--the No. 1 issue facing the West was water. One of the \nproposals that was made during the Eisenhower administration was that \nwe build a dam on the Colorado River that would be known as the Glen \nCanyon Dam and would create behind it Lake Powell. The predecessors of \ntoday's environmental groups came and testified against the building of \nthe Glen Canyon Dam.\n  One of their arguments was: We will never, ever, need that much \npower. You have Boulder Dam--or Hoover Dam. It was called Boulder Dam \nin those days; now it is called Hoover Dam--we have all the power we \nwill ever need for southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. To \nbuild the Glen Canyon Dam to produce that power will give us a glut of \npower, and we absolutely do not need it and never will need it. \nHowever, they said--and here is the point--if by some possible chance \nwe are wrong and we do need that power, you still do not need the dam \nbecause there is all that coal at Kaiparowits. Let's burn the coal at \nKaiparowits.\n  This was in the 1950s when my father was here. I remember the debate. \nI was serving on his staff while much of it went on.\n  Now the time has come when we need all the power at the Glen Canyon \nDam which, incidentally, the Sierra Club wants to tear down, and we \nneed some more power, and there sits a source of power perhaps unique \nin the world.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n But, no, we cannot touch it. The way to make sure we cannot touch it \nis to create a national monument around it and to do it in such a way \nthat it will never be subject to public comment or review. We will do \nit in secret. We will do it without telling anybody, and when members \nof the Utah delegation ask us about our plans, we will lie to them.\n  I am sorry to be that strong, but that is what happened because I \nasked the question directly, and I was given the answer directly, and \nthe answer was a lie, demonstrable, provable in the Record. The answer \nI got was a lie.\n  Now we are being told: Oh, these are special lands that we must \npreserve for our grandchildren, when in fact the genesis of this \nmonument makes it clear these are special lands primarily because of \nthe mineral resources that are in them, the energy sources that are \nthere, the low-sulfur coal which, by the way, if mixed with more \ntraditional coal, would lower emissions at every powerplant where it \nwas used.\n  For those who are concerned about greenhouse gases, they ought to be \nclamoring to open Kaiparowits to lower the emissions of greenhouse \ngases. If you say let's not do the coal, the coal is too bad, how about \nthe coal-based methane gas? How about getting that out in these \ntremendous quantities? Oh, no, no, that would involve building a \npipeline; we can't build a pipeline over these lands.\n  That is the history, Mr. President. This is not as it has been \npainted to be. And I do not impugn the motives of those who are \npainting it differently because they were not there. They do not \nunderstand the degree of duplicity that went into the creation of this \nmonument.\n  If I sound angry, it is because, frankly, I was, as was everyone else \nassociated with it, everyone else who was involved with the chicanery \nthat was employed to create this monument.\n  Are there portions of the Kaiparowits Plateau that probably belong in \nnational monument status? The answer to that is yes, there are. Am I \nand the other members of the Utah delegation in favor of preserving \nthose lands in national monument status? The answer is yes, we are, but \nit should be done in the kind of open process that the Congress decreed \nwhen they created NEPA. It is too late for that now.\n  As Leon Panetta said to me, we have 3 years to pick up the pieces. \nThe 3 years have passed and, quite frankly, the Interior Department and \nthe folks at the BLM have, indeed, come up with what I consider to be \nan acceptable and logical management plan for the monument. But the \nfact is that all of those marvelous qualities for preservation in a \nnational monument can be preserved and the coal can still be taken out.\n\n  I have been to the site where the mine mouth will be, and I say mine \nmouth singularly because you can get at that entire seam that I \ndescribed through a single mine entrance. It would not require multiple \nentrances.\n  As luck would have it, or as nature has created it, that particular \nmine mouth is at the bottom of a circular canyon, which means it cannot \nbe seen unless you are standing at the edge of the canyon looking down \non it. It could not be seen by anybody 200 yards away. They would look \nright over the top of it on to the other side of the canyon and not \neven know it is there.\n  The entire facility to take the coal out of the Kaiparowits mine \ncould be on 60 acres at the bottom of that circular canyon. We are not \ntalking about a huge environmental disaster that will spread over \nseveral square miles. We are not talking about a visual blight that \ncould be seen for hundreds of miles. We are talking about a mine mouth \nat the bottom of a circular canyon that could go right into a sheer \ncliff, into the seam of coal, and bring out enough coal to light and \nheat the city of San Francisco for 300 years, and we are talking about \ncoal-based methane gas on top of that coal seam that has even greater \nenergy potential.\n  It could be exploited without affecting in any way, other than \npsychologically, the beauty and power of the landscape on top of it. It \ncan all be done underground--no strip mining, no open pits, no oil \nderricks. It can all be done in such a way that people who want a \nwilderness experience can have it unless somebody tells them: There is \na pipeline 40 miles away from you. Oh, well, that spoils my experience \nto know there is a pipeline there.\n  You cannot see it. It does not affect you in any way. You cannot hear \nit. But the fact that it was put in there somehow will spoil the \nexperience.\n  I am not suggesting we need to automatically go in there and start \nmining the coal right now, nor am I suggesting that we need to start \nputting down the initial wells to start getting the methane gas right \nnow, because that would be as precipitous as the action was to create \nthe monument in the first place. That would be a political action \nrather than an intelligent examination of this resource and what needs \nto be done.\n  I am saying let's give the President the authority to do the studies, \nmake the examination, receive the public comment, go through the \nprocess that should have been done in the first place; then, with all \nof the facts on his plate, make a decision that I hope will not be \ndriven by political considerations. I hope that nowhere in the files \nwill be a note that says: There is $500,000 for the campaign if we act \nthis way, and $500,000 against us if we act that way.\n  To summarize: I, the other Members of the Utah delegation, and the \ncitizens of my State are as proud of the national heritage that we have \nreceived as anyone in this country. We take no back seat to anyone in \nour determination to see to it that these lands are kept as pristine \nand as preserved as they can possibly be.\n  I will share an experience I had on the campaign trail for the first \ntime I was down in that part of the State. A woman I had been talking \nto, hoping to get her to support me, walked out of the restaurant where \nwe were meeting, in a small Utah town. She said: Bob, look around.\n  I had no idea what she was talking about, but I looked around; I \ndutifully looked around.\n  And she said: What do you see?\n  Again, I didn't realize what she was talking about, so I didn't \nanswer.\n  She said: It is pristine, isn't it?\n  It was then I realized she was looking at the land.\n  I said: Yes, it is pristine. It is beautiful.\n  Then she said: My family and I have been earning our living off this \nland for five generations. Tell me we don't love it. Tell me we have \nnot been good stewards and can't take care of it and somebody else has \nto come in and order us off it in order for it to remain in good hands.\n  I have always remembered that comment. It is indicative of the way \nthe people of Utah feel about our State. We are making plans to do \neverything we can as we look ahead. The demographic trends say our \nState will double in population within the lifetime of my children. We \nare making plans now to preserve the open spaces, to preserve as much \nof that which is beautiful and magnificent as can be preserved. We take \nour stewardship very seriously and we take a back seat to no one in our \ndetermination to see that stewardship is passed on to our grandchildren \nand our great grandchildren. But we want to do it intelligently. We \nwant to do it in a way that makes sense. We want to do it with \neverybody participating in the process who will come to the table and \ntalk to us. We want to hear every idea. We want to hear every point of \nview.\n  We don't want to see a repeat of what Katie McGinty and others in the \nClinton administration did, of creating something in the dark, cramming \nit down people's throat without any opportunity for comment, and then \ndeclaring that it is forever and ever inviolate. That process only \nbreeds ill will. That process only creates bad feelings. There is no \nplace for that kind of process to ever be repeated.\n  My objection to the amendment by the Senator from Illinois is--and he \nwould enshrine the results of that process--not the process; he had \nnothing to do with the process. He didn't know what was going on. If he \nhad, given his sense of fair play, he probably would have objected to \nit, but he would enshrine the results of that process into law forever. \nThat, frankly, doesn't make sense. It is a process that does not \ndeserve to be rewarded with that kind of perpetual reference. We need \nto deal with our lands in a way that is good for the lands, a way that \nis good for the people, a way that is good for our posterity, and \nenshrining what was done in the case of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nMonument is not the way to do that.\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nFeingold and Boxer be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority whip if this is appropriate, we have a \nunanimous consent that the rollcall vote on this amendment be scheduled \nfor 2:45.\n  Mr. REID. We will work on the exact time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will suspend a unanimous consent request on a specific \ntime.\n  I will respond to my colleague and friend, the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett. I have heard him speak before about the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument. He is a man of great control and \nmoderation. I can tell it brings his blood pressure to a high level to \nrecall the creation of this particular monument. He has heartfelt \nfeelings about this process and he has expressed them, hopefully, in \nprivate.\n  I do say in fairness that one of the people he mentioned several \ntimes on the floor is someone I respect very much and worked with for \nmany years, Miss Katie McGinty, who worked for the Clinton \nadministration. I found her to be entirely professional and ethical, \nwith the highest integrity and great skill. I want to make certain that \nis part of the record.\n  I also do want to make note of the following for the record, as well. \nWith regard to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the \nBureau of Land Management has utilized an extensive process to develop \na management plan to administer the new monument. The planning team \nincluded five representatives nominated by the Governor of Utah, Mike \nLeavitt. Over 28 meetings were held and over 9,000 comments considered \nprior to finalizing the monument management plan in February of 2000. \nIn addition, following establishment of the monument, the Department of \nthe Interior worked closely with the State of Utah to negotiate a major \nland exchange that traded State and Federal land so as to help maximize \nthe value of State lands for the benefit of Utah's schoolchildren and \nprovided a $50 million payment to the State.\n  My amendment addresses whether or not we will drill for oil and gas \nand mine minerals, particularly coal in this case, in the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument.\n  I make the following comments for the record: According to the U.S. \nGeological Service, all of the recoverable oil in the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument would provide for America's energy needs \nfor a total of 4 hours. All of the recoverable gas in the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument would provide for America's \nenergy needs for 1 hour.\n  On the issue of coal, fortunately, we are not at the mercy of \nanything like OPEC when it comes to coal in the United States. The U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior has estimated we have 250 years worth of \ncoal reserves right here in the United States. The Senator has said \nrepeatedly that the coal in this national monument can light all the \nlights in San Francisco for a long period of time. I suggest all the \ncoal in the United States could light the lights of most of the western \ncivilization for a pretty substantial period of time. We have a lot of \ncoal. I am glad we do. I have three times more coal in my State of \nIllinois than the Senator from Utah believes he has in his State, at \nleast by estimates from the Department of Energy.\n  The Interior Department bought back all of the Federal coal leases \nwithin the Grand Staircase at a cost to taxpayers of $20 million. There \nare no existing leaseholders, no coal development taking place in this \nnational monument. So those who were there were compensated when they \nleft.\n\n  Let me go back to what this amendment is all about and why I have \noffered it. The Bush administration said they are prepared to explore \nthe possibility of drilling for oil and gas in national monuments. When \nvisiting Washington, DC, and you hear the words ``national monument'' \nyou think of the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. But \nnational monuments under Federal lands are tracts of land set aside by \nPresidents over the history of this country to be preserved for future \ngenerations.\n  Beginning with Republican President Teddy Roosevelt, 14 of the 17 \nPresidents who served since 1906 have used the power to set aside land, \nsaying this is special land and is part of our natural national \nheritage that should not be developed and should be protected. In all, \nthese Presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike, have established 122 \nnational monuments. After the Presidents did that, Congress came in and \nagreed with the President in at least 30 different instances, saying \nthese national monuments should be national parks, the next stage of \nthe process.\n  We are talking about the California Coastal National Monument, the \nGiant Sequoia National Monument in California, Craters of the Moon \nNational Monument in Idaho, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in \nArizona. The Grand Canyon was once a national monument that became a \nnational park. Those who support my amendment believe we ought to take \nthis special real estate in America and treat it in a special way. We \nought to say that for a small percentage of the land that we call \nAmerica, that God has given us, we are going to protect it from \neconomic exploitation.\n  But not President Bush. President Bush and his administration says \nno; we are prepared to drill for oil and gas and mine coal in these \nlands.\n  You cannot protect the special character of these lands and use them \neconomically. You cannot hope to say to your children, grandchildren, \nand their children and grandchildren, that they will be able to see \nsomething spectacular and special, untouched by man, if you allow this \nkind of economic exploration.\n  This is a photograph taken of one of these national monuments. It is \na beautiful piece of land. I am sure we are all proud it has been set \naside so future generations can come to see it, visit it, and know it \nis to be protected. Mr. President, 95 percent of all the Federal lands \nwe own in America--and we own millions of acres--can be drilled for oil \nand gas, and mined for coal. We believe that is appropriate because we \nare not going to sacrifice something that is really special. My \namendment says that for 5 percent, 1 acre out of 20, special rules will \napply: No drilling for oil and gas, no mining of coal.\n  I hope those who have followed this debate will understand that \nexisting leaseholders on these lands will not be disadvantaged. In \nfact, all we are saying is that this heritage, to be left to future \ngenerations, should be protected.\n  At the end of consideration of this amendment, there will be some \npeople watching the final vote very carefully. They will be people who \nwork for the big oil companies and the gas drilling companies, some \ncoal mining companies out west, who really think if they can get their \nhands on this land there is money to be made.\n  There will be others watching, too: People across America who \nunderstand a special responsibility which elected officials have today \nin the Senate and in the House of Representatives and, yes, in the \nWhite House as well, to preserve this national heritage.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting for this \namendment. It had a strong bipartisan vote in the House of \nRepresentatives: Democrats and Republicans and an Independent alike, \nbelieving it was important we speak with one voice when it comes to \nsomething as basic as this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that beginning at 4 \np.m. second-degree amendments be relevant to the first-degree \namendments under the previous order already entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened with great attention to the \ndebate concerning the amendment that is before us. I would like to \nspecifically identify the amendment in some detail because I think \nMembers should have an understanding of just what the intention of the \nSenator from Illinois is.\n  In the amendment, the specific purpose is to prohibit the use of \nfunds for the conduct of preleasing, leasing, and related activities \nwithin national monuments established under the act of June 8, 1906.\n  It is further appropriate to reflect on the concluding sentence of \nthe amendment, which states:\n\n       . . . a national monument established under the Act of June \n     8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.), except to the extent that \n     such a preleasing, leasing, or other related activity is \n     allowed under the Presidential proclamation establishing the \n     monument.\n\n  So one has to question just what the purpose of the amendment is. It \nsays, on one hand, no funds will be allowed for preleasing within \nnational monuments, and then it concludes by saying: ``except to the \nextent that such preleasing, leasing, or other related activity is \nallowed under the Presidential proclamation establishing the \nmonument.''\n  What we have here, in the establishment of a monument, in the normal \ncourse of events, is a Presidential proclamation. And in that \nproclamation it is specifically addressed as to what can occur within \nthe monument.\n  I really question the necessity of the amendment. I question the \napplicability of the amendment. I question the application of the \namendment. I question the purpose and objective of the amendment.\n  I am not one of the managers of the bill, but one of the more \nexpeditious alternatives would be to accept the amendment because the \namendment does not do a thing. It implies that you are not going to \nhave any funds for preleasing and related activities--and I assume we \nmean oil and gas or mineral exploration in national monuments--but then \nit goes on and says: ``except to the extent that such preleasing . . . \nor other related activity is allowed under the [authority of the \nPresident],'' which basically states the authorization for the \nproclamation establishing the monument. Hopefully, that is clear.\n  I assume there are some out there who would say, we do not want oil \nand gas or mineral exploration occurring in national monuments. We have \nheard from Senators who have had some experience with national \nmonuments, the creation of these monuments under the Antiquities Act. \nCertainly one of the more recent States is the State of Utah and the \ncase of the Grand Staircase-Escalante episode where a monument was \ncreated with very significant acreage. It took off the development \nscenario of some coal leases that the State of Utah was going to use to \nfund their educational system. I think, unfortunately, the application \nof the Antiquities Act in that particular case was inappropriate.\n  Our previous President took that action. He did it without the \nknowledge of the Governor of Utah, and without the knowledge of the \ncongressional delegation of Utah. Furthermore, he did not have the \ncompassion to even make the announcement in the State of Utah. I \nbelieve it was made in Arizona.\n  So the application of the Antiquities Act, traditionally, on national \nmonuments is well established. But the criteria of what can be done in \nthose national monuments are ordinarily left up to the Presidential \nproclamation establishing the monument, which certainly is the case in \nthe amendment pending before this body. I hope Senators, upon \nreflection, will recognize that this particular amendment really \naccomplishes no purpose.\n  One of the things that concerns me, however, is the implication and \nthe lack of understanding of terminology associated with the \ndesignation of public land.\n  We have all seen the concern expressed on the floor--both in the \nHouse and in the Senate--as to the issue of developing resources \noffshore or within our States or within specific designated areas. But \nI would like to share with you a chart that shows the designated areas \nthat have been taken off limits in recent years by State and Federal \naction. It is kind of interesting to note the entire east coast--from \nMaine to Florida--has been removed from any OCS (Outer Continental \nShelf) activity. And the merits of those action speak for themselves. \nThese States simply do not want any activity off their shore.\n\n  We saw an agreement on lease sale 181 in Florida the other day where \na significant portion of the lease was removed. Yet the inconsistency \nis, Florida wants very much to receive a portion of the energy that \nwould come from exploration offshore in the gulf. It is kind of hard to \nhave it both ways, but some would like that.\n  The chart also shows the Pacific coast--the entire area from \nWashington State to California--is off limits. In other words: NIMBY, \nNot In My Backyard. We have in the overthrust belt the States of \nWyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Montana. These are States that have oil \nand gas development and production. As a consequence of the roadless \narea promulgated by the previous administration, we have seen a \nsignificant area of prospect for oil and gas, particularly natural gas, \ntaken off limits. There were estimated to be about 22 to 23 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas in this overthrust area. We have taken it off \nlimits. That means basically no resource development.\n  There you have it. With the exception of the gulf area--Texas, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, that support OCS leasing--we find \nourselves in a position where we have an energy crisis. We find \nourselves in a position where we are becoming more and more dependent \non sources overseas coming into the United States.\n  We debate the merits of the inconsistency in our foreign policy where \nwe find ourselves dependent on 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq, \nfrom our old friend Saddam Hussein, where we fought a war in 1991 and \n1992. We lost 148 U.S. lives in that war. And now we are importing oil \nfrom that country. We buy Iraq's oil, put it in our airplanes, and then \ngo bomb him while enforcing a no-fly zone, basically a blockade in the \nair. We risk U.S. lives in doing that. We have flown over 230,000 \nindividual sorties over Iraq.\n  So here we are putting our own area off limits, going overseas, not \nreally caring where our oil comes from. Whether it comes from a \nscorched-earth refinery or a scorched-earth oil field in OPEC, we find \nourselves subject to the cartel of OPEC. Cartels are illegal in the \nUnited States. We would not even pass the test associated with that \ntype of business in this country because we have antitrust laws, but we \nare, in effect, supporting the viability of the OPEC cartel by becoming \nmore and more dependent.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer remembers, back in 1973, we had gas \nlines going around the block in this country. We had the Arab oil \nembargo at the Yom Kippur war. We had the public indignant, outraged \nbecause there were gas lines around the block. We were 37-percent \ndependent on imported oil at that time. Today, we are 57-percent \ndependent. The Department of Energy says the way we are going, we are \ngoing to be 63- or 64-percent dependent by the year 2007 or 2008. Where \nis it going to come from?\n  People generalize, very conveniently, that we have alternatives: We \nhave renewables; we have solar power; we have wind power; we have new \ntechnology. If you really think about it, most of these sources are for \nstationary power generation. But they do not move America. They do not \nmove the world.\n  Mr. President you, and I, and others, do not fly in and out of \nWashington, DC, on hot air. Somebody has to produce the oil, refine it, \nand put the kerosene in the jet. Only then do you take off. Whether it \nis your planes or your trains or your automobiles or your boats, \nAmerica and the world are dependent on oil. And we are becoming more \nand more dependent on one source, and that is OPEC.\n  We are sacrificing our national security interests; there is no \nquestion about it. To give a recent example, just a few weeks ago, \nSaddam Hussein didn't get his way with the U.N. So he cut his oil \nproduction. He pulled 2\\1/2\\ million barrels of oil a day off the world \nmarket. We thought OPEC would\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nmake up that difference. They took one look at it and said: No, we are \ngoing to hold off. So we were short that month. This previous month, \nabout 60 million barrels were held off the world market. It kept the \nprice up.\n  Look at what happened in this last year with OPEC in developing their \ninternal discipline. They developed a floor and a ceiling on oil: $22 \nwas the floor; $28 was the ceiling. It has gone over that. They have a \ndiscipline. We are becoming more and more dependent on that source, and \nwe are becoming more and more exposed from the standpoint of our \nnational security.\n  Where is it going? We are debating an amendment that doesn't do a \nthing to address supply. We should be debating an energy bill at this \ntime in a timely manner to address the crisis ahead. As we saw out in \nCalifornia, it can happen very fast. When we look at the concern the \nAmerican people are exposed to over the coming blackouts, how does that \naffect the security of the American taxpayer? Maybe there are some \nchildren at home and there is a blackout. There is a lack of power. \nWhat does that do to increase crime? These are exposures that real \npeople have and real concerns that can be alleviated if we take up an \nenergy policy in a prompt and efficient manner.\n  As we look at this chart, there is no exploration everyplace: No \nexploration in the Great Lakes, no exploration on the west coast, no \nexploration on the east coast, no exploration in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico, and eventually no exploration in the 40 percent of the land in \nthe Western U.S. owned by the Federal Government.\n  I am not here to promote the amendment of my friend from Illinois in \nthe sense of oil and gas activities in the national monuments, because \nthe Presidential proclamation will make a determination of that. What I \nam concerned about is where this energy is going to come from.\n  We have all heard the issue associated with the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge or ANWR. I want to communicate to my colleagues the \ndifference associated with some of the nomenclature that flows around \nhere.\n  We are dealing currently with an amendment that would prohibit the \nuse of funds in the conduct of preleasing within national monuments. \nDoes the public know what a national monument is? I think they have a \nperception. Maybe it is a park. Maybe it is kind of a wilderness. Maybe \nit is kind of a refuge.\n  The reality is, a national monument can be just about anything that \nit is designated to be in the Presidential proclamation. You can have \noil and gas activity, if it is permitted. Mostly it is not. National \nmonuments are created by the Antiquities Act. The Antiquities Act can \npreclude oil and gas or mineral leasing. These are all alternatives \nthat are determined at the time that the national monument is \nestablished.\n  That is why the application of this amendment has no meaning because, \nagain, it says: No money for preleasing within national monuments \nexcept to the extent that such preleasing or other related activity is \nallowed under Presidential proclamation establishing the monument.\n  There we have it. Let me just take my colleagues for a little walk \ninto the wildlife refuges. What is a refuge? What does that mean? It \nmight mean in the minds of some, a place for wildlife, but we have oil \nproduction in many refuges. We have mineral production in many refuges. \nWe have gas production in many refuges. We have coal production. We \nhave salt water conversion. We have many activities in this particular \nnomenclature of refuges.\n\n  Here are the States. We have 17 refuges in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, \nMississippi, four in California, Montana, Michigan, my State of Alaska. \nThese are activities that are authorized under the terminology of \nrefuges.\n  This chart shows where these refuges are. It is important that the \npublic understands the difference between national monument designation \nunder proclamation by the President and what is allowed in them by the \nproclamation and refuges. In Alabama, there is the Choctaw National \nWildlife Refuge. Oil production in national refuges and wetlands \nmanagement districts is a concept that has long been fostered by the \nCongress. It is specifically the balanced use of Federal funds and the \nreality that it is accepted and is commonplace.\n  This is oil and gas activity in 30 refuges, and there are 118 refuges \nfrom coast to coast where we are safely exploring for oil and gas. We \nhave over 400 wells in Louisiana refuges alone. And we have them in \nAlabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Texas, Alaska--the Kenai National \nWildlife Refuge--North Dakota, Mississippi, Michigan, and Montana.\n  I am not going to get into a presentation of the merits of ANWR. What \nmakes it any different than any of the rest of these refuges? Certainly \nnot from the establishment of the terminology ``refuge.'' ANWR is \nincluded as a refuge, therefore oil and gas activity is allowed, \nsubject to the authority of the Congress. That is what that debate is \nall about.\n  But as we look at the reality associated with the energy crisis, we \nhave to recognize we are going to have to look for relief. You are not \ngoing to get it from alternatives. You are not going to get it from \nrenewables. In spite of the fact that I support the technology, I \nsupport the subsidy, I support continued taxpayer support of these, \nthey still constitute less than 4 percent of the total energy mix. We \nhave expended about $6 billion in the last 10 years. It has been money \nwell spent, but it is not going to replace our dependence on \nconventional sources of energy.\n  How did we get into this thing? Why are things different now? I could \ntalk about oil and gas, but if we look at foreign oil dependence--now \nat 56 percent, up to 66 percent by the year 2010--the national security \ninterest of this country is in jeopardy. What are we going to use as \nleverage?\n  In 1973, we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some people say \nthat can be our relief. Do you know what we found out when the previous \nadministration took 30 million barrels out of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve? We found out we didn't have the refining capacity to refine it \ninto the heating oil that was needed to meet the crisis at that time in \nthe Northeast Corridor. We were genuinely concerned.\n  When we took that oil, we simply found we had to offset what we would \nordinarily import. We didn't have the refining capacity. I think we \nachieved, out of that 30 million barrels, somewhere in the area of a 1-\nday supply of heating oil for the Northeast Corridor. It just won't \nwork. If you don't have the refining capacity, you can have all the oil \nin the ground you want, it isn't going to do the job. You are not going \nto be able to increase, if the need is there, any more than the extent \nof the capacity of your refineries.\n  The reason things are different this time is we have natural gas \nprices that have soared. They have gone up as high as $10. They are \ndown now, thank God, but we are still using our reserves faster than we \nare finding them. We haven't had a new nuclear plant licensed in this \ncountry in 10 years. We haven't had a new coal-fired plant of any \nconsequence built in this country since 1995, and coal is our most \nabundant resource.\n  We have technology for clean coal. Nothing has been done in that \narea. Why? It isn't because the supply isn't adequate; it is because we \nhaven't had the conviction to come to grips with the reality of the law \nof supply and demand. Even Congress can't resolve the law of supply and \ndemand, unless we increase the supply or reduce the demand.\n  Demand has gone up and supply hasn't. That is why it is different \nthis time. I indicated that there have been no new gasoline refineries \nin 10 years. So if we look at our increased dependence on foreign oil, \nincreased price of natural gas, no nuclear plants--nuclear is 22 \npercent of our stationary energy--no new gasoline refineries, no new \ncoal-fired plants, and to top it off, we find our capacity to transmit \nour natural gas and electricity is inadequate. Why? Because we have \nbecome more of an electronic society. We leave our computers on; we \nleave our air-conditioning on. We could, perhaps, buy a more fuel-\nefficient refrigerator and use half of the energy, but if the old one \nisn't worn out, you won't do it.\n  The point is that the ``perfect storm'' has come together in the \nsense of energy. We have an energy crisis. As a consequence of that \ncrisis, I would have hoped that we would be debating how to address \nthis energy situation as opposed to debating the merits of a national \nmonument determination that\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nisn't going to result in any significant activity, other than some of \nthe media might be misled that it is going to terminate any activity in \nareas of national monuments, which it will not. We have skyrocketing \nenergy prices, gas shortages, and I guess I will conclude with a \nreference to, again, how important energy is, how we have a tendency to \ntake it for granted.\n  You know, the American standard of living is based on one thing: \naffordable and adequate supplies of energy. That is why we prosper. If \nwe don't keep up with the increased demand by increasing the supply by \nconservation, alternatives, renewables, we are going to jeopardize that \nstandard of living. And with it goes our economic security, and with it \ngoes our national security.\n  I think we all feel exposed to the potential of being held hostage by \na foreign leader such as Saddam Hussein. We have our job security at \nrisk--to keep Americans working and create more jobs. Energy certainly \npowers our workplace. It moves the economy--moves it forward and brings \neach of us along with it, giving us personal security and flexibility \nto live our lives as we choose. We saw in California what happens when \nstoplights don't work and when the elevators become jammed.\n  I think we have to focus in on what we must do for American \nfamilies--the consumers--and address the reality that we do have a \ncrisis. I am going to conclude with a reference to something that I \nthink America sells itself short on in times such as this, and that is \nAmerica's technology and ingenuity. We have the capability to meet the \nchallenges associated with a responsible environmental sensitivity and \nthe reality that we can do things better. But there is no magic to it. \nSomebody has to produce this energy. It has to come from some \nidentifiable source. I am speaking primarily of what moves America, and \nright now that is oil. I wish we had another alternative, but for the \nforeseeable future, we simply do not.\n  As a consequence of that reality, we have before us an energy plan. I \nintend to work cooperatively with Senator Bingaman toward a chairman's \nmark. We have an outline given by the President and the Vice President \nand their energy task force report. So I guess everybody is waiting, if \nyou will, on the process in the Senate. It is moving in the House. The \nHouse is moving on an energy bill. We should be moving on it here. I am \nvery pleased to see that it is now in the Democratic leadership's \nrecommendations of activities. We haven't gotten a schedule on it at \nthis time, but I hope we will in the very near future.\n\n  So, again, to get back to the debate at hand with regard to the \namendment, prohibiting preleasing-related activities within national \nmonuments by disallowing any funding and, yet, recognizing in the \namendment to the extent that such a preleasing or other related \nactivities is allowed under the Presidential proclamation establishing \nthe monument, would seem that the amendment is neutral to the issue of \nsupply, neutral to the issue of whether or not there is any authority \nfor oil or gas and mineral activity within any new national monuments \nthat might be created in the future is certainly not applicable to \nthose already in existence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe all debate on this amendment is \ncompleted, and the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on or \nin relation to the Durbin amendment occur at 4:10 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to table the Durbin amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator to allow \nan amendment to his motion to table--that there be no second-degree \namendments allowed to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request to have the vote occur at 4:10 \np.m.?\n  Mr. BURNS. I move that the Durbin amendment be tabled, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays, which vote will occur at the agreed time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, the Senate needs to address the request \nraised by the Senator from Nevada of having the vote at 4:10 p.m. He \npropounded a unanimous consent request to have the vote at 4:10 p.m. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, what is the request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, \nwe will have a motion to table the amendment at 4:10 p.m. today, and \nprior to the vote there will be no second-degree amendments to the \nDurbin amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. A vote on the motion to table would occur at 4:10 p.m. \ntoday.\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada asked unanimous \nconsent the vote occur at 4:10 p.m. There has been no objection. The \nSenator from Montana has moved to table and asked for the yeas and nays \nat 4:10.\n  Mr. BURNS. And the vote occur at the agreed time at 4:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BYRD. What was the request, ``and then 4:15''?\n  Mr. BURNS. The meeting with the President and the group downtown was \nnot in until 4:15. We are going to begin the vote at 4:10 and they will \nhave time to vote; 4:15 had nothing to do with it. We agreed at 4:10 to \ntable the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second on the motion to table.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New Jersey be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Torricelli are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote now \nscheduled for 4:10, on a motion to table, be rescheduled to 4:20. This \nhas been cleared with the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 10 minutes or so, the Senate will be \nvoting on my pending amendment. I believe the Senator from Montana has \nbeen given authority to offer a motion\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nto table the amendment. But I want my colleagues who come to this \nChamber to understand what the nature of this amendment is because it \nis very simple and straightforward.\n  My amendment will simply prohibit new mineral leases from being \nissued in designated national monuments. It does not affect any \nexisting, valid right, or prevent leasing in any area that was \nauthorized for mineral activity when the monument was established.\n  That description is pretty legal. Let me try to translate it so that \nthose who have not followed this debate will understand what is at \nissue.\n  We have designated, in this country, various national monuments. \nThese are tracts of land which Presidents of the United States, since \nTeddy Roosevelt, have set aside saying that they have special \nimportance and value to the future of our country. These tracts of land \nhave been set aside by all but three Presidents since President \nRoosevelt. President Nixon, President Reagan, and former President Bush \ndid not establish national monuments. Virtually every other President--\nDemocrat and Republican alike--made these designations. And, of course, \nthis national monument land occasionally will mature into something \nwhich Congress decides is of great value.\n  When you look at former national monuments, they include the Grand \nCanyon--designated first as a national monument--Glacier Bay, Zion \nNational Park, and Acadia National Park.\n  So though I use the term ``national monument,'' most Americans are \nfamiliar with the term ``national park.'' Although they are not the \nsame legally, the fact is that many of our national parks began as \nnational monuments.\n  We have taken great care when it comes to these national monuments to \nsay that they are so special and important that we will be careful what \nwe do with them once we have designated them as treasures for our \nNation to protect.\n  The reason I have offered this amendment is that we have had a clear \nindication from the current administration and the White House--\nPresident George W. Bush and his Secretary of the Interior, Gale \nNorton--that they are now going to explore the options of drilling for \noil and gas and mining minerals in this national monument space \ndesignated by the previous administration.\n  The House of Representatives, when they considered this, on a strong \nbipartisan rollcall, agreed with my amendment and said we should \nprohibit this administration and this White House from drilling for oil \nand gas in national monument tracts across America.\n  This land is too valuable to our Nation, it is too valuable to our \nnational heritage, to say to any oil company or gas drilling company or \nmining company: Please come take a look at our national monuments as a \npossible place to drill and to make a profit.\n  Some will argue--and they have in this Chamber--that it is \nshortsighted for us to limit any drilling for oil and gas or the mining \nof minerals at a time when our Nation faces a national energy crisis or \nan energy challenge. I disagree. Of all of the Federal land owned in \nthe United States by taxpayers, 95 percent of it is open to oil and gas \ndrilling and mining. We have said, if you can find those resources on \nthat public land, we believe it will not compromise the environment nor \njeopardize an important national treasure to go ahead and drill. But \nfor 5 percent--one acre out of 20--of Federal public lands which we \nhave designated as special lands--monuments; some may someday be a \nnational park--in those lands we do not want to have that kind of \nexploration and economic exploitation.\n\n  If some step back and say: You must be turning your back on a great \namount of energy resources if the Durbin amendment is enacted and \nprohibits the oil and gas drilling on these national monument lands, in \nfact, that is not the case at all. The U.S. Geologic Service did a \nsurvey of these national monument lands to determine just how much oil \nand gas there would be available. After they had done their survey, \nthey established that all of the monuments I have protected with this \namendment all of them combined have economically recoverable oil as a \nportion of total U.S. consumption that amounts to 15 days, 12 hours, \nand 28 minutes of energy. When it comes to gas: 7 days, 2 hours, and 11 \nminutes in terms of our national energy consumption. It is a tiny, \nminuscule, small part of the energy picture.\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues from other States talk about \nour energy crisis. You would believe that the only way we could keep \nthe price of a gallon of gasoline under control is to allow the oil \ncompanies to go in and drill on lands that have been set aside by \nadministrations to be protected because of their important historic and \nnatural value to the United States. That is not the case.\n  In fact, there are many things we can and should do to deal with our \nenergy crisis. I do not believe we have reached a point where this \nenergy crisis or challenge should be used as a battering ram to beat \ndown that which we hold sacred in this country. I think it is pretty \nclear, on a bipartisan basis, that at least Senators in this Chamber do \nnot want to see us drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, as President Bush has proposed.\n  I think it is also clear when it comes to drilling off our coastal \nshores, there are many States, including the State of Florida--\ncoincidentally, governed by a man with the same surname as the \nPresident--that don't want to see drilling offshore. They think it is \ntoo dangerous when it comes to spoiling the beaches and the \nrecreational activity that are part of the States of Florida, \nCalifornia, and others.\n  This amendment says there is also an area of America we should take \ncare not to exploit as well, and it is the national monument space.\n  The Senator from Montana has offered a motion to table my amendment. \nHe opposes it. He has stated his position very effectively. But I would \nimplore my colleagues on both sides to understand that this is a \nbipartisan amendment. It is an amendment which was supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives because when \nit comes to conservation and the protection of our natural resources, \nwhy in the world should this be a partisan issue?\n  Teddy Roosevelt was a great Republican. Franklin Roosevelt was a \ngreat Democrat. All of these Presidents set aside land that was \nimportant for future generations.\n  I am certain that some Republican President--either now or in the \nfuture--will do the same. And I hope that Democratic Members of \nCongress will respect it. But if we are going to show respect for these \nnational monuments, we have to understand that allowing for the \ndrilling of oil and gas runs the risk of spoiling a national treasure.\n\n  I have asked my colleagues to also consider the fact that the Bureau \nof Land Management has told us that 95 percent of the Federal land is \nalready open for this kind of exploration to find these sources of \nenergy. We are not closing that down.\n  This amendment makes it very clear that if there is a national \nmonument designated somewhere where they have established that oil and \ngas drilling will not jeopardize it, that will continue. If it is an \nexisting lease, this amendment does not affect it. The only impact it \nwill have is on the national monument space designated by the previous \nadministration.\n  One of my colleagues from the State of Utah came to this Chamber and \nwas clearly disappointed, to say the least, by the designation of a \nnational monument in his State. The fact is, the national monument is \nthere. We are saying, with this amendment: Keep the oil companies, keep \nthe gas companies, keep the mining companies off of that national \nmonument land.\n  In 1906, Teddy Roosevelt established Devils Tower in Wyoming as our \nfirst national monument. I take great pride in hoping that the Senate \nwill carry on in his tradition of standing up to special interest \ngroups which, frankly, want to make a profit; they want to come in and \ndrill on Federal public land, land owned by all of us as taxpayers to \nmake a profit. They are in business to make a profit. But I invite them \nto make that profit in other places, not on these lands that have a \nspecial import and a special significance for all of Americans living \ntoday and for future generations.\n  This administration has been challenged for the last 6 months on \nenvironmental issues. They have not been as sensitive as they should \nhave. The\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nAmerican people have said, overwhelmingly, they want an administration \nin the White House that understands that though energy is important, we \ncannot compromise important values in this country such as \nenvironmental protection and protecting our national monument lands.\n  I hope this Senate, on a strong bipartisan vote, will reject the \nmotion to table offered by the Senator from Montana and will enact the \nDurbin amendment which protects these lands and says to the Bush White \nHouse: Help us find other sources of energy, other sources of energy \nthat do not compromise important and pristine areas in this country.\n  There are things we can and should do as a nation to deal with \nenergy: Sustainable, renewable, clean energy; finding ways to conserve; \nhaving Congress accept its responsibility when it comes to fuel \nefficiency in the vehicles that we drive.\n  These are the things that are going to help us be a better nation in \nthe 21st century. To stick with the philosophy and notion of the 19th \nand 20th centuries, to drill and burn our way into the future is so \nshortsighted. To think we would even consider going to lands such as \nnational monument land that has such special value to every American \ncitizen would be a serious mistake.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against the motion to table and, \nonce it has been defeated, to support the passage of the Durbin \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nsummarize my argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will be very short.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BURNS. The figures the Senator cited are from a USGS survey taken \nin 1995. Those figures have changed and moved up. No. 2, if he doesn't \nwant people to drill there, where can they drill? How many people in \nthis body or in this town drove an automobile or rode something here \nthat required energy? How many? Do we close off the whole Nation \nbecause somebody is making a profit? Do we take the same mindset into \nagriculture, into production agriculture, as they have in Klamath Falls \nwhere 1,500 farmers cannot irrigate because of a suckerfish? It is a \nmindset.\n  I move to table this amendment for the simple reason that it will \nimpact the country. You say only 5 percent or 2 percent or 1 percent. I \nsay to the Senator: $5 is not very much to some of us. But it is when \nyou don't have it. We have that possibility with this kind of a \nmindset.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider that vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been working with the \ndistinguished managers of the bill. I would like to propound a \nunanimous consent request. I think it has the agreement of both sides. \nI have consulted with the managers of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Nelson amendment be the next order of \nbusiness; that it be debated for a period of 3 hours, equally divided, \nand that the vote occur following the expiration of the 3 hours \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not object. Would the distinguished majority leader \nmake that verbiage ``not to exceed 3 hours''?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would so ask, that it not exceed 3 \nhours; that the time be equally divided, and that there be no second-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority \nleader, I think there were two Nelson amendments, one was a 1-year and \none is a permanent ban. Would you tell us which one this is?\n  Mr. REID. One is a year and one is 6 months.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is the 6-month ban identical to the House \nprovision, amendment No. 893.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to execute a final lease \nagreement for oil and gas development in the area of the Gulf of Mexico \n                      known as ``Lease Sale 181'')\n\n       On page 194, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1   . LEASE SALE 181.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to execute a final lease agreement for oil or gas development \n     in the area of the Gulf of Mexico known as ``Lease Sale \n     181'', as identified in the Outer Continental Shelf 5-Year \n     Oil and Gas Leasing Program, before April 1, 2002.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent the committee amendment be agreed \nto, that the bill as thus amended be considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendment, and that no points of order be waived by \nthis request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, in offering this amendment, \nlet me frame the amendment so everyone understands the context of the \namendment. In the House of Representatives' discussion of the Interior \nappropriations bill some 3 or 4 weeks ago, a bipartisan amendment was \noffered by two Members of Congress from Florida.\n  The amendment that was attached by an overwhelming vote in the House \nof Representatives was with regard to a proposed lease sale, designated \nas 181, in the Gulf of Mexico, for the purpose of drilling for oil and \ngas. The House of Representatives, in a fairly substantial bipartisan \nvote passed a prohibition of the offering of the lease sale for 6 \nmonths. Specifically, this amendment tracks the House amendment \nidentically, in essence saying no money appropriated under this act, \nthe Interior appropriations bill, can be used for the purpose of \noffering for oil and gas drilling lease sale 181.\n  Lease sale 181 was originally proposed as a tract of some 6 million \nacres. It is in the eastern planning area of the gulf, an area that \nheretofore has not been violated with any drilling.\n  When the White House saw that there was considerable opposition, \nalmost unanimous, from the Florida congressional delegation, the White \nHouse scaled back the proposal from approximately 6 million acres to \nsome 1.5 million acres. It is in a location that starts to violate the \neastern planning area of the gulf by some 1.5 million acres, in which \ndrilling for oil and gas could occur.\n  Why am I opposed to that? I could say that clearly the people of \nFlorida have expressed their opinion over and over and over again, in \nhuge numbers, with huge majorities, whether that be in the expressions \nthrough previous bills in previous years, by both the Senate and the \nHouse delegations from Florida, or whether that has been in the body in \nwhich I last served as an elected, statewide cabinet official of the \nState of Florida, in resolutions by the Governor and the cabinet of \nFlorida opposing offshore oil drilling off Florida.\n  Why is there such intensity in Florida about not having drilling in \nthe eastern planning area of the gulf?\n  It is simply this: We have a $50 billion-a-year industry of tourism. \nA lot of that tourism is concentrated along the coast of Florida. The \nGood Lord has given us the beneficent sugary white, powdered sand \nbeaches. The beauty of those beaches has attracted, over decades and \ndecades--indeed, over the last century--people to come to Florida to \nenjoy our beautiful environment.\n  It is without question in most Floridians' minds that they see the \npossibility of oil spills from drilling off of Florida in the eastern \ngulf planning area, and it would, in fact, be a devastating economic \nblow--a spike right to the heart in our $50 billion-a-year tourism \nindustry.\n  Floridians happen to have another reason for not wanting drilling. \nThat is the fact that we are very sensitive about our environment. As a \nmatter of fact, so much of our tourism is inextricably intertwined with \npreserving our environment and protecting it. The bottom line is that \nFloridians simply do not want waves of oil lapping onto the beaches.\n  I think we will hear testimony today by those who are on the opposite \nside of the issue who will say that drilling for oil and gas in the \noffshore Outer Continental Shelf has, in fact, became a lot safer. That \nwell may be the case. But the fact is that according to the Minerals \nManagement Service, the chance of an oil spill in lease sale 181 is all \nthe way up to a 37-percent chance. Floridians simply do not want to \ntake the risk of a 37-percent chance of an oil spill and that slick \nfloating across the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and washing up onto \nthe beaches of Florida where so much of our prized environment is \ndisplayed for the wonderful people who come to enjoy the natural bounty \nand beneficence of Florida.\n  I want to draw your attention to this map of the Gulf of Mexico. This \nmap is very revealing with regard to the Florida story. I have talked \nto Senators in this Chamber who have had the White House tell them \ntheir side of the story. When they see this map, they say: I had no \nidea it was like that.\n  This map tells a completely different story. The story they are being \ntold by the White House is that a compromise has been made that is \nacceptable, a compromise in which originally lease sale 181 included 6 \nmillion acres, part of which was this stovepipe that came up close to \nthe Alabama shoreline, which was, in fact, within about 30 miles of \nPerdido Key, which is our western most beach in the State of Florida.\n  What they are being told by the White House is that the compromise of \nshrinking lease sale 181 is acceptable because it narrows it down, as \nrepresented here by the yellow, to a tract of 1.5 million acres instead \nof 6 million. They point out that it is 100 miles from Pensacola Beach, \nand that it is some 280 miles from Clearwater and St. Petersburg. \nWhereas, the original lease sale 181 was 213 miles from the west coast \nof Florida, and still 100 miles from here up at the top of the \nstovepipe. Of course, it was much closer.\n  But what they are not telling is the full story, and that is what I \nwanted to show with this map.\n  The green color indicates the existing drilling leases in the Gulf of \nMexico. Beyond this boundary is the eastern planning area in which \nthere is no drilling for the simple reason that Floridians have \ninsisted each year that the threat is too great and the risk is too \ngreat to despoil our beaches and our environment.\n  As well as that, the estimated future reserves were expected to be \nvery little. In all of the Outer Continental Shelf, which includes not \nonly the Atlantic seaboard, all of the gulf, as well as the Outer \nContinental Shelf off of the west coast of the United States, \nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington, 80 percent of the future gas \nreserves are estimated to be in the area that is already being drilled \nin the Gulf of Mexico--not in the eastern gulf planning area. And 60 \npercent of the future oil reserves are estimated to be in that area \nthat is already being drilled known as the western gulf planning area \nand the central planning area--not in the eastern planning area.\n\n  We come to the table quite naturally to make our case to the Senate, \nhaving had the case overwhelmingly made to the House already that if \nthe future reserves are mostly off the States of Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, the area already being drilled, and the \nfuture reserves are not here, why take the risk of an oil spill that \nwould despoil some of the world's most beautiful beaches that support \nthe economy of Florida. To repeat myself, the Minerals Management \nService says the chance of a spill in lease sale 181 is up to 37 \npercent. That is a risk simply not worth taking.\n  I think this map tells the whole story. This area has not been \nviolated--an area called the eastern planning area. Now in the attempt \nat a so-\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\ncalled compromise, the White House is pushing 1.5 million acres that \nnow go eastward into this area that has not been violated in the past.\n  As you can see, with all of this drilling activity, that yellow spot \nright there on this map of the gulf is what I call the proverbial \ncamel's nose under the tent. You can see that dirty little nose \nsticking underneath the edge of that tent.\n  What is going to happen in the future? That camel is going to start \ncrawling into that tent, and that drilling is going to proceed in an \ninevitable march eastward straight for Tampa Bay. The people of Florida \nthink that is too much of a risk.\n\n  We could talk about energy and a lot of the things that we ought to \nbe doing that are not the subject of this particular amendment, but I \nam compelled to bring up the fact that, goodness gracious, if we but \nimprove the miles per gallon for new automobiles manufactured--and \nthere is another very controversial lease sale, the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge--by 3 miles per gallon on all new vehicles--not the \nexisting vehicles, new vehicles--it would save the equivalent amount of \nenergy that would be produced by all of the oil to be drilled in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  So as we approach an energy crisis--and I am looking forward to \nhaving a debate when the Department of Energy authorization bill comes \nto this Chamber--what Senator Graham of Florida and I will probably be \noffering at that point is a complete moratorium. But for purposes of \nthis Interior appropriations bill, I am offering an amendment that is \nidentical to what was adopted in the House so that if adopted here this \nwill not be an issue in the conference committee but, rather, would be \naccepted in the conference committee and would become a 6-month \nmoratorium on the offering of this lease sale.\n  So perhaps what we ought to do is to rethink the White House's energy \npolicy of drill, drill, drill. Drill in the areas where the future \nreserves are already proven. Drill in the areas where the States do not \nobject to the drilling off their shore. Drill in the area where a State \nsuch as Louisiana really does not have the God-given beaches, the white \nsand beaches that we have in Florida that are so much a part of our \neconomy.\n  Save energy by conservation. Use our technological prowess to produce \nan automobile that will have a much higher miles-per-gallon average.\n  I had the pleasure of riding in one of these hybrids. I could not \nbelieve it. It was just as comfortable. The car was just as roomy. The \ncar had just as much pickup. In the hot summer Florida Sun, the air-\nconditioning worked just as well as any other car. All of the \nelectrical demands of radio and CDs and tape players were all there, \nwith no sacrifice.\n  As we drove down the road, I, as the passenger, could not help but \nhave my eyes riveted to the TV screen in the middle of the console that \nshowed how the engine would be running partly from the gasoline and \npartly from the battery, and when it was not running from the battery, \nthat the battery, in fact, was recharging--a vehicle known as a hybrid. \nAnd I was astounded for my host, the driver, the owner of the vehicle, \nto tell me that, in fact, this hybrid got a total, in city driving, of \n53 miles per gallon.\n  Can you imagine, if we used our technological prowess to get serious \nabout our automobile and transportation fleets, how much energy we \ncould save. Regardless of what we do here, I think that makes just \ngood, sound national energy policy and that we ought to pursue using \nour technology to improve our miles per gallon.\n  But I bring that point up to say that we have an old country \nexpression in Florida: There are many ways to skin a cat. And you don't \njust have to skin that cat by saying: We are going to drill, drill, \ndrill; and we are going to do it to the risk of a $50 billion a year \ntourism economy in Florida. We know in this Nation what the spill of \nthe Exxon Valdez tanker did to the shores of Alaska. We also know what \nthe winds and the wave currents can do with an oil slick in carrying it \nhundreds of miles within days. And, ladies and gentlemen, Senators all, \nit is not fair and it is not worth the risk to Pensacola and Fort \nWalton Beach and Destin and Panama City and Mexico Beach, and all these \nfragile areas of the ecosystem around Apalachicola Bay, and the big \nbend of Florida, and down into Cedar Key and the mouth of the Suwannee \nRiver, and coming on down to the white sand beaches of Clearwater Beach \nand St. Petersburg, and then into the very fragile ecosystems of Tampa \nBay, and on south from Manatee County and Bradenton, all the way south \npast Sarasota, down near Charlotte, and into Fort Myers--some of the \nmost beautiful beaches in the world--and south of Fort Myers to \nNaples--one of the hottest spots for new people to come to Florida and \nenjoy the environment of Florida--just south of there to Marco Island--\na place known as the ``Ten Thousand Islands''--one of the most \nproductive fisheries in the world, and not to speak of coming on around \ninto the Florida Straits into this beautiful land known as the Florida \nKeys--something that ballads have made famous by people such as Jimmy \nBuffett who would tell you the same thing that I am telling you today: \nIt is not worth the risk to the Florida environment nor to our economy. \nThat 37-percent risk of oil drilling off of Florida could produce an \noilspill that would become a slick that could travel, by wind and wave \naction, miles within days to despoil these Florida beaches.\n\n  So I make a plea on behalf of 16 million Floridians that the Senate \nwill debate this, understand it. Do not confuse it by saying that this \nline is not over the Alabama line. Where is the Alabama line? The \nAlabama-Florida line is up here as shown on this map. These are the \nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico. And this line right here is the line of \ndemarcation, the beginning of the eastern gulf planning area that has \nnever been violated by drilling.\n  So do not listen to the arguments that this is not over the line. \nThis is over the line, 1\\1/2\\ million acres over the line. That simply \nis not worth the risk to us.\n  There are others who have a similar set of circumstances. I want to \nremind the Senators, the Senators of the Great Lakes, they do not want \ndrilling off their shores. The Senators of New England, especially off \nof Maine, and that great lobster industry, they do not want the \ndrilling off of their shores. The Senators of the eastern seaboard, \nwith all of their tourism and ecological activities, don't want the \ndrilling there. The Senators off the west coast of the United States \ndon't want the drilling there either.\n\n  The fact is, the drilling has not occurred here for years because the \nfuture reserves are simply not there.\n  I am expecting others and I expect to be joined by my senior Senator, \nMr. Graham. What I will do is reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the time \nsequence and who is in control of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours evenly divided on this \namendment, and the Senator from Florida has used 25 minutes. There is \nan hour and a half remaining on the opposing side.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 10 minutes from the time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, the subject matter is energy. I just \ncame from a meeting with the Vice President and a group of Senators, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, who are trying to see what we can do as \na Congress to come up with an energy policy that makes sense for this \ncountry.\n  It is very clear that the United States at this time is in dire \ncircumstances with regard to where we get energy, how much we get, and \nhow much it costs. Over the last several weeks and the last couple of \nmonths, we have seen the price of gas go up. We have seen people \npanicking because they cannot afford their electricity bills because of \nthe high price of natural gas. We see the uncertainty of areas of this \ncountry suffering blackouts and businesses having to close and suffer \neconomic damage because they don't have enough energy.\n  At the same time, we import 57 percent of the energy we consume every\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nday from foreign sources. Many of these foreign sources are \nundependable. They are not our allies, and they certainly do not have \nthe best interests of the United States as the premise for their \noperations. Yet 57 percent of our energy comes from overseas. It comes \nfrom organized cartels that regularly do things for which, if done in \nthis country, they would go to the penitentiary.\n  What they do every day is fix prices of energy that we have to buy \nfrom them. They tell us how much we are going to have to pay by \ncontrolling the amount they produce. Yet we as a nation, in the year \n2001, have been comfortable with allowing that type of energy policy to \ngovern how we exist when it comes to energy supplies.\n  If we imported 57 percent of the food we eat, people would be \nmarching on the capital of this country saying that is an unacceptable \ncondition because food obviously is important to our national security \nand the way we live in America. That is absolutely true. But it is no \nless true that when we import 57 percent of the energy, that is an \nunacceptable set of circumstances we must address.\n  How do we address it? Unfortunately, one of the ways that we have, \nover the years and over several administrations and over several \nCongresses, was to say what we were not going to do. We have said that \nwe are not going to look for oil in the Outer Continental Shelf, which \nhas some of the most promising resources of any place in the world off \nthe coast of the United States; that we are not going to do anything \nfrom Canada to the Florida Keys because those areas are too valuable \nand should not be touched; and through congressional moratoriums and \nthrough Presidential moratoriums, basically everything from Key West to \nthe border of Canada is off limits: Don't touch it.\n  In addition to that, when we look over to the west coast, which \nhappens to have some of the States that consume by far the greatest \namount of energy per capita, we have said, through moratoriums, both \ncongressional and Presidential, that we are not going to do anything \nfrom Canada on the west coast all the way to Mexico on our southern \nborder because those areas are pristine, they are nice, we should not \nhave the potential for having an oil spill.\n  The only area of our Outer Continental Shelf in which we have had \nproduction, which produces the greatest amount of natural gas, the \ngreatest amount of oil and gas, and has done so for the last 60 years, \nof the offshore areas is the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We have said we are not going to touch ANWR. We are not going to \ntouch the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We will not touch the \nmonuments. We will not touch the east coast. We are not going to touch \nthe west coast. But go drill for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n  I represent Louisiana. I am happy with that policy because it \nprovides jobs. It provides energy. We make a contribution to solving \nthe energy policy of this country. We understand it. We have developed \nthe industry. We know its faults. We know what it can do and what it \ncannot do, and we have done it for 60 years. The technology that has \nbeen developed in the Gulf of Mexico is the technology that is used \nworldwide.\n  Less than 2 percent of the oil that is spilled in the oceans of the \nworld comes from offshore exploration and production activities. Where \ndoes it come from? It comes from seepage, which is natural. It comes \nfrom ballast discharges from ships. And it comes from rusty, leaky \ntankers that import oil from all over the world.\n  The Senator from Florida mentioned the Exxon Valdez. That was not a \ndrilling accident, that was a ship accident. That was a tanker \ndelivering oil, as they do every day to the ports of the United States, \nwhere we import 57 percent of the oil that we use, coming to this \ncountry in tankers that have a far greater risk than any risk that \npossibly could occur from drilling activities in the offshore waters of \nthe United States.\n  The State of Florida, under a Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles, our \ngood friend and our former colleague with whom I served in the Senate, \nand a Democratic President of the United States--at that time, \nPresident Clinton--reached an agreement on lease sale 181. It was \nproposed under a Democratic administration, and it was agreed to by a \nDemocratic Governor. The original sale has the potential to supply \nFlorida with as much as 7 years of the natural gas they use every day \nto cool their homes in the summer and to possibly heat their homes if \nit gets cold enough in the winter months. That sale can provide 7 years \nof their natural gas supplies.\n  They import 99 percent of the natural gas they use. Yet now they say: \nWe are going to object to a sale that has been worked out, carefully \ncrafted, proposed by a Democratic administration, approved by a \nprevious Democratic Governor, because it has the potential to damage \ntheir coastline.\n  We have done that in Louisiana for 60 years. While the beaches of \nFlorida may be prettier than the beaches of Louisiana, I argue that the \nvalue of the coastal estuarial area is no less valuable in Louisiana \nand Texas and Alabama and Mississippi than it is on the coast of \nFlorida. In fact, I argue that the coastal estuaries of Louisiana are \nfar more important in the sense that they are the habitat for \nwaterfowl, for ducks, and for geese, and for finfish, and for shrimp, \nand for oysters, and for fur-bearing animals, alligators, everything \nthat is important to an ecosystem.\n  We have been able to preserve those areas and to do so while \nproducing the largest amount of oil and gas for our neighbors in the \nother 49 States in the history of this country. We have done so \nsuccessfully. We have done so in a balanced fashion, and we have done \nso with a minimum impact. Is it perfect? Of course not, but nothing is \nperfect.\n  It is fine to drive around in battery-operated cars. I am all for \nthat. It is great to have windmills, and it is great to have geothermal \npower. What is not great is to import 57 percent of our energy from \nforeign sources which are undependable and unacceptable. What if we \nstart blocking the Gulf of Mexico? Are we going to fight to open up \nCalifornia? Are we going to fight to open up George's Banks? That is \nnot going to happen.\n  I daresay we make a very serious mistake to say: Oh, let them do it \nover there, but not in my backyard. We will consume; we want it cheap; \nwe want a plentiful supply; but, by golly, don't do it in my backyard. \nDo it somewhere else. We are too good to have oil and gas production \noff our coast because our beaches are clean.\n  Well, my beaches and coastline are also very valuable, but we also \nshow that it can be done in a compatible fashion to produce energy \nneeds for this country and at the same time preserve and protect the \nenvironment and wetlands.\n  The Democratic bill offered by the chairman, Senator Bingaman, calls \nfor going forward with lease sale 181. A Democratic President proposed \nlease sale 181, and a previous Democratic Governor of the State of \nFlorida approved lease sale 181. I don't know what has happened, and I \ndon't understand the politics of it, but something has changed. The \nadministration, in an effort to say, all right, we are going to do \nsomething--I think what they did was terrible. They took sale 181 and \ncut it by 75 percent. They said we are going to cut out 75 percent of \nthe size of this lease sale and only allow 25 percent. I think that was \na terrible decision. I told them that.\n  For them to now say Congress has to come in and postpone all of \nthat--even the 25 percent remaining--is absolutely, in my opinion, \nunacceptable. If we are going to have an energy policy in this country \nthat makes sense, we are going to have to have a balanced policy. I \nsuggest that saying ``not in my backyard, never, ever, don't want to \nsee it, let's get it from somebody else'' is unacceptable, not prudent, \nand is bad public policy. I think it is something that should not be \nadopted. At the appropriate time, I am sure we will have a vote on \nthis. I hope colleagues will join with me in saying that at least in \nthe Gulf of Mexico--if we can have it nowhere else--we will be willing \nto have a reasonable exploration program in an area where we have \nalready done it for the past 60 years.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time?\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I listened to my colleague and friend \nfrom Florida on his amendment that would basically block any production \nin a large area of waters, not only off the coast of Florida, but also \noff Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n  I have great respect for State sovereignty and for listening to \nSenators who are dealing with areas surrounding their States. When they \ntalk about the Everglades, I want to listen. I want them to listen to \nme when I talk about Oklahoma. I have a tendency to give great \ndeference to Senators from their home States. I think the Senators from \nAlaska know Alaska much better than we do, and we should listen when \nthey have recommendations to make about their lands, the development of \nit, and the balance of policies.\n  I also think we should listen to Governors. I know this lease sale \n181 was somewhat controversial. I was kind of disappointed. I know \noriginally Governor Bush of Florida was opposed to it. He is not \nopposed to the modification. The amendment of the Senator from Florida \nwould stop any lease in this entire area. This lease, as modified, has \nbeen reduced by 75 percent. The lease that we now have, which the \nadministration has negotiated with the Governors of Florida, Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana, has been agreed to by all of the Governors, \nincluding the Governor of Florida.\n  So I am thinking, wait a minute, I want to listen to the Senator from \nFlorida and give him some deference, but this is not just off the coast \nof Florida. This is not even close to the coast of Florida. This is 285 \nmiles from Tampa--285 miles. If someone visits the coast of California, \nthey will see a lot of rigs that are in State-controlled waters. That \nis within 3 miles of the coast of California, which also prides itself \non beautiful beaches and shoreline. They don't want those desecrated in \nany way. Neither do I. I happen to be a fan of the beaches, and I want \nto keep them as pristine as possible. But I want to use common sense, \ntoo--285 miles from Tampa, 138 miles from Panama City, 100 miles from \nPensacola.\n  I heard my colleague say, ``This is in Florida waters.'' It is not in \nFlorida waters. This actually goes down the borderline, and it is on \nthe Alabama side. The negotiated deal--and maybe this was to get the \nGovernor of Florida to support this deal, but all of the lands directly \nsouth of Florida were taken out of the lease.\n  I agree with my colleague from Louisiana; I think the administration \ngave up too much in the negotiation. They took a lot of potential \narea--area that is well beyond the boundaries--and said we are not \ngoing to ever look at those lands. I heard my colleague from Florida \nsay that there is not much there. Well, we don't know because there \nhasn't been any exploration. There is not simultaneous desecration of \nthe beaches because somebody happens to do some exploring to find out \nwhether there is any potential for gas.\n  I am bothered by the fact that maybe there are people saying, yes, we \nknow this is an energy problem, but don't touch it in my backyard. I \nunderstand that. But this is not somebody's backyard when it is 285 \nmiles away or it is 100 miles from the closest point to someone's \nState. That is not in their backyard; that is a long way away.\n\n  As a matter of fact, we have formulas that share royalties and lands \nthat are offshore areas that are close to lands and get a higher \nroyalty. This is not close; this is in Federal waters a long way from \nthe State of Florida. The very fact that the Governors of Alabama, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Florida support this modified sale tells me \nit is a reasonable compromise and one that should not be vitiated or \npostponed indefinitely.\n  I know one amendment says to postpone it permanently and another says \nfor a certain period of time. It basically says: We don't want to drill \nor explore or have oil and gas, but, incidentally, we would like to \nhave a pipeline to run from Mobile, AL, down to southern Florida \nbecause we are going to need gas.\n  As a matter of fact, the State of Florida is the third largest \nconsumer of petroleum products in the country. Yet they are saying \ndon't drill or touch or explore anywhere hundreds of miles from our \ncoast. I find that to be inconsistent. Are we going to say you don't \nget to use natural gas or oil? Don't they use oil and gas? Yes, they \nare the third largest consumer of petroleum products in the country. It \nis a growing State and a beautiful State. There is nothing inconsistent \nwith having some exploration off the gulf coast.\n  If you listen to my colleagues from Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama, there is a lot of drilling off the coast of Louisiana. If you \nlook at the map in the Venice area, and so on, there is a lot of \nactivity in those areas. They have been able to do it in ways that \npreserve the beautiful environment of southern Louisiana and \nMississippi. Southern Mississippi and southern Alabama also have a \ncoast, and they have casinos, and they have a lot of tourism in those \nareas. They are concerned about them. It can be done in an \nenvironmentally safe and compatible manner and in a way that provides \nenergy resources that are needed to keep the lights on, to keep the \njobs going, to keep the economy growing, to keep the tourists renting \ncars and visiting the beaches and enjoying the Florida coast.\n  To say we want to have a moratorium on any exploration this far \nremoved--285 miles from Tampa or 100 miles from the coastal point in \nFlorida--I think goes way too far. At some point, somebody is going to \nhave to say, wait a minute; use a little common sense.\n  I do not think, with all due respect, this amendment should be \nadopted. I understand the intention. I do not question the motivation \nof my colleagues from Florida for offering the amendment, but when the \nFlorida Governor supports this modified lease, when the other Governors \nwho are logistically much closer to this potential lease support it, I \nsay let this go forward; let's not block it; let's not block it \nindefinitely; let's not make this dependency on unreliable sources even \ngreater.\n  That is exactly what we are doing. Some people are asking the \nquestion: How did we get into this energy crisis? Why are we importing \n56, 57 percent of our gas needs? And that number will increase as the \nyears go by, especially if we adopt these kinds of amendments.\n  If my colleagues want to increase our dependence on unreliable \nsources, such as in the Middle East, on Saddam Hussein, on people who \nhave political agendas directly contrary to ours, then support this \namendment. It is very shortsighted for energy policy; it is very \nshortsighted for the well-being and future national security of our \ncountry; and it is very shortsighted for the people of Florida who need \nenergy, who happen to live in one of the growing, thriving economies in \nour country which needs energy--oil and gas.\n  This amendment is a serious mistake, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport us. When we make a motion to table the amendment, I urge our \ncolleagues to support that motion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I am not sure who controls the time in \nopposition. I yield whatever time the Senator needs. Ten minutes?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am looking for the brilliant staff to plead my case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will take 5 minutes off the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, so that people who may be watching on \ntheir monitors in their offices can understand a couple things about \nlease sale 181, this lease sale did not happen overnight. As I \nindicated before, when President Clinton was serving in office\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nand negotiating with Governor Lawton Chiles --two Democrats--on this \nlease sale 181, President Clinton said: We are going to set off limits \nall the areas in the eastern gulf, but we are going to have lease sale \n181.\n  In 1996 when they released the plan, the Governor of Florida, Lawton \nChiles, expressed his appreciation for Minerals Management designating \nlease sale 181 to not be within 100 miles of the coast of Florida. It \nis 70 miles off the coast of Louisiana. It is much closer to Louisiana, \nbut in no case is it within 100 miles of the coast of Florida. It is \n285 miles from Tampa, 213 miles from their coast, 138 miles from Panama \nCity. It is only 70 miles, as I indicated, from the coast of Louisiana.\n  In 1996 when we had a Democratic Governor and a Democratic President, \nthey thought this compromise was fine and agreed to the compromise at \nthat time and said this is something that fits into our plans for \nenergy and thank you very much for making sure it does not come within \n100 miles of the coast of Florida. That was their agreement.\n  It has proceeded forward under those terms until, because of \nopposition of the current Governor of Florida, the administration \nlopped off 75 percent of the sale in addition to that agreement in \n1996. This amendment takes the remaining 25 percent and says we cannot \nhave that either.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma has indicated, when one is talking about \na balanced energy policy in the country, this is something that is not \nacceptable.\n\n  The other point I will make is we have done exploration in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico for decades. This is not a first movement into \nthe eastern Gulf of Mexico. Drilling for natural gas and oil has \noccurred in the eastern Gulf of Mexico for more than three decades. For \nmore than three decades we have had activities off the Destin Dome, \nwhich I happen to love, which is a beautiful part of the country. I \nspent many summers on the beautiful beaches in Destin.\n  They have not gotten anything. They have had extensive exploratory \nwells. Shell had in the past a bunch of dry holes right off Pensacola.\n  We have been drilling in the eastern gulf for three decades. I \nsuggest it has been done without any problems, without any spills or \nanything of that nature.\n  We have a compromise based on a compromise based on a compromise. Yet \ntoday we have an effort to say even those compromises are unacceptable.\n  If you have a State that imports 99 percent of the natural gas they \nconsume, they, too, have an obligation to help contribute to the supply \nof something that is clearly the cheapest burning fuel in the world.\n  Unfortunately the area they knocked off, the top area, is the area \nthat has the greatest potential for natural gas because the natural gas \nfields are flowing off the coast of Louisiana, moving in a northeast \nway. All the activity has been in that area. That is where the natural \ngas is. Unfortunately, it has already been removed. That is where most \nof the natural gas potential is.\n  As I indicated, the Minerals Management survey said if you have \nwholesale gas, that could supply as much as 14 years of the natural gas \nneeds for the State of Florida. With the reduced area, the projection \nis, even lopping this off, it has enough potential natural gas alone to \nsupply Florida with 7 years of their natural gas needs for cooling, \noperating their industries and businesses, and also for heating in the \nwinter whenever it might be necessary on those rare days.\n  To say this compromise is still not acceptable is, in fact, \nunacceptable and the amendment should be tabled.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know in the State of Louisiana and I know also in the \nState of Texas there is a lot of activity off the coast. I asked my \nstaff to find out what percent of our domestic oil production and gas \nproduction right now comes from the Gulf of Mexico. They told me about \n25 percent of our domestic oil and 30 percent of our gas is produced in \nthose areas.\n  That is a big chunk of our domestic production: A fourth of the oil \nand almost a third of our gas. Has that production caused harm to the \necology, to the environment, to the coast of Louisiana, to the wildlife \nwhich is so abundant in the southern part of the State of Louisiana?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator makes a very good point. I answer his \nquestion with two points. Some in Florida--and I understand their \nargument--say we have beautiful beaches; we do not want oil to be \nspilled around our beaches.\n  I do not want it to happen either. I argue the wetlands in Louisiana, \nwhich are about 25 percent of all the wetlands in North America, with \nthe wildlife--the birds, the ducks, the geese, fish, shrimp, oysters, \nfur-bearing animals, alligators--all of that ecosystem which is \nprobably the most complicated anywhere in the world has been able to \nthrive and do very well in supporting those wildlife features and at \nthe same time support the largest amount of oil and gas production \nanywhere in the world.\n\n  In addition to that, the statistics say what the risk is. Advances in \ntechnology have made this operation the cleanest activity of finding \nenergy anywhere in the world. For example, for the period between 1980 \nand 1999, a 20-year period, 7.4 billion barrels of oil have been \nproduced in the Outer Continental Shelf with less than .001 percent \nspill. That is a 99.999 percent safety record for oil.\n  I dare any industry anywhere to come up with those safety numbers. \nThat shows we can have that kind of activity which produces that amount \nof oil with that little oil spill.\n  If we had a lousy track record out here, the Senator would be correct \nin saying do not put it here because it is going to damage our coast. \nBut if one looks at the last 60 years, one can see what has occurred is \nhuge amounts of production and yet a very insignificant amount of spill \ninto the waters of the ocean.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for one other comment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Isn't the risk of spillage even greater from shipping, \ntanker movements than it is from the production record in the Gulf of \nMexico?\n  Mr. BREAUX. We have been doing this for a long time. I say to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, when I was in the House in the seventies--it \nseems like the Dark Ages now--we wrote the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act. We had the National Academy of Sciences--and it has been \nupdated. This is not the National Petroleum Institute; this is not the \nState of Louisiana, but the National Academy of Sciences said less than \n2 percent of the oil that is spilled in the oceans of the world come \nfrom offshore drilling activity--less than 2 percent. Most of it comes \nfrom tanker discharges with rusty bucket tankers bringing in oil from \nforeign countries, as we have happening in this country, from natural \nseepage, from ballast discharges, and from other activities, allowing \nnonpoint source runoff into the Nation's waters, into rivers, and \nfinding its way into our bodies of water. Less than 2 percent of oil \nthat is spilled in the oceans of the world, the National Academy of \nSciences says, comes from OCS activities.\n  I think that is an enviable record for anyone.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Alaska requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to reflect on some realities associated \nwith this project because I think there is a question as to what the \nrisk is. What is the risk to the residents of Florida? What is the true \nunderstanding of what this risk is? What are we talking about \ndeveloping? We are talking about developing, in this lease sale, a \nsignificant, known deposit of natural gas.\n  When you take natural gas out of the reserve and you take it ashore \nand condition it, basically you are taking out the impurities, the wet \ngas. You are taking the oil that happens to be mixed in it, you are \ntaking it ashore, conditioning it, and then moving the clean gas, in \ntheory, to Tampa where it would be utilized for the benefit of \nFloridians.\n  What is the risk associated with that conditioned gas? It is pretty \nminimal. If you had some kind of fracture of that pipeline, you are not \ntalking about unconditioned gas, which includes oil and various \ncomponents associated with hydrocarbons; you are\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\ntalking about pure, conditioned gas. It would bubble up and dissipate. \nYou are not talking about moving crude oil or the risks associated with \ncrude oil from a pipeline.\n  We have heard of the NIMBY theory: not in my backyard. I think that \nhas been pretty well exercised. But one of the things that is \nfrustrating--obviously, I do not have a constituency in Florida, but I \nam sensitive to the concerns of my friend from Florida relative to what \nis good for his State. But at what point do we have a reasonable \ndefinition of what is offshore of my State or the State of Louisiana or \nany other State? This is 285 miles, in one case, to this area which is \nnow the alternative that has been agreed upon. According to my \nunderstanding, it has been agreed upon by basically all the parties \nconcerned.\n  The Secretary of the Interior modified the boundaries of the lease \nsale in response to the concerns of the State of California, the \nGovernor of California. The indication by this agreement is there will \nbe absolutely no new leases off the coast of Florida. They have \nmodified the sale to one-fourth of the original lease area. What \nconstitutes a reasonable determination of what is offshore? We used to \nhave the 3-mile limit. We have the 12-mile limit. We have the economic \nzone. Now we are 285 miles to 213 miles offshore and we are saying that \nis offshore. I think we have to be reasonable.\n  Therefore, the amendment proposed by my colleague from Florida that \nwould cancel the authorization for even the compromise, I have to state \nin my own opinion, is rather unrealistic.\n  I want to show another chart because I think it reflects a reality \nthat is occurring. That is the NIMBY theory: not in my backyard. We \nhave taken the entire east coast off limits for oil and gas \nexploration. We have taken the entire west coast off limits for \nexploration. We have taken an area of the overthrust belt in Montana, \nColorado, Wyoming, a number of States known to have significant \ndeposits of natural gas. As I recall, it is about 23 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas that was found in this area, known to exist, \navailable for commercial recovery, and with the last administration \nbanning road access into these areas we made these areas off limits. \nWhere is the energy going to come from in this country?\n  If we look at realities associated with the status of the OCS leasing \nprogram as evidenced by the next chart, I think we can get a better \nunderstanding of just what is happening.\n  These are various provinces. These estimates show oil and gas \npotential reserves; whether you start in Washington-Oregon or northern \nCalifornia or central California or southern California, you note and \nidentify reserve estimates of considerable merit. The only problem is \nthe areas were withdrawn from leasing through January 30, 2012.\n  These were done, for the most part, without any public hearing \nprocess before congressional bodies. These were done at the request of \nindividual Members, attaching riders to legislation moving on the \nfloor. So they really have not been subject to any debate. Some have \nbeen included in previous Interior appropriations bills. If you look at \nthe entire east coast, you will look at the North Atlantic area, the \nmid-Atlantic area, the South Atlantic area, all with considerable oil \nand gas potential from the standpoint of estimated reserves. They, too, \nare off limits--everything in the buff color.\n  If we go down to Florida the same thing is true in the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico; it is off limits. The remaining area, the blue area, is off \nthe coast of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The occupant \nof the chair is well versed, obviously, in the significance of what oil \nand gas development does in the State of Louisiana. But why should \nLouisiana alone, and to a degree Texas and Alabama and Mississippi, \nhave to bear the brunt of the requirements of the rest of the Nation \nwhen they do not have to share in any of the impact?\n  The occupant of the chair was very active in CARA legislation last \nyear, which was to suggest that, indeed, these States impacted deserve \nsome consideration associated with the impact of activity off the \nshores of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi--and justifiably \nso. That was not resolved to the satisfaction of those of us who \nsupported it. That was, indeed, unfortunate. We are going to come back \nagain. Because if you are looking to just a few States to support the \nrest of the Nation, those States that have to bear that impact are \nentitled to some consideration. That consideration was to come from the \nFederal account associated with oil and gas funding that came into the \nTreasury.\n  I think we have, if you will, an obligation to address the \nresponsibility of those States that have to bear this burden and have \nnot been given the courtesy, or the consideration of any sharing of \nfunds that go into the general fund, a portion of which should \ncertainly go to these States.\n  As we look at reality, again the red indicates existing leases; the \nbuff color is the national marine sanctuaries; we have my State of \nAlaska here, an area off the Aleutian Islands in Bristol Bay that is \nalso off limits, but we have 31,000 miles of coastline in the State of \nAlaska.\n  What has happened over an extended period of time is not much credit \nhas been given to the capability of the industry to develop oil and gas \nsafely in OCS areas. They have a remarkable safety record. It is not \nperfect by any means, but it is improving with advanced technology and \nwill continue to improve because the consequences of an accident are so \ndevastating. So the interest is certainly there as is American \ningenuity, American know-how, and American capability, to ensure, if \nyou will, that the risk is minimal.\n  Make no mistake about it. I think it is disingenuous, in a sense, to \nsimply take for granted that most of the 50 States enjoy oil and gas, \nand they don't give a moment's consideration that it has to be produced \nfrom somewhere. Somebody has to discover it. Somebody has to produce \nit, refine it, and distribute it. We all take these things for granted.\n\n  When we recognize how significant it is that there are so few areas \nsupporting the rest of the Nation, I think we have to recognize reality \nand where we go from here. If we want to import energy, that is fine. \nThen we are going to be beholding more and more to the merits of the \nOPEC cartel and others who have traditionally had a significant \ncapability in producing energy. But the ramifications of that \ndependence speak for itself. If you look at our relationship with Iraq, \non the one hand we are importing oil and on the other hand we are \nenforcing an air embargo. An air embargo for all practical purposes is \nsimilar to what you do in the ocean when you stop all shipping. That \nkind of an action is potentially an act of war in the minds of many.\n  As a consequence of our increased dependence on foreign energy \nsources, we sacrifice to some extent the national security of this \nNation. We sacrifice as well our oil dependence. We increase our \nbalance of payments. I could go on and on with the dangers associated \nwith increasing dependence on imported oil.\n  I think we should go back again to the chart and ask what is \nreasonable relative to States that do not want oil and gas activity off \ntheir shores. The proposed agreement put together with the cooperation \nof the Secretary of Interior and the Governor was basically three-\nquarters of the area has been withdrawn and we are still looking at \nsomething like 213 or 285 miles offshore. It is certainly beyond the \nreasonable consideration given to the protection of individual States \nfrom oil and gas. This is 100 miles from Pensacola; 100 miles from \nMobile, AL; Biloxi, 123 miles; Venice, 70 miles. It is a long way out \nthere.\n  Again, if you look at the experience of the industry in the Gulf many \nmiles offshore from Louisiana, they are drilling now in 3,000 feet of \nwater. They have developed the technology to have lease sales on 6,000 \nfeet of water.\n  When you have an agreement put together, you have to respect it. What \ndoes the Governor of Florida say about the Secretary's decision? My \nunderstanding is that he supports it. The statement by Governor Jeb \nBush regarding Lease Sale 181 is that today's unprecedented decision \nreflects a significant problem in Florida's fight to protect our \ncoastline. In its defense of Florida's coastal waters, the Department \nof Interior's proposal under President Bush goes far beyond any \nprevious proposals contemplated by\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\npast administrations, including the Clinton and Chiles administrations. \nAs a result, there will be no new drilling in the Lease Sale 181 areas \noff the coast of Florida. That is a statement of the Governor of \nFlorida.\n  There is an agreement. It has been developed as a compromise between \nthe Secretary of Interior, the Governor, and certainly it is beyond the \nreasonable consideration of what point are we going to put our body, so \nto speak, in front of the reality that we have to develop energy in \nthis country. You can say, if 285 miles is too close, why don't we go \n500 miles? Where is the limit? This is truly beyond the limit of \nreasonableness.\n  I think the amendment by the Senator from Florida really is \nunnecessary. You have an agreement now. It appears that most parties \nare happy.\n  Again, if the argument of the Senator from Florida prevails, then to \nwhat extent are we going to limit, if you will, reasonableness in \ndetermining where a lease sale offshore can take place, if one can't \ntake place as proposed in the amendment between 213 and 285 miles \noffshore?\n  For the time being, that pretty well accounts for my opinion as to \nthe necessity of recognizing where energy comes from and the reality \nthat we have a workable compromise which certainly seems fair and \nequitable.\n  When you consider reasonableness on the distance from the coast of \nFlorida, the reality that Florida will benefit in receiving conditioned \ngas from this lease sale and the practicality that if it doesn't go to \nFlorida, Floridians are going to be paying a higher transportation cost \nat least for their gas because that gas will have to come overland from \neither Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama, then across country and down \ninto Florida, Floridians will then be paying undoubtedly a higher \nprice. But the most efficient way to transport their gas is through a \npipeline to Tampa.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Louisiana \nmay proceed under the time in opposition.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida wishes to \nspeak at this time. I will reserve my time after he speaks for about 10 \nminutes and will speak in opposition to the amendment. But in all \nfairness to the proponents, I would be happy to allow him to go first.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 64 minutes. The opponent has \n45 minutes.\n  Without objection, the request of the Senator from Louisiana is \nagreed to.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of \nthe things that have been said on the floor. The Senator from Alaska \nhas referred to the proponents of this amendment throwing their bodies \nin front of the train, a vehicle, or whatever. I gladly do so because \nof the stakes that are in this for the State of Florida.\n  I would like to point out that according to the statistics compiled \nby the Department of Interior, during the period between 1980 and \n1999--almost two decades--some 3 million gallons of oil was spilled \nfrom Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas operations in 73 incidents. In \naddition, in one incident in April of this year, more than 90,000 \ngallons of saltwater and crude oil spilled out of a pipeline in \nAlaska's North Slope, becoming the fourth major incident there.\n  I point out the Department of Interior statistics simply to counter \nthe perception that all of the Senators who have spoken in opposition \nto this amendment, of invading the eastern Gulf by drilling in an area \nwhich heretofore has been off limits to drilling, come from an oil-\nproducing State.\n  What do you expect? They articulate the interests of the economic \nengines of their State. But when they give the impression that, in \nfact, offshore oil drilling is so safe, that there is no risk, and say \ninstead the risk is in tankers, indeed, we know the risk in tankers \nbecause we saw what happened with the Exxon Valdez. But when they point \nout the fact that oil drilling and gas drilling is so safe and there \nare no spills, that is not what the facts say as compiled by the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Some 3 million gallons of oil from Outer Continental Shelf have been \nspilled in 73 incidents in time period between 1980 and 1999.\n  I want to clear up another statement that was made. It is stated \nthere is all this oil out there. That is contrary to all of the \nengineering and the technology we have seen.\n\n  Indeed, let me tell you what has been estimated is in this lease sale \n181. It is not some huge find. In this new lease sale 181, it is, in \nfact, a find of only 10 days' worth--10 days, T-E-N, 1-0--of energy for \nthis country. Is that worth the risk to an industry that needs to \nprotect its beaches and its environment? I say that it is not worth the \ntradeoff. It is not worth the risk.\n  As a matter of fact, the Natural Resources Defense Council has stated \nthat in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where the oil and gas industry has \nbeen pressing to drill--this area that, as you can see, is not \nviolated, including this area shown on the map that is shaded in \nyellow, which is the subject of the lease sale we are trying to block--\nindeed, it said 60 percent of the Nation's undiscovered economically \nrecoverable Outer Continental Shelf oil and 80 percent of the Nation's \nundiscovered economically recoverable Outer Continental Shelf gas is \nlocated in the central and western Gulf of Mexico.\n  So protecting this area that for years we have had a moratorium on \nbecause of its sensitivity to the ecology and economy of the \nsurrounding areas--protecting that area will still leave a vast \nmajority of the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas available \nto the industry.\n  According to one study that even minimizes the risk of an oil spill, \nthe chance of an oil spill in this area is as high as 37 percent. That \nis according to the Minerals Management Service.\n  So I want to respond to my colleagues, all of whom are from oil \nStates, I want to make it very clear to them, this is not a NIMBY \namendment that we are offering. We are not saying: Not in my backyard \nbecause oil rigs might spoil the view from our famous beaches. Indeed, \nwe acknowledge that the latest plan--not the former one but the \nlatest--would keep them out of sight. But Florida is unique in its \ndependence on those beaches, and it is unique on its dependence on the \nvisitors who come to those beaches. Expanding drilling into this \neastern gulf poses a serious risk not only to our precious natural \nresources but also to our entire economy.\n  Tourism is the lifeblood of that economy. It is in the range of $50 \nbillion a year. Nothing could wreck our tourist industry quicker than \nwaves of black oil lapping up on our white-sand beaches, regardless of \nwhether the spill occurred 30 miles offshore or whether it is 100 miles \noffshore.\n  By the administration's own reckoning, the new leases would provide \nonly enough oil and natural gas to meet just a few days of our Nation's \nneeds. Is that worth the risk? Of course not. This is a commonsense \napproach. It is not worth the risk--not to Florida, not to the Nation--\nand it is not worth the risk to an area whose economy is so intertwined \nwith a lot of the population that do not want this drilling.\n  My amendment would prohibit the Interior Department from selling new \noil and gas leases anywhere in this eastern gulf planning area for 6 \nmonths from the time of enactment of this bill--only 6 months. It is \nintended to be a first step toward what I hope Senator Graham and I \nwill be able to offer--and I think we have assurances of offering an \namendment to the Energy Department authorization bill for a \ncontinuation of this moratorium. For the sake of Florida, and for the \nsake of our Nation, I ask for your support.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been consulting with Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. I appreciate very much the help and \ncooperation of both our managers. I am now at a point where I can make \na unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to Senator Nelson's \namendment No. 893 occur tomorrow morning immediately following the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to the House bankruptcy bill, \nH.R. 333,\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nand that there be 4 minutes of debate equally divided between the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be \nno further votes today. We will resume consideration of the bill \ntomorrow after the cloture vote. The managers have indicated to me that \nthey believe we can finish the bill tomorrow. If we finish the bill \ntomorrow and dispose of the Griles nomination tomorrow, then we will \nhave no other rollcall votes on Friday or on Monday. There will be \ntomorrow, as I noted in the unanimous consent request, a debate for a \nperiod of 3 hours, beginning at 9 o'clock, on the House bankruptcy \nbill, H.R. 333.\n  Following that, we will then come back to the Nelson amendment on \nwhich there will be 4 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my colleague who has \nrecently joined us in the Senate from the great State of Florida. I \nhave so enjoyed working with him on many issues that are important to \nus, such as education and health care, issues on which our \nconstituencies have a great deal in common. I look forward to working \nwith him in the future as well. But I am unwilling to support his \namendment on this particular issue for, I think, many good reasons.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment because not only \nis it not the right thing for Florida or for Louisiana or the gulf \ncoast, it is not the right direction we need to take for our Nation. It \nwill not put us on the right path for a sound energy policy, self-\nsufficiency, or necessarily for a cleaner environment in this world \nthat we need to treasure more.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of my senior colleague from \nLouisiana, who has been a wonderful and very eloquent spokesperson, \ndisplaying a lot of expertise in this particular area both during his \nyears in the House and now in the Senate. He continues to bring this \nCongress, both Democrats and Republicans, to some reasonable \narrangements regarding the energy needs for our Nation.\n  I also associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member of the \nEnergy Committee, Senator Murkowski, and acknowledge his leadership in \nthis area.\n  Mr. President, as the Scripture says: ``Come, let us reason \ntogether.'' If there was ever a time when Members of the Senate --both \nDemocrats and Republicans--need to sort of lay down our swords and \ncome, reason together, this is it because our country needs a well \nthought out, well-balanced energy policy. And in crafting one, we are \nall going to have to give a little as well as bend a little to do what \nwe need for this Nation to sustain, support and protect the economic \ngrowth that is threatened by backward politics as in this case.\n  This is much broader than a few oil and gas States against the one \nState of Florida.\n  This debate is about national security and our economy. It is about \ncompromise and common sense. It is an important debate.\n  To answer some of the points raised by the Senator from Florida, \nfirst, it is important to say that one of the proponents of this \nargument in the House said that people such as myself, or those of us \nwho are trying to make the argument that if you want to consume oil and \ngas, you need to be willing to produce it as well, said if that was the \ncase, then it goes to say, if you don't raise pigs in your backyard, \nyou shouldn't eat bacon.\n  That might make some sense initially in its first blush. However, the \nfact is, every State produces some food product that we all consume. \nFlorida produces wonderful oranges. I have enjoyed them every year. \nLouisiana produces some as well. The State of the Presiding Officer has \ncommodities of which it is proud. Some of us grow cotton. Some of us \ngrow soybeans. Some of us grow wheat. Some of us run cattle. Some of us \ngrow other food products. We all contribute to the overall food supply \nof this Nation.\n  While we don't all grow the same crop, while we don't all run the \nsame kind of cattle or livestock, every State in the Union contributes \nto the food supply of this Nation. That is the way it should be.\n  Every State should also contribute to the energy supply of the \nNation. We have great resources in oil and natural gas. In addition, \nthere is clean coal, nuclear and hydropower. We have a diversity of \nfuels to choose from in this nation and we should make use of all of \nthem.\n  This attitude of ``I want to consume the power, but I refuse to \nproduce the power'' has got to come to an end. It is not fair. It is \nnot right. It is not smart. If we get caught up in this hysteria, we \nare going to lead this Nation into a dangerous place where our \nbusinesses are hurt and our economy cannot survive.\n  Let me talk about the State of Florida.\n  The State of Florida is the third largest consumer of petroleum \nproducts in the Nation. The State of Florida only produces, however, \nroughly 2 percent of the petroleum that it consumes and a very small \npercentage of the natural gas.\n  From 1960 to 1994, Florida electrical demand increased 700 percent. \nIt is not the only State that has increased its demands, but it has \nbeen one of the fastest growing States. We are all happy and proud of \nthe development in Florida and we want Florida to continue to grow and \nto expand, as we want all of our States in this Union to grow and to \nprosper but it must hold up it's end of the bargain as well.\n  From 1960 to 1994, Florida's fossil fuel use for electrical \ngeneration, made necessary by this extraordinary growth in population \nand electrical demand, has increased 551 percent. More than 80 percent \nof Florida's electrical demand is met today by fossil fuels.\n  Right now Florida, as every State, uses energy produced by fossil \nfuels. In south Florida, the natural gas demand for electricity \ngeneration purposes is expected to double by the year 2008. However, \nthere are no increases in the number or size of nuclear power or \nhydroelectric power foreseen in Florida to supplement this need.\n  There is rising demand in Florida but it makes it quite difficult for \nthose of us from Alabama and Florida to want to help in Florida when \nthey are not willing to help themselves. It makes it very difficult for \nus to want to help Florida when they are not willing to help \nthemselves.\n  There is not yet the significant increase in solar or wind production \nin Florida or generally in the United States, to adequately take the \nplace of fossil fuels. Although those technologies are very promising \nwe have not made the adjustment yet. I disagree with the President's \ndecision to cut funding for those kinds of research and development \nprojects. We need to increase funding.\n  In addition, from 1995 to 2002, a minimum of 24 new electrical \ngenerating plants will be added to Florida's power grid, and 21 out of \nthe 24 new plants that are being planned for and designed today have to \nrun by natural gas.\n  This amendment doesn't make sense for Florida. It doesn't make sense \nfor Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, or the Nation but it \ncertainly does not make sense for Florida. Florida needs more natural \ngas, not less.\n  I grew up on the beaches of Florida and appreciate their beauty. My \nfamily vacations all over the gulf coast. The compromise announced by \nthe Administration, which is threatened by this amendment, allows us to \nsalvage almost half of the natural gas and oil resources from the \noriginal lease sale area and is more than 100 miles from any part of \nFlorida's coast.\n  It is not just Louisiana or Florida waters where there is gas and oil \nbut the waters of the United States. In this day and age we can drill \nwith minimal footprints and minimal risk to not only the Florida coast, \nbut the entire gulf coast, and also provide states such as Florida, \nMississippi, Alabama and Georgia with the power we need to grow.\n  I want to talk about that growth for a minute. When we talk about \ngrowth, we are talking about jobs, about people creating wealth, about \npeople having a dream to start a business, about a new family buying \ntheir first home, and the electricity they need to run that home. This \nis about people who need to get to work, and the transportation they \nneed\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nto get there. This is real. This isn't about mere statistics. If we \ncan't power our economy, how can people feed their children and \nfamilies?\n  Let me talk about risk for a moment. We have had people come on the \nfloor and say we can't risk the beaches. However, in reality there is \nminimal risk. As the senior Senator from Louisiana pointed out, there \nis minimal risk associated with drilling. There is more risk from the \npossibility of oil spills when tankers have to transport the oil to our \ncountry.\n  This amendment, and others like it, will not decrease the risk, it \nwill increase the risk because we will have more tankers coming into \nthis Nation. The environmental leaders should be strong enough in this \nNation to stand up and admit this fact.\n  There are also other risks to consider. The risk of a recession. I \nwant the President to know I strongly disagree with his decision to \nmodify this lease sale. He should have held his ground. We should be \nexploring for oil and gas in this entire lease sale area as originally \nproposed. If we do not supply states such as Ohio, California, Illinois \nor Louisiana, with the oil and natural gas to generate the power they \nneed, we risk jeopardizing the economic future for our Nation. So if we \nare going to talk about risk, let's not just talk about environmental \nrisk, let's talk about other risks to this Nation.\n  Another important risk to consider is that of our national security. \nThe risk of our dependence on oil from the Mideast is well known. I \ndon't mean to be overly dramatic, but I want this Senate to know that \nthis is not just a fight between Alabama and Florida or a fight between \nLouisiana and Florida; this is involves the entire country. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Let me talk about a more parochial issue as a Senator from Louisiana. \nWe are proud of the contribution we have made to the oil and gas \nproduction in this country. However, the people in Louisiana also want \na clean environment. The industry that operates off our coast has made \ngreat strides in making sure we can produce the oil and gas necessary \nto support the electricity needs of this nation while doing so in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner.\n  Louisiana and other gulf coast States have argued for some time now \nthat if we are going to continue to drill in the central and western \ngulf there should be reasonable compensation not only for the \nenvironmental impact, but also for the infrastructure necessary to \nproduce this oil and gas that is crucial to our nation.\n  Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and other States are asking to \nshare more equitably in the revenues that are produced from this \noffshore development. Currently, if $2 billion in royalties is \ncollected from production in the Gulf of Mexico, all of it goes into \nthe Federal Treasury and is being spent in a variety of different ways. \nHowever, the states that permit production off their shores should be \ncompensated fairly for their contribution to the nation as well as the \nimpacts they incur. Whatever we decide and however we can come to \nterms, as reasonable people can agree, I hope one thing we will agree \non is that, because interior States get to keep 50 percent of the \nrevenues from development in their states, the States that are serving \nas a platform for offshore production will be fairly compensated as \nwell.\n\n  In conclusion, we do not want to drive this industry off the shores \nof our Nation to other places in the world. We need a viable industry \nhere for economic as well as national security reasons.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. With all due \nrespect to my good friend, the Senator from Florida, this is not the \nright direction in which to lead our Nation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is not related to the issue at hand, \nalthough I want to speak on that under whatever time I am yielded. This \nis under leader time on a resolution. I believe Senator Daschle will be \njoining me momentarily. We want to be sure to do this when we both can \nbe here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7483-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7483-S7484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMENDING GARY SISCO FOR HIS SERVICE AS SECRETARY OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 127, which is at the \ndesk, and ask that the resolution be read in total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 127) commending Gary Sisco for his \n     service as Secretary of the Senate:\n\n                              S. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas, Gary Sisco faithfully served the Senate of the \n     United States as the 29th Secretary of the Senate from the \n     104th to the 107th Congress, and discharged the difficult \n     duties and responsibilities of that office with unfailing \n     dedication and a high degree of competence and efficiency; \n     and\n       Whereas, as an elected officer, Gary Sisco has upheld the \n     high standards and traditions of the United States Senate and \n     extended his assistance to all Members of the Senate; and\n       Whereas, through his exceptional service and professional \n     integrity as an officer of the Senate of the United States, \n     Gary Sisco has earned the respect, trust, and gratitude of \n     his associates and the Members of the Senate: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the notable \n     contributions of Gary Sisco to the Senate and to his Country \n     and expresses to him its deep appreciation for his faithful \n     and outstanding service, and extends its very best wishes in \n     his future endeavors.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Gary Sisco.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 127) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wanted the entire resolution to be read in \nthe Record because I did want a complete record of the appreciation of \nthe entire Senate for Gary Sisco who has served so capably over the \npast 5 years as the Secretary of the Senate.\n  I appreciate Senator Daschle joining me for this time because he \nknows, as I know, that we have some very dedicated officers of the \nSenate and other employees of our floor staff who put in long hours and \ndo a great job in making this institution function the way it should. \nWe do not say thank you enough to those who serve in the Chamber with \nus who make it possible for us to do our job, and we do not say thank \nyou enough to the officers of the Senate, people such as the Secretary \nof the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms, the Chaplain, and others who work \nevery day to help make this place function.\n  I have a very personal warm feeling for Gary Sisco. He is from \nTennessee. He was born in Bolivar, TN, a small town. He grew up in \nstrictly a blue-collar family. I believe his father did serve for a \nperiod of time as sheriff in that county in Tennessee.\n  I got to know him way back in, I guess, 1962 or 1963 at the \nUniversity of Mississippi. We became friends. I managed to even talk \nhim into joining the fraternity to which I belonged. We developed a \nvery close friendship.\n  He wound up having a blind date with his now wife, thanks to the \narrangement of my wife. Mary Sue Sisco is from Pascagoula, MS.\n  He went on to work with IBM after graduation and was involved in \ngubernatorial campaigns in Tennessee. He served Gov. Lamar Alexander, \nand then wound up in Washington and worked for Congressman Robin Beard \nas his administrative assistant. He worked for Howard Baker reaching \nthe position of executive assistant. He then returned to Tennessee and \nhad a very successful business life.\n  Five years ago, I called on him and said: We need somebody who \nunderstands computers, somebody who understands how to manage a pretty \ngood size operation, somebody who knows how to keep the books straight, \nsomebody who has political instinct and knows and loves the Senate. You \nare the man.\n  He left his business in Nashville, TN, and came to Washington and has \nbeen in the position of Secretary of the Senate for 5 years. He has \ndone a wonderful job.\n  The only thing I ever asked of him was: Gary, when we have a few \nthings\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\nthat need to be changed, need to be approved, let's just make sure when \nyou leave and I leave the position I am in, it is better than it was \nwhen we got here.\n  I believe Gary Sisco has achieved that goal. To show you the kind of \nman he is, Senator Daschle had agreed, frankly, that the officers of \nthe Senate could stay on through this session of Congress, even though \nthe majority might change. So I know he would have kept his word and \nGary could have stayed, but he submitted his resignation, and I agreed \nthat I think the majority leader should have officers of the Senate of \nhis selection. It was the right thing to do, but it was his idea; it \nwas not mine.\n  Senator Daschle has been very gracious in the way he has treated the \nemployees in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. He has selected \nan outstanding, capable, experienced person and one who also \nunderstands the Senate very well, Jeri Thomson. I know she will \ncontinue the great legacy Gary Sisco has built.\n  To my colleagues in the Senate, I thank them all for the courtesies \nand support they have given to Gary Sisco, and I wish my friend the \nvery best in his next career.\n\n  Some of us, as Senator Daschle and myself, have been in the Congress \nfor many, many years now, in my case 28 years. I have to confess, in a \nway, I am a little envious of a guy who was in the business sector, in \nthe political arena, in the congressional arena, back in the business \nworld, back in the Senate arena, and is now going out to the next stage \nof his life. I am sure it will be an outstanding one.\n  I, again, extend my best wishes to Gary Sisco, his wife Mary Sue, and \ntheir children. I know they will always have a special feeling in their \nhearts for the Senate, and I believe the Senate also has that feeling \nfor them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first, I compliment the distinguished \nminority leader on his remarks. I appreciate very much the opportunity \nto address the resolution this afternoon.\n  Five years ago, Gary Sisco came to Washington and came to the job as \nSecretary of the Senate with the full confidence of then-majority \nleader Trent Lott. Today he leaves the Senate, leaves his job as \nSecretary of the Senate, having earned the full confidence of now-\nmajority leader Tom Daschle.\n  That did not just happen because he had the title. It happened \nbecause he worked at it. It happened because, in spite of the long \ntradition that he had of working for very able Members of the Senate on \nthe Republican side in the Senate and the House and Governor, he came \nleaving his Republican credentials at home. He came working with us as \nDemocrats and Republicans, equally serving his country and serving this \ninstitution as ably as anyone can.\n  As Senator Lott has noted, the mark of a good and able public servant \nis one who leaves his job in a better position than when he came. I can \nsay without equivocation Gary Sisco has met that test. It has been my \npleasure to work with him. I have come to admire him and respect him, \nand I also respect the position he has taken with regard to this \nparticular resignation.\n  I confirm exactly what Senator Lott has just noted, that because of \nmy respect, not only for Senator Lott but for Gary Sisco and the \nSergeant at Arms, it was my view, in keeping the continuity of the \nofficers of the Senate, as well as because they were serving us so \nwell, they had every right and could have every expectation that \nregardless of what may happen to the majority in the Senate, they would \nhave the full confidence and have the full support of both caucuses for \nthe duration of this Congress.\n  Gary Sisco has made his decision, and I respect it, but I do so with \na great deal of appreciation. I do so with the hope that he will come \nback often. I do so with a realization that in this business we get to \nwork with quality people, people who give back to their country, to \ntheir community, and to each of us in ways that I think is admirable. \nHe has done so. Our country owes him a debt of gratitude. This Senate \nowes him a debt of gratitude.\n  On behalf of our caucus, I thank him for all he has given us. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I thank Senator Daschle for coming to \nthe Chamber and making that statement, and I look forward to working \nwith him and the new Secretary of the Senate to continue the very \nefficient and fine way the Senate has been conducted, in the way the \nOffice of the Secretary of the Senate has been run. I know she will do \na great job.\n  Mr. President, I do not know who is controlling the time now, but I \nwant to be yielded time to speak against the pending amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for 1 \nminute to comment on Mr. Sisco?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be happy to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Sessions from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader and the \nDemocratic leader and others for their kind comments about Gary Sisco.\n  In short, he is one of the finest people I know. He served the Senate \nwith great integrity, ability, and fidelity. He has a wonderful family, \nhigh personal values, the kind of person you like to know, like to call \nyour friend, you want to have in your home. He has served so well, and \nhe leaves with grace and style quite in harmony with his whole \nlifestyle. I thank Senator Lott for raising this point, and I join in \nhis compliments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the time has been off the leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7484-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7484-S7490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2002--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 893\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the pending \namendment. My question is, If we are not going to have exploration in \nthe Gulf of Mexico in a limited area for oil and gas, where are we \ngoing to do it? Not in the Atlantic along the coast. Not in the Pacific \nalong the coast. Some people say not in Alaska in the area that has \nbeen pursued. Then where? I believe we can do it effectively, \nefficiently, responsibly, and productively in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  For years, exploration in the gulf and, in fact, drilling activity \noccurred primarily in Texas and Louisiana waters. But in more recent \nyears it has moved over under Mississippi and Alabama. It has been very \nproductive.\n  This is an interesting map to which others have referred. The Florida \ncoastline goes to Pensacola, Alabama with Mobile, Biloxi, and New \nOrleans. I live right here; that is where my house sits. I can step off \nmy front porch and put a rock in the Gulf of Mexico. I can sit out on \nmy front porch and I can see a natural gas well working right in this \narea. In the daytime you can see it. It is clear. And at night \nsometimes they flare it off. It has never been a problem and it is \nproducing natural gas. As a matter of fact, it is closer to my front \ndoorstep, literally, than it is to Panama City, Florida, or Pensacola, \nor Biloxi or New Orleans. I am perfectly comfortable with this. There \nis no risk.\n  Those who live in the gulf area know that some of the most effective \ndrilling and exploration drilling anywhere in the world is done in the \ngulf. It has become more efficient, with greater accuracy. If there has \never been a spill in the gulf, it must have been very minor and \ncertainly never affected my State, I don't believe, since we have had \nthe drilling off the coast of Alabama and Mississippi. I don't believe \nwe have ever had one.\n  It also is a wonderful place to fish around the oil rigs. We take old \nliberty ships out and sink them in the gulf so they will form fishing \nmounds. It is very effective. The rig serves the same purpose.\n  But now we have people who say we should not have it in the Gulf of \nMexico, or we should delay it even further, even though there has been \na compromise. I think this whole area should be opened up for lease. \nBut now it is down to just this green area, a very small area. The \nGovernors of the States that are involved--Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and I believe this compromise provision is supported even by \nJeb Bush--all of our leaders\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nand all of the people who live in this area support this.\n  What are we going to do? We are depending on foreign oil for 56 \npercent of our energy needs, and it is going up. It will be 60 percent. \nCan we get everything we need just from wind and sun? If we triple what \nwe got from those areas, it wouldn't get us at 6 percent. As I said \nbefore, maybe we will have to harness some of the speeches around here \nto produce more energy needs in this country. But we need exploration \nfor oil and gas. We need to look at greater use of nuclear power. We \nneed to take advantage of clean coal technology. We do need alternative \nsources of energy--wind, solar, hydro. We need energy efficiency. We \nneed to encourage conservation. But we need a national energy policy--\nthe whole thing, the whole package--so that we will not be in danger of \nthe threat of OPEC countries saying they will cut us off.\n  By the way, every time we have a decline or some sort of a threat \nfrom OPEC countries, we get oil out of the SPR. Where do you think the \nSPR is, the strategic petroleum? I think most of it is in Texas and \nLouisiana.\n\n  Now people are saying, well, in south Florida, let's build a 1.6 \nbillion pipeline from my hometown and from Mobile, AL, across the Gulf \nof Mexico into Florida and supply their energy needs. We are supposed \nto take the risk in those areas of the exploration and the drilling for \nnatural gas, and of course, sometimes for oil, and now we are going to \nbuild this pipeline and lay it across the Gulf of Mexico to supply the \nnatural gas for people who say they don't want us to explore and \nproduce. This makes no sense.\n  The people have to decide. Are we going to continue to go down this \ntrail of not producing for our energy needs? Are we going to have this \nnational security risk, facing the danger of loss of freedoms in \nAmerica? Who thinks gasoline prices will not go up again next summer? \nThey are. And so will diesel fuel prices. The families won't be able to \nafford to drive to their vacation spots. The small business men and \nwomen are going to have trouble paying their electricity bills. The \nfarmers will have difficulty paying for the cost of diesel fuel for \ntheir tractors. It will ripple through the economy.\n  This is probably the most serious problem this country faces today. \nMeanwhile, we fiddle in Washington while the country has a heat stroke \nand is threatened with not having the energy to keep the economy \ngrowing. I think the American people realize this is a very serious \nproblem. Some people shy away from calling it a crisis. OK, don't use \nthat word. There is no imminent danger now. But there could be \ntomorrow, there could be next week. OPEC countries could say: We will \ncut you off. We could have rolling brownouts in California, blackouts \nin New York City. They will run short of power in south Florida.\n  This is the least we can do. We should do it now, not later. We have \nbeen wrestling around over this for months--in fact, years. This can be \ndone safely, effectively. I understand it is projected this area could \nproduce enough natural gas to provide 1 million families in America \nwith the supply of natural gas they need for 15 years. I don't know \nwhether that is accurate. It has been very productive in this part of \nthe gulf. It is done efficiently and in very targeted ways. They know \nnow where the oil and gas is. They can probably put a pin on it--and \nfrom long distances.\n  I urge my colleagues, this may be the only real vote we have on \nenergy production in America this summer. Senator Daschle said we will \nfocus on appropriations bills. He is right for doing that. We should \ntry to help him move the appropriations bills. We will not get to a \nfree-standing energy bill probably until the fall. But we should do it. \nIn the meantime, we should not take this step of prohibiting or \ndelaying exploration and development of the resources that we know are \nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n  My beach is closer to this area than the beaches in Florida. I say, \nbring it on. I am worried about the future of my country and my \nchildren's economic future. I urge my colleagues, this should be an \noverwhelming bipartisan defeat on an amendment that really, in view of \nall that has gone on, should not be passed.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, such time as he consumes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Bill Nelson, as we offer this amendment to help assure \nthat America will have a policy of energy that is also a policy for our \neconomic future and for the protection of important environmental \ntreasures.\n  Let us clearly understand what the amendment we offer will do. It \nwill provide for a short, 6-month delay, in the leasing of property in \nthe area that is known as lease sale 181. This short delay, 6 months \nfrom the time the bill is enacted, will allow time to make some \nimportant decisions before we are committed to an option that may not \nbe in the best interests of our Nation.\n  This is also an issue, while it is today in the context of the \neastern Gulf of Mexico, the exact same issues which I will speak about \nare relevant to other areas of the country which share a similar \nconcern, whether or not it is on the Atlantic coast. I heard this \nweekend of concerns off the northeast coast regarding a proposal for \ndrilling in areas that have been very significant parts of the American \ntradition and history of commercial fishing for hundreds of years.\n  We know our friends who live in the area of the Great Lakes are \nconcerned about proposals for drilling in Lake Huron and Lake \nSuperior--again, areas that have in the past been off limits for \ndrilling. California is another area that has expressed concern about \nthe proposals for drilling under the rules as they currently exist.\n  While this may be characterized as a Gulf of Mexico issue, or even \nmore specifically a Florida issue, it raises important implications for \nthe Nation. Let me discuss two of those issues which I believe justify \nthe 6-month delay we are requesting through this amendment.\n  First, the current laws that govern Outer Continental Shelf drilling \nin my judgment are imbalanced. They do not give proper consideration to \nother factors in addition to energy production, factors such as \neconomic and environmental needs. We are all aware that America has \nneeds for increased energy production. We are not insensitive to that. \nBut we also are not myopic, that that is the only issue America needs \nto take in the balance in making these judgments. We believe balanced \nlegislation on Outer Continental Shelf drilling would include the other \nfactors that might be affected by that drilling. Let me give, as an \nexample, what is happening today as a result of our law.\n  A number of years ago, leases were granted in these areas that are \nwithin 40 miles of the coast of Florida. Those are depicted on this map \nin the light pink and blue. The blue area is what is called Destin \nDome. It is an area that is approximately 35 miles south of Pensacola. \nThat lease has been outstanding for a number of years but was dormant. \nThen a few years ago the owner of that lease, the Chevron Oil Company, \nmade an application for a drilling permit, to start production on that \nproperty. What was discovered was that basic environmental analysis, \nwhich in my judgment should have preceded the lease being granted in \nthe first place, had not been done and it was deferred until the \ndrilling permit was requested. As an example of those basic studies, \none of them is the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Coastal Zone \nManagement Act is administered in a joint program between the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce and the various coastal States affected. The \nresult of that analysis of the Coastal Zone Management Act was a \ndetermination by the State of Florida that it was a violation of the \nact and of the management plan, which had been approved by the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, to drill on this Destin Dome. That has now \nprecipitated a series of litigation and administrative actions which \nhave drawn this process out for many years.\n  In my judgment, the lesson of Destin Dome is let's do the \nenvironmental surveys before we grant the lease, before we create the \nexpectations that a lease carries with it, before people apply for the \npermit to drill, so we have satisfied ourselves on environmental, \neconomic, and the other considerations that this is a property which \nwill be appropriate to drill should a lease be granted.\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n  One of the things we could do, during this 6 months of deferral, \nwould be to do an analysis of our current law to see if it is \nappropriately representing the wide range of interests that should be \nconsidered. We know we are going to be doing a major energy bill \nsometime in the next few months. Our Republican leader has indicated he \nthinks that will be on the Senate floor sometime this fall. I know the \nchairman of the Energy Committee is driving a schedule that would have \nit considered in committee this month. So we are not talking about long \ndelays. We are talking about legislation that is viable at this moment \nand would be the appropriate means by which to raise these issues as to \nwhether our current laws are adequate to represent the range of \ninterests.\n\n  The second point I would make, that in my opinion justifies the 6-\nmonths delay which the House of Representatives has voted by an \noverwhelming margin, is the very fact of these existing leases \noutstanding. If we were looking at a map, not a current map but a map \nas recent as the early 1990s, we would also have seen lots of these \nlittle pink squares in this area adjacent to the Florida Keys. What \nhappened there was that there was great concern about the potential \nadverse effects on one of the most fragile environmental areas in the \nworld, the Florida Keys and their adjacent coral reefs. The President, \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, announced that in his judgment that danger \nshould be eliminated by the Federal Government reacquiring those leases \nin the vicinity of the Florida Keys. Over a period of less than 10 \nyears, an aggressive program of reacquisition of those leases has, in \nfact, eliminated those leases.\n  I believe today we should be entering into negotiation during the \nadministration of George W. Bush to do the same thing in the northern \nGulf of Mexico, to eliminate those inappropriate leases that have been \ngranted in years past, that now threaten the beaches of the Panhandle \nof Florida. Again, the 6-months delay would give us the opportunity, \nwould give us the time to undertake exactly that type of analysis.\n  This idea is an idea which has been long under consideration. When \nsome of the initial proposals were being made for lease site 181, our \nformer colleague and then Governor of Florida, the now deceased \nGovernor Lawton Chiles, wrote a letter, on October 28, 1996, to the \nDirector of the Minerals Management Service about lease site 181. In \nthat letter, Governor Chiles made this statement:\n\n       A remaining concern, however, is the potential for \n     development of the existing leases in the eastern gulf. I am \n     still quite concerned about the dangers the State's pristine \n     coastline faces from production activities on these leases \n     offshore Northwest Florida.\n\n  Governor Chiles was talking about this cluster of leases in the \nFlorida Panhandle section of the north Gulf of Mexico.\n\n       While the final program represents a tremendous victory for \n     Florida, I know the victory will not be complete until there \n     are no existing leases off our coast.\n\n  This letter is now almost 5 years old and no progress has yet been \nmade towards achieving that goal of eliminating those leases off the \ncoast of Florida. This 6-month period should be a time in which we \nstart the serious negotiations with the current administration of \nPresident Bush that proved to be so effective in the administration of \nhis father in eliminating a similar cluster of oil and gas leases in \nthe area of the Florida Keys.\n  This is not 6 months which would be frittered away. This is 6 months \nin which we can reexamine the fundamental law that currently governs \nthe leasing of Outer Continental Shelf lands for oil and gas \nproduction, to assure that appropriate environmental studies are done \nbefore the leases are granted, not after the leases are granted, \nprecipitating the kind of contentious litigation and administrative \nprocedures we have been dealing with as it relates to Destin Dome.\n  It would also give us 6 months in which we could commence the serious \nnegotiations with the current administration, as was the case in the \nlate 1980s and early 1990s with the administration of the previous \nPresident leading to the elimination of the oil and gas leases in the \nsouthern Gulf of Mexico.\n  I believe our request is fair; that it is reasonable; that it has a \nspecific purpose to be accomplished by the brief delay. It is the same \namendment that the House of Representatives has already adopted by an \noverwhelming margin. It is one which I commend to my colleagues in the \nSenate, not only as it relates to the specific very fragile \nenvironmental area of our Nation but also for the precedent that was \nset in terms of establishing appropriate laws for the future and a \nreexamination of possibly ill-considered decisions in the past, such as \ngranting these leases in appropriate areas which would be beneficial to \nall Americans.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I watched the debate with a great deal of \ninterest. I can only think of the amendment a little while ago that was \noffered by the Senator from Illinois. The Minerals Management Service \nhas been working on this lease sale for quite a while, and includes the \ncurrent 5-year Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Program. This was \nput on the table under the Clinton administration. The service prepared \nthe draft EIS. They have ensured that the proper public hearings have \ntaken place, including the hearings in Pensacola, Tallahassee, and \nMobile. But despite the fact that service has jumped through all of the \nrequired administrative hoops, some opponents are now trying to foul \nthe whole thing up in the end game right before the lease, of course, \nis finalized.\n  When we take a look at the Land and Water Conservation Fund, it is \ninteresting that Members who have been leaning towards voting for this \namendment are the same Members who have submitted healthy requests for \nmoney out of that Land and Water Conservation Fund for some of their \nprojects. It is also interesting to note that in this very bill, \nFlorida has approximately $42 million in items that are funded under \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is likely that State has been \nthe single largest draw on the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the \nlast 5 years. That money is derived from royalties from offshore \ndrilling and production. It is ironic to note that the State of Florida \nis actually the third largest consumer of petroleum products. However, \nit only produces about 2 percent of the petroleum that it consumes.\n  Basically, this amendment on the surface appears to be one of those \n``not in my backyard'' kinds of situations or games.\n  To top it off, this amendment totally ignores the fact that last week \nthe administration announced that it decided to reduce the size of the \nlease sale and in particular decided to make sure that the lease sale \nis much further away from Florida's shores.\n  A while ago, we had the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. Now \nwe have the proponents of this amendment pleading with us to heed the \nlocal concerns for the protection of Florida's beaches, of which I \nwould concur. I will say right now that I think the offshore drilling \nprobably does less damage than the tankers that go up and down and \nunload in the Gulf of Mexico every day. They want those decisions to be \nmade locally. But when it comes to voting on an issue that affected the \nWest, they disregarded that.\n  When voting, I ask my fellow Members to think about the fact that \nthis is a legislative rider that could ultimately reduce the amount of \nfunds contributed to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and it might \ninterfere with our country's ability to produce its own oil and gas \nduring a time when the country is facing a very serious energy crunch.\n  If local concerns are in play in Florida, why aren't they in Montana? \nI call that the lack of fairness. I think that is all we ever want in \nthis body--fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a very serious national issue. \nIt is not a Florida issue in any strict legal sense at all.\n  I used to be the U.S. attorney and represented the Federal \nGovernment. I know that these Federal waters are 260 miles away from \nTampa, FL. It is a Federal decision about whether to lease it and \nproduce oil and gas from it.\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\n  As a resident of Mobile, AL, which is right here at the tip of OCS \ncentral planning area, I am pretty familiar with the facts in this case \nand what happens.\n  Frankly, I have to say I am a little bit disappointed. The President \nof the United States, in my view, made a mistake when he cut back huge \nportions of this lease that is on that map to accommodate and appease \nthe political leaders in Florida. What did he get? They still opposed \nthe sale and are still opposing it right on this floor.\n  Yet this map shows a dotted line from my hometown of Mobile, AL, over \nto Tampa, FL. I wonder if anybody knows what those dotted lines \nreflect. They reflect a pipeline. That pipeline is being built at this \nmoment. It started in June. The pipeline is to take natural gas \nproduced in the western gulf to Tampa, FL, and to south Florida to meet \ntheir surging demands for natural gas. Yet when it comes time for them \nto go along with a national goal of producing natural gas way out in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, far from where you can see it from land, they say: \nOh, no. We can never allow that to happen.\n  They have fought it natural gas production consistently. I am really \nconcerned about this position. We have natural gas here in the Gulf of \nMexico. It is being produced off the shores of Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana and Texas. Now they want to transport that gas over to \nFlorida. What is that going to do to the price of natural gas for the \nhomeowners in Alabama and electricity users in Alabama? They are going \nto bid it up. This demand on the limited supply in the western Gulf of \nMexico is going to drive up the price of natural gas for the people in \nAlabama; and, at the same time, Florida refuses to allow any production \nin Federal waters 100 or more miles from their shore.\n\n  This is a national issue. One reason, in my view, we have an economic \nslowdown--and I do not think anybody can dispute it--is an increase in \nenergy prices. Fifty-seven percent of our fossil fuels comes from \noutside the country. And that amount is growing. What does that mean? \nWhat it means is, American wealth is going overseas to Saudi Arabia, to \nVenezuela, to Iraq and other foreign countries, to pay for oil and gas \nthat we have right here off our coast. Whom do we pay when we produce \nit here? We pay us. We pay the United States. We keep American wealth.\n  The oil companies agreed to pay $136 million just for the right to \nbid on this property and are projected to pay $70 million, at least, \nper year of royalty. More than that will probably go into the Treasury.\n  A big chunk of offshore royalty goes to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund funds the \npurchase of parks and recreation areas, estuaries, and to protect \nenvironmentally sensitive areas that need to be preserved.\n  So the question is really simple for Americans: Whom are we going to \npay? Are we going to transfer our wealth overseas? Keep it within the \nUnited States? Or are we going to send it abroad?\n  Make no mistake, people act as if the price of energy makes no \ndifference. But when a family had a $100-a-month gasoline bill several \nyears ago, and now has a $150-a-month gasoline bill, they have $50 less \nper month to spend for things their family needs. It is right out of \ntheir pocket. When that $50--or a big portion of it--is sent over to \nSaudi Arabia or Iraq and Saddam Hussein, for their oil and gas, we are \nnot helping America.\n  Let me tell you, we do not just have oil and gas wells off the \nAlabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana coast 100 miles away, we \nhave them right up in Mobile Bay, in some instances less than a mile \nfrom homes. I drove over to Gulf Shores right near Pensacola this \nSaturday to visit my brother-in-law, and he was there with his \ngrandson. They were so proud. They had a picture of a 40-pound ling, a \ngreat fish. Where did they catch it? Under an oil rig about 1 mile off \nthe gulf shore's coast--1 mile.\n  We have never had a problem with these oil and gas wells. Offshore \noil and gas production in state waters has helped to generate for the \nState of Alabama a trust fund of $2 billion. The interest on that fund \ncontributes over 10 percent of our general fund budget on an annual \nbasis.\n  America has benefited from that. That supply has allowed American \nmoney to stay in Alabama and the producing States and not to go off to \nSaudi Arabia. It has helped to build wealth in America as a whole. You \nmay say: You just want the money for Alabama. The truth is, Alabama is \nnot going to get a dime out of this lease except as any other State \nwould under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The proposed lease \nsale is in Federal waters. It is not in State waters.\n  But we have produced oil in State waters right off the beaches, right \nin the bay here, and we have had no problems. People fish around it on \na regular basis. It has created a steady flow of income and has been \ngood for America.\n  The President, in trying to be accommodating, agreed to cut back this \nlease sale to less than one-quarter of the original area proposed by \nPresident Clinton. He tried to do that. He moved it off on the Alabama \nside--nothing in the Florida waters--to try to accommodate Florida. And \nthe Florida politicians are still not happy. But they want this \npipeline built. They want this pipeline built so they can get natural \ngas. And why do they want the natural gas? Because it is needed to fuel \nthe new cleaner burning electricity plants they need to heat and cool \ntheir homes, shops and offices.\n  What is particularly valuable in the Gulf are the huge reserves of \nnatural gas. The wells in the remaining lease area are going to be a \nmixture of oil and gas. But the neck, the ``stovepipe'', that the \nPresident shut off as part of his compromise to appease Florida's \npolitical leaders was virtually all natural gas.\n  So I think the Senators from Florida are asking a bit much. I would \nask them to think about this. Is not this the philosophy that got \nCalifornia in the fix they are in today? For decades California was \nfacing the question of offshore drilling: No. Nuclear power: No. Coal \nplants: No. Electric plants: No. And what happened? They have brownouts \nand prices going through the roof. And they want to blame somebody \nelse. They won't blame themselves.\n  But energy is going to come from somewhere. It is either going to \ncome from foreign sources or our own sources. We should not threaten \nour economy. We should not press down on the brow of American working \nmen and women, with the burden of paying 20, 30, 40, cents more a \ngallon for gasoline, or twice as much perhaps for natural gas to heat \ntheir homes to accommodate some sort of political fear that exists out \nthere.\n  So what I think is important is that we, as America, just relax a \nlittle bit. Let's be rational. Let's think this thing through. Let's \nask ourselves: What real threat is there? And what are the benefits \nfrom producing out there? We simply cannot allow people over in Naples, \nFL, in their beach houses, worth probably $2, $3, $4 million each, \nworrying about running their air-conditioners all the time to dictate \nnational energy policy.\n  Do you know how you generate electricity for air-conditioners in \nsouth Florida? They use natural gas because it is efficient and clean \nburning, much better than coal. So they want that natural gas. They \njust do not want it 213 miles or 260 miles away. ``Oh, no, we can't \nhave this'' they say. I really do not think they know what has \nhappened. I think they have been misled by some politicians and \nenvironmentalists who are not responsible.\n  This is an extreme position. I hate to say that. This is an unhealthy \nposition to have this Senate take. We ought not to adopt this amendment \nthat would stop us from producing oil and gas in one-quarter of the \npreviously approved area. It is going to hurt us in America. It is \ngoing to hurt us economically.\n  The demands in Florida are significant. Thirty percent of all natural \ngas produced in America comes out of the gulf, and Florida will consume \nhuge amounts. Their demand is going to double in the next 15 years, and \nincrease over 142 percent in the next 20 years, according to experts.\n  Yes, we should conserve. Yes, I hope people will use those hybrid \nautomobiles. I would like to have one myself. I don't know why \neverybody doesn't buy one. There must be some reason they don't buy \nthem. If they are so wonderful, why doesn't everybody go out and buy \none, if you get 50 miles to\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nthe gallon? But I think they have potential. I am interested in looking \nat them and support the efforts of our automakers to improve \nefficiency. But it is a free country. Are we going to make everybody go \nout and buy one?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will just say that I believe the \nPresident has submitted a scaled-down, fair, and reasonable proposal--\ntoo scaled down, frankly. It ought to have satisfied those who would \nobject. Unfortunately, it has not. We have had to have this debate. And \nthough it is healthy to have the debate, I am confident that the \namendment will be defeated and that this small production area will be \nopened for the benefit of American taxpayers and the American economy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how many minutes remain in \nopposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. How many minutes remaining do I have as the \nproponent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes twenty-one seconds.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I do not intend to take that. I see all of the \nstaff smiling at me.\n  But I would like to summarize. I would like to see if I can bring to \nclosure a 3-hour debate on a part of setting any energy policy in this \ncountry that is very important not only to us along the gulf coast but \nto the Nation as a whole.\n  I want to mark the contrast in the debate that you have heard: Every \nSenator who has spoken in opposition to this amendment to stop oil \ndrilling off Florida in the eastern Gulf of Mexico planning area is \nfrom an oil State.\n  That is the beauty of the United States of America. We come, each \nState represented by two Senators, and bring all of our different \ninterests and constituencies here. But it is an interesting contrast \nthat every opponent to us trying to protect against oil drilling in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico is from an oil State.\n  Senator Graham, my senior colleague from the State of Florida, has \neloquently pointed out a number of things. He pointed out in his \nsummary that these light-colored areas are active leases but no \ndrilling has occurred. Senator Graham and I have offered a bill to buy \nback these leases, just as President George Herbert Walker Bush had \nproposed buying back a bunch of leases off of the Ten Thousand Islands \noff of Naples, off of Fort Myers that occurred about a decade ago. We \nwant to get rid of these, including the lease called the Destin Dome, \nwhere Chevron has an active permit to drill.\n  Let me give you some statistics about Chevron and its offshore rigs \nin the Gulf of Mexico and what they have experienced between 1956 and \n1995.\n  There were 10 gas blowouts and an additional 5 blowouts of oil and a \ncombination of gas. There were 65 fires and explosions of which at \nleast 28 originated from natural gas, 14 significant pollution \nincidents, and 40 major accidents, resulting in at least 19 fatalities. \nThere were five pipeline breaks or leaks.\n  I don't have any particular reason to cite this with regard to \nChevron, except that Chevron came up because they have an active lease \nthat is ready to be drilled 30 miles off of some of the world's most \nbeautiful beaches called the Destin Dome. What Senator Graham and I \nwould like to do is to see us buy back that lease so that drilling, \nwith a safety record and a blowout record as has been shown by the \nfacts--and remember, facts are stubborn things--so that that won't \noccur right off of the sugary white sand beaches of Destin, FL.\n  We would like to reacquire that lease, just as the first President \nBush had acquired so many leases down here threatening the 10,000 \nislands of the Florida Keys.\n  That is not the issue here today. The issue today is taking these \nactive drilling leases in the central and western planning areas of the \nGulf of Mexico and thrusting eastward toward the coastline of Florida \nwith a new sale of 1.5 million acres.\n  They had 6 million acres in this original lease sale 181. They knew \nthey were not going to pass it. They knew there was too much political \nopposition. So what they have done is they have scaled it back to 1.5 \nmillion acres, thinking they can get it through.\n  It is, in fact, the eastward inevitable march of drilling into the \neastern planning area, an area that heretofore has not been violated \nwith this drilling.\n  Let me cite some more statistics as we wrap up this debate. The \nDepartment of the Interior, on the day that the Senate and the House \ngoes home for the Fourth of July, on Monday, July 2, announces this \ndeal, that they are shrinking 181. In the course of that announcement, \nthey put out a news bulletin: Secretary Norton announces area of \nproposed 181 lease sale on Outer Continental Shelf. And in that, the \nrelease states: The area also contains 185 billion barrels of oil.\n  You have heard the statistics of how much oil is there. The fact is, \nit is not 185 billion barrels of oil; it is 185 million barrels of oil \nthat MMS, a part of the Department of the Interior, estimates is in \nthis lease sale 181.\n  So I raise the question again, since this equates to about 10 days' \nworth of oil and gas energy for this country, is it worth the risk to \nthe beaches of Florida and to the environment of Florida, this eastward \nmarch that will inextricably, inexorably happen, is it worth the risk? \nIt is not.\n  I said earlier in my remarks, if ever I have seen anything that looks \nlike the nose of a camel suddenly under the tent, it is that yellow-\ncolored, 1.5 million acres coming into the eastern planning area that \nhas no drilling.\n  Back in the middle 1980s, I was a junior Congressman from the east \ncoast of Florida. The Reagan administration had a Secretary of the \nInterior named James Watt. James Watt was absolutely intent on drilling \nfor oil off the entire eastern coast of the United States and was \noffering for lease sale leases from as far north as Cape Hatteras, NC, \nall the way south to Fort Pierce, FL. I went to work, as the \nCongressman from the middle eastern coast of Florida, to try to defeat \nthat. And we defeated it in the appropriations bill, in an \nappropriations subcommittee on this very same Interior Department \nappropriations.\n  They left me alone. And 2 years later, they came back. This time they \nhad worked the full Appropriations Committee in the House so that they \nthought they had the votes. And they were running that train down the \ntrack for oil drilling from North Carolina to south Florida. The only \nway that we beat it was to finally get NASA and the Department of \nDefense to own up to the fact that off the east coast of Florida, where \nwe were launching the space shuttle, you couldn't have oil rigs out \nthere where you were dropping the solid rocket boosters from the space \nshuttle launches and where you were dropping off the first stages of \nthe expendable booster rockets that were going out of the Cape \nCanaveral Air Force Station.\n  They have left us alone on oil drilling until now. That was almost \n16, 17 years.\n  What we happened to do was call the the Pensacola Naval Air Station.\n  Fast forward 17 years. We decided to call one of the greatest \nmilitary installations in the world, the naval air station at \nPensacola, the place where almost every naval aviator has learned to \nfly, and we asked if this lease sale 181 were to have a spill--\nremember, I cited statistics earlier that the Minerals Management \nService says this lease sale has up to a 37- percent possibility of \nhaving an oilspill--we said to the executive officer at the Naval Air \nStation Pensacola: What would happen to Pensacola Naval Air Station and \nto the Air Force installations at Eglin Air Force Base at Fort Walton \nand Hurlburt Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach?\n  No. 1, for both of those military complexes, virtually all testing, \ntraining, and operations over water would cease until the oil slick was \ncompletely cleaned up.\n  No. 2, flights would cease due to the hazards to pilots if they had \nto eject over oily water.\n  No. 3, water training and equipment testing would cease.\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n  No. 4, test firing of weapons would cease over and into oily water.\n  In other words, the Pensacola Naval Air Station would virtually cease \nto operate as one of our greatest national assets.\n  We have not even talked about something that is a natural phenomenon \nin the State of Florida. Look at this peninsula. It is a land that I \ncall paradise, but paradise happens to be a peninsula that sticks down \ninto something known as hurricane highway, for in the course of the \nsummer and into the early fall, because the Lord designed the Earth \nthis way, hurricanes spring up in the gulf, they spring up in the \nAtlantic, and they go from the Atlantic into the gulf. It is an \nadditional reminder of the additional hazards of Florida offshore oil \ndrilling.\n  As we bring to a close this 3-hour debate, the risk of spill, \naccording to the Government, on this lease sale 181 is all the way up \nto 37 percent. This lease sale, by the Department's own recognition, is \nonly going to have about 10 days of oil and gas for the entire country. \nIt is not going to lessen the dependence on foreign oil.\n  My goodness, the United States has 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, 3 percent of the reserves, but we consume 25 percent of the \nworld's oil. We cannot drill our way out of dependence on foreign oil. \nWe have to have a balanced energy policy which includes the use of \ntechnology to get greater miles-per-gallon in our transportation, as \nwell as conservation, as well as being balanced with drilling.\n  I recite the statistic I cited that of all the future reserves, they \nare not in the eastern gulf planning area. Sixty percent of the \nNation's undiscovered economically recoverable Outer Continental Shelf \noil is in the central and western gulf area where they are already \ndrilling, and for natural gas, of the entire Outer Continental Shelf, \n80 percent of the future reserves are from the central and western \nareas, not from the eastern area.\n\n  I come back to the point at which we began 3 hours ago: Is it worth \nthe risk? Is it worth the tradeoff: Little oil and gas, and yet the \nfirst invasion of the eastern planning area, a huge invasion, a million \nand a half acres? Is it worth the risk to an economy of a State that \nhas pristine, white sandy beaches on which its economy is so dependent \nbecause of a $50 billion-a- year tourism economy? Is it worth it to the \nestuaries of Apalachicola, the Big Ben, and the Ten Thousand Islands, \nTampa Bay, and the Caloosahatchee River, and the sandy beaches from \nTampa all the way to Marco Island? It is not worth the risk. It is not \nworth the tradeoff.\n  That is why for years we see, as depicted by the green color, the \nactive drilling leases off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, \nbut not off Florida in the eastern planning area of the gulf.\n  I know the White House is putting on a full-court press. I know the \noil and gas industry, through all of their innumerable lobbyists, are \nputting on a full-court press. We heard the Senators from each of the \noil States. Not one non-oil-producing State spoke against this today. \nYet we have our hands full because the full court lobbying press by \nevery special interest involved in drilling in oil and gas is going to \nbe working this issue as hard as it can before our vote that is going \nto occur sometime late tomorrow morning.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the risk to their Outer Continental \nShelf and to consider what is in the best interest of the Nation.\n  I am deeply honored that this is one of the first great debates in \nwhich I have engaged, in which I have joined so many of those with whom \nI argued in many of the other debates, such as budget, education, and \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. This, however, is one of the great \ndebates that will take place, and it is an honor for me to have \nparticipated in it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, OCS Lease Sale 181 is an essential \nelement of a national energy policy that will provide affordable and \nsecure supply of energy.\n  Sale 181, the most promising domestic opportunity for newly-available \nleases in many years is a resource rich area for new supplies of \nnatural gas and oil. It will play an important role in meeting the \nNation's energy needs.\n  Sale 181 is the work-product of more than five years of planning and \npreparation by the Federal Government, affected States, and industry, \nand should proceed as scheduled in December 2001.\n  The Nation's demand for natural gas is expected to grow \nsignificantly.\n  According to a 1999 National Petroleum Council study, the nation's \ndemand for natural gas is expected to increase by 32 percent to 29 \ntrillion cubic feet by 2010 and by 41 percent to 31 trillion cubic feet \nby 2015.\n  Current demand is 22 trillion cubic feet. Natural gas is essentially \na North American commodity.\n  If the Nation is to meet its growing natural gas demand, access to \ngas resource rich areas like the Sale 181 area is an indispensable \nelement of the energy policy agenda.\n  Major reserves of oil and natural gas are believed to exist in the \neastern gulf. According to a study conducted in conjunction with the \n1999 National Petroleum Council study, the Sale 181 area may hold 7.8 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.9 billion barrels of oil.\n  This is enough natural gas to supply 4.6 million households for 20 \nyears and enough oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for three \nand one-half years or make enough gasoline to fuel 3.1 million cars for \n20 years.\n  This is also three and one-half times the amount of oil currently in \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserves.\n  Sale 181 was recently modified to ensure a balance between state and \nfederal interests.\n  Key affected constituencies including Alabama, Florida, and the \nDepartment of Defense were consulted during development of the current \nfive-year plan to ensure that all concerns were addressed.\n  For example, the sale area was drawn to insure it was consistent with \nthe State of Florida's request for no oil and gas activities within 100 \nmiles of its coast, including limiting the number of tracts offered for \nlease.\n\n  In 1996, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles expressed appreciation to MMS \nfor developing a program that recognized the need to exclude any tracts \nwithin 100 miles of Florida's coasts.\n  The sale area, with full recognition by Florida, including Florida \ncongressional delegation, was specifically excluded from current \nleasing moratoria language under both Congressional action and \nPresident Clinton's 1998 Executive order.\n  Other tracts are expected to be deferred to assure smooth operations \nwhen the military and industry operate in the same area.\n  Sale 181 is a regional opportunity that impacts 5 Gulf States; all 5 \nGulf States were consulted. Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas \nsupport Sale 181.\n  These States will enjoy significant economic benefits as a result of \nexploration and production activities in the area.\n  In addition, the coastal area of Louisiana will be the most heavily \nimpacted of the five States.\n  The impact on Florida will be minimal. Many tracts in the sale area \nare closer to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama than to Florida. In \nfact, Cuba is closer to Florida shore than is this lease.\n  Parts of the sale area come within about 40 miles of Mississippi, 64 \nmiles of Louisiana, and about 18 miles of Alabama.\n  Florida could benefit significantly from Sale 181. Florida's \npopulation is expected to grow by 29 percent between now and 2020.\n  Florida's total demand for natural gas is expected to grow by 142 \npercent during the same period.\n  About two-thirds of this growth in demand is for natural gas to \ngenerate electricity.\n  Some of the potential 7.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that \ncould be produced from Sale 181 could help meet the State's significant \ndemand for natural gas during this time.\n  Making more natural gas available to Florida utilities for \nelectricity generation should lead to better air quality in the state.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the Record why \nI voted to table the Durbin amendment to H.R. 2217, the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  First of all, once national monuments are designated, similar to \nother federal designations, those lands are withdrawn from any further \nmining activity, with exception to existing\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\nleases. My understanding is that nearly all of the recent monuments \ndesignated by the prior Administration are protected in this manner. \nOnly one of the newly established monuments in Colorado has specific \nprovisions in its proclamation that could potentially allow some type \nof oil or gas mining development. Unless the Congress or the President \nby executive action changes the terms of the original proclamation that \nestablished these monuments, these lands areas are protected. I would \nimagine that such changes would be difficult to approve.\n  The second reason I opposed this amendment is that I object to the \nprocess by which many of these monuments were designated by the \nprevious Administration. If important land use issues like this one had \nbeen thoroughly evaluated during an open and fair public process prior \nto the monument designation, the Senate would not have to vote on this \ntype of amendment. The use of the 1906 Antiquities Act is not an \nappropriate way to unilaterally cut off millions of acres of land from \npublic use by fiat nor does it allow for the type of open and fair \ninput to those living and working on and near those lands. Our \ndemocratic process should promote such procedural fairness and \nconsultation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7490-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, no matter what other issues are \ndiscussed in this Senate, what other concerns are brought before the \nbody, the Nation's attention is turned again to the issue of campaign \nfinance reform, the seemingly never-ending effort to restore integrity \nto this process and change the Nation's campaign finance laws.\n  In March, the Senate passed a comprehensive and workable piece of \nlegislation; it required 2 weeks and 22 amendments. One of those \namendments I offered together with my colleagues, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Ensign. It was the other part of the \nequation: As we reduce the amount of money that is raised, to reduce \nthe amount that must by necessity be spent.\n  Campaign spending in America is easily defined. It is used for \ntelevision overwhelmingly: 80 or 85 percent of the cost of the Senate \ncampaign goes to a television network.\n  This amendment was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate. I take the \nfloor today because it is now in jeopardy. It is unconscionable, while \nthe American people have demanded a control on the amount of political \nmoney being spent in America, unconscionable while this Congress has \nfought for campaign finance reform, the broadcast industry is fighting \nto the death to reverse this amendment in the House of Representatives \nand allow the television networks to charge whatever they want to \ncharge for political advertising.\n  I take the floor today as one who has voted for campaign finance \nreform since I came to the Congress 18 years ago. I have always voted \nfor campaign finance reform. I always want to vote for it because I \nbelieve the system must be fundamentally changed to restore integrity \nto the system and gain the confidence of the American people.\n  I take the floor to make this very clear: Reducing campaign \nfundraising without reducing the cost of campaigns is not reform. That \nreduces the amount of communication. It makes it more difficult for the \npolitical parties and candidates to communicate their message. This \ncannot be reform. This is silencing political debate in America.\n  The bill that passed this Senate reduced the amount of soft money, \neliminated the amount of soft money and, correspondingly, in a balanced \nfashion, dealt with this cost of advertising.\n  In 1971, the Congress believed we had faced this problem and required \nthe charging of the lowest unit charge. Over 30 years, the law became \nineffective. That is why I offered this amendment. This chart shows, by \n1990, an audit by the FEC found that 80 percent of television stations \nwere failing to give the lowest rate. These are examples from around \nthe country. The price of a typical ad is a percent greater than the \nlowest rate that should have been offered: NBC in New York, 21 percent \nhigher than by law should have been charged; WXYZ in Detroit, 124 \npercent; KGO, San Francisco, 62 percent higher than the lowest rate. \nThese are the numbers that convinced 69 Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate to pass this amendment.\n  The second reason for the amendment is that stations are charging \ncandidates the lowest rate, looking back 365 days. So they cannot \nsimply charge the lowest rate available on that day, which they were \nnot doing anyway, but had to look back for what was the lowest rate \nduring the course of the year. The fact is, the broadcast industry in \nAmerica has been profiteering at the expense of the political system. \nThere is not another democracy in the world where the public airwaves, \nlicensed to private companies, are used for profiteering and price \ngouging when a public candidate attempts to communicate with people in \nthe country.\n\n  The patterns are quite clear. This chart indicates the percentage of \nads sold above or below the lowest unit cost per station. Below the \nunit rate, Philadelphia, KYW, 9 percent; Detroit, XYZ, 8 percent; Los \nAngeles, one of the better in the country, is only 63 percent. NBC in \nNew York, 15 percent of their ads are sold in accordance with the 1971 \nlaw at the lowest unit rate.\n  It isn't that the law is not being obeyed; it is being violated \nwholesale. Compliance with the law is the rare, rare, exception.\n  Here is the magnitude of the problem. In the 2000 political season, \npolitical advertisers spent $1 billion on television ads; $1 billion \nwas raised, fundraiser by fundraiser, mailer by mailer, telephone call \nby telephone call. And an extraordinary percentage of this advertising, \nif it had been paid for at the lowest unit rate, would have saved \nhundreds of millions of dollars in political fundraising.\n  My message out of this, I hope, is clear. I speak not to my \ncolleagues, but I speak to the broadcast industry, to the network \ntelevisions, which since the 2000 Presidential campaign have carried on \na campaign of their own, criticizing the political community, attacking \nindividual candidates, railing against the problems of political \nfundraising.\n  Instead of being part of the problem, be part of the solution. \nCampaign finance reform does not simply mean the Democrat and \nRepublican Parties. It means ABC, NBC, CBS. It means you. Get your \nlobbyists out of the House of Representatives, out of these Chambers, \nand be part of a solution of campaign finance reform. Allow a balanced \npiece of legislation to pass this Congress that deals with this \nproblem.\n  The National Association of Broadcasters has been fighting against \nthis provision in an exercise of their own greed on two myths: First, \nthat this will lead to perpetual campaigns because the low rates will \nmean this will go on and on forever in advertising.\n  That simply is not the case. The look-back will only allow the lowest \nrates for 365 days. Mr. Shays and Meehan have only proposed 180 days. \nThat is the extent, in the primary season, campaigns are taking place \nanyway. The campaigns will not be longer; they will just be less \nexpensive. And that is the problem for the broadcasters.\n  Second, that this is somehow unconstitutional, that we are taking \nprivate property. For 30 years this has already been the law. The \nbroadcasters, as a condition of their license, are required to do \npublic broadcasting, sometimes children's broadcasting. They comply \nwith all kinds of Federal requirements as a condition of having a \npublic license. This is one more, but it is not even a new requirement. \nFor 30 years we have required them to sell at the lowest unit rate. \nThey simply are not doing it. We are just strengthening the law; we are \nnot fundamentally changing the law.\n  Third, they allege the amendment could force a TV station to sell a \n30-second spot during a prime time television show for a de minimus \namount of money. Actually, that would not be bad if it were true, but \nit is not. The FCC, in mediating pricing disputes under the law as it \nnow stands, has always taken viewership levels into account, that they \nmust be comparable.\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\n You cannot take a 2 o'clock in the morning television show that sells \nat a discount rate and compare it with prime time. It simply is not \ntrue.\n  Fourth, the broadcasters say lowering the costs of candidate \nadvertising will result in candidates running more ads. As my friend \nMitch McConnell commented on occasion, the Nation does not suffer from \ntoo much political discussion. It would not be a bad thing if there \nwere more advertising, discussing more issues. But that is probably not \nthe result of this amendment. It simply means candidates will raise \nless money because of campaign finance reform and hopefully be able to \nhave the same amount of advertising because rates are lower.\n  This is all part and parcel of eliminating a major source of revenue \nfor the broadcasters, and that is the problem. Political advertising is \na paid form, in my judgment, of community service. This is not running \na public service ad for the Boy Scouts, but it should not be akin to \ncharging General Motors to advertise a new car either. And that is \nexactly what has happened.\n  Here, political ads have now become the third highest source of \nrevenue for the broadcasters. In 1998, the automobile industry was the \nsource of 25 percent of advertising dollars in America. Political \ncandidates, using the public airwaves to discuss public policy issues \nunder campaign finance law restrictions, are 10 percent of advertising \ndollars in America. This is growing faster than any other component of \nadvertising in the Nation. Political advertising is not an industry; it \nis how we conduct public policy in a democracy. That is why we have \noffered this amendment as well.\n  This legislation will be voted upon in the House of Representatives \nin only another day. The House of Representatives has a choice that was \nbefore this Senate. The national broadcasters have spent $19 million \nsince 1996 to lobby this Congress. They have spent $11 million to \ndefeat no fewer than 12 campaign finance bills that would have reduced \nthe cost of candidate advertising. It is unconscionable and it is \nwrong. It is also hypocrisy. The very news departments and executives \nthat come to this Congress and complain about the state of politics in \nAmerica, the lack of public confidence, the declining levels of \nintegrity in the public discourse because of campaign fundraisers, are \nnow a principal obstacle to reform.\n  I want to vote for McCain-Feingold when that legislation returns to \nthis Senate after a conference, but I will make it very clear: \nRestricting campaign fundraising with no restriction on the cost of \ncampaign advertising, in the region of the country in which I live, and \nLos Angeles and Chicago and Miami and Boston and other large cities in \nAmerica, means that candidates will not be able to communicate with the \npublic. There will be no independent means of the political parties \nactually getting their message to American voters.\n  I am prepared to vote to limit campaign spending, to eliminate soft \nmoney, but the test, in my judgment, at least for the region of the \ncountry in which I live, is whether we can overcome this hurdle of the \nbroadcasters as well.\n  Mr. President, I hope the House of Representatives meets its \nresponsibility. I hope we can get a bill that in good conscience many \nof us in the Senate can vote to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7491-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              H-2A REFORM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of the \nAgriculture Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2001. I am \nproud to join my colleague Senator Craig as a cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I am a strong believer that American workers should have the first \nchance to have American farm and ranch jobs. However, when there are \nnot enough American workers, our agricultural producers should be able \nto find farmworkers elsewhere. Under the current H-2A agricultural \nguest worker program, producers are required to go through a lengthy, \nuncertain, and undoubtedly costly process to demonstrate to the Federal \nGovernment that American workers are not available in order to gain \nauthorization for guest workers. During this long process, Montana \ncrops are not being harvested and cattle and sheep herds are not being \ntended to the degree they require. A General Accounting Office study \nrecently found that the Government's inefficiency in processing such \nclaims discourages use of the program. As a result, the Federal \nGovernment estimates that only half of this country's 1.6 million \nagricultural workers are authorized to work in the U.S., and the figure \nmay be higher since the estimate is based on self-disclosure by illegal \nworkers.\n  Let me give you an example of how H-2A reform will benefit real \nproducers. We have a number of large sheep operations in Montana. All \nof these sheep need to be sheared in the spring of the year, and as any \nsheep rancher will tell you, this is a job that needs to be done \nquickly, safely, and accurately. Shearers need to pay close attention \nto detail, lest sheep could be severely injured. With the number of \nsheep ranches in this country dwindling, there are few Americans who \nshear professionally, so guest workers from countries such as Argentina \nmust be brought in to do the job. Reform of the H-2A program would make \nthis process easier for our sheep producers.\n  It is high time we reformed the H-2A program. This legislation will \nreplace the current system with a more efficient process for \ncertification of H-2A employers looking to hire agricultural guest \nworkers. It will also replace the current, unrealistic premium wage \nmandated for H-2A employers with the standard, minimum wage. Employers \nwill continue to furnish housing and transportation to H-2A workers.\n  This bill makes sense for producers in Montana, Senator Craig's home \nState of Idaho, and other agricultural States across the country. It \nalso provides a better environment for our guest workers. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7491-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Responding to this trend, the American \ntourist industry established motels that catered to the needs of family \nhighway travelers.\n  Recognizing the economic potential associated with the growing \ntourist industry in Vermont, Stanley and Minnie Sabens established the \nKnoll Motel on 1015 North Main Street in Barre. Located near the State \nCapital, Montpelier, and what eventually became Interstate 89, the \noriginal eight-room facility became a model for the motel industry in \nVermont, where tourism is vital to the success of the state's economy.\n  Keeping with Vermont's proud tradition of family-owned businesses, \nStanley Sabens II has assumed the management of the Knoll Motel, \nensuring that future generations of visitors to Vermont will be able to \nenjoy the Sabens' hospitality for years to come.\n  I congratulate the Sabens family and the Knoll Motel for their many \nyears of service to Vermont and its visitors, and I wish them success \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7492-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF ROSEMARIE MAHER\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in \nremembrance of a wonderful Alaskan, Mrs. Rosemarie Maher, the President \nand Chief Operating Officer of the Doyon Native Regional Corp. based in \nFairbanks, Alaska.\n  On Monday, I attended the moving memorial service in Fairbanks in \nRosemarie's Maher's honor, who tragically died quite suddenly last week \nat far too young an age--53. Along with my wife Nancy, I want to \nexpress my deepest sympathies to Rosemarie's husband, Terry J. Maher, \ntheir children: Malinda and husband Jim Holmes, Warren J. and wife \nAngela Westfall, and Kerry-Rose and Kevin Maher, and all other family \nmembers.\n  I also want to express my condolences to the employees and all of the \nnearly 14,000 shareholders of Doyon Ltd. upon the death of a very \ndedicated and talented woman, who successfully advanced the causes of \nboth Doyon members and of all Alaska Natives.\n  Rosemarie Maher showed uncommon grace and perseverance during her \nthree decade career working on behalf of Alaska Natives. For 21 years, \nshe served as a member of the Doyon corporation's board of directors \nand assumed the role of daily leadership of the corporation under such \ndifficult circumstances in winter 2000.\n  Rosemarie Maher began her involvement in Alaska Native organizations \nand public service while still in her 20's. As a devoted wife and \nmother, she helped to steer development of several organizations, \nincluding the Interior Village Association and the Tanana Chiefs \nConference. In 1979, she was first elected to the Doyon Ltd. Board of \nDirectors. Seven years later, she was elected Chairman of the Board, a \nposition she held until her appointment as President and Chief \nExecutive Officer after the tragic plane-crash death in January 2000 of \nlong-time Doyon President Morris Thompson.\n  Mrs. Maher was born in a fish camp on the Nabesna River near her home \nof Northway along the Alaska Highway in Central Alaska. As a child she \nwas raised as a traditional Athabascan Indian, but as a young teen she \nwas educated at Sheldon Jackson School in Sitka and later at East High \nSchool in Anchorage. After graduating from high school, she trained at \nAlaska Business College and in 1969 moved to Fairbanks, working for \nseveral U.S. Government agencies.\n  During the mid 1970s, Mrs. Maher moved back to Northway where she was \nelected President of the Northway Village Council and helped form the \nUpper Tanana Alcohol Program in the Tok area. She also played a key \nrole in the incorporation of Greater Northway Inc., the non-profit \norganization formed to administer local infrastructure and economic \ndevelopment projects in the region. She was a shareholder of Northway \nNatives Inc., the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Village \nCorporation for Northway, serving as the first President of that \norganization. She also was President of Naabia Niign, a Northway Native \nsubsidiary.\n  From 1976 to 1984 she entered governmental public service as a member \nof the Alaska Gateway School District Board and was a director of the \nNorthwest Regional Education Lab, a non-profit, federally and privately \nfunded educational research organization based in Portland, Ore. She \nalso was a member of the Teamsters Union, working summers in road \nconstruction and hazardous waste cleanup between 1992 and 2000.\n  At the statewide level, Rosemarie served as Co-Chair of the Alaska \nFederation of Natives from 1997-2000 and was a member of the Alaska \nBoard of Game. She also served as a member of the Governor's Commission \non Local Governance and Empowerment and on the Governor's Highway and \nNatural Gas Policy Council.\n  Rosemarie truly did commit her life to the success of Alaska Native \ncorporations and to the betterment of her neighbors and of all Alaska \nNatives. Her death is a great loss, not just to Doyon and her Native \nculture, but to all who knew and loved her. Again our deepest \nsympathies to her family and friends. She will always be remembered \nwith great fondness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7492-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n  H.R. 2131.

A bill to repeal the requirement relating to specific \nstatutory authorization for increases in judicial salaries, to provide \nfor automatic annual increases for judicial salaries, to provide for a \n9.6 percent increase in judicial salaries, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, along with Senator Thompson, \nto introduce legislation to restore pay equity for our Federal judges. \nThis legislation would guarantee judges automatic and annual cost-of-\nliving adjustments, COLAs, just like other rank-and-file Federal \nemployees.\n  In addition, the legislation would end a decade of Federal judicial \nsalary neglect by giving judges a one-time salary increase of 9.6 \npercent. In the past decade, Congress has denied COLAs for judges in \nfour separate years, in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998. This bill would \nrestore to Federal justices the four COLAs they have lost.\n  In his year-end report on the state of the Federal Judiciary, Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist called the ``the need to increase judicial \nsalaries'' the most pressing issue facing the Federal judiciary.\n  Simply put, while government service offers its own rewards, we \nshould not create financial disincentives to service on the Federal \nbench.\n  Federal judges bear enormous responsibility as they preside over the \nmost pressing legal issues. Often, they must render life-or-death \ndecisions or preside over cases with millions of dollars at stake. For \nthis vitally important work, they deserve appropriate compensation.\n  Recently, Congress took some action to restore equity in Federal \nsalaries by doubling the salary of the President of the United States \nfrom $200,000 to $400,000.\n  Congress should now consider an appropriate pay adjustment for the \nFederal judiciary. As of January 2001, Federal district judges receive \nan annual salary of $145,000. If judges had received the COLAs to which \nthey were entitled, a Federal District judge's salary would actually be \n$164,700, nearly $20,000 higher.\n  Now, $145,000 is a lot more money than the salary of a typical worker \nbut it is not so high when you compare it to equivalent positions of \nauthority in the private sector. For example, the average partner in a \nmajor national law firm earns well over $500,000 per year.\n  It is even more striking to note that major national law firms are \noffering first-year associates salaries topping $125,000 a year. With \nbonuses, some of these newly minted lawyers are earning more than \nappellate judges.\n  The bottom line is that we cannot expect to keep our country's best \nlawyers interested in serving on the Federal bench if we continue to \ndenigrate the salary of the post. Just since 1993, the salary of \nFederal judges, adjusted for inflation, has declined by 13 percent.\n  Not surprisingly, more and more judges are leaving the Federal bench. \nBetween 1991 and 2000, 52 Federal judges resigned their seats, many of \nthem for the purposes of returning to private practice. These 52 judges \nrepresent 40 percent of the 125 Federal judges who have left the bench \nsince 1965.\n  Attorneys should not expect to become wealthy through an appointment \nas a Federal judge. Neither should judges expect to have their salaries \neroded by Congress' failure to give them Cost-of-Living Adjustments.\n  Preserving judicial salaries is vital to maintaining the high quality \nof our Federal judiciary. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the Senate to restore fairness to judicial compensation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1163. A bill to increase the mortgage loan limits under the \nNational Housing Act for multifamily housing mortgage insurance; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Carper, in introducing legislation, \nthe FHA Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act, that would \nimprove access to affordable housing.\n  Our Nation currently faces a critical housing shortage. A report \nreleased recently by the Center for Housing Policy, ``Housing America's \nWorking Families,'' documented the overwhelming need for affordable \nhousing. The report indicates that in 1997, nearly 14 million families \nhad a critical housing need, meaning they either lived in substandard \nhousing conditions or spent\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nmore than half their monthly income on the cost of housing. The FHA \nMultifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act would provide America's \nworking families with increased access to affordable rental housing.\n  The bill is simple, it increases by 25 percent the statutory limits \nfor multifamily project loans that can be insured by the FHA. This \nincrease reflects the increased costs associated with the production of \nmultifamily units since 1992, when these limits were last revised. The \nbill also would index the loan limits for inflation and increases to \nthe Annual Construction Cost Index, which is published by the Census \nBureau.\n  Rising construction costs have resulted in a shortage of moderately \npriced affordable rental units. Rent increases now exceed inflation in \nall regions of the country, and new affordable rental units have become \nincreasingly harder to find. Because of the current dollar limits on \nloans, FHA insurance cannot be used to help finance construction in \nhigh-cost urban areas such as the New York/New Jersey metropolitan \narea, Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n  By increasing the limits on loans for rental housing we will create \nmore incentives for public/private investment in communities through \nAmerica and spur the new production of cooperative housing projects, \nrental housing for the elderly, and new construction or substantial \nrehabilitation of apartments by for- and non-profit entities.\n  Late last year, Congress sought, through a number of initiatives, to \nimplement programs aimed at increasing the production of affordable \nhousing for the millions of Americans who currently face critical \nhousing needs. For example, we expanded the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit, the one Federal program designed to produce new housing. We \nalso increased the supply of housing vouchers. However, these programs \nwere targeted largely at families with very low incomes. Currently, \nthere are no programs designed specifically to provide access to \naffordable rental housing for America's working middle class, the \npeople who serve as the engine of our nation's economy. Far too many of \nthese individuals, including vital municipal workers like teachers, \nnurses and police officers, are struggling to gain access to affordable \nhousing even remotely near where they work.\n  Without this much-needed adjustment to the FHA multifamily loan \nlimits, access to affordable housing for our working-citizens will \ncontinue to lag, thousands of more families will join the 14 million \npeople who currently face severe housing needs and our nation's economy \nwill suffer.\n  This bill is modeled after bipartisan legislation introduced in the \nHouse by my colleague from New Jersey, Congresswoman Marge Roukema, and \nCongressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts. The bill is supported by \nhousing and community advocates and has also been endorsed by the \nNational Association of Home Builders, the National Association of \nRealtors, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will support the legislation and help us \nensure that America's working families have access to affordable \nhousing.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleague from new Jersey to introduce the FHA \nMultifamily Housing Mortgage Loan Limit Adjustment Act of 2001.\n  A recent report published by the National Housing Conference's Center \nfor Housing Policy found that in 1997, nearly 14 million families \neither lived in substandard housing or spent more than half of their \nmonthly income on housing costs. This affordable housing shortage also \ncomes at a time of limited resources. Thus, we have to find the best \nuse of each dollar at our disposal, as well as the most effective use \nof existing Federal programs to stimulate new production and \nsubstantial rehabilitation.\n  The Federal Housing Administration's, FHA, multifamily mortgage \ninsurance is an important financing device for housing production. \nUnfortunately, production through this public/private partnership has \nbeen low in recent years. One of the reasons for FHA's absence from the \nrental housing market is that the multifamily loan limits have not been \nincreased since 1992. While the annual Construction Cost Index, \npublished by the Census Bureau, has increased over 23 percent since \n1992, FHA's multifamily loan limits have remained static.\n  These rising construction costs have contributed to FHA's inability \nto be a significant participant in the production of multifamily \nhousing. Increasing these loan limits by 25 percent, as this \nlegislation does, is something Congress can do today to address \nimmediately the shortage is affordable rental housing. This bill \nmodifies a current federal program, FHA multifamily insurance, to make \nthat program more effective. Importantly, this legislation also indexes \nthe loan limits to the Annual Construction Cost Index.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with Senator Corzine and me to increase \nthese multifamily loan limits so that more working families will have \naccess to affordable rental housing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 1164. A bill to provide for the enhanced protection of the privacy \nof location information of users of location-based services and \napplications, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce much-needed \nlegislation to protect the privacy of consumers who use technologies \nthat can pinpoint their location. Under my bill, the Location Privacy \nProtection Act, any company that monitors consumers' physical location \nwill be prohibited from using or disclosing that information without \nexpress permission from the consumer. And third parties that gain \naccess to the information cannot use or disclose it without the \nindividual's permission first.\n  Within the next few years, new technologies will allow companies to \nknow our location any time of day or night. Our cell phones, pagers, \ncars, palm pilots and other devices will enable companies to constantly \ntrack where we go and how often we go there. These services can have \nenormous advantages. For example, public safety and rescue teams can \nsave lives with systems that enable them to quickly locate crash \nvictims. Imagine being able to ask your cell phone for directions to \nthe nearest Italian restaurant. Or imagine you are traveling in a new \ncity and your pager alerts you when you are within a block of your \nfavorite coffee shop, which happens to be running a sale on coffee. The \npossibilities for location-based services and application are endless.\n  But these new technologies also raise serious privacy issues. \nLocation information is very private, sensitive information that can be \nmisused to harass consumers with unwanted solicitations or to draw \ninaccurate or embarrassing inferences about them. And in extreme cases, \nimproper disclosure of location information to a domestic abuser or \nstalker could place a person in physical danger.\n  The wireless industry is unique in that it has worked with Congress \nto guarantee some privacy protections in the law, and it should be \ncommended for recognizing the sensitivity of location information. \nHowever, although these laws are a good first step, we need to build on \nthem and strengthen them. For example, although under the law customers \nmust give their permission before wireless carriers can use or disclose \ntheir location information, the law does not require carriers to \nclearly notify consumers about how their location information will be \nused if they do grant their permission. Consumers also have no control \nover what happens to their information once third parties gain access \nto it. These parties are free to share it with anyone they please. And \nshockingly, there are no laws that protect the privacy of users of new \ntechnologies like telematics, services that allow drivers to get \ndirections at the push of a button in their cars, and global \npositioning systems.\n  My legislation puts control over location information in the hands of \nthe consumer. It requires the FCC to issue new regulations prohibiting \nall providers of location-based services and applications from \ncollecting, using, disclosing, or retaining location information \nwithout the customer's permission first. And customers must be given \nclear and conspicuous notice about what the company is going to do\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nwith their location information. Customers also will have the right to \nensure the accuracy of the information that is collected and companies \nwill be required to keep that information safe from unauthorized \naccess.\n  Third parties will not be able to use or disclose location \ninformation without prior authorization from the customer. In this \nregard, my bill makes an exception if the third party is an emergency \nservice. I believe that the FCC must be very careful not to interfere \nwith the laws that have been carefully crafted to allow emergency \nmedical rescue teams, public safety, fire services, hospital emergency \nfacilities and other emergency services to respond to the user's call \nfor help. These laws are critical to saving lives and I believe we \nshould do everything we can to make sure they work.\n  I would also like to point out that while my bill requires that the \nFCC rules not interfere with the ability of law enforcement to obtain \nlocation information pursuant to an appropriate court order, it does \nnot provide the FCC with extraordinary authority to control when law \nenforcement can and cannot gain access to location information. \nAlthough I have concerns about unnecessary and surreptitious government \nsurveillance, I believe that this issue is best addressed either \nseparately, or at a later date. The purpose of my bill is primarily to \nlay down guidelines for when private persons, such as businesses, are \nable to use and disclose consumers' location information.\n  The law needs to be strengthened, and we have the opportunity to do \nso while these location-based technologies are in their infancy. We \nhave a unique opportunity to give consumers power over their location \ninformation before its commercial value becomes so great that it is \nimpossible for consumers to prevent the buying and selling of this very \npersonal information.\n  In sum, I believe the Location Privacy Protection Act is a common \nsense measure offered at an ideal time. I know that wireless carriers \nand many companies such as OnStar, ATX, Qualcomm and others care deeply \nabout privacy. I applaud them for their efforts and I look forward to \ncontinuing working with them on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Location Privacy Protection \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Location-based services and applications allow \n     customers to receive services based on their geographic \n     location, position, or known presence. Telematics devices, \n     for instance, permit subscribers in vehicles to obtain \n     emergency road assistance, driving directions, or other \n     information with the push of a button. Other devices, such as \n     those with Internet access, support position commerce in \n     which notification of points of interest or promotions can be \n     provided to customers based on their known presence or \n     geographic location.\n       (2) There is a substantial Federal interest in safeguarding \n     the privacy right of customers of location-based services or \n     applications to control the collection, use, retention of, \n     disclosure of, and access to their location information. \n     Location information is nonpublic information that can be \n     misused to commit fraud, to harass consumers with unwanted \n     messages, to draw embarrassing or inaccurate inferences about \n     them, or to discriminate against them. Improper disclosure of \n     or access to location information could also place a person \n     in physical danger. For example, location information could \n     be misused by stalkers or by domestic abusers.\n       (3) The collection or retention of unnecessary location \n     information magnifies the risk of its misuse or improper \n     disclosure.\n       (4) Congress has recognized the right to privacy of \n     location information by classifying location information as \n     customer proprietary network information subject to section \n     222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222), \n     thereby preventing use or disclosure of that information \n     without a customer's express prior authorization.\n       (5) There is a substantial Federal interest in promoting \n     fair competition in the provision of wireless services and in \n     ensuring the consumer confidence necessary to ensure \n     continued growth in the use of wireless services. These goals \n     can be attained by establishing a set of privacy rules that \n     apply to wireless location information, regardless of \n     technology, and to all entities and services that generate or \n     receive access to such information.\n       (6) It is in the public interest that the Federal \n     Communications Commission establish comprehensive rules to \n     protect the privacy of customers of location-based services \n     and applications and thereby enable customers to realize more \n     fully the benefits of location services and applications.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF LOCATION INFORMATION PRIVACY.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking Required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall complete a rulemaking proceeding for \n     purposes of further protecting the privacy of location \n     information.\n       (b) Elements.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (2), the rules prescribed by the Commission under subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (A) require providers of location-based services and \n     applications to inform customers, with clear and conspicuous \n     notice, about their policies on the collection, use, \n     disclosure of, retention of, and access to customer location \n     information;\n       (B) require providers of location-based services and \n     applications to obtain a customer's express authorization \n     before--\n       (i) collecting, using, or retaining the customer's location \n     information; or\n       (ii) disclosing or permitting access to the customer's \n     location information to any person who is not a party to, or \n     who is not necessary to the performance of, the service \n     contract between the customer and such provider;\n       (C) require that all providers of location-based services \n     or applications--\n       (i) restrict any collection, use, disclosure of, retention \n     of, and access to customer location information to the \n     specific purpose that is the subject of the express \n     authorization of the customer concerned; and\n       (ii) not subsequently release a customer's location \n     information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which the \n     customer provided express authorization;\n       (D) ensure the security and integrity of location data, and \n     give customers reasonable access to their location data for \n     purposes of verifying the accuracy of, or deleting, such \n     data;\n       (E) be technology neutral to ensure uniform privacy rules \n     and expectations and provide the framework for fair \n     competition among similar services;\n       (F) require that aggregated location information not be \n     disaggregated through any means into individual location \n     information for any commercial purpose; and\n       (G) not impede customers from readily utilizing location-\n     based services or applications.\n       (2) Permitted uses.--The rules prescribed under subsection \n     (a) may permit the collection, use, retention, disclosure of, \n     or access to a customer's location information without prior \n     notice or consent to the extent necessary to--\n       (A) provide the service from which such information is \n     derived, or to provide the location-based service that the \n     customer is accessing;\n       (B) initiate, render, bill, and collect for the location-\n     based service or application;\n       (C) protect the rights or property of the provider of the \n     location-based service or application, or protect customers \n     of the service or application from fraudulent, abusive, or \n     unlawful use of, or subscription to, the service or \n     application;\n       (D) produce aggregate location information; and\n       (E) comply with an appropriate court order.\n       (3) Additional requirement.--Under the rules prescribed \n     under subsection (a), any third party receiving, or receiving \n     access to, a customer's location information from a provider \n     of location services or applications pursuant to the express \n     authorization of the customer, shall not disclose or permit \n     access to such information to any other person without the \n     express authorization of the customer.\n       (4) Express authorization.--\n       (A) Form.--For purposes of the rules prescribed under \n     subsection (a) and section 222(f) of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222(f)), the Commission shall specify the \n     appropriate methods, whether technological or otherwise, by \n     which a customer may provide express prior authorization. \n     Such methods may include a written or electronically signed \n     service agreement or other contractual instrument.\n       (B) Modification or revocation.--Under the rules prescribed \n     under subsection (a), a customer shall have the power to \n     modify or revoke at any time an express authorization given \n     by the customer under the rules.\n       (c) Application of Rules.--The rules prescribed by the \n     Commission under subsection (a) shall apply to any person \n     that provides a location-based service or application, \n     whether or not such person is also a provider of commercial \n     mobile service (as that term is defined in section 332(d) of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(d)).\n       (d) Relationship to Wireless Communications and Public \n     Safety Act of 1999.--The rules prescribed by the Commission \n     under subsection (a) shall be consistent with the amendments \n     to section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     222) made by section 5 of the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\n     106-81;

A bill to prevent juvenile crime, promote accountability by \nand rehabilitation of juvenile crime, punish and deter violent gang \ncrime, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Kohl and Senator Reed, the Juvenile Crime Prevention and \nControl Act of 2001. This is a balanced bill that recognizes the need \nto get tough on juvenile crime and violence, attempts to break the \ndangerous link between kids and guns, and, most importantly, puts the \nFederal Government firmly behind the proposition that preventing \njuvenile violence is the most effective crime fighting measure any of \nus could craft.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of the bill, let me give a brief \noverview of the current state of juvenile crime in America. Juvenile \ncrime, like almost all other categories of crime, is down. Last \nDecember, the FBI released statistics that show the homicide arrest \nrate for juveniles down 68 percent from its 1993 peak. We are now \nexperiencing the lowest rate of juvenile homicide arrests since 1966. \nBetween 1994 and 1999, the arrest rate of juveniles for violent crimes, \nmurder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, dropped 36 percent.\n  These statistics have not eased public concern about the scope and \nnature of juvenile crime. One 1998 poll showed that 62 percent of those \nasked believed juvenile crime was increasing. A poll conducted in 1999 \nrevealed that 71 percent thought it likely that a shooting could occur \nin a school in their community. In the face of these popular \nperceptions, the Education Department reports that American children \nface a one in 2 million chance of being killed in their school.\n  Why the disparity? There are several reasons, in my opinion. First, \nand probably most importantly, while arrests of juveniles are \nunquestionably down, juvenile crime is still too high. The incidence of \nthe most common crime committed by juveniles, property offenses, \nchanged little throughout the last two decades. The rate of juvenile \nviolent crime arrests has not yet returned to its 1988 level.\n  Second, and this cannot be understated, too many of our kids have \naccess to guns, and those guns are finding their way into our Nation's \nschools at an alarming rate. A report released last year by the \nEducation Department revealed that over 3,500 students were expelled in \n1998 and 1999 for bringing guns to school, that's an average of 88 kids \nper week. The juvenile arrest rate for weapons crimes fell 39 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1999, but it too has not yet returned to 1988's low point.\n  Third, the American people understand that crime cannot stay down \nforever. I like to say that fighting crime is like mowing the grass, If \nyou don't keep at it, it's going to come back up. We have good, \ndemographic reasons to think this is particularly true in the case of \njuvenile crime. Today, there are approximately 39 million children \nyounger than age 10. These kids, the children of the baby boom \ngeneration, stand on the edge of their teen years, the years when every \nreliable study reveals they are most at-risk of turning to drugs and \ncrime.\n  What does this mean for juvenile crime? Even if we do everything \nright, even if we fund programs that work, put incorrigible juveniles \nbehind bars, crack down on gun crimes, the demographic inevitability of \nthis so-called ``baby boomerang\" means there is likely to be a 20 \npercent increase in juvenile murders by 2005. Such a jump would \nincrease the overall murder rate by 5 percent. Our challenge is to make \nsure that does not happen.\n  We need to take another look at the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974. That Act expired on September 30, 1996, and, \ndespite the good efforts of several Congresses, Members on both sides \nof the aisle, and the prior Administration, it has not been \nreauthorized. We should get that job done in the 107th Congress. The \nbill I introduce today includes provisions to reauthorize the Act, to \nfine tune some of its grant provisions, and to make some common sense \nchanges to our firearms laws, changes that respect the rights of gun \nowners.\n  My bill reauthorizes the Community Prevention Grant Program, commonly \nknown as Title V. It funds this critical juvenile crime prevention \ninitiative at $250,000,000 per year for the next six years and mandates \nthat no State would receive less than $200,000 in annual prevention \ngrants. These funding levels would more than double juvenile crime \nprevention funding, enough resources for localities to implement a \ncomprehensive delinquency prevention strategy and then fund smart \nprevention programs that work. In Delaware, Title V funds have been \nused to sponsor programs to reduce school violence, provide transition \ncounseling to students returning to their local school from alternative \nschool placement, reduce suspensions, expulsions, truancy, and teen \npregnancy, and provide services to the children of incarcerated adult \noffenders. Prevention is the key to keeping our juvenile crime rate \ndown, and we need to extend Title V to guarantee that these funds \ncontinue to flow to States and localities.\n\n  The bill also reauthorizes the Formula Grant Program for the next six \nyears at $200,000,000 per year. I have included provisions to expand \nthe permissible uses of these funds so as to make clear that employment \ntraining, mental health treatment, and other effective programs that \nmeet the needs of children and youth in the juvenile system could be \nfunded. The bill reauthorizes gang prevention programs and emphasizes \nthe disruption and prosecution of gangs. It extends the juvenile \njustice mentoring program, and adds a pilot program to encourage and \ndevelop mentoring initiatives that focus on entire families. The bill \nalso includes funds for grants to States to upgrade and enhance their \njuvenile felony criminal record histories.\n  My bill includes important provisions to continue the core \nprotections for incarcerated youths that were included in the original \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. It continues \nthe Act's function of protecting children from abuse and assault by \nadults in jails by prohibiting any contact between juveniles and adult \ninmates. The bill ensures that children are not detained in any jail or \nlockup for adults, except for very limited periods of time and under \nvery limited circumstances. And it continues current law's requirement \nthat States address the disproportionate number of minority children in \nconfinement.\n  The bill authorizes $500,000,000 per year over the next six years for \nthe Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program. Funded for the past \nthree fiscal years, this program has never been authorized. Its purpose \nis to strengthen State juvenile justice systems. States would receive \nfunds as long as they implement or consider implementing graduated \nsanctions, though this condition can be met through a reporting \nrequirement. The language I have included in my bill is drawn from H.R. \n863, a measure which is currently working its way through the other \nbody. I am supportive of that measure, as it will provide much needed \nfunds for States to hire additional prosecutors, juvenile court judges, \nprobation officers, and court-appointed defenders and special \nadvocates. In years past, my State has used these funds to establish\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\na Serious Juvenile Offender program through the Delaware Division of \nYouth Rehabilitative Services, which provides an immediate secure \nplacement of violent youth offenders who have violated the terms of \ntheir probation. Delaware has also used these funds to expand \ndiversionary programs such as Teen Court and Drug Court, thus reducing \nthe time between arrest and disposition of juvenile offenders, and to \nadd psycho-forensic evaluators in the Delaware Office of the Public \nDefender to identify and address mental illness as a cause for \ndelinquent conduct. This is a good program and it needs to be \nauthorized.\n  My bill also reauthorizes the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The \nTrust Fund, created in the 1994 Crime Bill, has been the key to our \nsuccessful fight against crime over the past several years. \nUnfortunately, it expired in 2000. The Violent Crime Reduction Trust \nFund was the vehicle for providing billions of dollars to State and \nlocal governments to implement a variety of law enforcement and crime-\nfighting initiative, from the COPS program to the Violence Against \nWomen Act to youth violence programs. Without the Trust Fund, I fear we \nmay not have the resources necessary to continue our struggle to keep \nour streets safe. I am pleased to include provisions in this bill that \nwill extend the Fund through fiscal year 2007.\n  Finally, the bill I am introducing today includes several common \nsense gun safety provisions. First, it incorporates Senator Reed's Gun \nShow Background Check Act. This language will ensure that criminals \ncannot purchase guns at gun shows, and I applaud Senator Reed for his \nleadership in this area. Second, I have included Senator Kohl's Child \nSafety Lock Act. This moderate provision would require handguns to be \nsold with government-certified trigger locks. Studies indicate trigger \nlocks save lives; I was pleased to see the Administration's endorsement \nof this idea in its budget request for the upcoming fiscal year; and I \nthank Senator Kohl for including his bill in this larger measure today. \nThird, the bill would extend the Brady Law to dangerous juvenile \noffenders. This provision would make it unlawful for any person \nadjudicated a juvenile delinquent for serious drug offenses or violent \nfelonies to possess firearms. This is an important step toward getting \nguns out of the hands of criminals, and its enactment will prevent \nviolent juveniles from accessing weapons and thus make it difficult for \nthem to commit gun crimes as adults.\n  This is not a perfect bill, and I am not wedded to each and every \nline. I welcome comments from my colleagues, the juvenile justice \ncommunity, and anyone interested in preventing and controlling juvenile \ncrime. I am committed, however, to renewing our efforts to keep our \nchildren and our communities safe from crime and violence. I am \ncommitted to protecting our kids through meaningful prevention and \nintervention programs, to cracking down on drugs and the violence that \naccompanies them, and to ensuring that meaningful, appropriate and \nswift punishment is imposed on all juvenile offenders. I believe the \nJuvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act that I introduce today is an \nimportant step toward accomplishing these goals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Biden to introduce \nthe Juvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act of 2001.\n  This bill is an important step forward in the debate on juvenile \njustice. It is a comprehensive approach that recognizes prevention and \nenforcement are indispensable partners in combating juvenile crime. \nThis bill addresses the issues most important to our communities, to \nthe police, to the teachers, to the social workers, and most \nimportantly, to the at-risk children whom we need to help. The \nlegislation does this by giving crime prevention programs the priority, \nattention, and funding they deserve while recognizing that enforcement \nprograms are indispensable to safer communities.\n  Let me focus on one part of the legislation. The Juvenile Crime \nPrevention and Control Act increases the authorization of Title V, the \nCommunity Prevention Grant program, to $250 million. I worked closely \nwith Senator Hank Brown to create the Title V program in 1992 because \nwe listened to local law enforcement experts who told us that \nprevention works. Almost a decade later, they still say the same thing: \na crime bill without adequate prevention is only a half-measure. That's \njust common sense.\n  Congress has slowly realized the merits of crime prevention funding. \nSince 1992, funding for Title V has increased from $20 million to $95 \nmillion. Unfortunately, almost two-thirds of that money has been \nconsistently earmarked for purposes other than crime and delinquency \nprevention. The bill remedies this problem by ensuring that at least 75 \npercent of all Title V Community Prevention Grants be spent on pure \nprevention and not set aside for other purposes.\n  We now know that crime prevention programs like Title V work. Studies \nprove that crime prevention programs mean less crime. For example, a \nRAND Study found that crime prevention efforts were three times more \ncost-effective than increased punishment. A study of the Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters' mentoring program showed that mentees were 46 percent less \nlikely to use drugs, 27 percent less likely to use alcohol, 33 percent \nless likely to commit assault, and skipped 50 percent fewer days of \nschool. A University of Wisconsin study of 64 after-school programs \nfound that participating children became better students and developed \nimproved conflict resolution skills; in addition, vandalism decreased \nat one third of the schools that participated in the programs.\n  One of the reasons these programs work is that Title V is designed to \nlet the people with the real expertise do what they know best. Title V \nis a flexible program of direct local grants. The flexibility permits \neach locality, through a local planning board of experts from the \ncommunity, to determine how to best fight juvenile crime and \ndelinquency. Title V trusts each community to address its unique \nproblems.\n  Law enforcement officials appreciate the importance of juvenile crime \nprevention programs and crave more. Last year, I surveyed every sheriff \nand chief of police in Wisconsin and found that 100 percent of \nWisconsin's sheriffs and 100 percent of the police chiefs of \nWisconsin's largest cities who responded to\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nthe questionnaire believe more Federal money needs to be spent on crime \nprevention programs. Similarly, more than 80 percent of the police \nchiefs of small and mid-size cities in Wisconsin want more prevention \nfunding.\n  When asked how much of Federal juvenile crime funding should go to \nprevention, these same law enforcement officials answer that close to \n40 percent should be spent on prevention programs, far more than the \ncurrent level of prevention funding. The Juvenile Crime Prevention and \nControl Act of 2001 listens to what local law enforcement experts have \nbeen telling us for years and addresses their needs.\n  Of course, prevention is not the sole answer to juvenile crime. \nIndeed, we need a comprehensive crime-fighting strategy aimed at \njuvenile offenders and potential offenders, from violent predators to \nchildren at-risk of becoming delinquent. This legislation understands \nthat. Tough law enforcement plays an essential role. Certain violent \njuveniles should be incarcerated, and hopefully rehabilitated, and this \nbill provides the States with sufficient funds to get them off the \nstreets and safeguard our communities.\n  Finally, no sensible juvenile crime fighting strategy is complete if \nit does not address the toxic combination of children and guns. This \nbill does that as well by mandating the sale of child safety locks with \nevery handgun and insisting that those locks are designed well enough \nto work as intended.\n  Each year, teenagers and children are involved in more than 10,000 \naccidental shootings in which close to 800 people die. In addition, \nevery year 1,300 children use firearms to commit suicide. Safety locks \ncan be effective in deterring some of these incidents and in preventing \nothers.\n  The sad truth is that we are inviting disaster every time an unlocked \ngun is stored but is still easily accessible to children. In fact, guns \nare kept in 43 percent of American households with children. In 23 \npercent of the gun households, the guns are kept loaded. And, in one \nout of every eight of those homes the guns are left unlocked.\n  During the last decade, crime rates, including juvenile crime rates, \nhave decreased. Since 1994, the juvenile arrest rate for violent crime \nhas dropped 36 percent. Nonetheless, the public perceives that juvenile \ncrime is a growing problem, especially school violence.\n  We need to remain vigilant and think creatively about how to maintain \nthis trend in falling juvenile crime. This measure provides a \ncomprehensive approach. Prevention, enforcement, and keeping guns out \nof the hands of children are three essential elements to a common sense \njuvenile crime strategy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1166. A bill to establish the Next Generation Lighting Initiative \nat the Department of Energy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DeWine to \nintroduce a bill authorizing the Secretary of Energy to lead the United \nStates into the next generation of lighting technology. If this bill is \nenacted, I believe it will allow us not only to maintain a world \nleadership role that Thomas Edison started, but promote efficiency \nadvances in a market which consumes 19 percent of our electrical energy \nsupply.\n  Lighting is a 40-billion-dollar global industry. The United States \noccupies roughly one-third of that market. It's an extremely \ncompetitive industry whose technology has been well established over \nthe course of 80 years. Today's lighting market primarily consists of \ntwo technologies. The first technology is incandescent lighting, it's \nthe one Thomas Edison invented over 100 years ago. Incandescent \nlighting relies on running a current through a wire to heat it up and \nilluminate your surroundings. Only 5 percent of the electricity in a \nconventional bulb is converted into visible light. The second type of \nlighting is fluorescent lights, which use a combination of chemical \nvapors, mainly mercury, to discharge light when current is passed \nthrough it. Flourescent lights are six times more efficient than a \nlight bulb.\n  As I have mentioned, today's lighting uses up about 19 percent of our \nelectricity supply. In 1998, lighting electricity cost about 47 billion \ndollars which accounted for about 100 million tons of carbon equivalent \nfrom fossil energy plants.\n  Today, this paradigm is changing, because some scientists recently \nmade a leap ahead in lighting research. Technology leaps displace, very \nquickly, traditional markets. We know the stories all too well, the \nhorse courier, the telegraph, the telephone and finally the Internet.\n  That is why Senator DeWine and I are proposing this legislation, \nbecause some advances have been made in the areas of solid state \nlighting that require a national investment that no one lighting \nindustry can match. This emerging technology has the capability to \ndisrupt our existing lighting markets. So quickly in fact, that other \ncountries have formed consortia between their governments, industries, \nlaboratories and universities. Solid state lighting is being taken very \nseriously around the world.\n  Let me describe solid state lighting. The best examples are red light \nemitting diodes, or ``LED's'', found in digital clocks. LED's produce \nonly one color but they do not burn up a wire like a bulb and are seven \ntimes more efficient.\n  Until recently LED's were limited to yellow or red. That all changed \nin 1995. In 1995, some Japanese researchers developed a blue LED. Soon \nother bright colors started to emerge, such as green. That is when \nthings started to change. Because, white light is a combination of red, \nblue, the recent Japanese breakthrough, and green or yellow. The recent \nJapanese breakthrough of that simple blue LED has now made it possible \nto produce white light from LED's ten times more efficient than a light \nbulb.\n  If it is successful, white light LED's will revolutionize lighting \ntechnology and will disrupt the existing industries. It's imperative \nthat we move quickly on these advances. We need a consortia between our \ngovernment, industry, research labs and academia to develop the \nnecessary pre-competitive research to maintain our leadership role in \nthis field.\n\n  I would like to mention one other technology that will change \nlighting. That technology is found in your cell phone and on your \ncomputer screen. It's called conductive polymers. Three Nobel Prizes \nwere just awarded for this technology. Conductive polymers offer the \npossibility of covering large surface areas and replacing fluorescent \nlamps. These materials will not only provide white light, but like your \ncomputer screen, display text or programmed color pictures. These \ntechnologies can be Internet controlled to adjust building lighting \nacross the country.\n  Given these advances, I would like to describe the Next Generation \nLighting Initiative Act. If enacted, it will move our country to \ncapture these revolutionary mergers between lighting and information. \nIt will supply the necessary pre-competitive R which no one industry \nalone can provide, and, which we as holders of the public trust of \nbasic research owe a duty to further. It will keep the United States in \na leadership role of commercial lighting while promoting energy \nefficiency that can either be ten times that of incandescent lights or \ntwice that of fluorescent lights. We need to enact this legislation \nnow.\n  The Next Generation Lighting Initiative authorizes the Department of \nEnergy to grant up to $480 million over ten years to a consortium of \nthe United States lighting industry and research institutions. The \ngoals of the Act are to have a 25 percent penetration of solid state \nlighting into the commercial markets by the year 2012. The Next \nGeneration's consortium, will perform the basic and manufacturing \nresearch. The lighting industry will take this R and develop the \nnecessary technologies to make it commercially viable.\n  This is precompetitive research. It is research that no one industry \nby itself can achieve and which we have a duty to promote together with \nindustry. It has implications for our country's energy policy far \nbroader than economic competitiveness. It is the reduction in energy \nconsumption that makes it a national initiative. Once the pre-\ncompetitive research is transitioned to industry then it should be \nterminated, we think that will take about 10 years.\n  If this initiative is successful, then by 2025, it can reduce our \nenergy consumption by roughly 17 billion watts of\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\npower or the need for 17 large electricity generating plants. That's as \nmuch as 17 million homes consume in a single day. That's more homes \nthan in California, Oregon, and Washington combined.\n  So let me conclude that the Next Generation Lighting Initiative will \ncarry the U.S. lighting industry into the twenty first century. It \ncapitalizes on technologies that have emerged only five years ago but \nhave the potential to quickly displace our lighting industry. This \nInitiative will reduce our nation's energy consumption and greenhouse \ngas emission. The research necessary to advance this technology \nrequires a national investment that must be in partnership with \nindustry.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review this bill, offer their comments, \nand, join Senator DeWine and me in its bipartisan support. I ask that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \npermit the substitution of an alternative close family sponsor in the \ncase of the death of the person petitioning for an alien's admission to \nthe United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of \nmyself and Mr. Hagel, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2001. This \nlegislation would address the situation of those whose U.S. sponsor \ndies while they have the chance to adjust status or receive an \nimmigrant visa.\n  Under current law, a family member who petitions for a relative to \nreceive an immigrant visa must sign a legally binding affidavit of \nsupport promising to provide for the support of the immigrant. This is \nthe last step before a green card is issued. If the family sponsor dies \nwhile the green card application is pending, the applicant is forced to \nfind a new sponsor and restart the application process, usually a 7- to \n8-year process, or face deportation.\n  The legislation I have introduced today would correct this anomaly in \nthe law by permitting another family member to stand in for the \ndeceased sponsor and sign the affidavit. Without this legislation, \nanother relative who qualifies as a family sponsor would have to file a \nnew immigrant visa petition on behalf of the relative and the relative \nwould have to go to the end of the line if the visa category is \nnumerically limited. Thus, the beneficiary would lose his priority date \nfor a visa based on the filing of the first petition, and in some \ncases, face deportation.\n  With the passage of this legislation, even though there may be a \ndifferent sponsor, the beneficiary would not lose his or her priority \ndate to be admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. Nor \nwill the beneficiary be subject to deportation even though they meet \nall the requirements for an immigrant visa.\n  A classic example of this situation was presented to my office just \nrecently. Earlier this year I introduced a private bill on behalf of \nZhenfu Ge, a 73-year-old Chinese grandmother whose daughter died before \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, was able to complete \nthe final stage of application process: her interview. As a result, her \nimmigration application is no longer valid and she is now subject to \ndeportation. The private bill I introduced would allow her to adjust \nher status, given that she has met all the requirements for a visa.\n  In previous years, I have introduced other private bills which \neventually became law. One bill was on behalf of Suchada Kwong, whose \nhusband was killed in a car accident just weeks before her final \ninterview with the INS. In 1997, I introduced a private bill on behalf \nof Jasmin Salehi, a Korean immigrant who became ineligible for \npermanent residency after her husband was murdered at a Denny's in \nReseda, California, where he worked as a manager.\n  In all of these cases, a family's grief was compounded by the \nprospect of the deportation of a family member, who had met all the \nrequirements for a green card. This legislation is an efficient way to \nalleviate the need for private legislation under these circumstances by \nmaking the law more just for those who have chosen to become immigrants \nin our country through the legal process.\n  We introduce the ``Family Immigration Act of 2001,'' in the hopes \nthat it will go further to alleviate some of hardships families face \nwhen confronted by the untimely death of a sponsor. Similar legislation \nhas gained bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to move it quickly through the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Sponsor Immigration \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUBSTITUTION OF ALTERNATIVE SPONSOR IF ORIGINAL \n                   SPONSOR HAS DIED.\n\n       (a) Permitting Substitution of Alternative Close Family \n     Sponsor in Case of Death of Petitioner.--\n       (1) Recognition of alternative sponsor.--Section 213A(f)(5) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1183a(f)(5)) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Non-petitioning cases.--Such term also includes an \n     individual who does not meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1)(D) but who--\n       ``(A) accepts joint and several liability with a \n     petitioning sponsor under paragraph (2) or relative of an \n     employment-based immigrant under paragraph (4) and who \n     demonstrates (as provided under paragraph (6)) the means to \n     maintain an annual income equal to at least 125 percent of \n     the Federal poverty line; or\n       ``(B) is a spouse, parent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, \n     sibling, child (if at least 18 years of age), son, daughter, \n     son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, \n     grandparent, or grandchild of a sponsored alien or a legal \n     guardian of a sponsored alien, meets the requirements of \n     paragraph (1) (other than subparagraph (D)), and executes an \n     affidavit of support with respect to such alien in a case in \n     which--\n       ``(i) the individual petitioning under section 204 for the \n     classification of such alien died after the approval of such \n     petition; and\n       ``(ii) the Attorney General has determined for humanitarian \n     reasons that revocation of such petition under section 205 \n     would be inappropriate.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment permitting substitution.--Section \n     212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C)(ii)) is \n     amended by striking ``(including any additional sponsor \n     required under section 213A(f))'' and inserting ``(and any \n     additional sponsor required under section 213A(f) or any \n     alternative sponsor permitted under paragraph (5)(B) of such \n     section)''.\n       (3) Additional conforming amendments.--Section 213A(f) of \n     such Act (8 U.S.C. 1183a(f)) is amended, in each of \n     paragraphs (2) and (4)(B)(ii), by striking ``(5).'' and \n     inserting ``(5)(A).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to deaths occurring before, on, or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, except that, in \n     the case of a death occurring before such date, such \n     amendments shall apply only if--\n       (1) the sponsored alien--\n       (A) requests the Attorney General to reinstate the \n     classification petition that was filed with respect to the \n     alien by the deceased and approved under section 204 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) before such \n     death; and\n       (B) demonstrates that he or she is able to satisfy the \n     requirement of section 212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of such Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(4)(C)(ii)) by reason of such amendments; and\n       (2) the Attorney General reinstates such petition after \n     making the determination described in section \n     213A(f)(5)(B)(ii) of such Act (as amended by such \n     subsection).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7518-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7518-S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 126--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                    OBSERVANCE OF THE OLYMPIC TRUCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Reid, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Sarbanes) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas in recent months the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China has arrested and detained several scholars \n     and intellectuals of Chinese ancestry with ties to the United \n     States, including at least 2 United States citizens and 3 \n     permanent residents of the United States;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's 2000 Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices in China, and international \n     human rights organizations, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China ``has continued to commit widespread and \n     well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms'';\n       Whereas the harassment, arbitrary arrest, detention, and \n     filing of criminal charges against scholars and intellectuals \n     has created a chilling effect on freedom of expression in the \n     People's Republic of China, in contravention of \n     internationally accepted norms, including the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the People's \n     Republic of China signed in October 1998;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     frequently uses torture and other human rights violations to \n     produce coerced ``confessions'' from detainees;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2000 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices in China has extensively documented \n     that human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China \n     ``included instances of extrajudicial killings, the use of \n     torture, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, \n     the mistreatment of prisoners, lengthy incommunicado \n     detention, and denial of due process'', and also found that \n     ``[p]olice and prosecutorial officials often ignore the due \n     process provisions of the law and of the Constitution . . . \n     [f]or example, police and prosecutors can subject prisoners \n     to severe psychological pressure to confess, and coerced \n     confessions frequently are introduced as evidence'';\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has reported that some of the scholar detainees have \n     ``confessed'' to their ``crimes'' of ``spying'', but it has \n     yet to produce any evidence of spying, and has refused to \n     permit the detainees to confer with their families or \n     lawyers;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2000 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices in China also found that ``police \n     continue to hold individuals without granting access to \n     family or a lawyer, and trials continue to be conducted in \n     secret'';\n       Whereas Dr. Li Shaomin is a United States citizen and \n     scholar who has been detained by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China for more than 100 days, was \n     formally charged with spying for Taiwan on May 15, 2001, and \n     is expected to go on trial on July 14, 2001;\n       Whereas Dr. Li Shaomin has been deprived of his basic human \n     rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, has not been \n     allowed to contact his wife and child (both United States \n     citizens), and was prevented from seeing his lawyer for an \n     unacceptably long period of time;\n       Whereas Dr. Gao Zhan is a permanent resident of the United

\n     intelligence agency'' on April 4, 2001;\n       Whereas Dr. Gao Zhan has been deprived of her basic human \n     rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, has not been \n     allowed to contact her husband and child (both United States \n     citizens) or Department of State consular personnel in China, \n     and was prevented from seeing her lawyer for an unacceptably \n     long period of

permanent resident of the \n     United States and researcher who has been detained by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on suspicions of \n     ``leaking state secrets'', has been deprived of his basic \n     human rights by arbitrary arrest and detention, has been \n     denied access to lawyers and family members, and has yet to \n     be formally charged with any crimes;\n       Whereas Teng Chunyan is a permanent resident of the United \n     States, Falun Gong practitioner, and researcher who has been \n     sentenced to three years in prison for spying by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China, apparently for \n     conducting research which documented violations of the human \n     rights of Falun Gong adherents in China, has been deprived of \n     her basic human rights by being placed on trial in secret, \n     and her appeal to the Beijing Higher People's Court was \n     denied on May 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Liu Yaping is a permanent resident of the United \n     States and a businessman who was arrested and detained in \n     Inner Mongolia in March 2001 by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, has been deprived of his basic \n     human rights by being denied any access to family members and \n     by being denied regular access to lawyers, is reported to be \n     suffering from severe health problems, was accused of tax \n     evasion and other economic crimes, and has been denied his \n     request for medical parole;\n       Whereas because there is documented evidence that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China uses torture to \n     coerce confessions from suspects, because the Government has \n     thus far presented no evidence to support its claims that the \n     detained scholars and intellectuals are spies, and because \n     spying is vaguely defined under Chinese law,\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n     there is reason to believe that the ``confessions'' of Dr. Li \n     Shaomin and Dr. Gao Zhan may have been coerced; and\n       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment of United States \n     citizens and residents by the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, and the continuing violations of their \n     fundamental human rights, demands an immediate and forceful \n     response by Congress and the President of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) condemns and deplores the continued detention of Li \n     Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, Teng Chunyan, \n     and other scholars detained on false charges by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China, and calls for \n     their immediate and unconditional release;\n       (B) condemns and deplores the lack of due process afforded \n     to these detainees, and the probable coercion of confessions \n     from some of them;\n       (C) condemns and deplores the ongoing and systematic \n     pattern of human rights violations by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, of which the unjust detentions of \n     Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng \n     Chunyan, are only important examples;\n       (D) strongly urges the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China to consider carefully the implications to the \n     broader United States-Chinese relationship of detaining and \n     coercing confessions from United States citizens and \n     permanent residents on unsubstantiated spying charges or \n     suspicions;\n       (E) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to consider releasing Liu Yaping on medical parole, as \n     provided for under Chinese law; and\n       (F) believes that human rights violations inflicted on \n     United States citizens and residents by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China will reduce opportunities for \n     United States-Chinese cooperation on a wide range of issues; \n     and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the President--\n       (A) should make the immediate release of Li Shaomin, Gao \n     Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng Chunyan a top \n     priority of United States foreign policy with the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China;\n       (B) should continue to make every effort to assist Li \n     Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, and Teng \n     Chunyan, and their families, while discussions of their \n     release are ongoing;\n       (C) should make it clear to the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China that the detention of United States \n     citizens and residents, and the infliction of human rights \n     violations upon United States citizens and residents, is not \n     in the interests of the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China because it will reduce opportunities for United \n     States-Chinese cooperation on other matters; and\n       (D) should immediately send a special, high ranking \n     representative to the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to reiterate the deep concern of the United States \n     regarding the continued imprisonment of Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan, \n     Wu Jianmin, Qin Guangguang, Teng Chunyan, and Liu Yaping, and \n     to discuss their legal status and immediate humanitarian \n     needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COASTAL IMPACT \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States continues to be reliant on fossil \n     fuels (including crude oil and natural gas) as a source of \n     most of the energy consumed in the country;\n       (2) this reliance is likely to continue for the foreseeable \n     future;\n       (3) about 65 percent of the energy needs of the United \n     States are supplied by oil and natural gas;\n       (4) the United States is becoming increasingly reliant on \n     clean-burning natural gas for electricity generation, home \n     heating and air conditioning, agricultural needs, and \n     essential chemical processes;\n       (5) a large portion of the remaining crude oil and natural \n     gas resources of the country are on Federal land located in \n     the western United States, in Alaska, and off the coastline \n     of the United States;\n       (6) the Gulf of Mexico has proven to be a significant \n     source of oil and natural gas and is predicted to remain a \n     significant source in the immediate future;\n       (7) many States and counties oppose the development of \n     Federal crude oil and natural gas resources within or near \n     the coastline, which opposition results in congressional, \n     Executive, State, or local policies to prevent the \n     development of those resources;\n       (8) actions that prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources do not lessen the energy \n     needs of the United States or of those States and counties \n     that object to exploration and development for fossil fuels;\n       (9) actions to prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources focus development \n     pressure on the remaining areas of Federal crude oil and \n     natural gas resources, such as onshore and offshore Alaska, \n     certain onshore areas in the western United States, and the \n     central Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Alabama, Alaska, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (10) the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources is accompanied by adverse effects on the \n     infrastructure services, public services, and the environment \n     of States, counties, and local communities that host the \n     development of those Federal resources;\n       (11) States, counties, and local communities do not have \n     the power to tax adequately the development of Federal crude \n     oil and natural gas resources, particularly when those \n     development activities occur off the coastline of States that \n     serve as platforms for that development, such as Alabama, \n     Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (12) the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located onshore, provides, outside the budget and \n     appropriations processes of the Federal Government, payments \n     to States in which Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources are located in the amount of 50 percent of the \n     direct revenues received from the Federal Government for \n     those resources; and\n       (13) there is no permanent provision in the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located offshore, that authorizes the sharing of a \n     portion of the annual revenues generated from Federal \n     offshore crude oil and natural gas resources with adjacent \n     coastal States that--\n       (A) serve as the platform for that development; and\n       (B) suffer adverse effects on the environment and \n     infrastructure of the States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should provide a significant portion of the Federal \n     offshore mineral revenues to coastal States that permit the \n     development of Federal mineral resources off the coastline, \n     including the States of Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Texas.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 909.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate Chamber this evening \nto join my colleague, Senator Maria Cantwell, in acknowledging four \nyoung Americans who lost their lives in service to our country last \nevening.\n  Like many Americans, this morning I awoke to the very tragic news \nthat four firefighters had died while battling a wildfire near \nWinthrop, WA.\n  Today I want my colleagues and the American people to know the names \nof those four brave firefighters: Tom Craven, 30 years old, of \nEllensburg, WA; Karen Fitzpatrick, 18 years old of Yakima, WA; Devin \nWeaver, 21, of Yakima; and Jessica Johnson, 19, also from Yakima.\n\n  These were young people.\n  These were people who put themselves in harms way to keep the rest of \nus safe.\n  Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those four \ncourageous firefighters.\n  It's hard to imagine the dangers that firefighters face every day. \nBut they choose to fight fires to help protect the rest of us--our \nfamilies and our communities.\n  When something like this happens, it makes all of us stop and think \nabout what they've sacrificed for our safety.\n  My brother is a firefighter. For years, he fought fires. My family \nand I understand the risks.\n  I know how those families feel every day when they send their loved \nones off to work.\n  They are proud of them.\n  They know they are doing something important for their neighbors and \ntheir community.\n  And they are always hoping they will get back home safely at the end \nof the day.\n  This tragedy reminds us all of the dangers that firefighters face \nevery day.\n  To the families of those four brave young people, please know that we \nare a grateful nation, and you are all in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I also want to wish a speedy recovery for the other firefighters who \nwere injured while battling the wildfire.\n  I want to thank the firefighters in Washington State--and across the \ncountry--for the work they do to protect us.\n  We own them a debt of gratitude.\n  Today, we owe four families our condolences and our thanks for their \nsacrifice. I yield to Senator Cantwell from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I come to \nthe floor today after learning of the tragic deaths of four \nfirefighters in the Wenatchee National Forest in Washington state. \nThese courageous firefighters died yesterday battling a wildfire in \nOkanogan County. A tragedy of this magnitude is felt throughout \nWashington state, but should also be recognized and mourned by a \ngrateful nation.\n  This is the nation's deadliest wildfire since 1994. On behalf of the \ncitizens of Washington State, I extend my deepest sympathies to the \nfamilies of the four brave men and women who gave their lives to \nprotect their neighbors. Squad Leader Tom Craven of Ellensburg, Devin \nWeaver of Yakima, Jessica Johnson of Yakima, and Karen Fitzpatrick of \nYakima gave their lives to keep us safe. This tragedy is compounded \nbecause these firefighters were so young--the youngest being just 18 \nyears old.\n  We join their families and friends in mourning their loss.\n  As Senator Murray pointed out, this tragedy reminds us that we often \ntake for granted the men and women who routinely put their lives on the \nline to protect us. Every state in the nation has experienced the loss \nof people involved in fighting fires.\n  I hope the families and friends of these brave firefighters know that \nthe courage and sacrifice of their loved ones will not be forgotten and \nthat our sympathies reach out to their families.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work of those firefighters who are \nstill fighting; to those who are injured, I also wish them a speedy \nrecovery. The firefighters of the U.S. Forest Service come from all \nover the country. They have been battling fires for years. This year \nalone, 300 firefighting personnel are available on the Okanogan and \nWenatchee National Forests. These firefighters work year after year in \nservice to their country with little recognition.\n  On behalf of the residents of Washington State and the Nation, I \nthank\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\nthem for their hard work and their dedication under very trying \ncircumstances. We all remember the sacrifice that each and every one of \nyou have made.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss with my colleagues the \nissue of the Federal Bureau of Investigation oversight, and how we can \nhelp the Bureau regain the trust and confidence of the American people.\n  First, I find it very pleasant today to commend Attorney General \nAshcroft for something he did. He announced today action to enlarge the \njurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General of the Justice \nDepartment so that that Office of Inspector General would be able to \nwork with the FBI and the DEA on its own initiative, without jumping \nthrough a lot of hoops which were some hoops that were put in place in \nthe previous administration, which, in a sense, put the FBI and the DEA \nout of bounds from things that you would expect an inspector general of \na department to be looking into.\n  So, effective immediately, then, the inspector general will have \nprimary jurisdiction over allegations of misconduct against employees \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency. \nThis is an important and encouraging step towards overall FBI reform, \none which I hope will help to solve the problems that the FBI has with \ntheir management culture.\n  Previous to this, the inspector general could not initiate an \ninvestigation within the FBI, or the Drug Enforcement Agency, without \nthe express permission from the Deputy Attorney General. Contrariwise, \nin most other Departments, the inspector general can do any \ninvestigation they want to, unimpeded in any way. It is very important \nfor the inspector general to have that freedom to function. They are \nnot only an agent for the Cabinet Department head, but they are also an \nagent of the Congress because they can report directly to the Congress. \nIt is essential to have that type of oversight, that type of policing \nto ferret out wrongdoing.\n  I have been saying for many years that the FBI should not be allowed \nto police itself, and I am encouraged by this new step taken today \ntowards the establishment of a free and independent oversight entity \nwhich now, truly, the Department of Justice inspector general will be.\n  I am also pleased to see as part of this order that the Attorney \nGeneral has enhanced whistleblower protection for FBI employees who \ncome forward with protected disclosures. As an author of legislation \nthat is on the books now for whistleblower protection, the last time we \nenhanced the protection for whistleblowers there was just enough \nsympathy--and unjustified sympathy--within this body for the FBI that \nsomehow the FBI could have a separate set of regulations just for \nwhistleblowers within the FBI. As a result, whistleblowers within the \nFBI have not had the same amount of protection that whistleblowers in \nany other agency of the Federal Government might have. So this will \nalso help in that direction. I thank the Attorney General for that.\n  Today, then, following up on this action of the Attorney General, I \nhave forwarded a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft, commending him on \nthese steps, and also request that his office provide me with \nadditional details regarding how the various investigative and audit \nentities within the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the DEA are to \nbe administered and organized.\n  Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with FBI Director \nnominee Robert Mueller. I discussed with Robert Mueller several \nconcerns that I have with how the Bureau has been managed over the past \nseveral years. I also discussed with Mr. Mueller my views on the type \nof leadership that I think the FBI needs.\n  We have a once-every-10-year opportunity to find someone who can fix \nthe problems inherent in the management culture at the Bureau because \nthat appointment comes up for a 10-year length of time. I want to make \nsure, during this once-in-a-10-year opportunity, Mr. Mueller \nunderstands my concerns.\n  Part of our discussion concerned the need for strengthening FBI \noversight, both on the part of the executive branch, along the lines of \nwhat I have been saying about the inspector general, but also from the \nCongress--oversight, constitutional oversight over the executive branch \nagencies.\n  Without asking Mr. Mueller to comment on pending legislation, I \nmentioned to Mr. Mueller I am working on a bill to permanently extend \nby statute the jurisdiction that was given today by the Attorney \nGeneral to the Department of Justice inspector general, so that some \nfuture Attorney General cannot put impediments in the way of the \ninspector general investigating things within the FBI. I encourage Mr. \nMueller, should he be confirmed, to make it a priority to ensure that \nhe and the FBI will cooperate fully with whatever oversight entity is \nin place.\n  I also discussed with Mr. Mueller the need for increased \nwhistleblower protection for FBI employees. Over the years the FBI has \nbeen notorious for retaliating against those who would expose the types \nof waste, fraud, and abuse in cases that have now become synonymous \nwith a culture of arrogance within the FBI. These are cases such as \nRuby Ridge, Waco, the TWA-800 investigation, the FBI crime lab \ninvestigation, Richard Jewell, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen, and most \nrecently the Oklahoma bombing investigation in the McVeigh case.\n  I will be introducing legislation that will provide statutory \nprotection for FBI whistleblowers to overcome the shortcomings of the \nlegislation that was signed by President Bush in 1989. Those exemptions \nthat were made from the FBI need to be taken out so the whistleblowers \nin the FBI have the same protection as whistleblowers in any other \nagency of Government. I hope the new Director will not only support \nthis important reform but will work to ensure these important reforms \nare communicated clearly throughout the entire Bureau.\n  I believe that in order to regain the trust and confidence of the \nAmerican people, the FBI must be open and fully responsive to differing \npoints of view within its own ranks. More importantly, employees must \nbe able to present these opinions in an atmosphere that is free of \nretaliation that happens so often against people whom we call \nwhistleblowers.\n  Basically, within any organization there is a great deal of peer \npressure to go along to get along. But that peer pressure also has the \ncapability of covering up wrongdoing and bad administration. That is \nwhy the process of people telling the truth and coming out in the open \nis so important.\n  Without this freedom, the FBI will only continue to suppress and \nmarginalize those who speak out, and things will go on as they have for \nso long. That is not good. That is what has brought about a culture of \narrogance--of believing within the FBI that the FBI can do no wrong.\n  Perhaps the greatest example of this type of retaliation against a \nwhistleblower occurred in an investigation I made involving a \nwhistleblower by the name of Dr. Fred Whitehurst. You may remember that \nwhen Dr. Whitehurst came forward with proof of abusive practices at the \nFBI crime lab, he was shamelessly discredited by senior FBI officials. \nAn inspector general investigation--after going through all of those \nhoops I talked about--later supported the assertions made by Dr. \nWhitehurst. In an effort to get back his good name, Dr. Whitehurst won \na settlement that ended up costing the American taxpayers $1 million.\n  There is something wrong when a whistleblower comes forward and he is \nnot listened to, and he has to sue, and it costs the taxpayers $1 \nmillion to settle. He should have been listened to in the first \ninstance.\n  We want to encourage an environment within all government agencies,\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nbut particularly the FBI, that wrongdoing is not covered up; that \npeople who whistleblow aren't treated like a skunk at a picnic on a \nSunday afternoon, that they are held up as somebody who ought to be \nhonored rather than somebody who ought to be suppressed.\n  I want to make sure to mention that the comments I make about the FBI \ntoday, though, should in no way minimize the great sacrifices made \nevery day by hard-working FBI agents and support personnel. These men \nand women serve their nation proudly. They deserve an organization that \nhas integrity and credibility.\n  The FBI management system is broken. This does a real disservice to \nthe hard-working agents on the street. When the FBI does what they are \nset up to do--to seek the truth and let the truth convict--they do \ntheir job right. But when there is an effort to cover up something that \nhas gone wrong and people are more concerned about the headlines and \nthe public relations of the organization as opposed to the fundamentals \nof law enforcement--that is, these cases and a lot of others I have \nalready listed--that is when their agency gets in trouble and loses \ncredit.\n  In regard to these agents who do their work and do it right and \nbecause of this management culture that must be changed by the new \nDirector, I have asked the Attorney General to provide me with \ninformation regarding the extent to which the new FBI Director will be \nable to institute the departmentwide reforms and to make staffing \nchanges, including changes at the senior staff and management level.\n  I believe that a new FBI Director will only have a certain period of \ntime--maybe a couple of months--in which he can make real change. In \norder for the new Director to take advantage of that time, he must be \nafforded maximum flexibility for staffing and policy setting.\n\n  I also agree that we have not done enough in Congress. I am not \nputting the blame just on the Department of Justice and the FBI. We \nhave a constitutional responsibility of oversight. We spend all of our \ntime legislating, giving speeches, passing laws, voting, and offering \namendments. That is what most people think being a Congressman is all \nabout. But also, once laws are passed, the checks and balances of our \nConstitution require that we do our constitutional job of oversight; \nthat is, to see that the laws are faithfully executed and that money \nspent appropriated by Congress is spent within the intent of Congress \nand that the law is enforced within the intent of Congress.\n  Congress does not do a good enough job. For too long we have seen \nmishap after mishap occur, with the end result being more money and \nmore jurisdiction for the FBI. The Director of the FBI comes up to \nCapitol Hill, everybody sees the Director of FBI, and they just melt. \nThe Director of the FBI says a couple of mea culpas and walks out of \nhere with a nice pat on the back, and probably a bigger appropriation.\n  That is not oversight. That is just business as usual. One way this \ncan be improved is through the creation of a subcommittee within the \nCommittee on the Judiciary that would be directly responsible for FBI \noversight.\n  We need to help the FBI change the kind of culture that places image \nand publicity before basics and fundamentals. We need to help the FBI \nchange the kind of culture that holds press conferences in high-profile \ncases before the investigation is complete and all the facts are in, \nand when all the facts are in, then the FBI has egg on its face.\n  Yes, the American people deserve the kind of agency that won't make \nthe kind of mistakes the FBI has made in the Wen Ho Lee and the \nAtlantic Olympic bombing case, and the Waco case and the Ruby Ridge \ncase. But, more importantly, the American people deserve an agency that \nis honest and forthright about their errors; in other words, very \ntransparent.\n  As one of our Supreme Court Justices said 80 or 100 years ago, the \nbest disinfectant is sunshine. Let the Sun shine in and there won't be \nmold. That is transparency. That is the way the American Government \nought to operate.\n  I look forward to getting down to the business of helping the FBI and \nits next Director regain the trust and confidence of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Presiding Officer for waiting for me \nto speak tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/11/senate-section/article/S7537-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
