Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        College Education Costs\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last year, the Senate made significant \nstrides in easing the burdens of American families facing the mounting \ncosts of a college education. In an initiative that I have sponsored, \nand in which I take enormous pride--the tax reduction legislation of \nlast year--there is a provision allowing partial tuition, for the first \ntime in American history, to become tax deductible.\n  Another measure that I successfully authored raised a cap on interest \non student loans so that they could become deductible. In many ways, \nfor middle-income families--indeed, for all American families--this was \nenormously helpful in easing the burden of an expensive college \neducation.\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n  You can imagine how distressed I was to discover in recent days that \nthe administration has a new initiative that would now increase the \nburden of financing a college education--just as we were making all of \nthis progress. The proposal, of course, is to prohibit the \nconsolidation of student loans at low, fixed interest rates. This will \ncompound the problems of millions of American families who rely upon \nstudent loans to finance a college education.\n  Under their current program, a family can take their various student \nloans, consolidate them in a single loan, and fix them at a determined \ninterest rate, which is predictable and will not alter for the life of \nthe loan. The savings, obviously, will allow students to consider going \nbeyond college to graduate education. It allows young people who have \nthese debts to begin families, buy homes, and start their lives.\n  Under the alternative proposal by the administration, students \ngraduating from college will have variable interest loans. That would \nmake it impossible to plan young lives. The debts begin at high \ninterest rates and they are then subject to the market.\n  Young families having children, buying homes, in 5 years could find \ninterest rates at significantly higher levels. They can go from college \nto graduate school and in the middle of graduate school discover their \ninterest rates are going up and they cannot remain in school. This will \naffect an incredible 700,000 students per year who will have their \nfinances radically changed by this inability to consolidate loans.\n  The administration argues that most of this consolidation is being \ndone by medical students or law students who are going to have very \nhigh incomes so they can face this burden.\n  First, that is inaccurate. The average consolidated loan is $15,000. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of students with these loans. Most of \nthem are college students. They are getting bachelor's degrees. They \nmay be going into teaching or social work or business; they may be \nyoung entrepreneurs; they could be of any walk of life; but they are at \na stage of life when they cannot afford what amounts to a tax.\n  Make no mistake, this is a tax proposed by the Bush administration on \nmiddle-income families and college students. There is scarcely a \nsegment of American society that can less afford a tax increase. This \nSenate recognized that fact last year. That is why my amendments to \nmake college tuition tax deductible and to raise the cap on the \ndeduction of student loans were accepted. We wanted to reduce the costs \nof college education, not increase them.\n  Even if the administration were right and many of these loans were \ngoing for medical students or law students or business students, does \nthat make it the right priority for the country? Do we really want to \nmake it even more expensive for people to go into medicine when doctors \nare already leaving the profession? Do we really want to make it harder \nfor people to go to graduate school when we need engineers and \nbusinesspeople with real talents? This cannot be the right priority for \nthe country.\n  I hope the administration will reconsider this proposal. The \nadministration needs revenue. This cannot be the right way to approach \nit. Strangely, in this same Congress, while raising taxes on middle-\nincome families and college students, the administration is proposing \nto revisit the estate tax, which we have already lowered, and increase \nthe threshold so that only less than half of a percentage point of \nAmericans are even subjected to the tax. And the rates on those people \nhave been lowered. We are going to revisit that tax while taxing \ncollege students and middle-income families.\n  I cannot be the only person in this institution who thinks this does \nnot make any sense for the country or the Congress. I hope we do not \nhave a confrontation with the Bush administration on this point. I hope \nthey reconsider it. I hope they withdraw it. It is just the wrong thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and the time be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business and that the time I use come off the \npostcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Spending Valuable Time With Constituents\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, I have been a little \ndisturbed recently--I am not mad at anybody--about all of this \ndiscussion about what we are doing here and why it is necessary to be \nhere on Mondays and on Fridays when on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and \nThursdays we are spending most of our time in quorum calls.\n  I think there is this Washington, DC, mentality that floats around \nthat somehow if we are not here in Washington, DC, we, as Senators, are \nnot doing our work.\n  Let me tell you, for those of us who go back to the district and are \nwith our people--in my case, the people of Oklahoma, who make much more \nsense than anybody makes around this place--that time is more valuable, \nand it is harder. Our hours are longer. We work long hours when we are \nback there. Yet we see the bed check votes such as the one that brought \nus back last night. We come back, and we vote on something we could \nhave been voting on anytime--on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n  Then you see the press corps around Washington. They all think \neverything that is worthwhile is happening in Washington. You read the \nHill and you read Roll Call and they say it is perfectly reasonable for \nthe majority leader to say everyone ought to be in Washington all the \ntime.\n  I can tell you one of the problems we have is people who are in \nWashington all the time lose sight of who real people are. It is so \nhard to explain to people around here, but people in my State of \nOklahoma understand it very well. There aren't any real, normal people \nin Washington. Everyone is either a Member or they are a staffer or \nthey are a lobbyist or somebody else. To be able to get what is needed \nfor America, you need to get back into real America. Oklahoma is real \nAmerica. I can cite some examples.\n  I will be talking to the Duma this afternoon, the Russian Duma, about \nour new relationship with Russia. When I go back to Oklahoma, they will \nsay: Wait a minute; why do we still have an ABM Treaty that was set up \nin 1972?\n  Fortunately, we are going to get rid of that thing. But why did it \ntake this long? It took this long because people around this town don't \nunderstand pure logic. The logic is that at one time there were two \nsuperpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States. And I have to admit, \nas a Republican, this was done in a Republican administration. Henry \nKissinger, back in the Nixon administration, put together something \nthat said: I will make you a deal, U.S.S.R. We won't defend ourselves \nagainst you, if you don't defend yourselves against us. And if you \nshoot us, we will shoot you, and everybody dies and everybody is happy. \nIt is called mutual assured destruction.\n  That might have made sense to some people back in 1972. It didn't to \nme, but it might have to some other people. Now we have a totally \ndifferent world out there in Russia, which is a friend and ally of \nours; yet we do have Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, other countries \nharboring terrorists, developing weapons that will reach the United \nStates, missiles that will reach us. Already China, North Korea, and \nRussia have such missiles. So how does it make sense in today's world \nthat we don't defend ourselves?\n  I don't get the answers, but I get the questions when I go back to \nOklahoma. Then I have to try to explain to them. I was criticized the \nother day by some of my conservative friends as to why I voted on some \nof the amendments in the farm bill. I voted on those because I went \nback. I have town meetings, as I am sure the Chair is aware. I get \naround and have as many as five, six in a day.\n  Oklahoma, particularly in the western part of the State, is \nagricultural.\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nIn Oklahoma, our farmers have three sources of income: Grain, \nlivestock, and oil. They have this so-called marginal production. For a \nsustained period of time, all three of these were down, and they were \nreally hurting. I sat down in places such as Shattuck, OK, and Gage, \nOK. I had farmers coming in and saying: For the first time in five \ngenerations, we will have to sell our farm. We can no longer stay in \nbusiness.\n\n  For that reason, I realized that we have to do something that is \ndifferent than what we have done before in transitioning into a new \nfarm policy. So we did. And some of the amendments I voted for were \npretty expensive. Nonetheless, that came from going back to the State, \nbeing there and listening to them instead of staying around Washington \non the weekends.\n  On energy and ANWR, I can't believe we took all the time we did in \ntrying to open ANWR for exploration. Here we are in a threatened \nposition. Everyone is aware of it. After September 11, all of a sudden \nwe find ourselves dependent upon other countries for 57 percent of our \nenergy. We don't even pass something that will allow us to open up the \nAlaska Wildlife Refuge for exploration. I have yet to find one person \nto go up there to the ANWR on the North Slope of Alaska and come back \nhere shaking their head, wondering why in the world we call that a \npristine wilderness. It is nothing but a mud flat. It is a tiny area up \nthere that would give us a great capacity of domestic crude.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, if we had all of our marginal wells--a \nmarginal well is one that produces 15 barrels or less a day--if we had \nthem all opened, if we had those wells flowing that we have had closed \nover the last 10 years, that would have produced the same amount of oil \nas we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.\n  When you go back, you talk to real people. Last week, when we were \nhaving a town meeting, they were talking about this community planning \nbill that was going to come out, and now it has come out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It will be considered on this \nfloor. Do you know what that is all about? What that is about is a \nrecognition that no good decisions are made unless they are made in \nWashington, DC.\n  Many years ago when I was mayor of Tulsa, there was a guy named Dr. \nRobert Fryley. He had gone into San Diego. Pete Wilson was mayor at \nthat time. I was mayor of Tulsa. He had drawn these concentric circles \nthat said: This is the way you should plan your community.\n  He came to Tulsa in the first 2 or 3 weeks that I was in office. He \nstarted talking about Tulsa. I said: Wait a minute. This property is \nowned by people. These people bought this property. You are going to \nchange the value of the property to these people.\n  They said: That is of no concern to us.\n  That is what we now will be considering on the floor of the Senate--a \nbill that is going to allow us in Washington to decide what we in \nTulsa, OK, do with our property.\n  I see others seeking the floor. I was killing a little time.\n  The other day I was at Eisenhower School. It is a school that has \ndone some great things in the public school system that others are \nemulating. I received some letters. I will just read a couple. This one \nsays:\n\n       Thank you for my class. Your speech about rights and \n     responsibilities was great and interesting. I really enjoyed \n     you coming. It was fun. I learned a lot. Sincerely, Maggie.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Thank you so much for your presentation today.

The things that you told us was so \n     interesting. I learned a lot about the pilgrims. How they \n     fought for our freedom.

Thank you for telling us about the Constitution. Thank \n     you for coming again. Thank you for telling us how you work. \n     Now we know it's a big job.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              John Philips Hughes.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wanted to stand in the Chamber and say if we ran this \nplace the way it should be run, we could very easily handle all of the \nvotes we need to handle on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and allow \nthose of us who care about going back to our States, spending time with \nour people and sharing the wisdom we get from the States, as opposed to \nfrom Washington, I think we would be a lot better off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the Senator from South Carolina is \ngoing to speak for 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I follow \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, with respect to the Andean trade \ncompact and its re-enactment, and particularly with respect to the \nintent to put fast track on the particular Andean trade agreement, the \ncontention is that without this fast track, we are missing out on all \nof these wonderful deals.\n  I wish I had time to give the litany of the wonderful deals on how \nthe United States of America--from the Tokyo Round, Uruguay Round, \nright on down to the present scheduled rounds with the WTO and \notherwise--has been going out of business. Literally, intentionally, we \nare going out of business, I would say. What we were trying to do was \nwin the cold war. We wanted to defeat communism with capitalism. We \nsent over the Marshall Plan, with technology and expertise, and it \nworked. Everyone is happy with that.\n  Now, after 50 years, hometowns have been totally depleted of any \nindustrial manufacturing.\n  Let me get right to the point and bring out the actual facts, using \nnot just the record made here by the U.S. Trade Representative, but by \nthe morning news. Let's look and find out what we are talking about \nwith respect to trade agreements that we have been missing.\n  Well, if you look at the recent edition of the 2001 Trade Policy \nAgenda of the President of the United States on the trade agreements \nprogram, you will find in the glossary in the back that there are some \n200 trade agreements made without fast track.\n  Do I need to remind the Senate that we just voted on--without fast \ntrack--a free trade agreement with Vietnam? Do I need to remind the \nbody that we just voted on a free trade agreement with Jordan? I \nsupported both of those. Do I need to remind them that we passed the \nSub-Saharan Africa trade agreement, the Caribbean Basin Initiative \nAgreement, and the 1997 WTO telecommunications agreement? You can go \ndown the list--and they are all listed in here.\n  We have made some 200 agreements in the last 10 years--all without \nfast track. We didn't give total fast track authority to President \nClinton because we wanted to deliberate and make sure the economy of \nthe United States was protected. And it has been working. But look not \nonly at the red book here, but with respect to the national news, in \nthe Washington Post, it said this last Thursday:\n\n       United States signs trade agreement with eight African \n     nations.\n\n  There are eight more trade agreements. We aren't missing out on all \nthese so-called trade agreements. I wish the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee could read the morning paper. He could find out that we did \nit without fast track. According to the financial news--let me read \nthis to you. This is in the morning Financial Times:\n\n       John O'Leary, former U.S. Ambassador to Chile and \n     campaigner on a bilateral accord, said yesterday he expected \n     a deal to be signed this year whether or not Mr. Bush won \n     trade negotiating authority.\n\n  . . . ``It's not a matter of consequence who is first past the \nfinishing line,'' he said. ``But the deal with the EU is helpful for \nChile because it gives fresh momentum to their negotiations with the \nUnited States.''\n\n  We read it. If they brought a Chilean trade agreement--I would have \nto look at it obviously, but why would I vote for it? They have \nrelatively the same standard of living. They have a respected \njudiciary, they have property rights, they have labor rights, and they \nare strong on the environment. I voted for NAFTA with Canada because we \nhave relatively the same standard of living. But this total farce that \nwe are missing out on agreements all over the countryside is just \nwrong, wrong, wrong.\n  The problem is the loss of jobs. You only have to go to the morning's \npaper. I hope the chairman, who just left the floor, will listen to \nthis one. Of course, right now the best bet for the next few quarters \nis probably a jobless recovery in which the gross domestic product \nrises but unemployment stays high. After all, the economy needs to grow \nat about 3.5 percent just to prevent the unemployment rate from rising, \nand the odds are at least even that the growth will fall short of that \nmark. The funny thing is that a slow jobless and profitless recovery is \nexactly what level-headed people, such as economists at the Federal \nReserve, have been predicting for a long time. So how did a far more \nbullish view become not just prevalent but more or less mandatory on \nWall Street? How, with the business landscape still strewn with the \nrubble from the bubble, did that manic optimism so quickly become \npopular again? It seems that hype springs eternal.\n\n  That is the morning news, and that is why the Senator from South \nCarolina only asks for just a closer look.\n  Let me fulfill my obligation under the Constitution. Article I, \nsection 8, says that--not the President of the United States, not the \nSupreme Court--but this branch of Government, the Congress of the \nUnited States, shall regulate foreign commerce. Now, these pollster \npoliticians who come to Washington and crowd around take the easy \ncourse. They say: Free trade, free trade, fast track, fast track--and \nthey don't have to take any responsibility. So when you lose all the \njobs in St. Louis and in Charleston, SC, and you look around, you have \nto sort of take it or leave it. I didn't want to be against free trade, \nand that is what I had to vote for.\n  Madam President, it is just terrible when you read in that same New \nYork Times this morning:\n\n       Auto Parts Makers Grinding to a Halt\n\n  I have another article on a poster board, and I will get into the \nboard debate when some of the others come with their particular boards. \nBut the automobile industry is moving out of the United States. We have \nforeign locations here. Mercedes is in Alabama, BMW is in South \nCarolina, and some others are trying to get into the market.\n  As far as the American manufacturer making that profit is concerned \nand as far as the American manufacturer keeping on the cutting edge of \ntechnology--why did they move to China? General Motors was told by the \nChinese they didn't know how to trade. They don't run around saying, be \nfair, be fair, level the playing field, be fair. That is outrageous \nchild's talk. That doesn't happen in commerce. You trade for the \nbenefit and economic strength and the profit of your company. So the \nChinese told General Motors: Not only do you manufacture that GM \nautomobile over here, but the most modern automobile design plant in \nthe world is\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nin China. And that is as a result of that particular trade agreement \nthat, of course, General Motors made with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  The auto parts suppliers are grinding to a halt. They are moving \nthose now. They used to send those down to Mexico, and we would get the \nfinished product--the automobile--back. But you have here a quote from \nPaul Craig Roberts. Paul Craig Roberts served in the Reagan \nadministration. This was an article in the Washington Times just the \nother day:\n\n       The result is a decline in higher paying jobs in the United \n     States as companies move higher value-added operations abroad \n     to take advantage of cheaper labor.\n\n  A recent Cornell University study:\n\n       ``The Impact of U.S.-China Trade Relations on Workers, \n     Wages and Employment,'' concludes that U.S. companies shift \n     their production to China in order to produce for the U.S. \n     market with cheap Chinese labor. The study estimates that a \n     minimum of 760,000 U.S. jobs have been lost to China since \n     1992.\n       ``An increasing percentage of the jobs leaving the U.S. are \n     in higher-paying industries producing goods such as bicycles, \n     furniture, motors, compressors, generators, fiber optics, \n     clocks, injection molding and computer components.'' The \n     shift in production is so extensive that the U.S. has run a \n     trade deficit with China in advanced technology goods since \n     1995.\n\n  That is the old wag I was given when as Governor of South Carolina I \ntestified 42 years ago before the old International Tariff Commission. \nWe were about to lose so much of our textile industry that 10 percent \nof the consumption of clothing textiles in the United States would be \nrepresented in imports. In looking around the Chamber right this \nminute, two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported, 86 \npercent of the shoes.\n  Then Tom Dewey, who represented the Japanese at the hearing and ran \nme around the hearing room, he said: ``But, Governor, let them make the \nshoes and the clothing. We will make the airplanes and the computers.''\n  Fast forward to the reality of today. They make the shoes, they make \nthe clothing, they make the airplanes, they make the computers. We have \na deficit in the balance of trade in computers and semiconductors.\n  High-tech, globalization, you have to understand it. Come on. Do not \ntell this Senator what globalization is. I do not want to sound like \nVice President Gore, that I invented it, but I did travel 40 years ago \nto South America and Europe as a Governor, soliciting their investment. \nI was looking for jobs. I have been in this game for over 40-some \nyears. Today, we have 117 German plants in little South Carolina.\n  I will never forget calling on Michelin in June of 1960, down in \nParis, France, and I have now four beautiful plants of the French \ncompany. I also have the North American wonderful plant of Bowater. I \nsee that rather than me trying to move corporations from overseas to \nthe United States, which I am still trying to do--or more particularly \ncarpetbagging New York in the Northeast--they are overjumping me into \nMexico, into China, into Malaysia, into India.\n  Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, and all the rest of these big-name \ncompanies, the high-tech companies, are not saving us. We have to \nretrain.\n  I have another page of the Washington Post, ``Dupont Plans to Cut \n2,000 Jobs.'' Some of them, of course, are in South Carolina. \nEverywhere we turn, we hear about cutting jobs, and it is not textiles \nor low wage jobs. It is high-tech jobs.\n  I hope the Finance Committee will give me a hearing sometime. I would \nbe delighted to educate that crowd because this is a fix. They have a \nbunch of oil people and a bunch of farmers and they could care less, as \nlong as they get their depletion allowance and their subsidies, and \nthen they come around hollering, ``Protectionism, protectionism.''\n  Well, that is the fundamental of government. We have the Army to \nprotect us from the enemies without, and the FBI to protect us from \nenemies within. We have laws to protect clean air, clean water, the \nenvironment. We have Medicare to protect us from ill health. We have \nantitrust laws to protect us from monopolization and predatory \npractices. We have safety laws to protect us, safe machinery, safe \nworking places and everything else.\n\n  I was in the Rotunda on a cold January day when President Reagan was \nsworn in for his second term. He raised his hand to preserve, protect, \nand defend, and everybody clapped. We were all overjoyed, and then we \ncame down into the Senate Chamber and had to listen to a bunch of \nchildren running around hollering, ``Protectionism.'' That is the \nfunction of government, and the security of this Nation.\n  It is like a three-legged stool. There is the one leg of the values \nas a nation, unquestioned. We are admired the world around for \nAmerica's stand for individual rights, freedom, and democracy.\n  The second leg is the military. We are the superpower, unquestioned.\n  The third leg, economics, that is my point. It has been fractured, \nfractured intentionally, with this so-called free trade. We knew we had \nto sort of spread the wealth, spread the capitalism in order to defeat \ncommunism. It has worked, now to a counterproductive point. We will not \nbe in a position to produce foreign aid, we will not be able to defend \nfreedom the world around unless we have a strong economy.\n  I will never forget Akio Morita of Sony. We were in Chicago. We had a \nseminar, and he was talking about Third World nations. He turned and he \nsaid: In the Third World, the emerging nations, they have to develop a \nstrong manufacturing capacity in order to become a nation state. Then \ntalking along, he pointed over, and he said: Senator, that world power \nthat loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.\n  And we wonder why we do not have the influence?\n  They try to transfer it to hate. It is not hate. I have traveled. We \nhave all traveled around. They admire and they like Americans in the \nArab countries and everywhere else. You can go into downtown Baghdad, \nyou can go into downtown Tehran in Iran right now, and they will come \nup to you and talk to you and say glad to see you. Do not give me all \nthat hate stuff.\n  What is happening is we are losing our economic clout and our \neconomic strength because we are exporting the jobs faster than we can \ncreate them.\n  In the Los Angeles Times, April 2, ``High-Paid Jobs Latest U.S. \nExport,'' the No. 1 story on the front page of the Los Angeles Times.\n  I do not believe they read over in the Finance Committee. They give \nyou all of this: We are missing out on agreements; we have to retrain.\n  They sound like Mao Tse Tung: You have to go out and re-educate.\n  Let us try it on for size. I had a plant close not long ago, Oneida. \nThey made T-shirts. At the time of their closing, they had more than \n400 employees. The average age was 47 years old, and tomorrow morning \nwe have done it Washington's way. We have retrained. We have more than \n400 people who are now skilled computer operators. Is a company going \nto hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer \noperator? You are not taking on the health costs for the 47-year-old \nand above. You are not taking on those retirement costs. You are going \nfor the youngster who is just as expert. There you go, like we do not \nunderstand what is going on.\n  ``Levi Strauss Closing Most U.S. Plants,'' another article, again in \nApril. Every time I look around, they are closing, and what we have, so \nit is understood, is we have an affirmative action plan to get rid of \nthe jobs. Mind you me, that is what I say, an affirmative action plan \nto get rid of the jobs.\n  Why? Well, let me refer to this article from Business Week. Business \nWeek, in 1999, reported on, of all people, Mr. Industrial Success, Mr. \nIndustrialist of All Times, John F. Welch--Jack Welch.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                   (From Business Week, Dec. 6, 1999)\n\n                       Welch's March to the South\n\n                           By Aaron Bernstein\n\n       Washington, Dec. 6.--One of General Electric Co. CEO John \n     F. Welch's favorite phrases is ``squeeze the lemon,'' or \n     wring out costs to maintain the company's stellar profits. In \n     the past year, the lemon-squeezing at GE has been as never \n     before. In a new, superagressive round of cost-cutting, the \n     company is now demanding deep price cuts from its suppliers. \n     To help them meet the stiff goals, several of GE's business \n     units--including aircraft engines, power systems,\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\n     and industrial systems--have been prodding suppliers to move \n     to low-cost Mexico, where the industrial giant already \n     employs 30,000 people. GE even puts on ``supplier migration'' \n     conferences to help them make the leap.\n       GE's hard-nosed new push could spark other companies to \n     emulate its tactics. The supplier crackdown is reminiscent of \n     a similar attempt by former General Motors Corp. parts czar \n     Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. His efforts largely failed \n     in the face of stiff supplier resistance. But if GE succeeds, \n     other companies could be inclined to try again. GE officials \n     at headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., say the business units \n     are simply carrying out Welch's larger campaign to globalize \n     all aspects of the company. Says Rick Kennedy, a spokesman at \n     GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE): ``We're aggressively asking for \n     double-digit price reductions from our suppliers. We have to \n     do this if we're going to be part of GE.''\n       GE's efforts to get suppliers to move abroad come just as \n     World Trade Organization ministers start gathering in Seattle \n     on Nov. 30. That timing could help make the GE moves an issue \n     at the talks, where critics will be pointing to just such \n     strategies--and the resulting loss of U.S. jobs to low-wage \n     countries--as the inevitable fruit of unregulated trade. GE's \n     14 unions hope to make an example in Seattle of the company's \n     supplier policy, arguing that it's paving the way for a new \n     wave of job shifts. They plan to send dozens of members to \n     march with a float attacking Welch. PALTRY WAR CHEST. The \n     campaign by GE's unions, which bargain jointly through the \n     Coordinated Bargaining Committee (CBC), is also the opening \n     salvo of bargaining talks over new labor contracts to replace \n     those expiring next June. Because GE's unions are weak--fully \n     half of their 47,000 members at the company belong to the \n     nearly bankrupt International Union of Electronic workers \n     (IUE)--they'll have a hard time mounting a credible strike \n     threat. Instead, the CBC is planning a public campaign to tar \n     Welch's image. They plan to focus on likely job losses at GE \n     suppliers. The unions also suspect that GE may move even more \n     unionized GE jobs to Mexico and other countries once it has \n     viable supplier bases in place. ``GE hasn't moved our jobs to \n     Mexico yet because our skilled jobs are higher up the food \n     chain,'' says Jeff Crosby, president of IUE Local 201 at GE's \n     Lynn (Mass.) jet-engine plant. ``But once they have suppliers \n     there, GE can set up shop, too.'' His members from parts \n     supplier Ametek Inc. picketed the plant on Nov. 19 to protest \n     GE's pressure on Ametek to move to Monterrey, Mexico.\n       Although it has never openly criticized Welch before, the \n     AFL-CIO is jumping into the fray this time. Federation \n     officials have decided that Welch's widely admired status in \n     Corporate America has lent legitimacy to a model of business \n     success that they insist is built on job and wage cuts. \n     ``Welch is keeping his profit margins high by redistributing \n     value from workers to shareholders, which isn't what U.S. \n     companies should be doing,'' charges Ron Blackwell, the AFL-\n     CIO's director of corporate affairs. Last year, the AFL-CIO \n     proposed a bold plan to spend some $25 million on a massive \n     new-member recruitment drive at GE, but the IUE wasn't \n     willing to take the risk. So the federation is backing the \n     new, less ambitious campaign that focuses on traditional \n     tactics like rallies and protests. STRONG TIDE. GE's U.S. \n     workforce has been shrinking for more than a decade as Welch \n     has cut costs by shifting production and investment to lower-\n     wage countries. Since 1986, the domestic workforce has \n     plunged by nearly 50%, to 163,000, while foreign employment \n     has nearly doubled, to 130,000. Some of this came from \n     businesses GE sold, but also from rapid expansion in Mexico, \n     India, and other Asian countries. Meanwhile, GE's union \n     workforce has shriveled by almost two-thirds since the early \n     1980s, as work was relocated to cheaper, nonunion plants in \n     the U.S. and abroad.\n       Welch's supplier squeeze may accelerate the trend. In his \n     annual pep talk to GE's top managers in Boca Raton, Fla., \n     last January, he again stressed the need to globalize \n     production to remain cost-competitive, as he had done in \n     prior years. But this time, he also insisted that GE prod \n     suppliers to follow suit. Several business units moved \n     quickly to do so, with GEAE among the most aggressive. This \n     year, GEAE has held what it calls ``supplier migration'' \n     conferences in Cincinnati, near the unit's Evendale (Ohio) \n     headquarters, and in Monterey, where an aerospace industrial \n     park is going up.\n       At the meetings, GEAE officials told dozens of suppliers \n     that it wants to cut costs up to 14%, according to documents \n     about the Monterey meeting at Paoli (Pa.)-based Ametek, whose \n     aerospace unit makes aircraft instruments. The internal \n     report, a copy of which BUSINESSES WEEK obtained, says: ``GE \n     set the tone early and succinctly: `Migrate or be out of \n     business; not a matter of if, just when. This is not a \n     seminar just to provide information. We expect you to move \n     and move quickly.''' Says William Burke, Ametek's vice-\n     president for investor relations: ``GE has made clear its \n     desire that its suppliers move to Mexico, and we are \n     evaluating that option. We have a long relationship with GE, \n     and we want to preserve it.''\n       GEAE officials argue that heightened competition leaves \n     them no choice. Jet engines sell for less than they did four \n     years ago, says Kennedy, the unit's spokesman. Almost all \n     GEAE's profits have come from contracts to maintain engines \n     already sold. And that business is getting tougher, with \n     rivals such as United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney \n     laying off thousands of workers to slash costs. ``This \n     company is going to make its net income targets, and to do \n     it, we will have to take difficult measures,'' says Kennedy.\n       Still, even some suppliers don't see the Mexico push as \n     justified. They point out that GEAE's operating profit has \n     soared by 80% since 1994, to $1.7 billion on sales of $10.3 \n     billion. GE, they argue, is leading the cost cuts. ``It's \n     hard to give away 5% or 10% to a company making so much money \n     when most of the suppliers are marginally profitable,'' says \n     Barry Bucher, the CEO and founder of Aerospace International \n     Materials, a $30 million distributor of specialty metals in \n     Cincinnati. Nonetheless, Bucher says he's looking into a \n     joint venture in Mexico in response to the demands from GE, \n     his top customer.\n       The unions, for their part, worry that GEAE will follow in \n     the footsteps of GE's appliance unit. To remain competitive \n     in that low-skilled, low-margin industry, GE Appliances has \n     slashed its workforce nearly in half at its Appliance Park \n     facility in Louisville, to some 7,500 today. Much of the work \n     has been relocated to a joint venture in Mexico. Union \n     leaders have tried to stave off further job shifts by \n     offering concessions. In early November, the company agreed \n     to a $200 million investment in Louisville in exchange for \n     productivity improvements and lump-sum payments instead of \n     wage hikes for its members. ``We hope GE will see this as a \n     solution they can adopt in jet engines and elsewhere,'' says \n     IUE President Edward L. Fire.\n       Labor's new campaign may embarrass Welsh and even prompt GE \n     to tone down its demands on suppliers. But it won't rebuilt \n     the union's clout at the bargaining table the way a serious \n     organizing drive might have done. Until that happens, Welch \n     probably has little to fear from his restive unions.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I read:\n\n       One of General Electric Co. CEO John F. Welch's favorite \n     phrases is ``squeeze the lemon,'' or wring out costs to \n     maintain the company's stellar profits.\n\n  How did you squeeze that lemon? I am thinking now that he is \nsqueezing something else. Squeezing that lemon in Mexico, he said to \nall of his suppliers two years ago. You have to go down to Mexico and \ncut the cost of your particular supplies, or you will not be a supplier \nof General Electric.\n  When the best of the best blue-chip corporations of America has an \naffirmative action plan to get rid of the jobs and the industrial \nsecurity of the United States of America, we are really in trouble. How \ndoes it occur? It is a natural thing.\n  In manufacturing, 30 percent of volume is in the labor costs. As much \nas 20 percent of sales can be saved by moving offshore to a low-wage \ncountry or down to Mexico, India, or China. If you retain your \nexecutive office, of course your sales force, but move your \nmanufacturing offshore, if you have $500 million in sales, you can reap \na profit of $100 million before taxes. Or you can stay in America, \ncontinue to work your own folks, and go broke. That is how they look at \nit.\n  So with the policies we have, they are not only moving their \nmanufacturing, they are moving the executive office to Bermuda. They \nwant the protection of the United States of America, but they don't \nwant to participate in building up that protection. They want a free \nride. That is why I say, in the Senate, we are in the hands of the \nPhilistines. When my friend Bobby Kennedy really came in to national \nrecognition he had published a book ``The Enemy Within.'' He was \ntalking about organized labor. Now I can write the book ``The Enemy \nWithin,'' and I can talk about management.\n  Who is opposing us in the Senate, trying to create jobs, trying to \nhold together the strength of our economy, trying to maintain our \nindustrial backbone? Who opposes this? The Business Roundtable, the \nConference Board, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nChamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe retailers that make a bigger profit, newspapers that take the \nhandouts from the retail associations. They make the most of their \nprofits in newspapers from retail advertising. So they put out those \nthings, free trade, free trade, fast track, fast track, and here comes \nthe whole K Street crowd.\n  I came here 35 years ago on the Commerce Committee. The very first \nperson in the office on trade was a Japanese representative. No longer \nnow. I haven't seen anyone from Japan in Lord knows when. I am trying \nto get there to see our Ambassador over there, Howard Baker. I respect \ntheir productivity and I have watched as we cry babied along. We never \ndid open up their market. It was always a one-way street.\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n  In fact, the Japanese got to the position of saying, wait a minute, \nwe are not going to buy your bonds if that is what you want to do in \ntrade. We found out long since that the Secretary of the Treasury \nreally is trying to sell, as in the morning headlines, which says we \nhave a deficit, so he is trying to issue $1 billion in bonds, borrowing \n$1 billion. We have had the Japanese juggle our trade policy.\n  But more than anything else, we have the arrogance now of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce. I speak advisedly of that body. Ten years ago I \nwas their man. I was the Man of the Year of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, if I quote correctly, Robert Thompson, who was the national \npresident. He had me going around making talks and everything else \nbecause I had a standoff with my good friend Russell Long of Louisiana. \nWe had labor law reform. On eight votes, up and down for cloture, I won \nand prevailed.\n\n  I don't come here as an enemy of business. I know way more in \nexperience, I should say, about getting jobs and creating jobs, \ninstituting technical training, imparting the tools, high tech, and \nglobalization than most because I have been in the game. I am a friend \nof business, but I am a greater friend of the United States. I hate to \nsee my country go to pot with this childish nonsense of free trade. We \nare missing out on agreements. Since NAFTA, I have lost 53,900 textile \njobs alone. My friend, the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, lost \n124,000; 27,000 have been lost by the Senator from Mississippi. I don't \nknow whether he is with us or not.\n  This is what the Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, says, and he knows \nnothing about trade. In yesterday's National Journal's Congress Daily, \nI quote Tom Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He \nsaid the Chamber would not accept a bill weighted down by amendments \nthat exceed the average man or woman's sense of what is appropriate for \nthe bill. We will kill it and the people who loaded it up will pay a \npolitical price. Donohue also said that the business community has been \npatient and supportive through the political process to get the trade \nauthority bill before the Senate, but there will be dire consequences \nif the bill collapsed under partisan politics.\n\n       I know of many manufacturing companies that will move their \n     operations offshore. I brought that message home to specific \n     legislators about firms and their States and districts.\n\n  That is a threat from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Tell him to wake up. He headed the Trucking Association when Jack \nWelch was putting in his affirmative action plan to get rid of the jobs \nand move to Mexico. Donohue now will warn you they will move. Everybody \nknows this has been going on for 10 years. We are going out of \nbusiness.\n  I wanted to bring that story home in this debate, not asking to vote \npro or con with respect to a particular trade measure. As I say, I \nvoted for Vietnam; I voted for Jordan; I voted for NAFTA with Canada. \nIt is protecting not only your economy and your industrial strength but \nyour standard of living.\n  Incidentally, on the one hand, you can certainly bar child \nemployment, children and youth production. But you are not going to get \nMexico to pass environmental laws we have. Or the labor laws. They have \nthat advantage. In China, in India, in Malaysia, the competition can \nkeep on whistling ``Dixie,'' keep talking. It will not happen. It is \nnot going to happen, and you can't blame them. If you were running the \ncountry of China, you would do the same thing. You wouldn't run around \nand say we have to get with the Americans and level the playing field, \nand put in these labor reforms, and put in these environmental \nrequirements because we want to be seen as being fair. It is just \nabsolute nonsense.\n\n  Madam President, what happens is Republican and Democrat Senators \nunanimously support these requirements before you open up Carnahan \nManufacturing. Think about it. Before you open your manufacturing \nplant, you are going to have to have minimum wage, clean air, clean \nwater, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, \nparental leave, safe working place, safe machinery, antitrust \nprovisions. And everything else of that kind.\n  You can go down to Mexico and pay 90 cents an hour and have none of \nthose requirements.\n  In order to compete, is it the case we are going to go back and \nretrench on this high standard of living? No; not at all. That will \nnever happen. But we will have to maintain a balance with respect to \nthe economic strength. We have to maintain our steel production.\n  I will never forget, in 1961, before we got President Kennedy to \nenunciate his seven-point textile program, under the law--and, \nincidentally it is the law today--that before the President can take \nexecutive action unilaterally on a trade measure, he must prove that \nproduct is important to the national security of the United States. At \nthat time we corralled five Cabinet members--one sub-Cabinet of the \nfive, George Ball, because Dean Rusk was too busy, from the Department \nof State; Luther Hodges, Secretary of Commerce; Orville Freeman, the \nSecretary of Agriculture; Douglas Dillon, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, was there; and the Secretary of Labor, Arthur Goldberg.\n  They had hearings and we brought the witnesses. They made a finding, \nand the record is still there, that second to steel, textiles was the \nmost important to our national security. The wag at the time was you \ncannot send them to war in a Japanese uniform--because they were \nbringing in all those textiles. The Japanese don't fool with textiles \nanymore. They have gone high-tech. Now you would say you wouldn't send \nthem to war in a Chinese uniform and Gucci shoes. You have to have the \nclothing. You have to have the uniforms. So you have to have that \nmeasure because it is important to our national security.\n  We have to maintain a modicum of textile manufacturing. We certainly \nhave to maintain the ability to produce steel. We have to retain these \nother industries--electronics, with respect to watch-making, and fine \ntooling, and hand tools, and computers. We have to retain some \nproduction of semiconductors and the like.\n  In doing that, let's correlate, if you please, our 28 agencies and \ndepartments into one department of trade and commerce. We are all over \nthe lot. It is our fault. We have to begin to enforce our trade laws \nagainst dumping. We can't let Wal-Mart sell below cost. They would be \nin trouble. We would get them for antitrust, Robinson-Patman \nviolations, and we would send them to the hoosegow. In international \ntrade that happened in steel. Bob McNamara went running the world \naround saying to the Third World countries that in order to be a nation \nstate, you have to have steel for the tools of agriculture and the \nweapons of war. So they had 2-percent steel plants built all over Latin \nAmerica and the Middle East.\n  I have been into that game. Yes, the President was correct in moving \non steel because they are dumping steel. I see it. My office is in \nCharleston, SC. I can look on the dock and see all of this Brazilian \nsteel coming in at less than cost, putting out of business, 25 miles \naway, Nucor, the most productive of all steel plants in the world.\n  Please, spare me from the idea of productivity. If you go to the \ninternational section of the United Nations, if you go to the Labor \nDepartment, Department of Vital Statistics or otherwise, you will find \nthey will agree the world around, the most productive industrial worker \nis the U.S. industrial worker. We keep nagging: We have to get \nproductivity up. My steel plant is the most productive in the world, \nand they are dumping steel at less than cost and criticize the \nPresident for moving on this particular score. He was right. He is \nright. We have to maintain that.\n  We have to get a value-added tax to pay for this war on terrorism \nthat is costing the country and offset the 17-percent value added tax \nadvantage. For example, in Europe where it is rebated, it is costing us \na 17-percent differential in trade right there.\n  Enforce our dumping laws, but please do not say you have to get more \nproductive. What is not producing is not the industrial worker in the \nUnited States, it is the U.S. Congress. We haven't produced. We have \nbeen running around like lemmings: Free trade, free trade, fast track, \nfast track--having no idea in the Lord's world what we are doing; \nwhereas we are exporting jobs faster than we can create them.\n  My time is up. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are, in a minute or 2, going to turn to \ntwo judicial nominations. We have had a number of Senators wishing to \nspeak on the motion now before the Senate, so I ask unanimous consent \nthat when the votes are completed this afternoon on the two judges, the \nSenator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, be recognized for up to 15 minutes; \nfollowing her remarks, Senator Wellstone be recognized for up to 1 \nhour; following that hour, someone designated by the Republican leader \nwould speak for 1 hour; and following that, Senator Baucus, chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, would be recognized for 1 hour.\n  The majority leader wanted to have a vote on this tonight with the \nconsent of Senator Hollings and others, but it appears now there are a \nsignificant number of people who want to speak so that will probably \nnecessitate carrying the vote over until tomorrow. I have not checked \nwith the leader on that for sure.\n  I propound the request for the speakers who have been lined up. I \nhave checked this out with the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is now the business before the \nSenate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3522-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3522-S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MICHAEL M.

RUFE, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go to executive session to proceed to the consideration \nof Executive Calendar Nos. 778 and 779.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the two managers, Senators Leahy and \nHatch, are not here. I therefore ask unanimous consent that during the \nquorum call I will suggest in just a minute the time be charged--\nequally against the two managers--on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, is the Senator from Vermont correct that \nfollowing the two parties' caucuses this afternoon there will be two \nrollcall votes on judicial nominees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will speak about that, but, first, I \ncompliment the distinguished Presiding Officer and her colleague from \nNew York for their invaluable help behind the scenes as we were \nfighting for the farm bill. As a result, the dairy farmers in my State \nof Vermont and in her State of New York are better off. I thank both \nSenator Clinton and Senator Schumer for their help in that regard.\n  With today's votes, the number of federal judges confirmed since the \nchange in Senate majority fewer than 10 months ago now exceeds 50 and \ntotals 52. Under Democratic leadership, the Senate has confirmed more \njudges in fewer than 10 months than were confirmed by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate in the 1996 and 1997 sessions combined. We have \naccomplished in less than one year what our predecessors and critics \ntook two years to do.\n  The number of judicial confirmations over these past 10 months--52--\nexceeds the number confirmed in four out of six full years under \nRepublican leadership, during all 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997 and \n1996. And we are ahead of the pace for all the years of Republican \ncontrol. It exceeds the number of confirmations in the first year of \nthe Reagan Administration by a Republican Senate majority. It is almost \ndouble the number of confirmations in the first year of the Clinton \nAdministration by a Democratic Senate majority. And it is more than \ntriple the number of judges confirmed for the George H.W. Bush \nAdministration by a Senate of the other party.\n  The confirmation of Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson today illustrates the \nprogress being made under Democratic leadership, and the fair and \nexpeditious way in which we have considered nominees. With today's \nconfirmations, we will have confirmed three district court judges to \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania in fewer than four months. On \nApril 18th, the Senate confirmed, by a vote of 94 to zero, Judge \nLegrome Davis to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Judge Legrome Davis was first nominated to the position \nof U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \nby President Clinton on July 30, 1998. The Republican-controlled Senate \ntook no action on his nomination and it was returned to the President \nat the end of 1998. On January 26, 1999, President Clinton renominated \nJudge Davis for the same vacancy. The Senate again failed to hold a \nhearing for Judge Davis and his nomination was returned to the \nPresident on December 15, 2000, after two more years of inaction in a \nsecond full Congress while the Senate was controlled by a Republican \nmajority. Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis languished before \nthe Committee for 868 days without a hearing, notwithstanding the \nstrong support of Senator Specter. But he was unable to get the support \nhe needed for him to go through.\n  This year we have moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis. Judge \nDavis was nominated by President Bush in late January 2002 and he \nreceived a unanimous vote by the Judiciary Committee on April 11th--\nfewer than three months after his nomination and less than one month \nafter his paperwork was completed. The saga of Judge Davis recalls for \nus so many nominees from the period January 1995 through July 10, 2001, \nwho never received a hearing or a vote and who were the subject of \nsecret anonymous holds by Republicans for reasons that were never \nexplained. Judge Davis was a nominee held up for almost three years and \nwhen the Senate was finally allowed to vote on his nomination, he was \nconfirmed by a vote of 94 to 0.\n  Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson help fill vacancies on the Pennsylvania \nDistrict Courts that existed long before the majority shifted last \nsummer. One of the two vacancies has existed since December 31, 1998. \nDespite the fact that President Clinton nominated David Fineman to fill \nthis judicial vacancy, Mr. Fineman never received a hearing and his \nnomination was returned to the President without action at the end of \n2000. In contrast, we have moved expeditiously, as with Judge Davis, to \nconsider Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson. Both nominees were nominated by \nPresident Bush in January, received a hearing within days of their \nfiles being complete, and are being confirmed approximately three \nmonths after their nominations. Both nominees have been practicing law \nfor more than 25 years and have a distinguished history of public \nservice.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving at a fast pace \nto fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong bipartisan \nsupport. I have a chart--I always have a chart, Madam President--and it \ndemonstrates, that we are moving at a fast pace to fill judicial \nvacancies, especially with those nominees who have strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Partisan critics of these accomplishments ignore the facts. The facts \nare that we are confirming President Bush's nominees at a faster pace \nthan the nominees of prior presidents, including those who worked \nclosely with a Senate majority of the same political party. I again \npoint out these are nominees who, by and large, are Republicans, by and \nlarge, are conservative Republicans, but, by and large, have bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n  As long as I am Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do \neverything possible to protect the integrity and the independence of \nthe Federal judiciary. I will not support an effort by any President--\nRepublican or\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nDemocrat--to hang a sign on the courthouse door saying: only people of \na certain political persuasion can have a fair hearing before those \njudges. I do not want the American public to look at a court and say: I \nam eligible to have my case heard in that court, but only if I am a \nvery conservative Republican or I am a very liberal Democrat or if I am \nWhite or if I am Black or if I am poor or if I am rich. That is not the \nway it should be.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer is a lawyer, and she knows that \nthe Federal courts are supposed to be our bulwark of independence. It \nis one of the first things you learn in law school: The Federal court \nis a place you go where not only is justice supposed to be colorblind, \nit is supposed to be politically blind. And I do not believe I am \nfulfilling my constitutional obligations in the Senate if I vote for \nnominees who are put in for a specific purpose, to give an ideological \nslant of either the right or the left to the Federal courts.\n  I want everyone to know that, when they come to a Federal court, it \nwill make no difference whether they are Republican or Democrat or rich \nor poor. No matter what their color, no matter what their religion, no \nmatter what their age, no matter what their background, they should \nknow they are going to be treated the same.\n  The judges that we have confirmed, as shown on this chart, passed \nthat test. That is why both Republicans and Democrats have voted for \nthem.\n  Now, in fact, I should point out that the rate of confirmation in the \npast 10 months actually exceeds the rates of confirmation in the past \nthree Presidencies.\n  For example, in the first 15 months of the Clinton administration, 46 \njudicial nominees were confirmed, a pace on average of 3.1 per month. \nIn the first 15 months of the first Bush administration, judges were \nconfirmed at a pace of 1.8 judges per month.\n  Even in the first 15 months of the Reagan Administration, when a \nstaunchly Republican majority in the Senate was working closely with a \nRepublican President, 54 judges were confirmed, a pace of 3.6 per \nmonth. In fewer than 10 months since the shift to a Democratic majority \nin the Senate, President George W. Bush's judicial nominees have been \nconfirmed at a rate of more than 5.2 judges per month, a faster pace \nthan for any of the past 3 Presidents.\n  During the six and one-half years of Republican control of the \nSenate, judicial confirmations averaged 38 per year a pace of \nconsideration and confirmation that we have already exceeded under \nDemocratic leadership over these past 10 months in spite of all of the \nchallenges facing Congress and the Nation during this period and all of \nthe obstacles Republicans have placed in our path. As of today, we have \nconfirmed 52 judicial nominees in just 10 months. This is almost twice \nas many confirmations as George W. Bush's father had over a longer \nperiod--27 nominees in 15 months--than the period we have been in the \nmajority in the Senate.\n  I suspect the reason you hear so many complaints from the Republican \nside is that they are hoping people will not look at the facts, that \nthey are hoping the people will not remember what they did to President \nClinton. They do not want to have to admit what is an irrefutable fact, \nthat the Democratic-controlled Senate is treating President George W. \nBush far better than a Republican-controlled Senate treated President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton.\n  And, frankly, I get a little bit weary of the misstatements, I get a \nlittle bit weary of having members of my committee attacked for their \npatriotism or for their religion by those who feel we are not \nautomatically rubberstamping the President's nominees. The Constitution \nsays: advise and consent. It does not say: rubberstamp.\n  But I have also been here with six Presidents. I have had the same \nposition with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. I will \nnot vote for anybody who is going to diminish the independence of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  In fact the Republican critics, because they do not want to admit the \nfact that we are moving much faster than they did with a Democratic \nPresident, typically compare apples to oranges to mischaracterize the \nachievements of the last 10 months.\n  They complain that we have not done 24 months of work in the fewer \nthan 10 months we have been in the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see nobody seeking recognition. I ask \nunanimous consent to be able to continue for at least 1 minute after \nsomebody else seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Ironically, with today's confirmations, we even meet that \nunfair standard: Within the last 10 months we have confirmed about as \nmany judges--52--as were confirmed by the Republican majority in the \nentire 1996 congressional session and in all of 1997 combined. We are \nnow meeting their two-year figures is less than 10 months. Oh, and if \nyou were wondering about Court of Appeals judges confirmed in the 1996 \nand 1997 sessions combined--their total was 7. We have already \nconfirmed 9 in fewer than 10 months.\n\n  A fair examination of the rate of confirmation shows that Democrats \nare working harder and faster on judicial nominees, confirming judges \nat a faster pace than the rates of the past 20 years. The double \nstandards asserted by Republican critics are just plain wrong and \nunfair, but that does not seem to matter to Republicans intent on \ncriticizing and belittling every achievement of the Senate under a \nDemocratic majority.\n  The Republican attack is based on the unfounded notion that the \nSenate has not kept up with attrition on the District Courts and the \nCourts of Appeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has not \nonly been keeping up with attrition but outpacing it, and we have \nstarted to move the vacancies numbers in the right direction--down. By \ncontrast, from January 1995 when the Republican majority took over \ncontrol of the Senate until they relinquished control in June 2001, \nfederal judicial vacancies rose by 65 percent, from 63 to 105.\n  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmations in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. When I became Chairman of a Committee to which Members were \nfinally assigned on July 10, we began with 110 judicial vacancies. With \ntoday's confirmation of Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson, we have reduced the \noverall number of judicial vacancies to 88 and the number of district \ncourt vacancies to 58. Already, in fewer than 10 months in the \nmajority, we more than kept up with attrition and begun to close the \njudicial vacancies gap that nearly doubled under the Republican \nmajority. Under Democratic leadership, we have reduced the number of \ndistrict court vacancies by almost 25 percent and the overall number of \njudicial vacancies by 20 percent, to below 90.\n  I happen to have a chart that shows what we have been doing. We see \nthe trend under the Republican majority going up, and then we see the \ntrend under the Democratic majority and how we have brought the vacancy \nnumber down.\n  The Democratic majority in the Senate has also kept up with attrition \non the Courts of Appeals and been acting to close the vacancies gap on \nthe Courts of Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican \nmajority. Vacancies on the Courts of Appeals rose from 16 to 33 in the \nperiod January 1995 to July 2001, before the Senate was allowed to \nreorganize after the shift in majority last summer.\n  In the fewer than 10 months since the change in majority, the Senate \nhas confirmed nine judges to the Courts of Appeals and more than kept \nup with the five vacancies that had arisen since July. In contrast, the \nRepublican-controlled majority averaged only seven confirmations to the \nCourts of Appeals per year. Seven. This is what is somewhat \ndistressing. I suppose they think if they keep saying it enough, the \npublic will be fooled and the press will be fooled. I am willing to bet \nultimately neither will.\n  In the fewer than 10 months the Democrats have been in the majority, \nwe have already exceeded the annual number of Court of Appeals judges \nconfirmed by our predecessors. The Senate\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nin the last 10 months has confirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as \nwere confirmed in all of 2000 and more than were confirmed in 1997 or \n1999, and nine more than the zero from 1996. Another way to put it is \nthat within the last 10 months, the Democratic majority in the Senate \nhas confirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as were confirmed in the \n2000 and 1996 sessions combined and confirmed more Court of Appeals \njudges than were confirmed in the 1999 and 1996 sessions combined or in \nthe 1997 and 1996 sessions combined. Simply put, in fewer than 10 \nmonths we have already exceeded the number of Court of Appeals judges \nconfirmed by a Republican majority in four of the six years in which \nthey were in control. No matter what standard you use, we are moving \nvery fast.\n  Under Republican leadership from 1995 through July 10, 2001, \nvacancies on the Courts of Appeals increased from 16 to 33, more than \ndoubling.\n  When I became chairman of a Committee to which Members were finally \nassigned on July 10, we began with 33 Courts of Appeals vacancies. That \nis what I inherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, five \nadditional vacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the \ncountry. With last week's confirmation of Judge Howard, we have reduced \nthe number of circuit court vacancies to 29. That is, we have kept up \nwith attrition by confirming five Court of Appeals judges and then \nacted to lower the number of vacancies by confirming four additional \njudges. Those are the facts. Since our Republican critics are so fond \nof using percentages, I will say that we will have now reduced the \nvacancies on the Courts of Appeals by more than 12 percent in the last \n10 months.\n  Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making no \nprogress, as some have asserted, there are now 29 vacancies--that is \nmore than keeping up with the attrition on the Circuit Courts. \nRepublican critics unfairly seek to attribute to the Democratic \nmajority the lack of action by the Republican majority before the \nhistoric change last summer.\n  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority fewer than 10 months to reverse that trend, keep up with \nextraordinary turnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies \noverall. This is progress.\n  Rather than having the circuit vacancy numbers skyrocketing, as they \ndid overall during the prior six and one-half years--more than doubling \nfrom 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has reversed that trend. The \nvacancies numbers are moving in the right direction down.\n  Overall, in fewer than 10 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nheld 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominations. With today's \nactions, we will have confirmed 52 of those nominees. By contrast, in \nthe first 10 months of Republican control of nominations they held only \n10 hearings and confirmed only 36 judges. We have held more hearings on \njudges than the Republican majority held in any year of its control of \nthe Senate. The Republican majority never held 17 judicial confirmation \nhearings in 12 months.\n  Indeed, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial nominees--more than \n50--never got a Committee hearing and Committee vote from the \nRepublican majority, which perpetuated longstanding vacancies into this \nyear.\n  Despite the new-found concern from across the aisle about the number \nof judicial vacancies, no nominations hearings were held while the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last year. No \njudges were confirmed during that time from among the many qualified \ncircuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, 2001, or \nfrom among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, 2001.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ndistrict and circuit vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfirst hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the \nCommittee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included two District Court nominees and a Court \nof Appeals nominee on whom the Republican majority had refused to hold \na hearing the year before. Within two weeks of the first hearing, we \nheld a second hearing on judicial nominations that included another \nCourt of Appeals nominee. I did try to schedule some District Court \nnominees for that hearing, but none of the files of the seven District \nCourt nominees pending before the Committee was complete. Similarly, in \nthe unprecedented hearings we held for judicial nominees during the \nAugust recess, we attempted to schedule additional District Court \nnominees but we could not do so if their paperwork was not complete. \nHad we had cooperation from the Republican majority and the White House \nin our efforts, we could have held even more hearings for more District \nCourt nominees. Nevertheless, in fewer than 10 tumultuous months, the \nCommittee has held 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominations.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in Committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny Committee consideration of judicial nominees. We have \nmoved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from \n1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public \nfor the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the six and one-half years he chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee, I observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would \nhave made more progress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during \nthose years for his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have \nbeen able to do more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so \nmany nominees without action.\n  I hope to hold additional hearings and make additional progress on \njudicial nominees. In our efforts to address the number of vacancies on \nthe circuit and district courts we inherited from the Republicans, the \nCommittee has focused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order \nto respond to what Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a \nvacancy crisis, the Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This \nwill help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by \nconfirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as \npossible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime \nappointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow \nideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would \nfurther divide our nation.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have falsely charged that if a \nnominee has a record as a conservative Republican, he will not be \nconsidered by the Committee. That is simply untrue. The next time \nRepublican critics are bandying around charges that the Democratic \nmajority has failed to consider conservative judicial nominees, I hope \nsomeone will ask those critics about all the Federalist Society members \nwe have confirmed and the Republican activists we have confirmed \nwithout a single dissenting vote. I do not believe that President Bush \nis nominating liberals and neither does the White House.\n\n  The Committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senator Grassley, Senator \nLott, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi, Senator Smith, and Senator \nThompson--six Republican Senators who each sought a prompt hearing on a \nCourt of Appeals nominee who was not among those initially sent to the \nSenate in May 2001.\n  I tried to accommodate them. They asked if we could move their \nnominees ahead in the queue. We did. We heard them. We confirmed them. \nBut knowing that no good deed goes unpunished, having moved nominees at \nthe request\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nof Republican Senators, moved theirs ahead of others, the same \nRepublican Senators signed letters saying: It is terrible we are not \nmoving them in order.\n  I have tried to accommodate them as much as I could. We would be \nmoving a lot slower if we were going exactly in order. What we are \ntrying to do is get those nominees on whom there is some consensus \nthrough first. That will put as many judges on the bench as possible.\n  I ask my colleagues, please, try to at least wait more than a week \nafter I have accommodated you in moving your judge up for a hearing and \ngetting them confirmed before you send out a letter saying: Why aren't \nyou confirming more judges? I don't want to embarrass Senators by \nhaving a chart showing some of the letters and some of the statements \nthey have made asking me to take their judges out of order, and then \nputting them side by side with their letters criticizing me for taking \njudges out of order. I am not going to do that, although I get sorely \ntempted.\n  I am also sorely tempted because the problems we are talking about \narose on a Republican watch, while they were in the majority. It \nreminds me a little bit of an arsonist we had in Vermont when I was a \nprosecutor. There was a fellow who used to complain that the fire \ndepartment wasn't responding fast enough. He was setting the fires. He \nwas the one setting the fires. Rest his soul, he is no longer with us, \nbut he used to complain they weren't responding fast enough, and he was \nthe one setting the fires.\n  The whipsawing by the other side is truly remarkable. When we proceed \non nominees that they support and on whom they seek action, we are \ncriticized for not acting on others. When we direct our effort to \ntrying to solve problems in one Circuit, they complain that we are not \nacting in another.\n  I imagine that over the next 10 days we will be hearing a refrain \nabout the most controversial of President Bush's nominees who have not \nyet participated in a hearing. Some of them do not have the necessary \nhome-state Senator support needed to proceed. Some will take a great \ndeal of time and effort for the Committee to consider. I hope to be \nable to do something else that our Republican counterparts never did, \nwhich is to announce some scheduling decisions well in advance of \nhearings to come over the next several months.\n  But I do find it amazing that in spite of all we have done, all we \nare doing, and the fact that judges are moving much faster than they \ndid in the past 6 years, our partisan critics will act as if we have \nnot held a single hearing on a single judicial nominee. They will not \nacknowledge their role in creating what they now call a judicial \nvacancies crisis. They will not apologize for their harsh tactics in \nthe six and one-half years that preceded the shift in majority.\n  They will not acknowledge that the Democratic majority has moved \nfaster on more judges than they ever did. That will not acknowledge \nthat we have been working at a record pace to seek to solve the \nproblems they created.\n  We will keep on working. I am sure I will keep on listening to the \npartisan sniping, but we will keep moving faster than they ever did \nwhen they were in charge.\n  I remind everybody that this Senator would never vote for a nominee \nwhose sole purpose in being there is to detract from the independence \nof the Federal judiciary and, instead, is intending to make the Federal \njudiciary ideologically pure one way or the other--and I don't care \nwhich way it goes; I will not vote for such a person. I want people to \nknow that if any Vermonter or anybody from any State goes into a \nFederal court, they are going to have a fair hearing, and they will not \nbe judged based on political party or political ideology. Whether they \nare plaintiff or defendant, whether they are Government or defendant, \nor whether they are rich or poor, they should be treated the same.\n  Each of the 52 nominees confirmed by the Senate has received the \nunanimous, bipartisan backing of the Committee. The confirmations of \nJudge Rufe and Mr. Baylson make the 51st and 52nd judicial nominees to \nbe confirmed since I became Chairman last July. I would like to commend \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee and our Majority Leader Senator \nDaschle and Assistant Majority Leader Senator Reid for all of their \nhard work in getting us to this point.\n  The confirmation of the 52nd judge in fewer than 10 months, \nespecially these last 10 months, in spite of the unfair and personal \ncriticism to which they have each been subjected, is an extraordinary \nachievement and a real example of Democratic Senators acting in a \nbipartisan way even some on the other side have continued to make our \nefforts toward progress as difficult as possible.\n\n\n                      U.S. POLICY TOWARD COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to turn to another important \ntopic--the situation in Colombia. Two weeks ago, Colombia's President, \nAndres Pastrana, was in Washington for what may have been his last \nofficial visit before the elections in May to choose his successor. He \ncannot run again under Colombia's Constitution. While I am sorry to see \nhim leave, I am proud that he is departing through a democratic \ntransfer of power, confirming, once again, his commitment to democracy \nin Colombia. I respect President Pastrana. I admire his attempts to \nbring peace to Colombia and his successes in improving relations \nbetween our two nations.\n  I do, however, have concerns about the administration's request for \nmore assistance to Colombia. The reason we are given as to why we are \nspending such large sums of money in Colombia seems to change \nfrequently--from fighting an insurgency to combating terrorism to \nprotecting democracy to reducing the flow of drugs. Before we spend \neven more money down there, I hope the administration will articulate a \nclear plan, look carefully at the billions we have spent with little to \nshow for it, and understand Colombia's need to take more responsibility \nfor their own problem.\n  Colombia should not be blamed for America's drug problem. Even if no \ncocaine or heroin came here from Colombia, illegal drugs would still \ncome into this country. As long as Americans spend billions on illegal \ndrugs, somebody else is going to supply it.\n  In many ways Colombia fits into larger issues about our foreign \nassistance programs. I think it is time for us to re-examine the way \nforeign aid is being used. During the cold war, we would give foreign \naid to countries simply because they claimed to be anti-Soviet Union. \nIt didn't make any difference how it was used. After the Cold War, we \nstarting giving money, while paying little attention to human rights \nviolations by foreign militaries or security forces, to nations that \nwould say that they would help fight drug trafficking. Today, I am \nworried that we are starting down a road where we give all sorts of \nassistance to governments that claim to be antiterrorist, irrespective \nof their commitment to democracy, human rights, or economic reform.\n  I have said over and over again that we should increase foreign \nassistance to many areas of the world. We have moral and strategic \nreasons for doing that. But we ought to at least stand for something \nwhen we provide this assistance. We can deliver a strong message that, \nwhile we don't expect an absolute replication of our form of \ngovernment, we do expect you to respect human rights and other basic \nAmerican values if you use our tax dollars.\n  There is no reason that countries cannot respect these values and use \nforeign aid effectively--these things go hand and hand. We have had \nsome wonderful successes where we have done both. We have had some \ncolossal disasters where we have not.\n  Madam President, I have known Colombia's President Pastrana for \nseveral years, and consider him a friend. He has worked diligently for \npeace, often at great personal risk, and while he ultimately was unable \nto obtain the peace agreement with the guerrillas that he so deeply \nwanted, his administration will be remembered for other achievements. \nToday, thanks to his efforts and those of Colombia's fine Ambassador, \nLuis Moreno, Colombia's relations with the United States, which had \nsuffered under previous Colombian administrations, are strong and based \non mutual respect.\n  I want to thank President Pastrana for his friendship, for the \ndignity that he restored to the presidency, for his\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\ndedication to his people. Although we did not always agree about U.S. \npolicy toward Colombia, President Pastrana always treated me with \nrespect and warmth. I am grateful to him, and wish him the best in the \nfuture. While I regret that I was unable to travel to his country \nduring his term of office, I am determined to do so and look forward to \nvisiting him there when I do.\n  The issue of U.S. policy toward Colombia is the subject of \nconsiderable concern in Washington, both because of President \nPastrana's recent visit, and because of President Bush's supplemental \nappropriations request, which proposes to shift the focus of our \nassistance program in Colombia from counter-narcotics to counter-\nterrorism.\n  I am of mixed minds about this proposal, and want to take a moment to \ndiscuss some of my concerns.\n  Before we rush to bring the war against international terrorism to \nColombia's jungle as the Administration and some in Congress now urge, \nwe would do well to understand that country's feudal history. We should \nalso review what has been done with the nearly $2 billion we have \nappropriated for Colombia in the past two years.\n  ``Plan Colombia,'' devised by the Clinton Administration and the \nColombian Government to counter the flourishing trade in cocaine from \nColombia to the United States, called for $7.5 billion. Colombia was to \ncontribute $4 billion, and, were told at the time, the U.S. share was \n$1.6 billion. Donations by other countries, mostly the Europeans, have \nnot materialized. The Colombian Government's support has also fallen \nfar short. For fiscal year 2003, the Bush Administration seeks another \n$439 million in counter-drug aid, plus $98 million in military aid, for \na total of $537 million.\n  So far, U.S. tax dollars have paid for a fleet of aircraft to spray \nchemical herbicide over large areas of the country planted in coca, \ncombat helicopters to protect the planes from ground fire, and training \nand equipment for counter-drug battalions. More funds were provided for \neconomic programs to give coca farmers alternative sources of income \nand to reform Colombia's dysfunctional justice system.\n  Because of the Colombian military's poor human rights record, \nCongress conditioned aid on the prosecution of military officers \nimplicated in serious abuses, and on the severing of the military's \nlinks with illegal paramilitary groups. These groups, like the \nguerrillas, have been designated by the Administration as terrorist \norganizations.\n  By any objective measure, Plan Colombia's results have been, at best, \ndisappointing.\n  First, the State Department predicted a 30 percent reduction in coca \ncultivation by the end of 2002. Although 84,250 hectares were sprayed \nlast year, coca cultivation in Colombia actually rose, by at least \n21,100 hectares. There has not been any reduction in the flow of \nillegal drugs into the U.S., and virtually no one in the Administration \nthinks there will be.\n  Second, while aerial spraying may at some point reduce the coca crop, \nthere is vast territory ripe for future cultivation and a huge U.S. \ndemand for drugs. Serious questions have been raised about the health \nand environmental impact of the spraying which need to be \nsatisfactorily answered if this program is to continue. Manual \neradication, as was done in Bolivia and Peru, should be reconsidered, \nand we should target the large growers, drug labs and traffickers. \nMoreover, any of these eradication efforts will ultimately fail without \neconomic alternatives for those displaced by coca eradication.\n  Third, U.S.-funded economic programs have produced little in the way \nof viable alternatives. It is dangerous and difficult to implement \nthese programs in conflict zones where coca is grown. The Colombian \nGovernment has not invested enough of its own money in these areas, and \nhowever much it has invested has produced few tangible results. Nor has \nit done enough to reform its sagging economy. This needs to be a \npartnership, and our support for alternative income programs should \nfocus where the needs are greatest and programs can be sustained.\n  Fourth, senior military officers implicated in the murders of \ncivilians, or who abet paramilitary violence and drug trafficking, have \nnot been jailed despite the conditions on U.S. aid. Many remain on \nactive duty and some have been promoted. Human rights investigators and \nprosecutors have been threatened, killed or forced to flee the country. \nWhile some soldiers have been suspended, none have been prosecuted and \nsome have joined paramilitaries.\n  Under our law, the Secretary of State must certify that certain human \nrights conditions have been met prior to the release of military aid. \nEarlier this year, a number of high-ranking Administration officials \ntraveled to Colombia, and informed Colombian military officers that \nmore progress was needed. Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, no such \nprogress has taken place and therefore, to his credit, the Secretary \nhas not made the certification. However, I am told the certification \ncould come at any time, and if that is true I hope that it is based on \nfacts and reflects a good faith application of the law.\n  Fifth, top paramilitary leaders, implicated in hundreds of murders, \ntravel around the country and give press interviews despite numerous \nwarrants for their arrest. One has to ask why these arrest warrants, \nmany of which have been pending for years, have not been executed? \nLocal military commanders share airfields, intelligence and logistics, \nand in some instances even coordinate attacks. While some members of \nparamilitaries have been captured, their influence has grown throughout \nthe country and they are responsible for a large share of targeted \nassassinations and gruesome attacks against unarmed civilians. Like the \nguerrillas, the paramilitaries are deeply involved in drug trafficking. \nContinued U.S. aid to the Colombian military must be tied to \naccountability for abuses and to aggressively fighting the \nparamilitaries, particularly the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia \n(``AUC'').\n  Sixth, President Pastrana's brave efforts to negotiate peace, \ncynically spurned by the guerrillas, have collapsed. The violence has \nintensified and the guerrillas, especially the Revolutionary Armed \nForces of Colombia (``FARC''), have sharply escalated kidnappings, \nassassinations and other terrorist acts. They are unlikely to be able \nto defeat the Colombian military, but they can lay siege to cities by \ncutting off water and power supplies. Colombia's generals are now \nasking the U.S. for aid to fight the war.\n  Americans need to understand that Colombia is really two \n``countries,'' which is at the heart of its problems. The thinly \npopulated, impoverished eastern half, which the government has ignored \nfor generations, is mired in the 19th Century, while the sophisticated, \nurban west is edging toward the 21st. There are deeply rooted social, \neconomic and political reasons why Latin America's oldest conflict is \nno closer to resolution, and why drug money, corruption and lawlessness \npermeate Colombian society. These problems, which ultimately only \nColombians can solve, will not be fixed by attacking the symptoms, and \nan all out war against the twin terrorist threats--guerrillas and \nparamilitaries--would cost far more, take far longer, and wreak more \nhavoc than anyone in Washington has acknowledged so far.\n  Until now we have confined our aid to fighting drugs. In the first \nsign of a shift, the Administration asked Congress for an additional \n$98 million to protect 100 miles of an oil pipeline that has been a \nfrequent target of guerrilla attacks that have cost Colombia $500 \nmillion a year in oil revenues. The White House is now seeking broad, \nnew counter-terrorism authority in the fiscal year 2002 supplemental, \nopening the door to a deeper, open-ended U.S. involvement in Colombia.\n  If we go down that road what would be the likely result? Colombia is \nnot Afghanistan, and no one supports sending U.S. troops. But while no \ntwo countries are the same, we gave over $5 billion to the military of \nEl Salvador, a country with \\1/50\\th the land area of Colombia, and \nthey could not defeat the guerrillas there. Are we, and the Colombian \npeople who currently spend a meager 3 percent of GDP on the army, \nprepared for a wider war, the huge cost, many more displaced people, \nand the inevitable increase in civilian casualties? Is the only \nalternative to continue a limited, ineffective counter-drug strategy, \nand the growth in public support for the AUC which may ultimately pose \na greater threat to the\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\ncountry than the FARC? Can the military be made to see their oft-times \nallies, the AUC, as terrorists to be fought as aggressively as the \nFARC? Should we send an envoy of the caliber of Richard Holbrooke to \npush for a cease fire, and actively support a much more inclusive \nnegotiating strategy than was pursued previously? What about attacking \nthe security problems that have given rise to the AUC, by strengthening \nColombia's National Police, who have a cleaner human rights record and \nwho may be more effective in responding to kidnappings and other \nterrorist acts?\n  We want to help Colombia, particularly as the FARC has evolved from a \nrebel movement with a political ideology to a drug-financed terrorist \nsyndicate. But we and the Colombians need to be clear about our goals \nand what it would take to achieve them. We should not commit ourselves \nto a costly policy that is fogged with ambiguity, and we should not \nsubvert our other objectives of promoting the rule of law, protecting \nhuman rights, and supporting equitable economic development. Goal-\nsetting should also be coordinated, after the elections in May, with \nColombia's new president, who may favor an entirely different approach.\n  Finally, just as Colombians need to take far more responsibility for \ntheir own problems, Colombia cannot solve America's drug problem. Too \noften, we unfairly blame Colombia, and the other Andean nations, for \nthe epidemic of drug addiction in our own country. Our meager attempts \nto reduce demand for drugs have failed, and unless we devote far more \neffort to what we know works--education and treatment--the drugs will \nkeep coming and Americans will keep dying.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ncolleague from Vermont for awaiting my arrival. We have just been at a \nnews conference on the introduction of legislation on nuclear \ntransplants. There were many questions beyond what we had anticipated. \nI did want to have an opportunity to appear briefly in support of these \ntwo nominees who are from my state.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Cynthia M. Rufe\n\n  The nomination of Judge Cynthia Rufe comes to this floor after having \nbeen approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. She has an \nexcellent educational background: A bachelor's degree from Adelphi \nUniversity, a J.D. from the State University of New York. She has \nextensive experience in the private practice of law. She was in the \npublic defender's office for some 5 years. She has been solicitor in \nher home county, Bucks County, PA, and has been a judge on the State \nCourt of Common Pleas from 1994 to the present. She presides over the \nCriminal Court, Juvenile Court and Protection From Abuse cases.\n\n  Prior to her election to the position of judge in 1993, she \nmaintained law offices in Newtown, Pennsylvania practicing civil and \ncriminal litigation, family law and specializing in child abuse cases.\n  Before entering private practice in 1982, Judge Rufe served Bucks \nCounty as Deputy Public Defender, coordinating that office's Juvenile \nDivision.\n  She also served as Solicitor for the Bucks County Children and Youth \nSocial Services Agency for four years.\n  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has appointed Judge Rufe to sit on the \nAppelate Procedural Rules Committee. She also serves the Pennsylvania \nConference of State Trial Judges on their Judicial Education, Juvenile \nCourt and Corrections Committees.\n  In addition, she served on a Federal task force to improve the \nquality of mental health treatment and services for female inmates in \nthe Bucks County jail system.\n  Judge Rufe has been an active member of several community agencies \nrelated to the improvement of youth, families, and drug and alcohol \nissues, including serving as a member of the Board of Directors of \nYouth Services, Inc.; Organization to Prevent Teenage Suicide, Inc.; \nReaching-at-Problems, Inc. Group Home; and Prevention and \nRehabilitation for Youth and Development, Inc.\n  Judge Rufe has received countless awards from various women law \norganizations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Michael M. Baylson\n\n  Michael Baylson is a man I have known since 1965. He was one of the \nfirst people I appointed as an assistant district attorney when I was \nelected in 1965. I have known him intimately for the course of the past \n37 years. I can attest to his capability.\n  He is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, with both a \nBachelor of Science and a law degree. Beyond serving as an assistant \ndistrict attorney in my office, where he was chief of the homicide \ndivision, and he handled some of the most complicated criminal \nprosecutions known, he later served as a U.S. attorney from 1988 to \n1993. He has been a senior partner in the distinguished Philadelphia \nlaw firm of Duane, Morris & Heckscher, working on some very tough \nlitigation matters in the areas of commercial and securities litigation \nand antitrust law.\n\n  Mr. Baylson served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania from 1988 to 1993. He was heavily involved in the Weed \nand Seed Program.\n  From 1966 to 1969, he was an assistant district attorney in the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney's Office, where he served as chief of \nthe Narcotics and Homicide Divisions.\n  He is the chair of the Specialization Committee and past chair of the \nState Action Exemption and Noerr Doctrine Committee of the Antitrust \nLaw Section of the American Bar Association, and is a fellow of the \nAmerican Bar Foundation.\n  He has also been on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law \nSchool.\n  He received the United States Department of Treasury's U.S. Attorneys \naward for Distinction in Financial Management, 1993; Attorney General's \nSpecial Commendation Award, 1993; Inspector General's Prospective \nLeadership Award, U.S. Health and Human Services, 1992; and the \nDistinguished Service to Law Enforcement Award from the County and \nState Detectives Association of Pennsylvania, 1992.\n  Baylson has provided pro bono services to prisoners asserting civil \nrights violations and has represented defendants accused of crimes on a \npro bono basis.\n  Madam President, while my colleague from Vermont is still in the \nChamber, I want to make a comment or two about some discussions he and \nI have had, and which I have had with other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is my hope that we will be able to agree on a protocol of \nwhere we can come to an agreement in the Judiciary Committee, and \nreally in the full Senate, as to how we handle judicial nominations.\n  We have seen recurrent problems when we have a Republican President \nand a Senate controlled by the Democrats. When the shoe was on the \nother foot, we had a President who was a Democrat and the Senate was \ncontrolled by Republicans. Before that, we had a Republican President \nand the Senate was controlled by Democrats.\n  So that in my Senate tenure we have had three situations where the \nWhite House and the Senate were controlled by different parties.\n  When there is debate about what has happened and how long the \nnominations have taken, although I have been here and followed the \nsituation closely, I get lost in the statistics. I think the American \npeople do too.\n  I do believe there have been failures on both sides, by both parties. \nI think the time has come to move beyond recrimination and to try to \nestablish a protocol. Hopefully this protocol will provide for a \ncertain number of days after a nomination has been submitted to be \naccorded a hearing, so many days later for a markup in an executive \nsession, so many days later to be considered by the full Senate. Delays \ncould occur at the discretion of the chairman of the committee, after \nconsultation with the ranking member--not the concurrence of the \nranking member but the consultation--similarly with the\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nmajority leader, with consultation with the minority leader.\n  I wanted to make those comments because one might say it is hard for \nthe issue to disintegrate further, but I do see it disintegrating \nfurther. On May 9, we are going to have a one year anniversary of the \nsubmission of eight circuit judges, and I hope we do not have dueling \npress conferences. I hope we are able to work this out where we will \nhave rules and a protocol established, regardless of who controls what.\n  Again, I thank the Chair for sitting overtime and I thank my \ncolleague from Vermont for staying overtime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am always happy for the cooperation of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, and I do compliment him on the two \njudges who will be confirmed today, recommended by him, and his efforts \nto get a consensus for them. I am well aware we can have dueling press \nconferences.\n  I have mentioned a number of courts of appeals judges were heard out \nof order at the request of Republican Senators, and I am sure if some \nof those same Senators were then to speak of the fact that some of the \njudges, their own nominees especially, were heard ahead of others, that \nthey would see delicious irony in that.\n  I know we are supposed to recess. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     nomination of michael baylson\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nMr. Michael Baylson to the District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania. Mr. \nBaylson is another fine example of the qualified attorneys President \nBush has named to the federal bench, and I am convinced based on his \nrecord that he will make an outstanding addition to an already \nprestigious court.\n  Mr. Baylson earned his undergraduate degree from the University of \nPennsylvania's Wharton School. He then graduated from the University's \nLaw School. After working as a volunteer for the public defender in \nPhiladelphia, he joined the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office. My \ncolleagues will remember that my friend the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, was the Philadelphia \nDistrict Attorney at this time. Mr. Baylson was quickly promoted to \nsupervise that office's Narcotics Unit and then it Homicide Unit.\n  Mr. Baylson worked in private practice at the law firm of Duane \nMorris and Heckscher. Then, in 1988, he returned to public service as \nthe United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nThere, he became well-known for his aggressive drug prosecutions. Mr. \nBaylson also was a pioneer in developing the Violent Traffickers \nProject, a program that uses a different strategy than the traditional \ntactic of arresting smaller dealers and then ``flipping'' them in order \nto convict the leaders of a drug conspiracy.\n  After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Baylson returned to \nDuane Morris and Heckscher as a partner and has specialized in \nantitrust, federal securities, RICO and white collar crime matters.\n  Clearly, Mr. Baylson is a very talented attorney with a great deal of \nexperience. I have no doubt that he is an excellent choice to be a \njudge on the District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                  nomination of Judge Cynthia M. Rufe\n\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation of Judge \nCynthia Rufe to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Judge Rufe's nomination is yet another example of \nPresident Bush's effort to enhance our excellent and diverse federal \njudiciary. Judge Rufe has had a distinguished legal career. She is an \noutstanding Pennsylvania state judge who will only add to the \ndistinguished federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Rufe graduated with a B.A. in Political Science and Education \nfrom Adelphi University in 1970. After receiving her teacher's \ncertificate from Bloomsburg University in 1972 and teaching high school \nsocial studies, Judge Rufe graduated from SUNY-Buffalo Law School in \n1977.\n  After law school, and mindful of each attorney's responsibility to \n``serve the disadvantaged,'' she joined the Bucks County Public \nDefenders Office. In this role, her case-load ran the gamut from \nmisdemeanors to homicides. At the Public Defender's Office, Judge Rufe \ndeveloped an expertise in representing abused and neglected children.\n  As a result of that expertise, she created and led the Public \nDefender's Juvenile Division. Later, Judge Rufe rose to the level of \nDeputy Public Defender. In this position, she was responsible for \nmanaging the office's trial caseload.\n  In 1982, she left the Defender's Office to begin a private practice. \nJudge Rufe concentrated on litigation, especially criminal and juvenile \nlaw. Over the years, the Judge Rufe's practice expanded to include \ncases on employment, discrimination, personal injury, defamation, \ncontracts, adoptions, estates and family law.\n  But, during this period, she never forgot about her community, and \nshe served as Solicitor of the Bucks County Children and Youth Social \nServices Agency.\n  In 1994, Judge Rufe re-entered public life when she was elected to \nthe Bucks County Court of Common Pleas. For the last eight years, she \nhas developed a well-earned reputation for hard work and fairness.\n  It is a pleasure and a privilege to support Judge Rufe's nomination \nto the federal bench.\n\n\n                         judicial confirmations\n\n  Madam President, I would like to respond briefly to some comments \nmade earlier today on the topic of judicial confirmations. I had no \nintention of bringing up this topic today, but now I find myself with \nno choice but to set the record straight. I want to make one \nobservation and then two simple points.\n  Madam President, my observation is this: The American people want \nthis Senate to help--rather than hinder--President Bush. And that is \ntrue of every President. Everyone understands that we are living at a \ntime of great national importance. Our government is being put to a \ntest. President Bush is performing extraordinarily well, and he is \nleading our country and our military in the right direction to achieve \nprosperity and security for all Americans. The American people support \nPresident Bush and his administration, and they correctly believe that \nthe Senate should do the same.\n  But the people who follow the Judiciary Committee's record on \nreviewing and approving President Bush's judicial nominations are \nfrustrated--for good reason--with the way in which this body has \ntreated President Bush. They know that President Bush gave great care \nand attention to finding nominees who are extremely well-qualified, \nhighly talented legal thinkers who hold mainstream American values. \nThere is not an ideologue among them. To the contrary, President Bush's \npicks for the judiciary are all principled and fair people, from a \nvariety of backgrounds and experiences, who are committed to following \nprecedent, applying the law as it exists, and standing firm against \njudicial activism. President Bush should not be forced to divert any \nmore of his time and attention away from the war on terrorism and his \nmany domestic priorities in order to persuade this body to do what is \nright for the American people.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to make two points that directly \nrespond to the comments made earlier today.\n  Madam President, the current Senate leadership is not doing a better \njob this Congress than the Senate has done under other Presidents. I \nlistened as my colleague explained that, if looked at through the right \nlooking glass, or examined in the right subsection of the right time \nperiod of the right session of the right Congress, then the current \nnumbers are pretty impressive.\n  The most important measure of performance should be how we are \nhandling the most important courts: the Circuit Court of Appeals. Let's \ncompare the treatment of President Bush's first 11 circuit court \nnominees to the first 11 of previous presidents. President Reagan, the \nfirst President Bush and President Clinton all enjoyed a 100 percent \nconfirmation rate on their first 11 circuit court nominees, and all \nwere confirmed well within a year. President Reagan's first 11 were \nconfirmed in an average of 39 days, the first President Bush's first 11 \naveraged 88 days, and President Clinton's first 11--only 115 days. The \nlongest any of these individuals were held up in committee was 202 \ndays. In stark contrast to previous\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nPresidents, 8 of President Bush's first 11 nominations--made on May 9, \n2001, almost a year ago--are still pending in committee without so much \nas a hearing! That's nearly 365 days, and only 3 of the President's \nfirst 11 nominees are confirmed. Is this what the Democratic leadership \nconsiders a record-breaking pace? It may be record-breaking, all right, \nbut not the record they're talking about. They are confirming with the \nvelocity of molasses.\n  Now I heard my colleague suggest that some of the first 11 nominees \nmay have been superseded out of courtesy to Republican Senators who \nrequested some later-nominated judges to move first. Well, I know how \ndifficult it is to chair the committee, and such requests do come in. \nBut I would suggest to my friend that he do what I did for President \nClinton: consider more than one circuit nominee per hearing. That's \nwhat we did, under Republican leadership, no fewer than 10 times. Why \nnot two at a time?\n\n  Of course, the pace of confirming a President's first 11 nominees is \nnot the only measure by which the current leadership is falling short. \nMy colleague suggested that kudos should be awarded for bringing the \ncircuit court vacancy rate down to 29. Well, it was never that high at \nthe end of any Congress when Republicans controlled the Senate. And I \ncertainly don't recall that, during my chairmanship, any of our circuit \ncourts were facing the kind of crisis that is going on today in the 6th \nCircuit Court of Appeals, where the court is operating at half-staff \ndespite the fact that president Bush has nominated seven highly \nqualified people to serve on that court.\n  The fact is that, at the close of the 106th Congress, when I was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, there were only 67 vacancies in \nthe federal judiciary. In the space of one Democratic-controlled \ncongressional session last year, that number shot up to nearly 100, \nwhere it remains today. Under Republican leadership, the Senate \nconfirmed essentially the same number of judges for President Clinton--\n377--as it did for President Reagan--382--which proves bipartisan \nfairness--especially when you consider that President Reagan had six \nyears of his party controlling the Senate, and President Clinton had \nonly two.\n  So how did we go from 67 vacancies at the end of the Clinton \nadministration to nearly 100 today? There can be only one answer: The \ncurrent pace of hearings and confirmations is simply not keeping up \nwith the increase in vacancies. We are moving so slowly that we are \nbarely keeping up with natural attrition. President Bush nominated 66 \nhighly qualified individuals to fill judicial vacancies last year. But \nin the first 4 months of Democratic control of the Senate last year, \nonly 6 Federal judges were confirmed. At several hearings, the \nJudiciary Committee considered only one or two judges at a time. The \ncommittee voted on only 6 of 29 circuit court nominees in 2001, a rate \nof 21 percent, leaving 23 of them without any action at all.\n  This leads to my second point, which is that the current situation \nhas nothing whatsoever to do with ideology. I was surprised to hear my \nfriend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, address earlier today \nthe question of introducing ideology into the judicial confirmation \nprocess. Some of my Democrat colleagues have made no bones about the \nfact that this is exactly what they are seeking to do. In July, they \nhave even held hearings expressly on how to justify it. We saw what \nhappened to Judge Charles Pickering.\n  What is now occurring is far beyond the mere tug-of-war politics that \nunfortunately surrounds Senate judicial confirmation since Robert Bork. \nSome of my colleagues are out to effect a fundamental change in our \nconstitutional system, as they were instructed to do by noted liberal \nlaw professors at a retreat early last year. Rather than seeking to \ndetermine the judiciousness of a nominee and whether a nominee will be \nable to rule on the law or the Constitution without personal bias, they \nwant to guarantee that our judges all think in the same way, a way that \nis much further to the left of mainstream than most of President Bush's \nnominees.\n  In the judiciary that some would create, citizens will have to worry \nabout the personal politics of the judge to whom they come for justice \nunder the law. I strongly object to that result.\n  The legitimacy of our courts, and especially the Supreme Court, comes \nfrom much more than black robes and a high bench. It comes from the \npeople's belief that judges and justices will apply a judicial \nphilosophy without regard to personal politics or bias.\n\n  In conclusion, Madam President, it is time for this Senate to examine \nthe real situation in the Judiciary Committee, rather than listen to \nmore inventive ways of spinning it. We have lots of work to do. There \nare 90 vacancies in the federal judiciary--a vacancy rate of more than \n10.5 percent--and we have 50 nominees pending, including 4 nominees for \nthe Court of Federal Claims. Nineteen of the pending nominees are for \ncircuit court positions, yet the Senate has confirmed only nine circuit \njudges this Congress. This is despite a crisis of 29 vacancies pending \nin the circuit courts nationwide--virtually the same number of \nvacancies pending when the Democrats took control of the Senate in June \nof last year.\n  Madam President, the American people are disappointed in this \nprocess. They want the Senate to help--not hinder--President Bush. I \nurge my friends across the aisle to focus on this situation, to step up \nthe pace of hearings and votes, and to do what's right for the country.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the trade \npromotion authority legislation that is before the Senate.\n  America has the most productive, creative workforce in the world. Our \nindustries are diverse. Our products are second to none. Now we must \nexpand our reach to bring more of these goods and services to the \nglobal marketplace by passing trade promotion authority legislation.\n  Trade promotion authority had been used since President Ford's \nadministration to implement trade agreements until it lapsed in 1994. \nThe President has not had this trade promotion authority since 1994. If \nAmerica is going to increase trade opportunities around the world, \nCongress needs to pass this legislation so the President has the \nability to negotiate trade agreements with the knowledge that, while \nCongress retains its right to approve or reject a treaty, it will not \ntry to amend or delay it.\n  Without this legislation, foreign governments may not be willing to \nsit at the negotiation table with the United States, knowing that they \nmay put all of this time into a negotiation that would then be delayed \nor changed by Congress.\n  Ninety-six percent of the world's consumers live outside of the \nUnited States, representing a vast potential market for American \nexports. Unfortunately, other countries are moving forward in promoting \ntrade while we are standing on the sidelines. While we delay, other \ncountries are entering into agreements that exclude us. Our competitors \nin Europe, Asia, and Latin America have sealed more than 130 free trade \ncompacts. Yet we are party to only three--Jordan, Israel, and NAFTA \nwith Mexico and Canada. Again, there are 130 free trade agreements in \nthe world and the United States is a party to only 3 of those.\n  A lack of free trade agreements puts American exporters at a \nsignificant disadvantage. For example, a $180,000 tractor made in \nAmerica and shipped to Chile incurs about $15,000 in tariffs and duties \nupon arrival. That same tractor would face only $3,700 in tariffs if it \nwere made in Brazil, and there would be none if it were made in Canada.\n  American businesses, farmers, and ranchers are the best, but they \nshould not have to compete with this kind of disparity. Our inability \nto negotiate agreements with foreign countries is hurting U.S. industry \nand limiting economic growth. The TPA offers the United States a chance \nto reclaim momentum in the global economy by adding foreign markets and \nexpanding our opportunity for American producers and workers.\n  For 60 years, Presidents and members of both parties in Congress have \nworked together to open markets around the world. Now, as we launch the \nnext round of global trade negotiations, close cooperation is critical. \nIn Texas, we have experienced the benefits of free trade as a result of \nNAFTA. Since the agreement was implemented in January 1994, Texas \nexports have grown much faster than the overall U.S. exports of goods. \nTexas merchandise exports in 2000 went to more than 200 foreign \nmarkets, totaling $69 billion--an increase of more than 22 percent \nsince 1997.\n  On the agricultural front, Texas ranks third among the 50 States in \nexports, with an estimated $3.3 billion in sales in foreign markets in \n2000. We are leading exporters of beef, poultry, feed grain, and wheat. \nNAFTA has helped us secure the No. 1 cotton exporting State status. \nSince the agreement took effect, we have increased cotton exports to \nMexico from 558,000 bales to 1.5 million bales in 2000.\n  Some people fear that trade will hurt the United States because they \nbelieve we will end up lowering barriers more than our trading \npartners. This is a legitimate question, but the fact is that the \nUnited States is already generally very low in barriers compared to our \ntrading partners. For example, the average U.S. tariff on machinery \nimports is 1.2 percent, while foreign tariffs on U.S.-made machinery in \ncountries such as Indonesia, India, Argentina, and Brazil are 30 times \nhigher. By negotiating trade agreements, such as Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas, the benefits we will receive by lowering those high barriers \nto our goods and services far outweigh the effect of lowering our very \nsmall tariffs.\n  Another fear is the extent to which lowering barriers to the U.S. \nmarket will cause job losses as companies move manufacturing overseas. \nThis could happen, but we do have superior quality and work ethic--that \nis undeniable. Beyond that, however, we must consider the extent to \nwhich we are already losing jobs to overseas plants because of the high \nbarriers to our goods.\n\n  Some countries try to attract manufacturing jobs by raising barriers \nto imports. This forces companies that would otherwise have production \nfacilities in the United States and then export their products to build \nplants in\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nthese foreign countries so they get around the tariffs. For example, \nMars, Inc., the candy and pet food manufacturer, has their largest \nproduction facility in Waco, TX. They and other U.S. confectionary \nmakers face an average of 25 percent in tariffs on confectionary candy \nexports and candy products to the European Union, and they have a 55-\npercent tariff on these goods to India. But the United States has \nvirtually no tariffs on confectionary products. The employees of \ndomestic candy makers would be much more secure if the President were \nable to negotiate a trade agreement that lowered these barriers \noverseas so they were not penalized for having U.S.-based \nmanufacturing.\n  In addition to trade promotion authority, we will be debating related \ntrade bills over the next few weeks. The Andean Trade Preference Act, \nwhich is the base bill we are debating today, seeks to help our \ncounternarcotics efforts by providing people of the Andean region--\nSouth America--with economic opportunity other than drug trade. This \nbill can help U.S. develop overseas markets. If the beneficiary \ncountries are able to use their exports to the United States to develop \na healthier economy, it will create market opportunities for U.S. \nexporters.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act has been successful in this respect. \nSince it went into effect in 1991, the four Andean countries have \nexperienced $3 billion in new output and $1.7 billion in new exports. \nThis has led to the creation of 140,000 legitimate jobs in this region, \nproviding employment alternatives to people who might otherwise get \ninvolved in the drug trade.\n  Similarly, by extending the General System of Preferences, which \nprovides duty-free status to certain items from developing countries, \nwe can help to develop healthier economies that will inevitably demand \nU.S. products.\n  The other bill we are addressing during this debate is Trade \nAdjustment Assistance. This is a good program that would help those who \nlose their jobs because of trade. But we must also make sure this is \nnot a program that is going to be so expensive and a program that \ndiscriminates among certain unemployed workers versus other unemployed \nworkers versus employed workers. I think we might be taking a big \nchance with that part of the bill--not being as fully vetted and \nresearched as the two parts that are trade promotion and Andean \npreference. These are two trade promotion acts that will have direct \nbenefits to the workers and the people of America. It will also help \nthe consumers of America get the lowest prices for goods that are \nimported without those artificial barriers.\n  So in this time of increased tension in many parts of the world, \nAmerican leadership on trade is more important than ever. Giving \nPresident Bush a strong hand to negotiate, helping other countries to \nuse the benefits of trade to develop legitimate businesses and economic \ngrowth are what we are addressing in the Senate with this trade \npackage. Passing this legislation will ensure the continued growth of \nour economy and make sure that we are exporting our greatest ideals to \nthe world--freedom, free enterprise, and democracy.\n  We must give the President this trade promotion authority so we will \nnot be left behind. If America is only a party to 3 trade agreements \nout of 130, you know that other relationships are forming that keep \nAmerica out.\n  We made a very good start with NAFTA. We have seen the benefits of \nNAFTA, that free trade agreement. Now we must extend NAFTA to South \nAmerica with the Andean nations with which we have had trade relations. \nWe need to come back and put in place trade with those countries \nwithout those barriers that have been put forward in the last year. We \nneed to have good relations all over the world.\n  I think it is clear, from what is happening in the world and the lack \nof understanding in many parts of the world what freedom and free \nenterprise are, that we should be the leaders in opening free trade \nmarkets under an agreement that provides a level playing field for our \nworkers and the workers of a foreign country. We should be the leaders, \nnot the followers; not the people who are being dragged kicking and \nscreaming into the new century.\n  We need free and fair trade. We can only get it by negotiating trade \nagreements and making sure there is a level playing field. If we have \nno agreements, we can have small barriers, they can have big barriers, \nand that is not a level playing field. We want a level playing field. \nTrade promotion authority and the Andean Preference Act will give us \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Carper]. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before \nspeaking on the fast track bill, I be allowed to speak on the Middle \nEast, and I will take about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For colleagues who are watching, because I know there \nare a lot of people who want to speak, I probably will not take a full \nhour on my statement on fast track. I will try to proceed \nexpeditiously, but first of all I do want to speak on the Middle East \nbecause I do not think we can ignore what is happening in the world. It \nhas such a critical and crucial impact on our lives and our children's \nlives and our grandchildren's lives.\n\n\n                      search for middle east peace\n\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I had enormous hopes for a \npermanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians before the collapse \nof the Oslo-Camp David peace process two years ago. Yet recently, as we \nall know, the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated \ndramatically, and what we have witnessed there is heart-breaking.\n  As I speak today, Palestinian gunmen remain holed up in the Church of \nNativity, Israeli tanks are present in the West Bank, and Israeli and \nPalestinian civilians, seized by anxiety, fear stepping into the street \nin order to go about their daily lives. Across the region and in this \ncountry too, people are grieving for innocent Israelis and Palestinians \nwho have lost their lives.\n  While there are new reports of clashes in Hebron, there is some \npositive news this morning. The month-long standoff at the Ramallah \ncompound may be ending as U.S. and British security experts are \nexpected to arrive today in the region to implement a U.S.-brokered \nplan. There are also signs of progress in Bethlehem, where there are \nnews reports that many civilians not wanted by Israel will leave the \nchurch today.\n  Even in this time of terrible violence, however, we cannot lose hope, \nfor the sake of Israelis and Palestinians everywhere who yearn for \npeace--and especially for their children, and the generations to \nfollow. For them, we must continue to seek a pathway to peace.\n  To that end, Secretary Powell's mission to the region earlier this \nmonth was an important step. While a cease-fire was not achieved, the \nsituation is less dangerous now than it might have been, without active \nU.S. engagement and Powell's vigorous diplomatic efforts. Events were \nspinning out of control earlier, especially on the border of Lebanon. \nBut, the tense border situation seems to have cooled a bit, even if \nmomentarily, due at least in part to Secretary Powell's work with the \nSyrians.\n  The real test, however, is whether the administration will stay \nengaged. It has finally left the side-lines and is onto the playing \nfield of Middle East diplomacy, and it must stay in the game. Israeli \nofficials say that conditions might worsen in the days to come, that \nIsrael may witness a rash of suicide bombings as it pulls its forces \nback. If the administration, facing such an escalation of violence in \nthe region, withdraws, as it has before, history will judge us harshly. \nIf it continues to devote its time, energy and prestige to achieving \nthe goals Mr. Bush laid out earlier this month, then the violence might \nbe contained, and we may see progress. Engagement remains the only \nintelligent option for our country now.\n  We must pursue a courageous approach which seeks both to meet the \ncritical need of the Israeli people to be free from terrorism and \nviolence, and acknowledges the legitimate aspirations of the \nPalestinian people for their own state, a state which is economically \nand politically viable. Even in this horrific time, we must not lose \nsight of what should be our ultimate goal: Israel and a new Palestinian \nstate living side-by-side, in peace, with secure borders.\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\n  For many, the last two years have shattered confidence in any peace \nprocess. It has raised questions in some people's minds about whether \nPalestinians and Israelis can ever really live and work together, \nsupporting each other's aspirations for peace, prosperity and security.\n  We must do our best to work with the parties to restore calm, to end \nthe bloodshed, and to get back to a political process that might \naddress the underlying causes of this conflict.\n  I believe many of the elements of the path back to peace are known:\n  First, Palestinian leaders need to renew their severely damaged \ncredibility as legitimate diplomatic partners by condemning \nterrorism and doing all in their power to combat it. Chairman Arafat \nhas not consistently rejected or confronted terrorists; indeed if the \nevidence gather by the IDF is to be believed, he may have actually \nsupported them. He cannot play both sides any longer, but must work to \nend terror and the sickening wave of suicide bombings Israel has \nsuffered.\n\n  There must also be an end to the culture of violence and the culture \nof incitement in Arab media, in schools and elsewhere, which Arab and \nPalestinian leadership have allowed to go unchecked too long. \nThroughout the region, anti-Israel incitement is widespread and \ninsidious: government-controlled press, television programs and school \ntextbooks regularly demonize Israelis with vile language and images. \nArab states must help put an end to this, as it badly damages all the \nparties and powerfully undermines the cause of the Palestinian people \nand their national aspirations.\n  President Bush and the international community have called on Israel \nto end its incursion into the West Bank, and Israel has begun a \nwithdrawal, however partial and tentative. As President Bush stated, \nwhen Israel moves back, responsible Palestinian leaders and Israel's \nArab neighbors must step forward, and demonstrate that they are working \nto establish peace: ``the choice and the burden will be theirs.'' To \nthat end, the Palestinian leadership must commit to resuming security \ncooperation with Israel, and the United States and the international \ncommunity must assist the Palestinians in reconstituting an effective \nsecurity mechanism so they can do so.\n  Second, Israel must show a respect for and concern about the human \nrights and dignity of the Palestinian people who are now and will \ncontinue to be their neighbors. It is critically important to \ndistinguish between the terrorists and ordinary, innocent Palestinians \nwho are trying to provide for their families and live an otherwise \nnormal existence. Palestinians must no longer be subjected to the \ndaily, often humiliating reminders that they lack basic freedom and \ncontrol over their lives.\n  Third, the United States and the international community must begin \nimmediately the urgent task of rebuilding so that ordinary Palestinians \ncan resume a normal existence. The Palestinian economy has been \nbattered and the infrastructure of the Palestinian Authority badly \ndamaged. Last week, the World Bank identified a $2 billion need, \nestimating that the direct physical destruction of the public \ninfrastructure alone is $300 million, and that at least 75 percent of \nthe Palestinian workforce is now idle. At the same time, Israel is \nfacing major economic challenges, with a serious recession and currency \ndropping to a new low recently. The international community and \nIsrael's Arab neighbors must contribute to serious rehabilitation and \neconomic development efforts.\n  Consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions, the United \nNations fact-finding team must be allowed to visit the territories to \nexamine what actually happened in the Jenin Refugee Camp. As Secretary \nPowell has declared, this is in the best interests of all concerned, \nespecially in the best interests of the Israelis, to end speculation \nand have a full, accurate, public accounting of what actually occurred \nthere. As soon as details on the composition of the team is resolved \nand the scope of its mission agreed upon, it must be allowed access to \nconduct its work.\n  Fourth, I believe there is no military solution to this conflict. The \nonly path to a just and durable resolution is through negotiation. And \nthere will be no lasting peace or regional stability without a strong \nand secure Israel, which is why the United States must maintain its \ncommitment to preserving Israel's strength, and providing Israel \nsubstantial assistance.\n  I believe the United State must now push forward with specific and \nconcrete ideas for rebuilding the shattered trust between the parties, \nbringing an end to the violence, and offering a new path back to the \nroad of peace. The points of departure for such a plan are already in \nplace--the UN Resolutions 242 and 338 and the earlier settlement \nnegotiations conducted at Taba, Egypt in January 2001. The recent Arab \nLeague support of the Saudi proposal for normalization of relations \nbetween Israel and Arab nations is key. It acknowledges Israel's right \nto exist, and raises hope of a constructive Arab involvement in the \nsearch for peace. The United States should also consider supporting, \nwith the consent of both parties, some kind of international observer \nforce to enhance security for both sides. NATO might choose to take \npart in any such deployment, given Europe's continuing interest in \ncontaining the Middle East crisis. This could be followed, again with \nthe agreement of all parties, with an international peace keeping \nforce, if such a force could be helpful.\n  We cannot afford to dither. The administration should move decisively \nto convene a broad international conference loosely based on the Madrid \nconference of 1991, at which the exchange of land for peace became the \nbasis for negotiation. The goals of the conference should be spelled \nout clearly: putting the breaks on the violence and speeding \nnegotiations for a two-state solution.\n  Both sides will need to make painful choices if there is to be a just \nand stable peace. There must be a recognition of the tragic Palestinian \nrefugee experience, and also an understanding that not all Palestinians \nrefugees will be able to return to Israel. Many observers believe that \nthe parties will eventually need to agree on a formula which would \nallow some refugees to return to Israel, and then provide for \nresettlement, and financial compensation for the remainder. And \nconsistent with the Mitchell plan, Israeli settlement expansion in the \noccupied territories will have to be addressed and, as many observers \nhave noted, some settlements may need to be dismantled. All of this \nshould be negotiated by the parties themselves.\n  Despite the rage and raw feelings in the region now, most Israelis \nand most Palestinians crave a peaceful resolution to this conflict. \nThis hunger for peace, and a sustained and vigorous engagement by the \nUnited States, are our best hope for achieving it.\n\n\n                              Andean Trade\n\n  Mr. President, I debate this motion to proceed to fast track, the \nfast-track trade mechanism now known as the trade promotion authority. \nI oppose it on a lot of grounds.\n  First, I oppose the bill because of a principled opposition to the \nfast-track mechanism. I am not sure that for me this principle would in \nall cases be absolute and decisive, but I do lean against any fast-\ntrack mechanism for fundamental reasons. Second, I oppose the bill \nbased on my judgement in advance of the unlikelihood of seeing \nnegotiated trade agreements that I will be able to support on behalf of \nthe people of Minnesota and of the nation. I base that judgement on the \nnegative consequences of past trade agreements, the track-record of \nthis administration so far, and on the text of the Trade Promotion \nAuthority Act, which I believe is fundamentally flawed in its approach. \nFinally, I oppose moving to the fast-track bill because I believe it is \nirresponsible to discuss it before first addressing the urgent needs of \nworkers in this nation.\n  Let me begin with my first reason for opposing the fast-track bill. I \nam inclined to oppose fast-track on general principles of democracy and \nrepresentative accountability alone. Fast track procedures shorten \nnecessary congressional debate and eliminate the option of amendments \nby elected and accountable representatives of the public. Under Article \nI, Section 8 of the Constitution, it is not the President but Congress \nthat shall ``regulate commerce with foreign nations'' and I am not \nwilling to shirk my responsibility to make fair trade policy by giving \nthe President authority to determine trade\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\npolicies without meaningful checks from Congress.\n  It is worth observing at the outset that when we say we are \nconsidering trade agreements under fast track procedures, the measures \nwe are talking about generally entail the substantial changing of \ndomestic laws. We are talking about packages of legislative changes \nthat are the implementing bills for what the President and his \nrepresentatives have negotiated with trading partners. We are not only \ndiscussing tariff schedules, important as those can be. We are talking \nabout the alteration of domestic law. It is difficult to imagine good \nenough reasons to surrender our rights as Senators to unlimited debate \non amendment of those measures before we have even seen them.\n  This bill, HR 3005, which the motion to proceed could bring before us \nby the end of the week if it is successful, would lock in fast-track \nrules now for debates and votes we will have later. By later, I mean at \nwhatever point we consider implementing legislation for several of the \ntrade agreements which the Administration is now negotiating such as an \nagreement entered into under the auspices of the World Trade \nOrganization, agreements with Chile and Singapore, and an agreement \nestablishing a Free Trade of the Americas or which it might negotiate \nunder this authority between now and 2005. That is the duration of the \nbill's provisions if it is enacted. In other words, we are deciding now \nwhether to establish special and highly restrictive rules which will \ngovern our debate and votes later on implementing bills for agreements \nwhose contents we will not know until that time.\n  That is the meaning of fast-track legislation. I wonder how many \nAmericans are aware that the Senate might be willing to give away that \nmuch authority in the making of trade policy. If we pass this fast-\ntrack legislation, whatever agreement is negotiated and the changes in \nU.S. law that would be required in order for the United States to \ncomply with it, will be considered automatically here in the Senate \nonce that agreement is reached. This will take place on an expedited \nschedule, with no amendments, and with a limited number of hours of \ndebate. Just one up-or-down vote on a giant bill changing numerous U.S. \nlaws, with no amendments and limited debate. I am sorry to say that \nbased on my experience, many of us in this body will probably be only \npartially aware of what is actually contained in such implementing \nbills. But in any case, even if we know every provision, we will not \nhave the opportunity to change a single one.\n  During my time here in the U.S. Senate, I have consistently opposed \nthe granting of fast-track authority for trade agreements. I opposed it \nfor NAFTA. I opposed it for creation of the WTO. I have yet to be \nconvinced of the need for any fast-track authority to achieve \nbeneficial trade agreements. The record of the previous Administration \nappears to reinforce this conviction. During the 1990s we entered into \nnearly 200 international commercial agreements without fast-track, \nincluding the Caribbean Basin Initiative and agreements with sub-\nSaharan Africa, Jordan and Vietnam. I should repeat that nearly 200 \ntrade agreements, and only two of those utilized fast track procedures. \nLast November, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said that \nfast-track was a tool the administration could not live without. He \nsaid: ``If I'm pressing my counterpart to go to his or bottom line, he \nor she is going to balk if they feel that Congress has the ability to \nre-open the deal. My counterparts fear negotiating once with the \nadministration and then a second time with Congress.''\n  Mr. President, if the previous Administration could so readily reach \ntrade agreements without the benefit of fast-track, then I question the \nneed to impose such procedures, which are inherently undemocratic. I \nalso question what Mr. Zoellick is getting at. I would hope he \nunderstands that our system of government has three branches. That our \nsystem is based on checks and balances. And I would hope that in the \nnations with which we are negotiating trade agreements, that we are \nalso promoting an agenda committed to democratic principles. Because \nwhen we talk about the fast-track mechanism, that is not the case. They \nshorten necessary debate. They eliminate the chance for amendment by \nelected and accountable representatives. They exclude meaningful \nparticipation in the legislative process by numerous groups which \nnormally have at least some access to it.\n\n  For example, free trade is supposed to be good for the consumers. But \nhow often do representatives of consumer organizations help to decide \nour negotiating goals? How many consumers are on the panels which \nadvise negotiators? Corporations in various sectors help decide what \nour goals are, which is appropriate. But why not consumers? Consumers \nmight argue that open trade is good; it can help bring higher quality \ngoods and services at lower prices. But consumers might also point out \nthat there need to be rules in an open trading system enforceable rules \nagainst downward harmonization of environmental and food-safety \nstandards, enforceable rules against child labor, enforceable rules \nagainst the systematic violation of labor and human rights. These are \nnot enforceable objectives of negotiators under this fast track bill. \nIn fact, as negotiating objectives, they need not even be achieved for \na trade agreement to come before the Senate and receive fast-track \nconsideration. But they probably would be enforceable if we had a more \ndemocratic process for negotiating and considering trade agreements. \nAnd if the objectives were not achieved in the agreements, consumer \nadvocates could find a member of the Senate willing to offer an \namendment to change the proposal. But not under fast track.\n  I favor open trade. Open trade can contribute significantly to the \nexpansion of wealth an opportunity. It can encourage innovation and \nimprove productivity. It can deliver high quality goods and services to \nmany consumers at better prices. Negotiated properly, trade agreements \ncan help bring these benefits to all trading partners in fair way. \nHowever, I remain unconvinced of the need for a fast-track procedure in \norder for a president to achieve beneficial trade agreements.\n  Fast-track is not about politics. It is not be about providing the \nauthority to a President whose trade policy we support, and not to one \nwe do not. Fast track is about our responsibility as legislators to do \nour part to ensure fair trade in the global economy. Of course the \nWhite House should conduct trade negotiations. But there is no reason \nto give the White House autocratic power to do so. If a trade agreement \ncannot withstand the scrutiny of our democratic process, then it does \nnot deserve to be enacted.\n  My second reason for opposing the motion to proceed to this bill is \nthat I do not have confidence that the specific trade agreements that \nare likely to be negotiated with this fast-track authority would \nachieve an improvement in the standard of living and quality of life \nfor a majority of Americans. Nor do I believe that such trade \nagreements would be likely to improve the lives of the majority of the \npopulations of other countries, the countries with whom we trade. \nTherefore, I do not believe I am likely to support the agreements, or \ntheir implementing legislation. Why would I give up my right in advance \nto amend bills which I do not think I will be able to support?\n  We have had excellent debates over the nation's trade policy in \nrecent years. We had a good debate over the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade, which ultimately led to the creation of the WTO, over permanent \nnormal trade relations with China, and more recently over trade and \ntrade remedies regarding the steel industry. I would like to take a \nsecond to talk in particular about NAFTA and the WTO implementing \nlegislation. I voted against the implementing legislation for those \nagreements because I believed those bills did not take this country in \nthe right direction in trade policy. The results of those agreements \nhave largely reinforced my view. I continue to regret that I did not \nhave more opportunity to change those major pieces of legislation. I \nbelieve they have done us great harm.\n  I did not oppose NAFTA and the WTO because I am a protectionist. I am \nnot. I don't have the slightest interest in building walls at our \nborders to keep out goods and services. Nor do I fear fair competition \nfrom workers and companies operating in other countries. I am not \nafraid of our neighbors.\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nI don't fear other countries, nor their peoples. I am in favor of open \ntrade, and I believe the President should negotiate trade agreements \nwhich lead generally to more open markets, here and abroad.\n  Indeed, I am very aware of the benefits of trade for the economy of \nMinnesota. I am told about them constantly. We have an extremely \ninternational-minded community of corporations, small businesses, \nworking people and farmers in our state, and we have done relatively \nwell in the international economy in recent years. Minnesota has lost \nsome jobs to trade, as have most states. But we also benefit from \ntrade. We benefit from both exports and imports. Exports create jobs, \nas we all know. But imports are not necessarily a bad thing either. \nThey provide needed competition for consumers, and they also push our \ndomestic companies to become better, to be as productive and efficient \nas they can be. Open trade can contribute significantly to the \nexpansion of wealth and opportunity, and it tends to reward innovation \nand productivity. It can deliver higher quality goods and services at \nbetter prices. Negotiated properly, trade agreements can help bring all \nthese benefits to all trading partners in a fair way.\n  My position is merely that Congress should exercise its proper role \nin regulating trade, which is what trade agreements do, so that the \nrules of international trade reflect American values. That is how \nAmerican can lead in the world. It is how America should lead in the \nworld.\n\n  What are American values when it comes to trade? We believe in \ngenerally open markets at home and abroad. But we also believe there is \na legitimate governmental role in the protection and maintenance of \ncertain fundamental standards when it comes to labor rights. There are \ncertain fundamental standards when it comes to the environment. \nStandards when it comes to food safety and other consumer protections. \nFundamental standards when it comes to democracy.\n  The question is how to pursue these values when we are negotiating \ntrade agreements. The Bush administration believes that commercial \nproperty rights are primary in trade agreements, and should be \nenforceable with trade sanctions, and that environmental and labor \nrights are secondary. A majority of the Senate appears to agree. I do \nnot. I don't believe most Americans agree with the President and the \nmajority of the Senate on this question. I believe, and I believe that \nmost Americans believe, that fundamental standard of living and \nquality-of-life issues are exactly what trade policy should be about. \nThat is why strong and enforceable labor rights, environmental, \nconsumer, and human rights protections must be included in all trade \nagreements, and as principle objectives in all trade negotiations. If \ntrade agreements do not help to uphold democracy and respect for human \nrights, then they are deficient. That is my position. These should be \nthe pillars of American leadership in the world.\n  At the same time we are told that America must lead on the issue of \ntrade, we are also told that if we do not negotiate trade agreements, \neven ones which do not live up to our principles, then other countries \nwill do so with each other in our absence. We will be left out. What a \ncontradiction. We must lead, but we must do so by weakening our values. \nBy leaving protection of workers rights out of the agreements we \nnegotiate. By surrendering our principled linkage of human rights \nconcerns to trade policy. Are we saying that when it comes down to it, \nmoney is what basically matters? Is that how we should lead the world? \nNot in my view.\n  Our trade policy should seek to create fair trading arrangements \nwhich lift up standards and people in all nations. It should foster \ncompetition based on productivity, quality and rising living standards, \nnot competition based on exploitation and a race to the bottom. \nProtection of basic labor rights, environmental, and health and safety \nstandards are just as important, and just as valid, as any other \ncommercial or economic objectives sought by U.S. negotiators in trade \nagreements. We need to be encouraging good corporate citizenship, not \nthe flight of capital and decimation of good-paying U.S. jobs. We ought \nnot be pitting workers in Bombay against workers in Baltimore, making \nthem compete against one another to get a decent living. Giving them \nultimatums to accept an unlivable wage, or else. It is our \nresponsibility in trade agreements to make the global trading system \nfair and workable.\n  It is the role of national governments to establish rules within \nwhich companies and countries trade. That is what trade agreements do. \nThey set strict rules. If a country does not enforce respect for \npatents, trade sanctions can be invoked. If a country allows violations \nof commercial rules, trade sanctions can be invoked. You can bet that \nU.S. companies get right in the face of our negotiators to make sure \nthat the rules in these agreements which protect their interests are \niron clad and will be strictly enforced. Of course it is one of the \ngoals of trade agreements to advance the interests of U.S. employers. \nBut we are elected to help ensure that those agreements allows trade to \nbenefit the interests of a majority of Americans, not only those with \nsignificant commercial interests abroad. I would go further and say \nthat we also even have an interest in advancing the interest of a \nmajority of people in other countries. Development abroad means more \ndemand for products and services that we produce.\n  I believe our trade policy can achieve those goals. I wish that we \nwould more often pursue them fully and in a balanced way. Our current \ntrade policy is deeply skewed towards large corporate interests. That \nview is based on our experience with recent trade agreements. And \nunfortunately, this bill does little to require our negotiators to do \nbetter with new ones.\n  The negative effects of NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, and the \nWTO, created in 1995, demonstrate the harm in failure to negotiate \nimportant safeguards in trade agreements. NAFTA's damaging results have \nbeen documented by a range of reliable observers. They include loss of \njobs, suppression of wages, and attacks upon and weakening of \nenvironmental and health and safety laws. Fast-track promoters want \nthis authority to make it easier to extend NAFTA throughout the \nhemisphere in a proposed Free Trade of the Americas agreement and to \nexpand the WTO in a new round of multilateral negotiation. If we repeat \nour past failure to include adequate labor, environmental, and health \nand safety provisions in new agreements, we only condemn ourselves to \nseeing some of NAFTA and other trade arrangements worst consequences \nagain.\n  What have some of those consequence been? Let me draw from a report \nissued by the respected Economic Policy Institute. The report was \nissued in April of last year and is titled: ``NAFTA at Seven: Its \nImpact on Workers in all Three Nations.'' E.P.I's study examined the \neffects of NAFTA seven years after it implementation and concluded that \nin the United States: ``NAFTA eliminated some 766,000 actual and \npotential U.S. jobs between 1994 and 2000 because of the rapid growth \nin the U.S. export deficit with Mexico and Canada.'' Minnesota, \naccording to the report, lost about 13,200 jobs due to the NAFTA \nrelated trade deficit. The report went on to say that in the U.S. \n``NAFTA has contributed to rising income inequality, suppressed real \nwages for production workers, weakened collective bargaining powers and \nability to organize unions, and reduced fringe benefits.'' A second \nreport released last October argues that when you look at the combined \nNAFTA and WTO trade-related job losses between 1994-2000, that number \nis over three million. According to the report, Minnesota lost nearly \n50,000 jobs. E.P.I also estimates that 5 to 15 percent of the decline \nin real median wages can be explained by the increase in trade.\n\n  NAFTA also has not lived up to promises regarding the environment or \ndomestic areas such as food safety. According to reports released by \nPublic Citizen, since the implementation of NAFTA, U.S. food imports \nhave skyrocketed, while U.S. inspections of imported food have declined \nsignificantly. Public Citizen notes that imports of Mexican crops \ndocumented by the U.S. government to be at high risk of pesticide \ncontamination have dramatically increased under NAFTA, while inspection \nhas decreased. It argues that U.S. border inspectors have simply\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nbeen overwhelmed by the large volume of food imports entering the \ncountry from Mexico. In a report from September titled: ``NAFTA Chapter \n11 Investor-to-State Cases: Bankrupting Democracy,'' Public Citizen \ndocuments the frontal assault on American law by foreign investors \nusing rights and privileges given to them in the NAFTA agreement. It \nstates that ``since the agreements enactment, corporate investors in \nall three NAFTA countries have used these new rights to challenge as \nNAFTA violations a variety of national, state and local environmental \nand public health policies, domestic judicial decisions, a federal \nprocurement law and even a government's provision of a parcel delivery \nservices.''\n  Mr. President, our experience with NAFTA cannot be dismissed. It has \ncontributed to a significant number of job losses and the suppression \nof real wages for production workers, who make up 70 percent of the \nworkforce. Real wages have gone down in Mexico, too, despite the fact \nthat some workers are performing high-skill, high-productivity labor. \nOur trade balance has dramatically worsened with respect to Mexico. And \na number of U.S. firms not only have used the threat of relocating to \nMexico to hold down wages, but some have even closed part of all of a \nplant in response to union organizing or bargaining. Violations of \nfundamental democratic principles, as well as of basic human and labor \nrights, continue to occur regularly in Mexico. And NAFTA's side \nagreement has not significantly improved Mexico's environment, or that \nof the U.S. Mexico border region.\n  NAFTA is a bad agreement. But I must also note briefly the tremendous \nweakness of this fast-track bill itself. The bill reported by the \nFinance Committee requires only that trading partners enforce existing \nlabor and environmental laws. Nowhere in this bill does it state that \nparties must strive to ensure that their labor and environmental laws \nmeet international standards. Nowhere in this bill do we demand that \ncountries make progress in protecting the rights of workers and the \nenvironment. This is unacceptable. Have we learned nothing? Shouldn't \nwe, at a minimum, require that countries try to do better?\n  The bill requires only that a country enforce its own laws as they \nstand today, and to add insult to injury, it has a loophole that allows \ncountries to lower labor and environmental standards with impunity. It \nallows for strong enforcement of the provisions on intellectual \nproperty and other commercial rights, but then provides no adequate \nenforcement for violations of the labor and environmental provisions. \nIn the real world, the effect of weak labor standards coupled with no \nenforcement mechanism means that while a U.S. company could easily \nbring a case against a country for not enforcing laws on copyright \nprotection, that same country could fail to enforce minimum wage laws \nor even lower the minimum wage, and neither the U.S., nor a worker who \nis affected, could bring a case for violation of the trade agreement. I \nbelieve this provision shows exactly whose interests this bill is meant \nto benefit, and it's not the working man.\n  And unfortunately, the drafters have not learned from the mistakes of \nthe NAFTA agreement when it comes to investor lawsuits. Just like under \nNAFTA, this bill does not forbid investor lawsuits that challenge \ndomestic laws on the grounds of expropriation--expropriation that is \nnot even limited to the long standing legal precedent that it must \ninvolve more than just a diminution in value or loss of profits. Today, \nas we debate the motion to proceed, a lawsuit is underway between a \nCanadian company and the U.S. government dealing with this very issue. \nUnder NAFTA, the Canadian company Methanex has sued the U.S. government \nfor $970 million in future profits due to California's banning of the \nchemical MTBE, which Methanex produces. Small leaks of MTBE from \nstorage tanks, pipeline accidents, and car accidents were found to have \ncontaminated 30 public drinking water systems in California. California \nbanned the chemical on safety grounds and now we, the American people, \nare supposed to re-imburse the company that made the chemical for their \nlost profits? Absolutely not.\n  In 2000, another Canadian company, ADF Group Inc., filed a complaint \nusing NAFTA's Chapter 11 on investment to challenge the federal \nrequirement that U.S.-made steel be used in all federally funded \nhighway projects. The case both challenges federal procurement policies \nand attacks a part of U.S. law that directly benefits American workers. \nRegardless of the outcome of this case, the fact that a private company \ncould use NAFTA to challenge a popular domestic law that the U.S. has \nroutinely tried to exempt from trade agreements, should trouble us all. \nThe fast-track bill would do absolutely nothing to prevent more \nchallenges to our Buy America Law in the future, and it would do \nnothing to guarantee that trade agreements will not be used to \nchallenge laws we pass to protect our environment, public health and \nsafety, and our workers.\n\n  Proponents of fast-track argue that these inadequate negotiating \nobjectives will produce concrete gains in protecting workers' rights \nand the environment in future trade agreements, notably the FTAA, the \nWTO, and pending agreements with Chile and Singapore. But the Bush \nAdministration has provided no basis for confidence that it is will \nwilling to expend the necessary energy and political capital to \nactually move workers' rights and environmental provisions forward in \nany of these arenas. In fact, every word and action from the Bush \nAdministration since it has been in office points to the contrary. It \nis simply untrustworthy when it comes to trade policy.\n  Section 131 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, as amended, directs \nthe President to ``seek the establishment . . . in the WTO . . . of a \nworking party to examine the relationship of internationally recognized \nworker rights . . . to the articles, objectives, and related \ninstruments of the GATT 1947 and of the WTO.'' Despite this crystal \nclear mandate from the U.S. Congress, the Bush Administration has \nrefused even to propose a working party on worker rights at the WTO. \nU.S. Trade Representative Zoellick told the House Ways and Means \nCommittee on October 9th that such a proposal ``would kill our ability \nto launch the round . . . It has no chance whatsoever.'' The truth is, \nthe Uruguay Round Agreements did not ask the President or his Trade \nRepresentative to evaluate the potential success of seeking a working \nparty; it said the President ``shall seek'' such a party. Why would we \ngive this President authority to negotiate trade agreements on an \nexpedited basis, with no amendments, when it appears he already doesn't \nfollow the instructions mandated by law from this body?\n  This Administration has publicly announced it will not enforce \nprovisions negotiated in good faith by the Clinton Administration in \nthe Jordan Free Trade Agreement. The Jordan agreement incorporated \nenforceable workers' rights and environmental protections in the core \nof the agreement subject to the same dispute resolution provisions as \nthe commercial aspects. Yet in July, USTR Zoellick exchanged letters \nwith the Jordanian ambassador to the U.S., in which both pledged not to \nuse trade sanctions to resolve disputes under the agreement. This \neffectively gutted the path-breaking labor and environmental provisions \nin the Jordan agreement, since they are the only provisions not also \ncovered by WTO rules, which authorize sanctions separately.\n  Also, the draft ministerial WTO declaration prepared for the next \nministerial contains no progress on workers' rights whatsoever. There \nis not even a commitment for a formal cooperation agreement with the \nILO, which would be a very minimal step forward, yet the Administration \nhas not publicly criticized this aspect of the declaration.\n  The draft text of the FTAA, released in April, also contains no \nlanguage whatsoever, not even as a proposal, linking trade benefits to \nworkers' rights or environmental protection. If the FTAA negotiations \ncontinue on their current path, even the modest workers' provisions now \nincluded in the Generalized System of Preferences--which currently \napplies to virtually every Latin American country--will be rendered \nmoot. In regard to the on-going Chile and Singapore negotiations, the \nBush Administration has apparently retreated from the Jordan agreement \ncommitments which were to be the baseline for the labor and \nenvironmental provisions of any new agreement. It has also failed to\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n bring forth any proposals on labor and environment in the \nnegotiations. Chilean negotiators have told reporters that the U.S. is \nonly asking for monetary fines to enforce labor and environmental \nstandards. This falls short of even the modest Jordan standard.\n  It is clear this Administration has no commitment to labor rights or \nthe environment in its trade policy. In fact, it doesn't see them as \nfundamental principles necessary to achieve fairness in the global \ntrading system--it sees them as ``potential new forms of \nprotectionism.'' This is what USTR Zoellick said in a speech to \nbusiness associations in New Delhi last year. He also told the \naudience: ``We can work cooperatively to thwart efforts to employ labor \nand environmental concerns for protectionist purposes.''\n  Mr. President, we can not trust what this Administration says it will \ndo when negotiating agreements because quite honestly, it doesn't \nbelieve what it is saying when it negotiates them. Worker's rights and \nprotection of the environment in trade agreements are secondary to \ncommercial interests. Period. They are secondary when it comes to \nworkers and the environment abroad and they are secondary when it comes \nto workers' and the environment here.\n  For example, we have watched workers in the steel industry bear the \nbrunt of ineffective trade policies and more recently, inadequate trade \nremedies on the part of this Administration. Although the President's \nrecent Section 201 decision brought relief to some segments of the \nUnited States steel industry, it did nothing for Minnesota's Iron \nRange--nor for the iron ore industry in Michigan. While the President \nimposed a fairly significant tariff on every other product category for \nwhich the International Trade Commission ( ITC) found injury, for steel \nslab he decided to impose ``tariff rate quotas.'' This brings us \nvirtually no relief.\n  Nearly 7 million tons of steel slab can continue to be dumped on our \nshores before any tariff is assessed. The injury will \ncontinue. Moreover, already some of our trading partners--Brazil, for \nexample--are angling for exemptions that would drive the quota levels \neven higher. And, frankly, I fear this Administration might listen too \nsympathetically to such pleas.\n\n  In fact, members of the Senate's Steel Caucus recently received a \nletter warning of potentially devastating impact of grants of \nexclusions awarded by the Administration. As the President of the \nUnited Steelworkers of America, Mr. Gerard, says, ``It would be tragic \nif having traveled so far to provide the industry and its workers and \ncommunities desperately needed relief, that the Administration now \nwasted this opportunity by making unwarranted exclusions at the behest \nof our trading partners.''\n  Frankly, the commitment to protect domestically produced iron ore and \nthe blast furnace capacity to process that iron ore is shockingly \nabsent. We must remain vigilant.\n  All of this leads me to the final reason I oppose moving to the fast-\ntrack bill. It is obvious this nation has more urgent priorities than \ndebating fast-track authority. America's manufacturing industry is in a \ndeep, long-lasting crisis that threatens the future of American \nprosperity. Manufacturing job losses since July 2000 have totaled 1.3 \nmillion. Manufacturing employment peaked in March 1998 at 18.9 million, \nbut since then has declined by more than 1.6 million jobs to a total of \n17.3 million. Last year, total employment in manufacturing fell below \n18 million for the first time since June 1965. From 1994 to the \npresent, growing trade deficits have eliminated a net total of 3 \nmillion actual and potential jobs from the U.S. economy--nearly 50,000 \nof those jobs in Minnesota, representing 2% of the state's labor force. \nLet's be clear. This crisis is a result of a failure of economic and \ntrade policy. We should be addressing this failure, not granting fast-\ntrack authority for major new trade negotiations.\n  Domestic companies are hurting and domestic jobs are being lost by \nthe thousands because of unfair trading practices not adequately curbed \nor punished by our domestic trade policies. What's perhaps most \ntroublesome is that the trade-related losses of the past decade \nhappened during times of economic prosperity so their effect was \nmasked. I think we are just starting to feel the real impact of this \nnation's misguided trade policies. And now the Administration wants \neven more authority--fast track authority--to perpetuate these \nmisguided policies? Where are their priorities? Do they even recognize \nthe needs of workers in America?\n  We must address the condition of the American worker first. Trade \nAdjustment Assistance is critical for thousands of American workers and \ntheir families, and it should not be boot-strapped to a flawed, \nundemocratic bill that will cause more long-term hardship. I support \nthe trade adjustment assistance portion of this bill. It will provide \nimportant assistance that is urgently needed. But, I believe we should \naddress TAA separately, on its own merits.\n  Congress established TAA in 1962 to assist workers whose job loss is \nassociated with an increase in imports. Workers are eligible for up to \n52 weeks of income support, provided they are enrolled in re-training. \nThe program also provides job search and relocation assistance. Despite \nlow unemployment through the second half of the 1990s, the number of \nworkers eligible for TAA has increased. In 2000, approximately 35,000 \nworkers received TAA benefits. Unfortunately, existing TAA eligibility \nrequirements have not kept up with the changing times. TAA covers too \nfew workers and fails to address major problems that workers and \ncommunities face. The TAA provision in this package would help change \nthat.\n  It would broaden eligibility and expand benefits, providing benefits \nto secondary workers, including suppliers and downstream providers. For \nexample, iron ore workers who faced layoffs because of increased steel \nimports would be covered. TAA eligibility would also be expanded to \ninclude workers affected by shifts in production, as well to those \naffected by increased imports. It would increase income maintenance \nfrom 52 to 78 weeks; substantially increase funds available for \ntraining; ensure workers who take a part-time job don't lose training \nbenefits; and increase assistance for job relocation.\n  The expanded program would link TAA recipients to child care and \nhealth care benefits under existing programs, and provide assistance to \nrecipients in making COBRA payments. When you lose your job you lose \nyour health insurance, and unfortunately that often means you lose your \nhealthcare. While I was in Minnesota last summer, I heard from working \nmen and women who had lost their jobs because of the economic downturn. \nIn the fall I spoke to many who had become unemployed as a direct \nconsequence of September 11th. Many of them told me that they were \neligible for COBRA assistance but couldn't afford it. The average cost \nof COBRA coverage for a family is $700, more than half the monthly \nunemployment benefit. 80% of dislocated workers don't purchase it \nbecause they can't afford it. They end up having to make an awful \nchoice: the choice between food and clothes for their families and \nhaving health insurance. This is unacceptable. We must provide \nassistance to the unemployed to ensure they have affordable health \ninsurance.\n  The TAA provision in this bill would recognize the special \ncircumstances faced by family farmers, ranchers and independent \nfishermen, and would seek to provide assistance and technical support \nbefore they lose their businesses. It would provide wage insurance for \nolder workers and help communities adjust to devastating job losses. \nMr. President, entire communities are often affected by the closing of \none textile factory or steel mill. We must coordinate federal \nassistance to these communities, help them develop strategic plans \nfollowing job losses, and provide technical assistance, loans and \ngrants.\n\n  As of December, in Minnesota over 3800 workers have applied for Trade \nAdjustment Assistance as a result of NAFTA. Entire companies have \nrelocated to Mexico or Canada, or workers have been laid off do the \nincrease in imports from those countries. We must guarantee that all \nAmericans benefit from trade by providing adequate trade adjustment \nassistance. But even that is not enough. We must protect the standard \nof living and quality of life of the American worker. We must address \ndecline in real median wages and the weakening of workers rights in \nthis country. And we must do so before we even think about fast-track \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\n  Why is it, for example, that we are proceeding to debate the need for \nexpedited review of trade deals this Administration negotiates when we \nhave yet to address the long over-due increase in the federal minimum \nwage. Have we considered the irony of this? Expedited review of trade \nagreements that cause us to lose jobs, that undermine worker safety and \nsecurity around the globe, before we debate a paltry $1.50 increase in \nthe minimum wage over three years?\n  Poverty has nearly doubled among full-time, year-round workers since \nthe late 1970s--from about 1.3 million then to 2.4 million in 2000. \nThere are millions of mothers and fathers toiling 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, who are still unable to meet their families' basic \nneeds--food, medical care, housing, clothing. More than 32 million \npeople in this country--more than 12 million of those children--were \npoor in 1999.\n  A key part of the problem is an unacceptably low minimum wage. \nMinimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn \nonly $10,712 a year--more than $4,300 below the poverty line for a \nfamily of three. The current minimum wage fails to provide enough \nincome to enable minimum wage workers to afford adequate housing in any \narea of this country.\n  Mr. President, every day the minimum wage is not increased it \ncontinues to lose value, and workers fall farther and farther behind. \nMinimum wage workers have lost all of their gains since we last raised \nthe minimum wage in 1997.\n  Today, the real value of the minimum wage is now $3.00 below what it \nwas in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum \nwage would have to be more than $8 an hour today, not $5.15. Since \n1968, the ratio of the minimum wage to average hourly earnings dropped \nfrom 56% to 36%.\n  Members of Congress acted to raise their own pay by $4,900 last \nyear--the fourth pay increase in six years. Yet we have not found time \nto provide any pay increase to the lowest paid workers, an increase \nthat would add $3,000 to the income of full-time, year-round workers. \nDon't those who are most vulnerable in our society, those who are \nabsolutely struggling to make ends meet, those who every day are forced \nto choose between food, clothing, shelter, or health care for their \nfamilies, don't they deserve the modest increase in the minimum wage \nthat is proposed in the legislation that has been stalled for far too \nlong.\n  A gain of $3,000 would have an enormous impact on minimum wage \nworkers and their families. It would be enough money for a low-income \nfamily of three to buy: over 15 months of groceries; over 8 months of \nrent; over 7 months of utilities; or put a family member through a 2-\nyear community college program.\n  History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any \nnegative impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. Rather, in the three \nyears since the last minimum wage increase, the economy experienced its \nstrongest growth in over three decades. Nearly 11 million new jobs were \nadded, at a pace of 218,000 per month.\n  Nearly 9 million workers would directly benefit from the proposed \nminimum wage increase, many of whom are raising children. Thirty-five \npercent of these workers are the sole earners for their families. \nSixty-one percent are women. Sixteen percent are African American and \ntwenty percent are Hispanic American.\n  Finally, since a minimum wage increase goes to families who need \nevery dollar for basic needs, raising the wage will provide a much-\nneeded spur to our slowly recovering economy. Fifty-eight percent of \nthe benefit of the 1996 and 1997 increases went to families in the \nbottom 40% of income groups. Over one-third of the benefit went to the \npoorest families, those in the bottom 20%.\n  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. This body should \nnot be proceeding to this wrong-headed fast track measure at all. But \nat the least we should not be doing so in advance of considering a \nminimum wage increase to correct some of losses suffered as the result \nof our shameful inaction in the past. No one who works for a living \nshould have to live in poverty.\n  I oppose the motion to proceed to fast-track authority for all the \nreasons I have laid out here today: the fast track mechanism is \nundemocratic, it is unlikely I will be able to support trade agreements \nnegotiated under fast-track authority given the consequences of past \ntrade agreements, the track-record of this Administration so far, and \nthe text of the Trade Promotion Authority Act, and I believe is \nirresponsible to discuss fast-track authority before addressing the \nurgent needs of workers in this nation.\n\n  I know that I am not alone in my opposition to fast-track authority. \nAnd I know that proponents of it will try to cast this debate as one of \nprotectionists versus free traders. Nothing can be farther than the \ntruth. The debate today is one of free trade versus fair trade. I know \nthe difference. The American people know the difference. The debate \ntoday is about the responsibility of this nation to ensure justice in \nthe global trading regime, to ensure democracy, human rights and all \nthe values that make this nation great are not swept aside in the name \nof trade promotion. And it is about ensuring the American worker is not \nswept under the rug in the name of free trade.\n  Mr. President, Americans and especially the American worker, \nunderstand the link between promoting human rights and democracy and \npromoting free trade. In fact, they demand that link. We have seen it \nin the street of Seattle, Washington; Genoa, Italy; and just two weeks \nago here in Washington, DC. At the grassroots level, people are \ndemanding that trade be more than the simple movement of capital. They \nare demanding that it be more than the protection of intellectual and \ninvestor property rights. They are demanding more than what we see in \nthis fast-track bill. My position on trade agreements is their \nposition. It is not ``no, never.'' It is ``yes, if.'' Yes to trade \nagreements if they protect democracy, human rights and internationally \nrecognized labor rights; yes to trade agreements if they guarantee \nminimum safeguards for the environment; yes to trade agreements if they \ndo not abandon family farmers to competition from export-oriented mega-\nfarms abroad operating free from any environmental regulation; yes to \nmajor trade agreements if they do not displace thousands of workers \nwithout any adjustment assistance. I oppose this motion to proceed and \nI will oppose the bill when it comes to the floor. To reiterate, \nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution says it is not the President \nbut the Congress that shall regulate commerce with foreign nations.\n\n  I am not willing to shirk my responsibility of being a part of \nshaping a trade policy that can dramatically affect the quality of \nlives of families and people I represent in Minnesota. I do not \nunderstand how we could agree to a fast-track procedure whereby we \ncould have a trade agreement which would entail actually changing some \nof our domestic laws that deal with consumer protection, that deal with \nworker rights, that deal with a whole range of issues, and that we \nbasically surrender our rights to have the opportunity to have an \namendment considered on the floor of the Senate. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  This legislation locks us into fast-track rules now for debates and \nvotes we will have later. The administration is talking about \nagreements with Chile and Singapore, the Free Trade Agreement of the \nAmericas. In other words, we are deciding now whether to establish \nspecial and highly restrictive rules which will govern our debate on \nvotes on pieces of legislation, votes that will take place later; an \nexpedited schedule, no amendments, a limited number of debates. I don't \nunderstand it.\n  We can have trade legislation without this procedure. With fast \ntrack, any kind of trade agreement can come to the Senate floor. It can \naffect environmental laws that we pass in our States--in Delaware, in \nMinnesota. It can affect food safety legislation that we might pass in \nour States or pass in the Congress. It can overturn and declare trade \nillegal. It can be a trade agreement that we make with different \ncountries, that further depress wages in our country. That means many \nworking families will lose their jobs. That means no respect for basic \nchild labor rights. And where there is no respect for human rights, \nthere is no respect for democracy.\n  All of that can happen, and we are going to say through this \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\nthat we forfeit our right as Senators to represent people in our States \nand try and amend these agreements so we can provide protection for the \npeople we represent? I say to colleagues, on principle alone, I oppose \nthis.\n  By the way, I opposed the Democratic administration. It is not a \nmatter of politics. I oppose any President having this authority. I \ndon't believe we should give up what is not only our constitutional \nright but our responsibility as legislators.\n  Robert Zoellick discussed why he needs fast track: If I am pressing \nmy counterpart to go to his bottom line, he or she will balk if they \nfeel the Congress has the ability to reopen the deal. My counterparts \nfear negotiating once with the administration and a second time with \nthe Congress.\n  From the floor of the Senate, I say for Mr. Zoellick, without \nacrimony, we have a system of checks and balances. We have three \nbranches of Government. As a matter of fact, during the decade of the \n1990s, we negotiated close to 200 trade agreements only two of which \nused the fast track procedure. I have a list of them. The list goes on \nand on and on.\n  Let me make a second point, which is more hard hitting. When I look \nat past trade agreements and some of the empirical evidence, I don't \nwant to give up my right to amend future trade agreements which I think \nwill have the same detrimental or an even more detrimental effect on \nfamilies in the State of Minnesota or, for that matter, around the \ncountry.\n  Let's just take NAFTA. The Economic Policy Institute, a highly \nrespected think-tank, issued a report last year entitled ``NAFTA At \nSeven: Its Impact on Workers in all Three Nations.'' The report says:\n\n       NAFTA eliminated some 766,000 actual and potential U.S. \n     jobs between 1994 and 2000 because of the rapid growth in the \n     U.S. export deficit with Mexico and Canada.\n\n  Minnesota lost 13,200 jobs due to the NAFTA-related deficit.\n  The report went on to say that in the United States:\n\n       NAFTA has contributed to rising income inequality, \n     suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened \n     collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions \n     and reduced fringe benefits.\n\n  A second report released last October argues that when you look at \nthe combined NAFTA and WTO trade-related job losses between 1994 and \n2000--and I voted for neither agreement--the number is over 3 million. \nAccording to that report, Minnesota lost 50,000 jobs. The EPI estimates \nthat 5 percent to 15 percent of the decline in real median wages can be \nexplained by this increase in trade.\n  What are we saying? I will tell you something about potash workers. I \nwas in Brainerd. It is so heartbreaking that 700 workers are out of \nwork. When I called the CEO, he said to me: Senator, we can deal with \nany of the U.S. companies. We got killed by trade policy. In greater \nMinnesota they were shut down and lost $20-an-hour jobs with health \ncare benefits.\n  LTV's iron ore workers--slab steel is coming in, produced way below \nthe cost of production, and 1,300 workers are out of work, having lost \nwell-paying jobs with good health care benefits.\n  Apparel workers, textile workers, auto workers continue to lose their \njobs. In all due respect, we are supposed to be the party that \nrepresents working people. We are supposed to be the party for jobs. I \nfail to see how we live up to this responsibility by signing on to a \ntrade agreement where we do not even have the right to offer \namendments.\n  These companies say to workers in this country: if you do not give up \nsome of your health care benefits, or if you do not agree to keep your \nwages down, we are gone. They do not say to workers in Minnesota: we \nare going to North Carolina. They are leaving North Carolina, too. They \nare saying to American families: we are gone. We are going abroad. We \nare going to Juarez, or Singapore, or wherever. We are going to \nVietnam. We are going to Cambodia where we can pay people 30 cents a \nday; we can hire little children; we can work them 18 hours a day; we \ncan imprison people if they try to organize and form a union, and we \ncan torture people and violate people's human rights. There are some 70 \ngovernments today in the world that systematically practice torture.\n  Then, what these companies say to these countries is: OK, we will \ncome to your country, but if you dare ever pass legislation allowing \npeople the right to organize and bargain collectively, then we will \nleave, or we will not come. You had better not have any environmental \nstandards that make it hard on us, or then we will not stay. You had \nbetter not pass any laws that protect little children so they don't \nhave to work 18 hours a day at age 11, or we will not invest in your \ncountry.\n  We are given all these arguments about how we should be \ninternationalists. I am an internationalist. My father was born in \nOdessa, Ukraine. My father's family moved to stay one step ahead of the \npogroms. He moved to Siberia in czarist Russia and then came here at \nage of 17. He fled czarist Russia. There was a revolution. He was going \nto go back, and his parents told him: Don't come back, the Communists \nhave taken over, Kerenski is out and Lenin is in. He never saw his \nfamily again, and they, in all likelihood, were murdered by Stalin.\n\n  My father spoke 10 languages fluently. I don't. But I am an \ninternationalist. That is not the issue.\n  I know we are part of an international economy. I just want to ask, \nare there not any new rules that go with this? Just as 100 years ago \nwhen we moved from a farm economy to a national economy to more of an \nindustrial economy--remember what happened? The women said: We want the \nright to vote. And then workers organized for an 8-hour day and 40-hour \nweek, and then other citizens, the farmers and Populists alliance, \nsaid: we want some antitrust action; these trusts are destroying our \nlives. And there was the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, and then other \npeople said: we want direct election of Senators.\n  There was a group of citizens who in a democracy demanded what they \nas citizens in a democracy had the courage to demand, which was: As we \nmove from an agrarian to a national economy, make that national economy \nwork not just for these huge companies, but for all of us, for our \nfamilies and our children.\n  Now we are in the 21st century. What we are saying is, with this new \ninternational economy, can't we make sure that this new economy works \nnot just for large multinational corporations? Can't we make sure that \nthis new international economy works for workers--workers here and \nworkers in developing countries? Can't we make sure it works for the \nenvironment and works for human rights and democracy?\n  It breaks my heart that we are told we can lead, but we can't lead \nwith American values. What we are hearing from the administration and \nsome of the proponents of this is: We have to do this. We have to lead. \nBut we dare not--and believe me, I will have an amendment on the floor \nthat will do this--we dare not tie this to human rights or democracy. \nThere cannot be any mention of human rights or democracy in any of \nthese trade agreements. We are asked to lead, but not lead with our \nvalues. We are asked to lead, but not stand for human rights. We are \nasked to lead, but not stand for democracy. As a first-generation \nAmerican, the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from \nRussia, I reject that proposition.\n  There is much I could say that is more technical, and I will as we \nget to amendments, but I have one other question. Why are we on this \nlegislation? How about first raising the minimum wage? In the coffee \nshops of Minnesota, when I walk in with Sheila and have a cup of coffee \nand a piece of pie, people don't say: Are you going to get to fast \ntrack? People talk to me about wages. They talk to me a lot about \neducation.\n  How about a debate about when we are going to fully fund special \neducation and live up to our commitment? The Presiding Officer, as a \nformer Governor, knows what that is all about in Delaware.\n  How about a debate about affordable prescription drugs for seniors, \nand for others as well? We should be able to reimport drugs from \nCanada. Farmers and consumers should be able to reimport drugs back \nfrom Canada, if they have met all their FDA requirements. It helps not \nonly senior citizens but all of our citizens.\n  How about going from $5.15 an hour which, if it kept up with \ninflation,\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nwould be $8 an hour--$1.50 over the next 3 years?\n  In the State of Minnesota, to be able to afford housing at minimum \nwage, you would have to work 127 hours a week. There are not 127 hours \nin a week. It is just unbelievable. We are the Democratic Party. I am, \ntoday, speaking for the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. \nHousing? In the State of Minnesota now, in the metro area, you will be \nlucky if you get a two-bedroom apartment for under $900.\n  Childcare? If you had a 2-year-old and 3-year-old, you would be very \nlucky if your expenses were less than $1,000 a month.\n  Of course, childcare workers make $6, $7, or $8 an hour with no \nhealth care benefits. You can't support yourself on minimum wage. If \nyou are a single parent, that takes almost all of your income. It \ndoesn't even meet the question of health care costs, food, \ntransportation, and maybe once in a blue moon to go to a movie, or go \nout to eat.\n  Why aren't we focusing on the basic concerns of working families? I \nmake this appeal on the floor of the Senate. Why aren't we talking \nabout raising the minimum wage? Why aren't we talking about minimum \nwage jobs? Why aren't we talking about affordable prescription drugs? \nWhy aren't we talking about health security for all? Why aren't we \ntalking about how to meet these exorbitant health care expenses that \nsmall businesses can't meet? Why aren't we talking about what we are \ngoing to do as more and more of our neighbors, parents, or grandparents \nlive to be 80 and 85 to make sure they can stay at home and live at \nhome with dignity and not be forced to go to nursing homes? Why aren't \nwe talking to our health care providers and to our physicians about \nadequate Medicare? Why aren't we talking about how we can have more \nsupport for nurses and attract more teachers? Why aren't we talking \nabout retaining more teachers? Why aren't we talking about doing more \nfor K-12? Why aren't we talking about affordable higher education, how \nwe can make sure that every child by kindergarten knows how to spell \nhis names, knows the alphabet, the colors, the shapes, and the sizes \nwhen they are ready to go to school?\n  Why in the world are we not focusing on these issues that are so \nimportant to the vast majority of the people we represent?\n  Why are we talking about fast track? Why are we calling upon all of \nus to give up our constitutional authority to amend trade agreements; \nto give up our responsibility to represent the people back in our \nStates in case these trade agreements are antithetical to their rights \nas workers, or to their environment, or to their safety, or to their \nchildren; or to the rights of consumers?\n  I wouldn't do it for any President. Why don't I just lay my cards out \non the table. Forgive me. I wouldn't do it for this President.\n  I don't see that this administration is at all committed to raising \nthe minimum wage, or to making sure people have the right to organize \nand bargain collectively for labor law reform, or, for that matter, to \nprotecting against repetitive stress injury, and to ensuring a safe \nworkplace.\n  I don't think there is a great commitment on the part of this \nadministration on behalf of the environment, consumers, or ordinary \npeople who do not have all the capital and who make the huge \ncontributions. I don't see a whole lot of commitment.\n  Now we are going to give this administration fast-track authority? I \ndidn't vote to give it to the last administration. We can't come out \nhere with an amendment to try to make things better. We can't fight to \nrepresent the people back in our States. And the trade agreements that \nI have seen so far--every single one--do not represent fair trade. They \ndon't have child labor standards. They don't have basic human rights \nstandards. They don't have any standards for protection of the \nenvironment. At the end of the day, there are depressed wages for \nworkers not only in our country but in the developing countries as \nwell. I think we can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Interest Rates For Student Loans\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to review the \nspecifics of the President's proposal. Jill Morningstar works for me on \neducation. She gave me a briefing last night, which I haven't had a \nchance to read.\n  As I understand it, the administration is now basically proposing \nthat students will not be able to consolidate some of their students \nloans in order to lower the interest rates and give them a break on \ninterest rates.\n  I want to say to the White House that this is a true no-brainer; that \nis to say, it is a nonstarter.\n  I think the more the administration hears from higher education \nstudents in the State of Minnesota and around the country, the more \nthey are going to realize that it is not true that these students when \nnot in school are traveling around the swank ski resorts or playing on \nall the swank golf courses because they have a ton of money. It is not \ntrue. If they are 18, 19, and 20, many of them are working several jobs \n30 hours a week. Many of these students in my State--I bet in Delaware, \ntoo--are in their forties and fifties and are going back to school.\n  I am the beneficiary of the National Defense Education Act, which was \na low-interest rate loan, and I only had to pay half of it back because \nI went into teaching.\n  We should be going in the direction of more affordable higher \neducation--not less affordable.\n  I think the bind this administration is in with their proposal is \nthey are trying to figure out ways of supporting the Pell Grant Program \nbecause so far in their budget they don't have the support for it and \nthe ability to find other pots of money.\n  This is sort of an unconscionable tradeoff. This is not the way we \nget more funding for Pell grants or other worthy programs--basically by \nseverely undercutting students' abilities to be able to combine their \nloans and pay a lower rate of interest.\n  This is really anti-education. Frankly, it is anti-student.\n  I want the higher education community in Minnesota to know that is \nwhy I came to the floor. I am adamantly opposed to this policy. I join \nthe ranks of other Senators--Democrats and Republicans alike--in \nopposition.\n  I think for many middle-income families higher education ranks right \nup there as one of the huge issues. It is very important.\n  I imagine that back in my State--and other Senators and \nRepresentatives will be doing the same thing--I will be having some \nmeetings with students. Unless I am wrong, I think we will see a \ntremendous reaction, a lot of organizing, and a lot of insistence that \nthe administration change this policy.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate today to call upon the White House to \nbasically back away. They are going in the wrong direction. They are \ngoing to really feel the political heat. You should really feel the \npolitical heat.\n  This is the bind we are in. All of these worthy programs are on a \ncollision course with the tax cut. Let us have tax cuts. Let us do some \nof it, but there has to be balance.\n  We have done so much by way of tax cuts. Now they want to make these \ntax cuts permanent. We no longer have revenue when it comes to \naffordable higher education, prekindergarten, welfare reform, money for \nchildcare, money for TANF, affordable housing, special education, title \nI, support for COPS, support for firefighters assistance grants, and \nmore research for all kinds of disabling diseases and illnesses.\n\n  So many people in the last couple of days have come from our State \nasking about money for Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, mental \nhealth, and on and on. The money isn't there. This is one little \nexample.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate to make clear my opposition to the \ndirection the administration is going. I call on students to organize \nfor higher education to make sure their voices are heard. I think the \nadministration needs to hear from you because they are about to make it \nharder for you to afford your education. That is a distorted\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\npriority. We ought not be making it harder for men and women--whatever \ntheir age--who want to pursue higher education. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my strong \nsupport for the motion to proceed to the Andean Trade Preference Act.\n  Since 1991, the Andean Trade Preference Act has helped the countries \nof the Andean region--Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia--to more \nthan double their exports to the United States, to nearly $2 billion in \nthe year 2000.\n  At the same time, exports from the United States into the Andean \nnations saw a 65-percent increase between 1991 and 1999.\n  Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have not only increased their \nexports, they have accomplished another important objective to them and \nto the United States; and that is, they are developing new, \nnontraditional sectors of their economy. They are developing legitimate \ncommercial exports as alternatives to the illicit drug trade which has \nso bedeviled these countries in the recent past. This has been a huge \nbenefit not only to the four countries of the Andean region but to the \nUnited States as well.\n  Today, as an example, 85 percent of Colombia's cut flowers go by \nexport to the U.S. market. In fact, these flowers alone account for 80 \npercent of the air freight between the United States and Colombia.\n  In Peru, the asparagus industry has served as an example of what an \nalternative crop production can achieve--an alternative to illicit coca \nproduction. Asparagus, growing in Peru, now employs 40,000 people in a \nlegal agricultural enterprise.\n  In spite of this progress, regrettably, the ATPA expired last year on \nDecember 4, its 10th birthday. It is in the national interest of the \nUnited states of America, as well as the national interest of the four \nnations of the Andean region, that this Congress act now to restore and \nenhance this highly successful program.\n  The House has already done so. In December of last year, it passed \nits version of Andean trade preference renewal and expansion. It is \ntime for the Senate to do the same.\n  Why is this legislation important? And why is it important now?\n  I suggest three reasons: the grave consequences of inaction, the \nopportunity to strengthen the partnership between the United States and \nthe Andean region, and as an important tool in our global war on \nterrorism.\n  What are some of the consequences of inaction?\n  The expiration of the ATPA is having an immediate and negative impact \non the export industries that have blossomed under the benefits of this \nprogram, as well as industries that support this trade.\n  In February of this year, 2 months after the ATPA had expired, I \nrequested that the administration grant a deferral on the collection of \nthose additional duties which came due as a result of the expiration of \nthe ATPA.\n  The President, in my judgment, agreed and used the administrative \npower to postpone the collection of those additional ATPA duties for 90 \ndays with the expectation that Congress, during that period of time, \nwould renew and extend ATPA.\n  That period of deferral is almost over. The 90-day clock runs out on \nMay 16. If we have not completed all the work needed to pass this \nlegislation into law by then--including passage by the Senate, a \npotential conference committee with the House of Representatives to \nresolve what differences might exist, and final signing into law by the \nPresident--if we do not do all of those acts by May 16, the U.S. \nCustoms Service will start sending out bills for duties which would \nthen be due and payable.\n  These bills will be steep for both importers and their customers. An \nexample: Annual imports of flowers totaling $400 million from the \nregion are liable for duties of up to 6.8 percent. Example: Annual \nimports of asparagus worth $50 million will get an additional 20-\npercent tariff. Example: Leather handbags and luggage imports of $20 \nmillion a year are subject to a 10-percent tariff. Example: Imports of \nprecious metal jewelry, worth $140 million a year, will face up to 7-\npercent duties.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a caring man and probably--I would \nsay no doubt--gave to his wife, maybe to his mother as well, beautiful \nflowers for Valentine's Day and is preparing to do the same for \nMother's Day. Chances are great that those flowers he has and will \nprovide to his loved ones came from an Andean country. And the risk of \napplying these additional tariffs to the two most significant days of \nthe year for the sale of flesh cut flowers, Valentine's Day and \nMother's Day, representing 50 percent of the total cut flower imports, \nwill be enormous.\n  Because of the temporary extension of ATPA, only the tariff duties \nhave been deferred. Growers will still be responsible if the renewed \nATPA fails to become law by May 16, only 4 days after Mother's Day. On \ntop of that, if you send those flowers for Mother's Day, they will \nprobably cost you about $6 more just because we have allowed ATPA to \nlapse.\n  With the proven, positive economic returns of the current ATPA, we \nmust not only renew these trade benefits; the time has come to expand \nthem.\n  The Andean landscape was noticeably changed in the year 2000 with the \npassage of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. That legislation \nprovided the Caribbean nations significant new trade benefits, \nessentially parity with the benefits which Mexico has received under \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement Act. But in helping the \nCaribbean Basin, we have inadvertently hurt the Andean region.\n  The Andean apparel industry is tiny in comparison to the apparel \nindustry in Mexico and the CBI countries. Of these three preferential \ntrade arrangements in the Western Hemisphere, NAFTA accounts for \napproximately 55 percent of U.S. apparel imports. CBI has a 41-percent \nshare. The Andean Trade Preference Act countries provide only 4 \npercent.\n  Despite its small share of our imports, the U.S. market is the \nrecipient of over 90 percent of the Andean countries' apparel exports, \nso it is a small percentage of our imports of apparel from the Western \nHemisphere. But our market is an extremely significant economic \nopportunity for these four countries. If Congress does not level the \nplaying field between ATPA and the Caribbean Basin, the potential job \nloss is tremendous. Colombia alone stands to lose up to 100,000 jobs in \njust the apparel sector. As I will indicate later, there are already \nearly indications of a significant relocation of the apparel assembly \nindustry from the Andean trade area to CBI or Mexico because of the \nsome 8- to 10-percent competitive advantage which Mexico and the \nCaribbean now have over the Andean region as it relates to the export \nof finished apparel products.\n\n  U.S. imports of apparel from Colombia in 2001 were down 18 percent \nover the year 2000. Total apparel exports to the United States from the \nAndean region were down over 11 percent for the same timeframe.\n  As a result, U.S. exports of cut pants to be assembled into apparel \nin the Andean countries was also down but down by an average of over 33 \npercent. This reduction in exports, which support the apparel industry, \nillustrates how the lack of trade benefits clearly hurts both the \nUnited States and the Andean countries.\n  We must create a business climate that can provide Andean citizens an \nalternative to illegal industries. Promoting legitimate economic \ndevelopment rather than leaving these countries at a competitive \ndisadvantage with their near hemispheric neighbors, especially in \nhighly mobile industries such as apparel, is a critical goal of this \nATPA legislation.\n  If we are successful in our counternarcotics efforts in Colombia \nalone, it is estimated that there will be a quarter of a million people \nout of work. A quarter of a million people in Colombia earn their \nliving in the elicit drug trade. It is our national policy and goal\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\nto try to eliminate that elicit drug trade. As part of that strategy, \nwe have a role to play in developing legal alternative jobs for those \npeople who we hope will lose their jobs in coca production and \ntrafficking.\n  It is ironic that at the same time we are asking the region to \neliminate an illegal industry that contributes almost 5 percent of its \ngross domestic product, we have created an environment which makes it \nmore difficult for those same countries to retain legitimate \nindustries.\n  It is imperative that we correct that inequality now and send a \nstrong signal with a renewed and expanded Andean Trade Preference Act.\n  I have been talking about some of the immediate and microconsequences \nof inaction by the Senate. There are macroconsequences as well. As you \ncan see in the chart I have brought, the Andean region is bordered on \nthe north by Venezuela and on the south by Argentina. Venezuela, as \nevidenced by events in recent days, is facing an increasingly volatile \nand unstable political future. To the south, in Argentina, the economic \nsituation is still reeling. Without active U.S. involvement in the \nregion, the Andean nations could share the same fate as their northern \nand southern neighbors.\n  Our Andean neighbors are trying desperately to keep their houses from \ncatching fire.\n  But the houses on both ends of the block are already in flames. The \nATPA duty preferences expired, and the Andean countries are fighting \nthat fire with water through buckets. We need a renewed and expanded \nATPA to give them a big firetruck with a steady and reliable stream. We \nare sending exactly the wrong signal to our neighbors if we do not take \nactive steps at this pivotal time.\n  The second reason this is important is the building of partnerships \nbetween the United States and the Andean region. While the clock is \nticking on Congress to act on ATPA legislation, there is another clock \nticking in the Andean region and the Western Hemisphere, including the \nUnited States, in the area of apparel production. For now, many of the \nlargest apparel assembly countries in Asia have been at a comparative \nadvantage in the production of apparel. As an example, these two golf \nshirts, sold by the same company, same label, same color, would be \nconsidered identical. There is a difference. If you look inside the \none, you will see that it was made in Nicaragua; the other was made in \nChina. Other than that, they are identical.\n  One other area in which they are different--they both sell for \napproximately $20--is the shirt that is made in Nicaragua costs 10 \npercent more to produce than the shirt made in China. The shirt made in \nNicaragua started as cotton grown in a U.S. field. That cotton was then \nmade into the material from which this shirt was made. That material \nwas then sent to Nicaragua, where it was assembled into this golf \nshirt. This shirt from China was made from Chinese cotton, converted \ninto textile in a Chinese textile factory, and then assembled by \nChinese workers.\n  That is a significant part of the reason, even though this had to \ncome halfway around the world; whereas the one from Nicaragua only a \nfew hundred miles, and the shirt from China costs 10 percent less to \nproduce than did the shirt from Nicaragua. How has this imbalance been \nmaintained? It has been maintained because the United States, as part \nof what is called the Multifiber Agreement, sets an annual limit on how \nmuch product of a particular apparel can be exported into the United \nStates.\n  As an example, under current agreements, China is limited to \nexporting 2.374 million dozen golf shirts to the United States per \nyear. That restriction on the amount of product that can be exported to \nthe United States is a significant reason the partnership of the United \nStates growing the raw material, converting it into clothing material, \nthen shipping that to a Caribbean, Mexican, or Andean assembly factory \nfor final conversion into the wearable product has been able to sustain \nitself.\n  In the year 2005, the Multifiber Agreement goes out of effect. In the \nnext 3 years, the apparel industry in the Western Hemisphere must get \nsubstantially more efficient in order to compete with China and the \nother major Asian producers, which will likewise come out from under \nthe restrictions of the Multifiber Agreement in 2005. Failure to become \nmuch more efficient, in my judgment, puts the whole partnership of U.S. \nagriculture, U.S. textile, and Caribbean, Mexican, or Andean assembly \nin serious jeopardy.\n  The assembly operations in this hemisphere, under our law--including \nthe law we are now considering extending--must use U.S. fabric and \nyarn, buy U.S.-made sewing machines and equipment, and use U.S.-grown \ncotton and other fabric materials. If these industries do not become \nmore efficient in the Andean region, the Caribbean, and Mexico, they \nwill lose out in global competition to Asia. Then, American raw \nmaterials and equipment, and some 40,000 to 50,000 Americans who are \ninvolved in producing the material that goes into these garments that \nare assembled within the hemisphere will all be completely out of the \npicture. With the enhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in \n2000, fabric exports to Caribbean nations from America, or assembly of \napparel items, rose 170 percent since 1999.\n\n  Last year, the United States exported $3 billion in cut parts to \nCaribbean nations, which supported some 60,000 jobs in the United \nStates, 40,000 to 50,000 of which were in the textile industry. This \nincrease in cut parts exports came despite an overall decline in U.S. \nexports of finished apparel from CBI countries.\n  What this all means is apparel manufacturers are substituting U.S. \nfabric and yarn for foreign inputs, proving that the partnership \nbetween the U.S. textile and yarn producers and the Caribbean assembly \noperators is working. That is the same result we hope to achieve in the \nAndean region. If we can make importing our fabrics more affordable, \nbased on trade benefits and reduced tariffs, then American jobs will be \nsaved.\n  But passing trade preference legislation is only part of the equation \nfor making the apparel sector more efficient within our hemisphere. \nThere must also be comprehensive implementation of both the letter of \nthe law and the spirit behind it. Legislation expanding CBI in 2000 was \na good example. Congress expanded the trade benefits for apparel \nassembled in the region from U.S. yarn and fabric. But there are still \nmany more hurdles to clear before the region will be an efficient \nmanufacturer of apparel--efficient in terms of our ability to compete \nwith Asian manufacturers.\n  Secretary of Commerce Don Evans has taken the lead in coordinating \nthe administration's long-term implementation of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative. Last year, the Department of Commerce canvassed its \noverseas post in the Caribbean to identify other problems that are \nholding the countries back from more efficient production. The \nDepartment's exports identified issues such as poor transportation \nsystems, high energy costs, unreliable energy supply, and the \nunpredictable business climate as obstacles to greater efficiency in \nthe Caribbean assembly industry.\n  This year, the Department of Commerce has assembled an initiative to \nbegin tackling some of these problems. When we pass Andean trade \npreference enhancement--and I am very optimistic that we will--there \nmust be a similar effort to assure that not only are the trade benefits \nimplemented but the region, as a whole, is prepared to meet the \nchallenges of the sharply increased competition it will face in the \npost-2005 world.\n  The third and final reason I think this is important--and important \nnow--is the role that this legislation will play in our effort to \ncombat narcotics and counterterrorism. The ATPA is more than just good \ntrade policy. The ATPA is a key tool in fighting our Nation's war \nagainst terrorism.\n  Recently, the Director of the CIA, Mr. George Tenet, came before the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, of which I am privileged to be \nthe Chair, and said Latin America is ``becoming increasingly volatile \nas the potential for instability there grows.'' One reason he cited was \nthe sluggish, oftentimes downward spiraling economy in Latin America. \nWhat was the other reason? Terrorism.\n  Some of the worst terror and violence in the world is happening in \nthe Western Hemisphere. In Latin America, the evil hand of terror has \nbecome\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nan everyday reality for too many. In Colombia, for example, \nparamilitary forces linked to the drug trade have instilled fear \nthrough random kidnappings and bombings. A statistic which I think \nwould stun most citizens of the United States is this: In the year \n2000, of all the worldwide incidents of terrorist attacks against \nUnited States citizens and United States interests, over 44 percent of \nthose worldwide terrorist attacks against Americans occurred in a \nsingle country, Colombia.\n  Today in Colombia there is no substantial difference between one who \nis a drug trafficker and one who is a terrorist. Recent events, such as \nthe indictment in a United States court of four members of the primary \nterrorist organization in Colombia, known by the name of FARC, on drug \ncharges, confirm this trend.\n  In the early days in the Andean region the drug traffickers who were \nproviding cocaine were highly centralized. They had a chief executive \nofficer. They were vertically integrated. That started with growing of \nthe coca in the fields to financing its distribution in the United \nStates and other demand countries.\n  We made a major effort--we the civilized world, with the United \nStates playing a key role--to take down these highly centralized drug \norganizations, particularly the Medellin and the Cali cartels. After a \nlong period of significant investment and loss of life, we, the \nColombians, and the international community were successful.\n  We thought that by taking the head off the drug cartel snake, we \nwould kill the rest of the body. In fact, what we found in the late \n1990s was these decapitated snakes were beginning to reconstitute \nthemselves, and they were moving away from the large corporate model \ntowards a more entrepreneurial model; where they used to have \nvertically integrated parts of the drug chain, now they have multiple, \nsmall drug traffickers for each phase of the process, from growing in \nthe field to transporting, to the financing of the drug trade.\n  For a period of time, these new entrepreneurial drug traffickers \nfound themselves at risk because they did not have the security blanket \nthat the old centralized system had provided. So they turned to the \nmodern economic guerrillas, the Al Capones of Colombia, and made a \npact. The pact was: We will pay you well if you will provide us \nsecurity so we can continue to conduct our illicit drug activities.\n  For awhile, that was the deal, but then the Scarfaces figured out: We \nare providing the capability of these drug traffickers to do their \nbusiness, but they are making a lot more money in drug trafficking than \nwe are in providing the security for the drug traffickers. So why do we \nnot become drug traffickers ourselves? And they did.\n  By the end of the 1990s, the drug trade, particularly in Colombia, \nhad been largely taken over by the former ideological guerrillas who \nhad become the Al Capones and now were becoming drug traffickers.\n  The motives of those who commit violent acts throughout the world are \nvariant, but one thread is predominant in nations plagued by \nterrorists: An economy unable to provide hope or a legitimate means for \nthe people to earn a living. In Colombia, this condition is fed by the \nillegal businesses that are the root of violence: Drug cultivation and \nsmuggling.\n  The recent escalation of tensions in Colombia magnifies the urgency \nof America's involvement in helping to sustain South America's oldest \ndemocracy, Colombia. At the same time, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia are \nalso vulnerable to the surge of the illicit narcotics trade as they \nhave developed alternative business programs.\n\n  Fifteen years ago, most of the cocaine in the region was grown in \nPeru and Bolivia and then transported to Colombia for processing. Those \nlevels have been dramatically reduced, in large part because local \nfarmers have been encouraged, in significant part through U.S. \nprograms, to make the transition from illegal cocaine to a legal \nagricultural crop. With this continued commitment, our neighbors will \nhave incentives to develop both legitimate economic alternatives to the \nproduction of drugs and real avenues to end the violence that plagues \nso much of our hemisphere.\n  If we are serious about halting the flow of illegal drugs to the \nUnited States, if we are committed to contributing to the stabilization \nof our nearest neighbors in the hemisphere, and if we are steadfast in \nour war against terrorism, then the United States must act now to both \nextend and expand these portrayed benefits, important for us and \nimportant for the four countries of the Andean region.\n  Time is short for the people of our regions who stand to lose should \nwe fail to pass this legislation. The time is now. The days between now \nand when the crisis occurs on May 16 are few. I urge my colleagues to \nexpeditiously move to the passage of this legislation, to the \nresolution of differences, and to accept the invitation to attend a \nsigning ceremony in the Rose Garden and then to see that the roses of \nhope will begin to bloom again in the backyards and fields of our \nneighbors in the Andean region.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleague from South Carolina. I will speak for 5 or 10 minutes. I \nthank him for the courtesy.\n  Madam President, the Senate is embarking on a historic debate, one in \nwhich we have the opportunity to expand economies, promote job \ncreation, and reduce poverty, in the United States and around the \nworld. As we consider this package of trade bills and debate whether to \ngrant the President trade promotion authority, I hope we remain focused \non the big picture. Both collectively and individually, these bills \npromote the expansion of global free trade and the prosperity that \nattends it.\n  Since the end of World War II, the United States has served as a \nglobal leader and champion of free trade. Regrettably, a recent surge \nof protectionism, often driven by special interests that care nothing \nfor the welfare of the average American consumer, has severely \nhandicapped our leadership. Major U.S. trading partners doubt our \ndedication to free trade, and not without cause. Recent protectionist \npolicies on lumber and, most egregiously, on steel have fueled the \nscorn of our global trading partners--and rightly so. Failing to pass \ntrade promotion authority will forfeit our nation's legitimacy as a \nglobal free trade leader and confirm the views of critics around the \nworld who don't take our devotion to free trade, and consequently our \nglobal leadership, seriously. We cannot let this happen.\n  The authority first established by the Trade Act of 1974 and now \nproposed in TPA expired eight years ago. Since then, numerous trade \nagreements, in which the United States has not participated, have been \nnegotiated and implemented around the world. The simple fact is that \nour trading partners are unwilling to negotiate agreements with an \nadministration that lacks TPA.\n  Today, there are 130 preferential trade agreements, and the United \nStates is a party to three of them.\n  Similarly, the United States is a party to only one of the 30 free \ntrade agreements in the Western Hemisphere. Those 156 agreements to \nwhich we are not a signatory represent missed opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n  The American people benefit enormously from trade, even if they often \ndon't realize it. Today, over 12 million U.S. jobs depend on exports, \nand those jobs pay wages that are 13 to 18 percent higher than the \nnational average. Every day, American consumers reap the benefits of \ntrade in the form of lower-priced goods and services. The office of the \nU.S. Trade Representative estimates that the combined benefits of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the Uruguay round \nagreements have saved the average American family of four between \n$1,300 and $2,000 a year. A University of Michigan study found that a \nglobal reduction of trade barriers could result in an additional income \ngain of $2,500 for the average American family of four.\n  Too often, our Nation's approach to trade has been to open foreign \nmarkets\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nto American goods and services while erecting domestic barriers to \nforeign imports. But trade does not work that way. It is, by \ndefinition, a two-way street. Continuing along this protectionist path \nwill ultimately cause more damage to the very American industries \nclamoring for protection today. Without reciprocity, the farmers and \ncorporations of this Nation will soon lose access to the valuable \nmarkets they depend on to sell their goods. Such an approach turns \ntrade, a positive-sum game in which all parties benefit from expanded \neconomic opportunity, into a zero-sum game strangely reminiscent of a \ndiscredited, mercantilist past.\n\n  Expanding free trade is a way to improve the well-being of all \nAmericans, particularly the working poor. The most basic economic \nanalysis shows that tariffs represent an unfair tax on an already \novertaxed public. Reducing barriers to trade is the equivalent of a tax \ncut for every consumer. Presidential trade negotiating authority was \nnecessary in the past to reach the agreements from which Americans \ncurrently benefit. That same authority is needed for this \nadministration and others to negotiate future agreements, to build on \nour prosperity.\n  By enabling the negotiation of bilateral and multilateral trade \nagreements, TPA will empower the President to eliminate trade barriers, \nreduce tariffs, and open foreign markets to American goods and \nservices. American workers, farmers, businessmen, and consumers will \nbenefit from the successful completion of the World Trade Organization \nnegotiations in Doha, regional free trade agreements like the Free \nTrade Area of the Americas, and bilateral trade agreements such as \nthose we hope to achieve soon with Singapore and Chile.\n  On a regional level, it is particularly urgent that we support our \nallies in the hemisphere by deepening our trade relationship with them, \nin order to advance broader American interests in Latin America. Let \nthere be no doubt: the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act is \nimportant to U.S. national security and the security of the \ndemocratically elected governments in the Andean region.\n  In 1991, former President Bush signed into law the Andean Trade Act. \nIn a fresh approach to the war on drugs, he argued that promoting trade \nbetween the United States and the countries of the Andean region would \nexpand their economies, create jobs outside the drug trade, and \nincrease stability in the Andean region. After a decade in which \ndemocracy has taken root in these nations, these goals are even more \nimportant.\n  Although the original Andean Trade Act represented a modest effort--\ngranting duty-free or reduced tariff treatment to a limited number of \ngoods from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru--it has produced many \nsuccesses. Two-way trade between the United States and the Andean \nnations has more than doubled since 1991, and new industries have \nemerged as a result of the reduced-tariff benefits or the agreements.\n  In Colombia, for example, the fresh-cut flower industry has created \nover 150,000 new jobs. These people are now harvesting and planting \nflowers rather than trafficking illegal drugs. Similarly, in Peru, the \nbenefits of the Andean Trade Act encouraged farmers to cultivate \nasparagus, creating 50,000 new jobs, and making asparagus that \ncountry's largest export crop to the United States. Today, farmers in \nthe region are choosing to plant products to be exported under the \nAndean Trade Act, rather than coca. Our strategic goals in the region \nrequire us to build upon these successes.\n  The Colombia conflict lends particular urgency to the need for swift \ncongressional action on Andean trade expansion. Not only are Colombia's \npeople at risk from the FARC terrorists, Colombia's democracy is at \nrisk from the corrosive effects decades of civil war have had on her \ninstitutions and her economy. The military and intelligence assistance \nAmerica provides to Colombia is critical, but it is only a part of our \npolicy response. We have an obligation to help our ally not only to \ndefeat the terrorists, but to build the foundation for a lasting peace \nby supporting economic development in Colombia. Andean trade expansion \nprovides a way to do that without costing U.S. taxpayers a dime.\n  The government of the region, burdened by the spillover effects of \nthe Colombian conflict, are the most eloquent advocates for the \ntangible benefits provided by the Andean trade agreement. The group of \nnations that benefit from the act are critical to the hemispheric \nstability, prosperity, and democracy America has worked to foster in \nthe region. These nations stand with us in wanting to end the economic \ndespair and dislocation the Colombian conflict has projected across \ntheir borders. It is in America's interest to counter the economic \ndestabilization that war has brought to Colombia's neighbors with the \nbroad-based economic growth that represents the region's best hope.\n  The arguments that drive support for the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act demonstrate how trade and development in the Andean \nregion increase our national security. I hope the Senate will act \nswiftly on the ATPA, given the expiration of existing Andean trade \npreferences on May 16, as we accelerate our efforts to build prosperity \nand consolidate democracy in the region.\n  As we consider this entire legislative package, I would caution my \ncolleagues against further efforts to restrict free trade. I hope we \nwill avoid the temptation to support veiled protectionist measures in \norder to secure passage of this bill. We cannot, in good faith, work to \npromote trade liberalization with one hand while restricting it with \nthe other. Such an approach will not further the expansion of global \nfree trade. Indeed, it will only solidify the distrust of our allies \nand trading partners while doing nothing to increase the prosperity of \nthe American people.\n  A critical component of this trade bill is how to develop the best \npossible solution for providing assistance to hard-working Americans \nwho may lose their health insurance coverage as an unintended result of \nthis legislation. This is a real concern and one that we must take \nseriously. However, we can't allow this issue to be politicized and \nused to deter the passage of this important trade bill. Both sides of \nthe aisle have made significant progress toward a compromise. Now we \nmust continue compromising until we iron out a fair and sound solution \nfor addressing the health care needs of our Nation's workers.\n  Ensuring access to affordable and quality health care for all \nAmericans must be a priority, and I commend each of my colleagues who \nare fighting for health care protections for workers possibly impacted \nby this bill. But this simply can't be done if partisan politics \nprevent us from working together to find a solution that is good for \nour workers and the overall quality of our health care system.\n  I look forward to this broad trade debate. I believe it is healthy \nfor our Nation and our democracy for our leaders to make what is a \ncompelling intellectual case for free trade, and to demonstrate to the \nAmerican people how successful trade liberalization represents money in \nthe pockets. We now have the opportunity to reverse the recent \nprotectionist tide. It is time that we look to the future, consider the \nlong-term interests of our Nation, and work urgently to provide the \nPresident with the authority he needs to negotiate for free trade.\n  Madam President, I reiterate, the situation in the four countries of \nColombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru is such that we cannot delay, \nlonger than May 16, passage of the Andean Trade Preference Expansion \nAct. I cannot tell you the problems that will result in that very \ndelicate region of our hemisphere at that time if the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act is not renewed.\n  Colombia is in serious trouble. Peru has only recently emerged from a \nvery difficult period. Ecuador has been directly impacted by the \nconflict within Colombia. And, of course, Bolivia has had severe \neconomic problems for a long period of time.\n  This is a small step but a very important one. And our failure--our \nfailure--to act on this legislation I think would send a very bitter \nmessage to our friends and allies in our own hemisphere.\n  After passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, America's \ngoal was to have a hemispheric free trade agreement within a short \nperiod of time. Obviously we have fallen very short of that.\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n  I look forward to a vigorous debate with my friend from South \nCarolina and my friend from North Dakota who just came to the Chamber. \nI hope this debate is based on our mutual concern for the workers of \nAmerica, but that concern should also be balanced by our concern for \nthe average working men and families in America who will find that \ngoods and services are less expensive to them. History proves it. No, \nwe don't like to see lumber workers or cotton farmers or wheat farmers \nor anybody else harmed by free trade. We can take care of that impact \non our economy and still serve the greater good of our entire Nation.\n  I have had the great privilege of visiting South Carolina on many \noccasions. One of the greatest products of free trade is the BMW plant, \nwhich the Senator from South Carolina was instrumental in attracting to \nthat great State. It is always a privilege for me to go back and visit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Arizona, ranking member and former chairman of our Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The fact is, where we have that BMW plant, just 2 years ago, in \nSpartanburg County, we had 3.2 percent unemployment; it is now 6.1 \npercent. It is just an outflow, a stampede almost of the exportation of \ntextile jobs in South Carolina. Since NAFTA we have lost 53,900 jobs. \nThat is one of the things they are debating with respect to trade \nadjustment assistance to get health care. If you are going to have \ntrade adjustment assistance, I certainly want to apply it to those lost \njobs. They are out there struggling in the sense that almost, in a way, \nI don't have any more jobs to lose. I have to apply it to those because \nthey are retrained and skilled.\n  I gave the example of Oneida, the little T-shirt plant where they had \nmore than 400 employees with an average age of 47 years old, lose their \njobs. So they trained them as expert computer operators, as Washington \ntells them to do. Who is going to hire the 47-year-old? They are going \nto hire 21-year-olds. So they are still out of a job. That is the \ndesperate circumstance that is going on all over the country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from South Carolina. He has the floor. \nMay I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from South Carolina, I know there \nare individual and heartbreaking stories of people who have lost their \njobs in the textile industry in South Carolina. The fact remains that \nhistory and the record show that every American family, whether they \nare unemployed or employed or rich or poor, has benefited by the \nimportation of less expensive goods and services into the United \nStates. We balance this with assistance, training, in every way we can, \nincluding reaching agreement on health benefits for dislocated workers.\n  I never have sold anything to a grocery store. I bought a lot from \ngrocery stores. I buy flowers a lot cheaper when they are grown in \nColombia than when they are grown in South Carolina. It has never been \nmy ambition for any child to grow up to work in a textile factory. I \nwould much rather have them work in a BMW plant or high-tech factory or \nother kinds of employment for which we can provide the training and \neducation.\n  I hope the Senator understands the fact that Americans have profited \nby free trade enormously. Yet we can still address the specific \nproblems that result from dislocated workers. That is what free trade \nis all about. That is why I believe this Nation will continue to \nprosper when we have free trade agreements consummated between \nourselves and our neighbors. We should be concerned about the economy \nof countries such as Colombia because their narcotraffickers can take \nover that country and export their goods, which are drugs, into this \none.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I look forward to a renewal \nof our spirited discussion which we have had for many years, always \nmarked by respect for the views of the junior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. There \nis no question that they are better jobs, but textiles are very good \npaying jobs at $10 and some odd cents an hour. Those are middle class \nAmericans.\n  The Senator is correct, facts are facts. That is why this particular \nSenator, as Governor some 40 years ago, went to Europe to get that BMW \nplant. I didn't get BMW at that particular time. Since that time, in my \ntravels to Germany, we now have in South Carolina 117 German plants in \nmy little State. So, yes, we have gotten way better jobs. We have \ncontinued to work on that.\n  But I would just address a few comments with respect to the need for \nthe trade bill. I heard my distinguished leader earlier today. He \noutlined the need for the trade bill. He said: Wait a minute, you have \nto understand, after all, these are just singular examples that I had \ngiven earlier in the morning's debate with respect to Vietnam and \nJordan. Those are just one country. He said: But when you have \nmultilateral countries, it is sort of hard to get them all together and \nthen get an agreement, then bring it back to the Congress and have \namendments.\n  Not so. The Andean trade agreement we are now discussing involves \nseveral countries. Without fast track, we have listed in the 2001 Trade \nPolicy Agenda and 2000 Annual Report by the U.S. Trade Representative, \nsome 100 different agreements. I have gleaned many of them. Of course, \nthe African Growth Opportunity Trade Agreement, involved a few dozen \ncountries. We got that without fast track. We told President Clinton we \ndidn't want to abdicate our responsibility in regulating foreign \ncommerce.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, says the Congress shall \nregulate foreign commerce. It doesn't say the President, or the Supreme \nCourt, but the congressional branch, the legislative branch. We were \nnot going to abdicate that authority, which we are being asked to do at \nthe present time.\n  We didn't do it. And to refute that argument with respect to the \nmultilateral requirements, the Caribbean Basin Initiative with nine \ncountries; the chemical weapons treaty, of course, that we debated \nduring the Clinton administration, there were over 100 countries; the \nsemiconductor agreement with the European Union, the United States, \nJapan, and Korea, more than a dozen countries joined in that one \nwithout fast track; the telecommunications agreement with the Asia \nPacific countries, that was more than a dozen countries involved there; \nthe international tropical timber agreement with numerous countries, \nthe United States; Central American Regional Trade Investment Agreement \nin November of 1998, there were nine countries; the WTO \ntelecommunications agreement in 1997, that was some five dozen \ncountries. So was the WTO financial agreement in 1999. I could go on \nand on.\n  Don't be sold a bill of goods about the difficulty of fine points and \nnumerous countries. That happens right regularly, and that is why you \nhave trade agreements, and that is why we have been able to get over a \nhundred during the past 10 years alone.\n\n  Now, Madam President, the next point that was made was that the \nUnited States has only 4 percent of the world's consumers. Of course, \nright to the point, the distinguished leadership is confusing the \npopulation with numbers of consumers. What we are really interested in \nis that 4 percent. Those who are opposing fast track are interested in \nthose 4 percent of consumers because, unless you have a job and are \nmaking a living, we have consumers going out of business. That is the \nstopping, the cessation of consumption that has this economy in a funk.\n  I just had a gentleman, from SBC Communications, telling me how his \nstock had gone down. I said: Meet the group. MCI has changed leaders \ntoday. So you have all of these telecommunications companies that are \nhigh-tech, and more growth, and they are in a funk because we don't \nhave manufacturing, we don't have jobs. We have been exporting jobs \nfaster than we can possibly create them. The United States also has the \nmost skilled and productive workforce in the world--what is left?\n  I pointed out here, with respect to the steel, that I commend \nPresident Bush for his recent actions. Mr. McNamara, the former \nSecretary of Defense and head of the World Bank, went running all \naround to the Third World\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nemerging countries telling them they could not become a nation state \nunless they had steel--the capacity to produce steel for the weapons of \nwar and the tools of agriculture. As a result, I look outside my office \nin Charleston at the dock, and they are off-loading Brazilian steel for \nconstruction all over the Southeast. Some 20 miles away is Nucor, the \nmost productive, modern, competitive steel plant in the world. But how \ncan they compete when the Brazilians are dropping steel off at less \nthan cost on the dock there in Charleston. The rules are not being \nenforced.\n  What we need is not a free trade policy, we need competitive trade; \nwe need to go back to the word itself--``trade''--something for \nsomething. Not aid. That is what the Andean thing is all about down \nthere with Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia. They are saying: Look, get \nout of the drug business. That is what this initiative is about. Get \nout of the drug business and grow pineapples and bananas and that kind \nof thing.\n  I went and asked--in one of the meetings where I was getting a \nbriefing in Bolivia a few years ago--what about this growing of \npineapples. He looked at me and laughed. He said: You think I am going \nto struggle growing pineapples when I can get a little crop going and \nmake a whole year's income in a week's time, when it would take a year \nwith the pineapple crop, and have to worry about the weather?\n  He said: With these drugs, you don't worry about the weather.\n  Incidentally, he pointed out on the map an area as big as Georgia. He \nsaid: That is off limits for the Bolivian policy. We can grow anything \nwe want to there.\n  Let's get into these trade agreements in depth and find out what is \ngoing on. The tail of the drug war is wagging the trade policy of \nAmerica. I went up 14,000 feet to La Paz and they were chewing the \ndrugs walking up and down the street. Oh, we had a wonderful thing. We \nhad conquered a little bit of it. We had not conquered much. What was \nin Bolivia went into Colombia, and it gets into Peru and Ecuador--those \nfour countries. The United States has one of the most open markets in \nthe world. Well, that is exactly what they all argue, and everything \nelse, that our open market is going to open their closed markets. In \nthe 1990s, they argued that if we get these trade agreements, we will \nopen the markets. We have yet to get into Japan or Korea.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent--is the Senator from Arizona \nready to speak?\n  Mr. KYL. I am. But if the Senator wants to close, that is okay.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield from my time 10 minutes to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will complete this quickly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent to \nbe recognized following Senator Kyl's presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have to respond to Senator \nKyl because this deals with Senator Leahy's committee.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I might suggest this: Probably Senator \nReid and I will have a colloquy over a series of unanimous consent \nrequests that I will make. I will just count that on my time. When I am \ndone, I will certainly have no objection to the Senator from North \nDakota speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the colleagues in the Chamber for allowing me \nto have a few more minutes. I wanted to make an important point.\n  Ten years ago, in 1992, they said that is what we needed, just \nexactly what they said--to open up the markets. We would get these \nagreements to open up the markets. So here is a booklet by the Special \nTrade Representative on foreign trade barriers, and it equaled some 262 \npages. Now, after we have gotten the NAFTA agreement, which was to open \nup markets, and after we have gotten WTO, which is a multilateral \nagreement--incidentally, let's find out how many markets have been \nopened. The book now has gone from 262 pages to 455 pages. It has \ndoubled.\n  We have doubled the foreign trade barriers. All these wonderful free \ntrade agreements were supposed to open up the markets. You continually \nhear that, but that isn't what occurs. Twelve million export-related \njobs are manufacturing jobs. There are less than 17 million \nmanufacturing jobs left in the country. Manufacturing has gone from 26 \npercent of the workforce 10 years ago to 12 or 13 percent today. The \nexport-related jobs pay 13 percent to 18 percent more. Definitely, the \nmanufacturing jobs do pay more. The union jobs, in a general sense--\nsuch as the Longshoremen and the AFL-CIO--are the ones opposed to fast \ntrack, vigorously, because they are exporting their jobs out from under \nthem.\n  The balance of trade--you cannot turn back the clock on trade any \nmore than on technologies; namely, typewriters versus computers. This \nis the old argument about, wait a minute now, we went from the horse \nand buggy days to the automobile, and now in trade we are going from \ntypewriters to computers.\n  Here is a sample of the U.S. trade deficit in the world. We have a \n$20 billion deficit in the balance of trade with computers. We have a \ndeficit in the balance of trade with cellular telephones, pacemakers, \nnight vision equipment and other telescopes, and electrocardiographs. I \ncould go on and on. The idea that, son, you don't understand, we are \nmoving into globalization, and we have moved now from typewriters to \ncomputers. I told the story years ago as a witness.\n  I was told: Look here, let them make the clothing and the shoes. We \nwill make the airplanes and computers. The truth is they are making the \nshoes and clothing and the airplanes and computers.\n  Finally--and I am trying to close down for my distinguished friend \nfrom Arizona. In the 1990s, we liberalized trade and saw record \neconomic growth and job creation, some 20 million new jobs created from \n1994 to 2000, and without fast track.\n\n  I do not know who got these points up for the distinguished leader \nabout why we need it, because, yes, we had wonderful economic growth, \nbut we had that without fast track. That was due to another measure \nthat we passed in 1993.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nArizona.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, and I ask that the record reflect my agreement with my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, on this matter. Since I have agreed with \nSenator Reid to discuss another matter, I will simply indicate at a \nlater time I will make remarks concerning both the Andean trade bill as \nwell as trade promotion authority.\n  There is another matter which is very timely. As a matter of fact, it \nis important we speak on it now because there is scant time to get some \nvery important business done in the Senate, which has to do with the \nconfirmation of judges but more specifically the holding of hearings on \njudges because they cannot be confirmed until there has been a hearing \non them. For too many of our judges, we do not even have hearings \nscheduled.\n  It would be one thing if we waited 2 or 3 months after a nomination \nto schedule a hearing, but I am speaking of people who have been \nnominated now for almost an entire year and there has never been a \nhearing scheduled for them. I am going to take a minute or two to talk \nabout who they are.\n  I will quote briefly from a Washington Post editorial and then \npropound a series of unanimous consent requests that will perhaps move \nus toward the hearings we need to get these judges confirmed.\n  Preliminarily, Democrats and Republicans can both cite a lot of \nstatistics about judges confirmed under one administration or another, \nand can pat themselves on the back about a job well done. But it seems \nto me one thing stands out that is unmistakably clear, and that is when \nthe President has nominated a distinguished American to serve on a \nFederal district court or, in this case, a Federal circuit court of \nappeals, and the Senate does not deign to\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\ngive those people a hearing for over a year, something is wrong.\n\n  There is no excuse for holding someone for a full year. It has now \nbeen a year, minus 1 week, since the President made his first circuit \ncourt of appeals nominations, 11 in all. Eight of them have never had a \nhearing.\n  Quoting briefly from this Washington Post article of April 22:\n\n       It has been nearly a year since President Bush nominated \n     his first batch of judges.\n\n  Parenthetically, that was done on May 9, 2001.\n\n       Of the initial group of 11 appeals court nominees, 8 have \n     still not had hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     Two of these nominees are of particular local interest: John \n     Roberts and Miguel Estrada. Both have been nominated to the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which currently has 4 of its \n     12 seats vacant. Both, on the surface anyway, seem well \n     qualified, having done extensive appellate work in the \n     solicitor general's office and in private practice. Both have \n     high profile bipartisan support. Yet neither has moved. And \n     while Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has said \n     that Mr. Estrada will receive a hearing this year, he has \n     pointedly failed to promise the same for Mr. Roberts.\n\n  Skipping part of the editorial to two other quotes:\n\n       Nominees should receive timely consideration out of \n     deference to the President, out of respect for the \n     institutional needs of the judiciary, and out of a sense of \n     fairness to the individuals. But delays are particularly \n     objectionable when nobody will even come forward to make a \n     case against the nomination.\n\n  The final three sentences of the editorial:\n\n       If there is a case to be made against either nominee, the \n     onus is on opponents to make it and its proper forum is a \n     hearing. If there is no case, the Senate should move to a \n     vote. Either way, further delay is not the answer.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post editorial dated \nMonday, April 22, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2002]\n\n                           Give 'em Hearings\n\n       It has been nearly a year since President Bush nominated \n     his first batch of judges. Of the initial group of 11 appeals \n     court nominees, eight have still not had hearings before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee. Two of these nominees are of \n     particular local interest: John Roberts and Miguel Estrada. \n     Both have been nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, which currently has four of its 12 seats vacant. \n     Both, on the surface anyway, seem well qualified--having done \n     extensive appellate work in the solicitor general's office \n     and in private practice. Both have high-profile bipartisan \n     support. Yet neither has moved. And while Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has said that Mr. Estrada will \n     receive a hearing this year, he has pointedly failed to \n     promise the same for Mr. Roberts.\n       Mr. Leahy is in a tough spot. He has taken a beating for \n     his handling of judicial nominations, a beating that is \n     largely unfair. The Senate has confirmed 45 judges since he \n     took over the committee, which is a respectable pace. He \n     certainly has not yet begun to match the obstructionism with \n     which the same Senate Republicans who now criticize him \n     managed the confirmation process while they were in charge of \n     it. Neither, however, has he entirely restored dignity and \n     fairness to it. Rather, like his predecessor Orrin Hatch (R-\n     Utah), he is allowing individual nominness to sit around with \n     no explanation for what are turning out to be long periods of \n     time. These delays are hard to justify under any \n     circumstances. Nominees should receive timely consideration \n     out of deference to the president, out of respect for the \n     institutional needs of the judiciary, and out of a sense of \n     fairness to the individuals. But delays are particularly \n     objectionable when nobody will even come forward to make a \n     case against the nomination.\n       So far, anyway, nobody has made a serious case against Mr. \n     Roberts or Mr. Estrada--neither of whom has an extensive \n     public record of statements or writings to criticize. Liberal \n     groups have complained that Mr. Roberts, as a lawyer for the \n     government, helped write briefs that argued against abortion \n     rights. The more general anxiety seems to be that both men \n     are young, talented conservatives who could upset the D.C. \n     Circuit's ideological balance. It is true that President \n     Clinton's nominees to the D.C. Circuit were held up also--as, \n     incidentally, was Mr. Roberts when he was initially nominated \n     by the elder President Bush, But government by tit-for-tat is \n     an ugly spectacle. If there is a case to be made against \n     either nominee, the onus is on opponents to make it and its \n     proper forum is a hearing. If there is no case, the Senate \n     should move to a vote. Either way, further delay is not the \n     answer.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will indicate the names of these 8 nominees, and I will \npoint out that of the 11 who were nominated by the President on May 9, \n2001, 3 have been confirmed. Two of those were judges previously \nnominated by President Clinton, and I think that is interesting. The \nJudiciary Committee chairman is willing to move people who were \nnominated by President Clinton but not by President Bush. So when we \ntalk about nominees of President Bush having been confirmed to the \ncircuit court of appeals, remember that two of the three of this \ninitial group were originally nominated by President Clinton.\n  The eight nominees who have languished before the committee are the \nfollowing, and they are individuals all of extraordinary experience, \nintellect, and character:\n  John Roberts is a nominee to the DC Circuit. He is one of the leading \nappellate advocates in the United States, having argued 36 cases before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. He served as Deputy Solicitor General. I doubt \nthere is another lawyer in this country in the Solicitor General's \nOffice who has argued 36 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Miguel Estrada is nominated to the DC Circuit. He has argued 15 cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court, worked as a Federal prosecutor, as \nAssistant Solicitor General, and a Supreme Court law clerk. He came to \nAmerica as a teenager, spoke virtually no English and, if confirmed, \nwould be the first Hispanic ever to serve on the DC Court of Appeals.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen, who is a nominee to the Fifth Circuit, has \nserved on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994. In her successful \nreelection bid in 2000, every major newspaper in Texas endorsed her.\n  Michael McConnell is a nominee to the 10th Circuit. He is one of the \nNation's leading constitutional scholars and lawyers. His reputation \nfor fairness and integrity has generated support from hundreds of \nDemocrat law professors across the country.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is a nominee to the Sixth Circuit, another of \nAmerica's leading appellate lawyers. He graduated first in his class \nfrom Ohio State Law School, has gone on to argue over 20 cases before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court and State supreme courts, and served as the \nsolicitor in the State of Ohio.\n  Justice Deborah Cook is also a nominee to the Sixth Circuit. She has \nserved as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court since 1994 and, before \nbecoming a judge, was the first woman partner at the oldest law firm in \nAkron, OH.\n  Judge Dennis Shedd, a nominee to the Fourth Circuit, was unanimously \nconfirmed to be a Federal judge in 1990. He is strongly supported by \nhis home State Senators, Democrat Hollings of South Carolina and \nRepublican Thurmond of South Carolina. He served in the past as chief \ncounsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Finally, Judge Terrence Boyle, a nominee to the Fourth Circuit, was \nunanimously confirmed to be a Federal district judge in 1984. The \nformer chairman of the State Democratic Party supports Judge Boyle's \nnomination, stating that he gives everyone ``a fair trial.''\n  On January 25, Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy indicated that \nJustice Priscilla Owen, Michael McConnell, and Miguel Estrada would \nreceive hearings this year. Each has waited nearly a year for a hearing \nand more than 2 months for a hearing since this statement.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist recently stated that the present judicial \nvacancy crisis is alarming and, on behalf of the judiciary, implored \nthe Senate to grant prompt hearings and to vote these nominees up or \ndown.\n\n  I conclude by showing two things. On this chart it shows the \nPresident's rate of judicial confirmations by the Senate, comparing \nPresident Clinton and President Bush. The red line ends at exactly 11 \nmonths after each President nominated his first nominees. These are \nboth district and circuit court nominees.\n  By the end of 11 months, President Clinton had 67 percent of his \nnominees confirmed. President Bush, 11 months after his first nominee \nwas made, only had 44 percent of his confirmed. At the end of 14 \nmonths, as it shows, President Clinton had 90 percent of his nominees \napproved--14 months after the first nomination was made. At the rate we \nare going, President Bush will be lucky to have 50 percent.\n  Let's be specific about circuit court nominees because I think this \nis even\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nmore telling. This chart shows the circuit court confirmation rates by \nthe Senate. Again, after 11 months, President Bush has had 31 percent \nof his circuit court nominees approved by the Senate. By contrast, 63 \npercent of President Clinton's nominees were approved to the circuit \ncourts after 11 months, and 14 months after he made his first nominee, \n86 percent of President Clinton's nominees had been approved by the \nSenate. At the rate we are going now, we are obviously not going to get \nto 86 percent. We cannot get the confirmation until we have had a \nhearing. It would be reasonable to expect hearings to be held on the \neight nominees within a year of the time they were nominated. Whatever \nthe record of success, whatever the number of hearings that have been \nheld for district court nominees, whatever else one might say, there is \nabsolutely no excuse for not even scheduling a hearing on a circuit \ncourt nominee for a full year after that nominee was nominated by the \nPresident.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I have a unanimous consent request to propound, and I expect a \nfulsome response from the Senator from Nevada. I ask unanimous consent \nno later than May 9, 2002, the Judiciary Committee shall conclude \nhearings on each of the eight nominations remaining of those made by \nPresident Bush on May 9, 2001, to the United States Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nnumber of things to say. I don't mean to detain people unnecessarily, \nbut I don't think this is unnecessarily. I will take some time. The \nSenator from Arizona is welcome to stay or not. I have something I want \nto say regarding this issue.\n  One thing I want to say in my reservation, and I will save the rest \nas I get the floor, I have the greatest respect for my friend from \nArizona, a man who is an outstanding lawyer. I knew of Jon Kyl's legal \nreputation in Nevada. I knew of him in Nevada because of his reputation \nin Arizona as a lawyer. He was good at a lot of things.\n  One of the things we look to Jon Kyl for with respect is his great \nknowledge of water law. In the arid Southwest, when a lawyer \nunderstands water rights, someone in the legal profession, someone who \nbears a standard, one whom others look up to--not many people know \nwater law.\n  The point I am trying to make is that the Senator from Arizona is a \nfine lawyer. He is a fine Senator. But I want to remind him as to one \nof the things he spent a little time discussing today, the DC Court of \nAppeals--Senator Kyl discussed the need to fill vacancies in the DC \nCircuit--President Bush has nominated two people to the circuit court. \nBecause they have been nominated by President Bush, my friend from \nArizona, the lawyer whose credentials I have already established, has \nchanged his tune. Lawyers can do that. When they do, sometimes you have \nto bring it to them.\n  On March 19, 1997, for President Clinton we were trying to get \napproved a man by the name of Merrick B. Garland, a lawyer from \nMaryland, to be a U.S. Circuit judge for the District of Columbia.\n  The Senator from Arizona said, among other things, when responding to \nSenator Sessions: Like my colleague from Alabama, my colleague from \nIowa, and others, I believe the 12th seat on this circuit does not need \nto be filled. I am quite skeptical that the 11th seat, the seat to \nwhich Mr. Garland has been nominated, needs to be filled, either. The \ncase against filling the 12th seat is very compelling and it makes me \nquestion the need to fill the 11th seat.\n  He goes on to say: In the fall of 1995, the court subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing on the caseload of the D.C. Circuit. \nJudge Silberman pointed out that the courtroom normally used for en \nbanc hearings seats only 11. In other words, that is all they can \naccommodate.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona, 4 or 5 years ago, thought \nthere was no need to have these seats filled in this circuit court. But \nhe has changed his tune now because we have a different President.\n  For this and other reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the kind remarks that \nthe Senator from Nevada made about my law career, and I do appreciate \nthat sincerely. He knows of my affection for him.\n  Before I make my next request, I point one thing out with respect to \nwhat the Senator from Nevada said about my opposition to filling the \n12th position on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. At that time, there \nwere two vacancies. He correctly read my remarks. I said I didn't think \nwe needed to fill the 12th, and I had questions about the 11th. But \nthere are now 4 vacancies, and I don't think there is any doubt we need \nto fill numbers 9 and 10. When we get up to No. 11, maybe I will have a \nquestion still, and I might even not support filling the 12th. But that \nwas a totally different situation because we were talking about the \n12th and final vacancy.\n  Here we have four vacancies, and I have advocated that we fill two of \nthem.\n  In view of the objection that was heard, let me ask my colleague if \nhe would agree to the following, and I propound this request: I ask \nunanimous consent no later than May 9, 2002, the Judiciary Committee \nwill conclude hearings on at least seven of the eight remaining of \nthose nominations made by President Bush on May 9, 2001, to the D.C. \nCircuit Courts of Appeals.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I don't often smile on the \nSenate floor, but I really have to smile at this request. The reason I \ndo that is I had a Senator come up to me today and say: Why are we \nvoting on all these judges? We voted on four judges last week. We voted \ntwo judges today.\n  I have other things I will say, but I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the objection.\n  We have voted on several judges. I am talking about holding hearings \non judges nominated over a year ago, not voting on them; just holding a \nhearing and trying to hold the hearings before the anniversary day.\n  In view of that objection, let me propound this request: That no \nlater than May 9, 2002, the Judiciary Committee shall conclude hearings \non at least six of the eight nominations remaining of those made by \nPresident Bush on May 9, 2001, to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we could go through 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. I \nobject.\n  I reserve the right to object in this instance because the Judiciary \nCommittee is working very hard. Let me lay the foundation.\n  Senator Leahy became chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In fact, we \ndidn't organize--he became chairman sometime in July or August--because \nwe had trouble getting the organization going after we took control of \nthe Senate. Immediately after he became chairman of the committee, \nhowever, 9-11 occurred, and a short time after that, anthrax in Senator \nDaschle's office basically closed up one office building and that took \ncare of half the Senators.\n  In spite of 9-11, the new leadership role that Senator Leahy \nobtained, and the anthrax scare, he went ahead and held all kinds of \nmeetings of the Judiciary Committee. I attended one in the basement of \nthe Capitol. There we had a circuit court judge, Judge Pickering. I \nremember that very well because I had one of my Nevada judges there. I \ntestified for my judge. It was very crowded. Senator Leahy was \ncommended, as he should have been, for holding the hearing. There was \nreally no room.\n  Senator Leahy has gone to great lengths to make the Judiciary \nCommittee one that functions well. I will lay out in some detail what \nhe has done to maintain the Senate's proper role in the selection of \njudges. Remember, the Judiciary Committee had the lead role in a number \nof other very important items following September 11. The work that we \ndid with antiterrorism legislation was all done in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Leahy, with his counterpart, Senator Hatch, worked \nnight and day for weeks to get that done. We finally got it passed. It \ntook an inordinate amount of time.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, with the deepest respect, Senator \nLeahy and the Judiciary Committee are going to hold hearings. They have \nalready held hearings.\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\n  As I have said on this floor on a number of occasions: This is not \npayback time. If it were payback time, we would not have already \napproved 52 Federal judges since Senator Leahy took over that \ncommittee. But we have approved 52 Federal judges.\n  If it were payback time, we would not be holding any hearings. \nRemember, we had judges who waited more than 4 years for a hearing. We \nare not going to do that.\n  People who are selected by the President of the United States to be \njudges, whether they are trial court judges or circuit court judges, \nare going to have hearings. I assume there would be some exceptions, \nbut I can say, with little reservation, Senator Leahy is going to hold \nhearings for all these people and in as timely a fashion as he can.\n  I therefore object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in deference to the Senator from Michigan who \nis here, I gather, to speak, instead of going through the numbers of 5, \n4, 3, let me just see if I could get my colleague to agree to this \nbecause we do have a full week left. I am a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and I can tell you, we have not been that busy. We have had \nplenty of opportunities for hearings. These eight nominees have been \nsitting around for a year, and none of them has had a hearing. We could \neasily have a hearing for two of these nominees before the anniversary \ndate of 1 year from their nomination by the President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no later than May 9, 2002, the Judiciary \nCommittee shall conclude hearings on at least two of the eight \nnominations remaining of those made by President Bush on May 9, 2001, \nto the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can assure the Senator from Arizona and \nanyone within the sound of my voice that Senator Pat Leahy is going to \ndo the very best he can in holding hearings for all nominees, not only \ncircuit court but trial court judges. As to whether or not he can \ncomplete two judges within the next week--the next 9 days is what it is \nbecause tomorrow is May 1--I really cannot tell Senator Kyl whether \nthat will take place.\n  But I know the Senator from Vermont is going to do the best he can. I \nheard him in a conversation today, right here. He was right here \nbecause he was at the leader's desk this morning talking about the \njudges whom we approved. I heard him talking to a Senator regarding a \ncircuit court judge, that he would do a hearing in the immediate \nfuture. Immediate is pretty quick. I know that will be done.\n  With respect and the knowledge that Senator Leahy is going to move it \nforward as quickly as he can, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. I think I know the answer to this, but it would certainly be \npossible for us to have a hearing on one nominee. As a member of the \ncommittee, I think it is doable, I can tell you. I think it is only \nfair that Senator Leahy pick out one of these people and have a hearing \nfor him or her 12 months after their nomination.\n  So, out of desperation, I ask unanimous consent that no later than \nMay 9, 2002, the Judiciary Committee shall conclude hearings on at \nleast one of those nominations remaining of those made by President \nBush on May 9, 2001, to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, my friend should not be \ndesperate. This is not a desperate situation. I am not on Senator \nLeahy's committee. I can't speak for his committee. But I have some \nresponsibility to try to see that the Senate operates in an orderly \nfashion, especially things that go on here in the Chamber. I am \nconvinced Senator Leahy will do everything he can to move these men and \nwomen forward who have been nominated.\n  Remember, I am sure we have had at least 52 hearings. We have 52 \njudges who have moved forward during the last few months. That is \npretty good. So it is not as if there is a so-called stonewall. He is \ndoing the best he can.\n  I say with some degree of apology to my friends from Michigan and \nKansas, I am going to speak for a few minutes on the judges situation, \nso I think they should rest their legs for just a little bit because I \nam going to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I guess in light of this last objection, as \nthe lawyers say, I will rest my case. I think I have made my point. I \nhope we can have this conversation again in the next 2 days. Having had \nan opportunity to confer with Senator Leahy, I hope the Senator from \nNevada will have better news for us, but especially for the eight \nnominees who have been languishing now for a full year, and we can \nquickly move to have a hearing on at least some of those nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we consider \nan increase in the minimum wage no later than June 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, Mr. President. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I made my case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, the assistant \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and the time count against the 30 hours, postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just last week, as I indicated, the Senate \nconfirmed its 50th judicial nominee. Today we got two more judges. This \nhas happened in less than 10 months since the change in majority. More \nof President Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed in less than \n10 months than were confirmed in all 12 months of 4 of the 6 years \nRepublicans controlled the Senate.\n  I have always been very dubious of numbers because even as one who \ndid not have a degree in engineering or did not do much in the way of \nmath in high school or college, I can still do a lot of things with \nnumbers. We can manipulate numbers--you know that is easy to do. We can \nhave all kinds of numbers games. I will run through a few numbers here \nthis evening on judges.\n  The thing I want everyone to know is that Chairman Pat Leahy is an \nhonorable man. He represents a very small State in population, the \nState of Vermont. He takes a very close look at everything that affects \nVermont. He does a great job for Vermont.\n  One reason I have so much respect for Chairman Leahy is his view is \nof more than the State of Vermont. He has a national view. He has been \na Senator for a long time, the first Democratic Senator ever elected \nfrom the State of Vermont.\n  He has been able to represent that State so well, but also do a good \njob for our country. A lot of times that is not easy to do, but he has \ndone that.\n  He has been chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I served on the \nAppropriations Committee. He has been chairman of that very volatile \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations, foreign aid--the committee from \nwhich people run. He doesn't run from that or anything else. He is a \nvery courageous man, Pat Leahy.\n  I only say that because we can do all kinds of things with numbers. \nMy friend on the other side of the aisle can bring out fancy little \ncharts and say this happened. I can bring them here and talk about what \nhas happened. But I want everyone to look for just a minute in their \nmind's eye at Pat Leahy. Does he want to leave a legacy in the Senate \nthat he was the kind of person who would not approve people who are \nqualified lawyers who want to become Federal judges? The answer is no.\n  Pat Leahy also before he came here was a prosecutor, a lawyer. He was \na good one. He was a young man. But that is why he got elected to the \nSenate, because he was a great prosecutor.\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\n  Look at Pat Leahy a little bit. Put yourself in his role. He wants to \nbe recognized as somebody who runs the Judiciary Committee in a fair \nmanner. I do not know of anyone who could question his honesty, his \nintegrity, and therefore I say let's not really worry about all these \nnumbers.\n  I can make a case with numbers. I think he has done more than he \nphysically should have done, because it has just been so hard for him \nto do that. I talk about the committee hearing. My colleagues \ncomplained that we have only approved--I don't know how many circuit \njudges he said. But we had hearings on them. Pickering had a hearing. \nHe couldn't make it out of committee. That is more than they gave our \npeople.\n  He said some people on May 9 will have waited a year. Well, that is \ntoo long, and I recognize that. But it is not 4 years.\n  More than 50 of President Clinton's nominees never even got a vote. \nOthers waited years to be confirmed. Still others languished for years \nand many months before a hearing and then no vote. They had hearings \nand never had a vote in the committee. The Judiciary Committee never \nvoted. Where were the Republican voices of concern then?\n  Under Republicans, total court vacancies rose from 63 in 1995 to 110 \nin July 2001, when the committee reorganized, and circuit vacancies \nmore than doubled from 16 to 33. The Republicans caused all the \nvacancies about which they are now complaining.\n  I had a big murder case when I practiced law. A young man shot his \ntwo parents. It was a very serious case, to say the least. But today \npeople still joke about that case. There isn't anything to joke about. \nIt is the old standard joke that you have heard a thousand times: He \nwas now an orphan. He pled for the mercy of the court because he was an \norphan. He killed his parents.\n  That is about what we have here. Republicans caused these vacancies. \nVacancies continue to exist on the courts of appeals, in part because a \nRepublican majority wasn't willing to hold a hearing or vote on more \nthan half--56 percent--of President Clinton's circuit nominees in 1999 \nand 2000, and was not willing to confirm a single circuit judge during \nthe entire 1996 session.\n  This is like somebody who kills his parents and then asks for mercy. \nThey ask for mercy because they are an orphan.\n  They helped create these vacancies.\n  I repeat: On more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's \ncircuit nominees in 1999 and 2000, the Republicans were not willing to \nhold hearings and vote on them. In 1996, not a single circuit judge was \nconfirmed. Some of the vacancies they are talking about go back to \n1990, 1994, and 1996. They refused to fill the vacancies.\n  Under Senator Leahy's leadership and Senator Daschle's leadership, \njudicial vacancies are going down, with 50 judges confirmed--as I \nindicated last week, it is now up to 52--including 9 circuit judges. \nThat is more than were confirmed in all 12 months of 4 of the 6 years \nof Republican control. As of April 29, there were 90 vacancies, and 29 \nof them were circuit.\n  The Senate has already devoted a week in March to Senator Lott's \namendment, No. 3028, to the energy bill. One reason it took the energy \nbill so long is we had a week of time on the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution demanding that those nominated last May 9 have a hearing by \nMay 9. The Senate, of course, rejected this, as it should have done. An \nalmost unanimous Senate supported, instead of the second-degree \namendment to that resolution, the committee's continued fair treatment \nof judicial nominees and its efforts to schedule and hold regular \nhearings on judicial nominees.\n  That is what we said we would do. That is what Senator Leahy is \ndoing. The Judiciary Committee has continued its efforts in accord with \nthe Senate resolution which passed this body. The Judiciary Committee \nheld 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominees. That is more hearings \non judges than the Republican majority held in any year of its control \nof the Senate. They were considered en bloc form rather than one or two \nat a time. In effect, we have had at least 54 hearings.\n  I say that really skewing numbers a little bit because in some \nhearings more than one person was brought before the committee.\n  That is more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in \nany year of its control of the Senate.\n  I repeat: The Judiciary Committee had 17 hearings in less than a \nyear, and that is more than held in any year of the Senate when the \nRepublicans controlled it.\n  Rather than berating the Judiciary Committee, I commend Senator Leahy \nand the members of that Judiciary Committee for doing the good work \nthey have done. Remember, they have more responsibility than just \napproving judges. The Republican leadership never followed a ``first \nin, first out'' rule. As the former chairman said in 2000, ``If \nnominees were only considered in the order they were nominated, the \nprocess would grind to a halt as more qualified nominees would back up \nbehind the questionable nominees.'' That makes sense.\n  The Democratic leadership has been working hard to process the \nnominations of qualified, noncontroversial nominees to address the \nvacancy crisis caused by previous Republican obstruction and inaction.\n  We are carefully reviewing the records of those nominated last May, \nas well as other nominees. All but one of those nominated last May 9 \nwere chosen by the President without any consultation with both parties \nin the Senate. In spite of that, we have already expedited and \nconfirmed three of them.\n  One of the May 9 nominees lacks home-State consent. Surely the \nminority is not suggesting overriding the Senate tradition of consent \nor what we call blue slips from both home-State Senators. Senator Orrin \nHatch--a dear friend--would never agree to that when he was chairman. \nHe would never consider that. The other seven appear to be relatively \nmore controversial nominees who require a great deal of background \nresearch. They will have hearings, but more work needs to be done. If \nthe committee fails to do this thorough investigation of these men and \nwomen who would serve for life, it fails its job to the rest of us.\n  When these nominations come here, I depend on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I am not a member of that committee. I assume that if there \nis a problem with one of them, someone is going to provide that for me. \nIf they don't and something comes up later, I am going to be very \nupset, as well as Senator Leahy and the other members of that \ncommittee. They need to take the time to do the job right.\n  Five of the May 9 nominees were nominated to seats that have been \nheld vacant for years and years by Republicans. Well-qualified Clinton \nnominees to those seats were blocked by Republicans, including two \nwell-qualified gentlemen active in the Hispanic community in Texas: \nEnrique Moreno and Judge Jorge Rangel; three distinguished lawyers from \nthe African-American community: James Wynn and James Beatty of North \nCarolina, and Elan Kagen; and other nominees with equally outstanding \ncredentials, such as Kent Markus of Ohio and Allen Snyder of the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I would like to take just a little bit of time to pay our colleagues, \nour Republican counterparts, the courtesy of making sure that this \nrequest for unanimous consent for immediate action on Bush nominees is \nOK with them, including the anonymous Republican Senators who held up \nvotes on Clinton nominees such as Bonnie Campbell, Judge Margaret \nMorrow, and many of the circuit court nominees who languished for years \nwithout ever receiving even a vote in committee.\n  The deep concern now expressed about vacancies was oddly silent when \nthe minority--then the majority--was blocking more than 50 judicial \nnominees.\n  Some Republicans held these seats open for years for another \nPresident to fill. That President is President Bush. They wanted to \nsave these seats for a Republican President. Maybe some thought these \nwould be judicial activists for their agenda and would tilt the balance \nof numbers on these circuit courts to give Republican appointees a \nmajority, with the hope of winning through these activists what they \nwere not been able to win at the ballot box.\n  One of the people for whom I have the greatest respect--he is my \nfriend, he has great Nevada roots, and he has all kinds of family in \nNevada--is Karl\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nRove, a close confidant of the President. He has given speeches to \nconservative groups talking about he wants what he refers to as \nconservative judges. He has a right to say that. But that is why \nChairman Leahy has an obligation to look and make sure these people are \nqualified and that they have more credentials than just simply being \nconservative.\n\n  Advice and consent does not mean giving the President carte blanche \nto pack the courts. The committee's evaluation of nominees is a \ncritical part of the checks and balances of our democratic Government \nthat does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to one \nperson alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, to \npack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the mainstream, \nand whose decisions would further divide our Nation.\n  President Bush has singled out Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, the \nSupreme Court's most conservative Judges, as model Judges. Well, isn't \nit interesting he would do that. He has chosen Scalia and Thomas as \nmodel Judges. I wonder if that had anything to do with the decision \nthey made dealing with Florida when they, in effect--there are not only \narticles written--lots of those--but there are books written of how \nScalia steamrolled the other Judges. And Scalia elected George Bush \nPresident. Well, no wonder he thinks he is a model judge. I think if he \nselected me as President, as he did President Bush, I would also \nprobably think he was a model.\n  The committee is acting responsibly. The Judiciary Committee, led by \nPat Leahy, is acting responsibly in its consideration and scheduling of \nnominees. We would be able to move more expeditiously on nominees if \nthe White House were acting in a bipartisan way, by nominating more \nconsensus nominees to these lifetime judgeships, conferring with the \nJudiciary Committee, conferring with home State Senators.\n  Even with the partisanship of the White House and the Republicans, \nSenator Leahy's Judiciary Committee has had more confirmations of \ncircuit court nominees in less than 10 months than were confirmed in a \nsimilar period for Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and the first President \nBush.\n  Nine circuit court judges--consensus nominees--have been confirmed in \nless than 10 months. This is more confirmations of circuit nominees of \nPresident George W. Bush than in the first 10 months of the Reagan, \nBush I, and Clinton administrations combined.\n  We also have the best pace of confirmation in recent history. The \nDemocratic-led Senate is averaging 5 confirmations per month, as \ncompared with 1.6 per month during Bush I, and 3.1 per month and 3.6 \nper month for President Clinton and President Reagan, even though they \nhad Senate majorities from their own party.\n  So that is why I have objected to these motions. Chairman Leahy and \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee should be commended for reforming the \nprocess and practices used during the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican \nleadership. We are holding more hearings for more nominees than in the \nrecent past. We have moved away from the anonymous holds that so \ndominated the process from 1996 through 2000. We have made home State \nSenators' blue slips public for the first time.\n  The Democratic leadership and Majority Leader Daschle should be \ncommended and not attacked with these unfair claims and motions.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to my friends, especially the Senator from \nMichigan, whom I know wishes to address the Senate. I also apologize \nand extend my deep appreciation to the Senator from Florida for his \nusual courtesy in remaining in the chair so the Senator from Michigan \ncan speak. I am personally very grateful to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I indicate to our leader from \nNevada that he is certainly welcome to take whatever time is necessary \nto talk about this very important issue and to set the record straight. \nI very much appreciate the Senator being able to do that in such \narticulate terms so that it is very clear that we, in fact, are moving \nahead in a way that, frankly, has been unheard of when we have had a \nPresident of one party and the Senate majority of another party in \nterms of confirming judges.\n  So I certainly associate myself with the Senator's comments and very \nmuch appreciate his advocacy.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about an issue that is \nincredibly important. It is probably one of the most important \nchallenges facing our families today; and that is the question of the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  I cannot think of a more important issue facing older Americans, who, \non average, use 18 different medications in a year, or a more important \nissue facing families, who, for example, may have a disabled child, or \na more important issue for anyone who is struggling and does not have \ncoverage under their insurance policy for prescription drugs.\n  We know that right now, even as we are at the dinner hour on a \nTuesday evening, there are seniors who are sitting down at their \nkitchen table and deciding: Do I eat supper or do I take my medicine?\n  We are the greatest country in the world. I say shame on us for our \ninability to address this issue and to have a Medicare prescription \ndrug plan that lowers the costs for everyone. This is an issue that now \ntouches every part of our economy.\n  Today, I met with the leadership of Michigan Blue Cross-Blue Shield. \nYesterday, I met with people who are involved with hospitals and home \nhealth care agencies and nursing homes.\n  I meet with small business owners who cannot afford to keep their \ninsurance for their employees because the costs are going up 30 \npercent, 40 percent a year, and the majority of that is the \nuncontrolled costs of prescription drugs. I meet with the big three \nautomakers, and I hear the same thing.\n  These costs are out of control. There is no accountability, and it \naffects every part of our economy and the lives of too many Americans.\n  So I rise this evening to ask our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, and to ask the President of the United States, to join with us \nin a serious effort--not words, not efforts that look as if they do \nsomething on paper but do not really solve the problem--but to join \nwith us in a serious effort to provide a comprehensive prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare that is long overdue, and to join with us \nin a number of issues and a number of strategies to lower the costs of \nprescription drugs for every American.\n  I find it extremely frustrating, when we know that American taxpayers \nunderwrite much of the research--certainly the initial basic research \nthrough the National Institutes of Health for new prescription drugs, \nnew technologies, new cures--and I certainly support that. I support \nthe fact that we allow research tax credits and deductions. And \ntaxpayers subsidize those efforts as well. It is important for us.\n  But I am very frustrated that after we have patents that are given \nfor 15 years, 20 years, to companies to recoup their costs, when they \ndo not have to have competition, we create a way for them to come up \nwith these new, wonderful drugs that are lifesaving, and yet, at the \nend of the line, Americans pay more than anyone in the world--and that \nis not an exaggeration--for those drugs. If someone is uninsured, \nHeaven help them--which the majority of seniors are in this country--\nbecause when they walk into the pharmacy, they are paying the highest \nprescription drug price of anyone in the world.\n\n  Tomorrow, we are going to start Older Americans Month. And I say \nagain, shame on us for not addressing this issue in a comprehensive \nmanner.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with us in a number of efforts. One, we \nwant to make sure that generic drugs are more available and that we \nclose loopholes that are now used by the companies to change patents or \ndo other things that stop generics from coming on the market even \nthough it is the same--a very comparable drug--at a dramatically \nreduced price. We certainly have legislation right now in the Senate \nwhich Senator Schumer and Senator McCain have put forward that needs to \nbe addressed.\n  We also need to do something about the explosion of advertising. \nSince the FDA changed the rules a number of years ago on direct \nconsumer advertising, I daresay you can't turn on your\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\ntelevision set in any 5-minute increment and not see at least one \nadvertisement for a prescription drug. They are nice ads. Many of them \nare very pretty. But we pay a heavy price for that advertising.\n  We also pay a heavy price for the promotions that are going on in the \ndoctors' offices and all of the effort that goes into this question of \nadvertising rather than putting the money into research for more \nlifesaving drugs.\n  We want to address that in the Senate, and we ask our colleagues to \njoin with us to stop this spiraling situation where right now there is \ntwice as much being spent on advertising in this country, advertising \nand promotion of prescription drugs, than on research to create new \nlifesaving drugs. We intend to put forward proposals to do that in the \nnext week.\n  I specifically wish to talk for a moment about S. 2244, an effort my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and many of us have joined \nin to provide another way of creating cost savings; that is, to open \nthe border to Canada. I find it ironic that at the time we are creating \nopen trade, fast track, a trade bill on the floor of the Senate, we \nhave in place walls at the border of Canada. And coming from Michigan, \nwhere it is 5 minutes across the bridge, 5 minutes across the tunnel, \nthis is a very real wall where we are told, based on legislation passed \nback in the 1980s, that even though you can get your medications made \nin America, FDA approved, safe drugs, my citizens in Michigan or those \nfrom Florida or anyone cannot go 5 minutes across that Ambassador \nBridge or that tunnel and lower their cost because of a law that was \nput in place to protect our companies from competition.\n  We believe, those of us who have put forward S. 2244, that the wall \nneeds to come down. If we are going to talk about open trade, we should \nnot close trade. We should not be allowing lack of competition on \nprescription drugs. If we did that, we could see amazing changes \nimmediately. It would not cost money other than probably a small amount \nas it relates to the FDA. We are not talking about any large sum of \nmoney to be able to open the borders and immediately we could lower \ncosts 40 percent, 50 percent or more.\n  I took two different bus trips to Canada to demonstrate, as other \ncolleagues have, the cost differences, working with the Canadian \nMedical Society, going through a Canadian physician and a Canadian \npharmacy to demonstrate the differences in the prices for prescription \ndrugs. I wanted to share with you some of those differences.\n  Zocor is a drug for high cholesterol. In Michigan, it is $109 a month \nfor the prescription; it is $46.17 in Canada--$109 versus $46.\n  Even more dramatic is Tamoxifen. We had women on our bus trip with \nbreast cancer. In Michigan, they are paying $136.50 a month for \nTamoxifen. In Canada, they purchased it for $15.92--$136 versus $15.\n  There is something seriously wrong when our citizens are having to \npay such a large amount of money when compared to other countries, \nparticularly our Canadian neighbor to the north, and at the same time \nthey are having to juggle all of the other expenses in their life, and \nmany people are not being able to purchase Tamoxifen or Zocor or \nPrilosec, all of the other drugs where there is such a disparity.\n  I invite colleagues tonight to join with us in supporting S. 2244, to \nbecome cosponsors, to join with us in an effort to say that we are \ngoing to open the borders; we are going to create competition; and we \nare going to make sure Americans who underwrite so much of the cost of \nthe new medications being developed every day have the opportunity to \nget the very best price.\n  We need to do that. It is long overdue. From my perspective, there is \nno excuse at this time not to proceed to support this effort to open \nthe border, to create new opportunities for generic drugs, to make sure \nwe are addressing the high cost of advertising and to put some sense \naround that, and promoting research rather than more advertising. These \nare all items that need to happen, and they need to happen now.\n\n  My biggest concern is that we don't have the same sense of urgency in \nthe Congress that I hear from my own family, from neighbors and \nconstituents I represent in Michigan. This is not a theoretical debate. \nThis is real. This is about whether or not people will be able to live \nlonger because they can benefit from the medications being developed \nwith the help of taxpayers or whether they are going to struggle every \nday to decide whether to eat, to pay the utility bill, or to get their \nmedicines they so desperately need.\n  We can do better. Our older citizens, our families, our children, our \nbusinesses wanting to cover their employees for health care costs \ndeserve better. We have an opportunity to do that in the Senate and to \nsay to everyone: We have really done something that will make a \ndifference in the lives of the people we represent. I suggest the time \nis now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wanted to echo the eloquent \ncomments the Presiding Officer, speaking in her capacity as the Senator \nfrom Michigan, has spoken about, a problem that is so rampant today.\n  Medicare was designed 37 years ago in 1965. Think of the condition of \nhealth care at that time. It was centered around acute care in \nhospitals. Thus, as we designed the system which would be a health \ninsurance system for senior citizens to assist with medical expenses, \nwhat were most of the medical expenses? In 1965, they were expenses \nthat were attendant to hospital care and physician services that often \noccurred in and around the hospital. Medicare Part B was set up for \nadditional expenditures, primarily physician expenditures. That has \nserved our senior citizens so very well, as a health insurance system \nat the time that they knew they needed health care, when, as we get \nolder, things don't quite work as they did when we were 21.\n  Over that 37 years we have had these wonderful, I call them, miracles \nof modern medicine that have occurred through technology, through \nresearch, through the ingenuity of American enterprise. And as a \nresult, we now have a health care system that produces prescription \ndrugs that can often cure our ailments when compared with the state of \nmedical care 37 years ago.\n  I talk about that little bit of history to follow the comments of the \nSenator from Michigan because it is instructive for us as to why we \nneed to modernize the Medicare system 37 years later and now provide a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  There is no question in the State of Florida, with our abundance of \nwonderful, vibrant senior citizens, that people want Medicare \nmodernized with a prescription drug benefit. Clearly, in the election \nof 2000, I talked about it, and I know both of the candidates for \nPresident talked about it in the State of Florida--indeed, they had \nsigned up to the idea that we were going to be spending--then the \nfigure was $300 billion to $350 billion over a 10-year period. That is \nwhat was thought to be the expenditures to give a fairly substantial \nFederal Government investment for providing prescription drugs to those \nwho were eligible as senior citizens under Medicare. And here we are, a \nyear and a half after that election, and we still have not enacted it.\n  The administration has come forth with a proposal for $190 billion \nover 10 years. That is not going to cut it because that is not what was \npromised. With the explosion of the cost of prescription drugs, the \ncost of that prescription drug benefit over the next decade might well \nbe in excess of the $300 billion to $350 billion that we talked about \nduring the campaign of 2000. So we ought to be addressing it here.\n  In the meantime, the Senator from Michigan has pointed out other ways \nthat we can start addressing the cost of prescription drugs. Why could \nwe not address a system by which we could suddenly pool the various \nneeds and start buying in bulk and, therefore, bring down the cost per \nunit? That is a common economic principle. So as we approach a \ndiscussion of whether we are talking about trade or whether we are \ntalking about judicial appointments, we need to constantly remind \npeople about the promises and the expectations in the election for \nPresident in the year 2000, and those statements were very clear in the \nState of Florida,\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\nwhich became so critical for the outcome of the election.\n\n\n                              Andean Trade\n\n  Madam President, since we are on the trade bill, I want to make a few \ncomments about a tremendous dilemma that I have with regard to this \ntrade bill. I am a free trader. I am for free and fair trade. That has \nbasically been the kind of voting record that I have had in the last \nyear and a half. I believe that a State such as my State, Florida, \nwhich is so affected by being not only a microcosm of America but now \nso much of a microcosm of the Western Hemisphere, will benefit \neconomically by free and fair trade.\n  The dilemma in which I find myself, as does my colleague--my senior \ncolleague, wonderful colleague, Senator Bob Graham--is that the very \npremier industry of Florida, the citrus industry, the very industry \nwhose symbol graces all of our license plates on our vehicles in \nFlorida--the Florida orange--is threatened if we don't take action on \nan amendment in this bill.\n  What I have said is that I support free and fair trade. What we find \nis that, with the concentrated, frozen orange juice production, the \ncountry of Brazil has 50 percent of the world consumption of \nconcentrated orange juice. Florida has 40 percent of the world's \nproduction, and that is primarily servicing the needs of the domestic \nmarket in the United States, a large part of which has been created as \na result of the advertising over the last five decades by the \nFlorida Citrus Commission, so that now orange juice is a regular staple \nof the diet at the breakfast table in America each morning. So it is 50 \npercent Brazil, 40 percent Florida, and the remaining 10 percent is \nspread throughout the rest of the planet.\n\n  The problem is that it is not free and fair trade if Brazil is \nallowed to undercut because of Brazil growers colluding into a cartel, \nundercutting the price of Florida, and dumping additional product on to \nthe market. If there is not tariff protection for the Florida citrus \nindustry, Brazil will be participating not in free and fair trade, but \nBrazil will have taken over the market and they will have a monopoly. A \nmonopoly is exactly what we want to get away from in global economic \nmarkets. We want the crosscurrents of economic competition to bring the \nbest product at the lowest price. That is not what is going to happen.\n  So the dilemma that my senior colleague, Senator Graham, and I find \nourselves in is wanting to support the administration on the trade \npromotion authority or, as some people call it, the fast track, where \nthe administration can negotiate the agreement without every little \ndetail having to be approved, except when the final agreement has to \ncome back to the Congress, which I think is a step in the right \ndirection, and facing the Hobson's choice that if we do so without an \namendment that would protect this industry from a monopoly from foreign \nshores, our major citrus industry would be facing a life or death \nchoice.\n  Now, that is not an easy choice for this Senator. So I call to the \nattention of the Senate the fact that Senator Graham and I will be \noffering an amendment that doesn't specifically just speak to Florida \norange juice but says that if there is an order by the International \nTrade Commission against dumping by companies or by a country, or if \nthere is a countervailing duty as a result of an order by the \nDepartment of Commerce because foreign competition is subsidized by a \nforeign government and therefore it is not free and fair trade--if \nthere is an order from either one of those two, whatever the commodity \nis, the tariff cannot be reduced until 1 year after that order by the \nDepartment of Commerce, or that order by the International Trade \nCommission has been removed, because that noncompetitive practice has \nbeen eliminated by that foreign country or those foreign corporations.\n  In other words, if we want to have free and fair trade and there is \nan order that another country is not being free and fair, we are not \ngoing to put the American industry at the disadvantage of having the \ntariff lowered so that anticompetitive action in that foreign country, \nagainst which there is already an order, is not able to protect that \nindustry in America.\n  I am not just talking about orange juice. I am talking about steel. I \nam talking about salmon production in the Northwest. I am talking about \nhoney production in Montana. I am talking about any commodity where \norganizations such as the Department of Commerce or the International \nTrade Commission say there is anticompetitive behavior, and therefore \nthere is an order against that anticompetitive behavior; if that order \nis in place, then you cannot reduce the tariff.\n  That seems to me common sense. Therefore, there is no reason the \nadministration should not accept Senator Graham's and my amendment. Yet \nthey will not. Just today Senator Graham and I talked to the Secretary \nof Commerce: Well, we will look at it. I understand. That is a polite \nway of saying: No, we do not agree.\n  I have talked to people about this amendment until I was blue in the \nface. I have talked to the chief lobbyist for the White House as to why \nthis is so important to Florida, which happens to be important to this \nadministration. I have talked to members of the Finance Committee to \nget them to understand why this is so important, not only to Florida \nbut to other States with regard to steel, salmon, and beekeepers in \ntheir honey production.\n  The fact is, the administration thinks it has the votes. In fact, it \nthinks it is filibuster proof; that it has more than 60 votes for this \ntrade bill. Therefore, there is no willingness to engage in a \ndiscussion with Senator Graham, me, and others about adding this \namendment, as they did so vigorously in the House when, several months \nago, they passed the trade promotion authority bill by the razor thin \nmargin of one vote.\n  I can tell you, Madam President, it will not only be tonight, but I \nwill continue to speak until my face, to use an old southern \nexpression, turns blue. I will continue to speak every opportunity I \nhave as we go about considering this trade bill over the course of the \nnext 2 to 3 weeks.\n  I hope there are folks in the White House who are listening. The \nState of Florida has a great deal at stake in this debate. It is not \nthat we are asking for any special protection; we are asking for free \nand fair trade. We do not want another country to have a monopoly of a \nsingle product that is so very important to our State of Florida.\n  Madam President, neither you nor I expected to be here at this late \nhour, but it was an opportunity for us to say something that is very \nimportant to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \nbusiness, the trade promotion authority bill. I will be brief.\n  I believe I am the only Member of the Senate who has worked in the \nTrade Representative's office. In 1991, I had a wonderful experience as \nwe were negotiating several major treaties at that time. Without \nqualification, for the United States to engage in more trade \nnegotiations and more trade agreements is positive.\n  There will be sectors in the United States that have difficulty. That \nis why we have trade assistance provisions, to make those transitions \nbetter. But overall, for the U.S. consumers and the U.S. economy, trade \npromotion, reducing barriers and tariffs--and tariffs amount to nothing \nmore than taxes; tariffs are taxes--this is a positive action for U.S. \nproducers and U.S. consumers. Not that it is uniform for everybody, but \nfor the overall economy this is positive. It has been positive and \nremains positive.\n  Narrowly for my State, the State of Kansas, where we have a lot of \nagricultural exports, where at least 1 out of 3 acres goes to the \nexport market, the international market is a critical market for us. A \nlot of our livestock goes to the international marketplace. It is a \nvery important part of our business.\n  Aviation is a main part of our industry. Much of that goes into the \ninternational marketplace as well.\n  This is positive. It is probably the best thing we can do at this \ntime, on top of the tax cuts, to stimulate the U.S. economy, and \nexpansion of our broad-band access is a third issue that can stimulate \nthe overall economy. Trade is a key one. It is broadly supported in \nthis body. It is not supported by everybody, but overall it has a \nstrong base of support and that is because our economy is built on \ntrade\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nand so much of our opportunities to expand this economy are built on \ntrade. The trade needs to be both free and fair.\n  I hope we can get a strong vote for trade promotion authority to \nencourage the President to engage in substantial trade agreements with \nkey trading partners of the United States so we can aggressively move \nour economy forward and out of the sluggish position and the negative \ngrowth we had last year and continue strong, positive growth.\n  I wish to talk narrowly about a particular provision I would like to \nsee us take up, and I will be putting forward an amendment with regard \nto this issue, and that is expansion of trade in central Asia. I am \nreferring to those countries known as the ``stans,'' that were under \nthe Soviet Union--Kazakhstan; Uzbekistan became more familiar to us in \nthe war on terrorism; Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, \nTajikistan as well. We need to enter into permanent normal trade \nrelations with these nations.\n  As we seek to engage them, as we seek to work closer with them in the \nbattle on terrorism, as we seek to engage them internationally, \nparticularly Kazakhstan on expanded oil production and gas production \nso we are not as dependent on the Middle East for oil, it is very \nimportant that we engage them in the area of permanent normal trade \nrelations; that we are able to give to them the same status we give to \nvirtually every country trading with the United States around the \nworld.\n  They are key countries. They are key in the battle on terrorism, as \nwe have already seen. They are key in our energy diversity. I am hoping \nwe can get more of our energy production at home. That is what we \ndebated over the last 5 weeks.\n  We also need to diversify our source of energy. One of the key areas \nto which we can go is Kazakhstan and also Azerbaijan. We need to have \npermanent normal trade relations to expand that energy supply and \nexpand that energy exchange.\n  They want to grow with us. Some are trying to pull them into being a \nradicalized militant state against the United States. There are forces \nin several of these countries seeking to do that. One of the best \nthings we can do with them is to broadly engage them economically.\n  We have the opportunity, but we do not have PNTR with these nations \nin the central Asian region. We do with Georgia, we do with Kyrgyzstan, \nbut not the other countries I named.\n  I will be putting forward an amendment, hopefully with a number of \ncosponsors, that is going to be modeled after the Central Asian Trade \nAct of 2002. In this bill, we would like to bring up the issue of PNTR \nwith these central Asian countries.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this carefully, critically, and \nwith an eye to what is best for this region and what is best for the \nUnited States.\n  In our battle on terrorism, it is best we be engaged with these \ncountries. In our battle to diversify our energy sourcing, it is best \nwe be engaged with these countries. For their stability in this region \nof the world long-term, it is best that we are engaged. One of the \nprerequisites for us being able to do that is PNTR.\n  I am quite hopeful we can take this up; that it will be a \nnoncontroversial amendment; that it can be accepted, passed, and that \nwe can move this on through so we can get PNTR for central Asia and we \ncan start working so we are not engaged in this region militarily, pull \nout of the area, then we see more militant activity buildup and we have \nto go back in. Rather, let's be engaged in this region on a long-term \nbasis so we do not have to go in episodically, with billions of \ndollars, and try to clean up a problem that evolved over a period of \ntime.\n  This is one we can head off at the pass. We can deal with this, we \nshould deal with this, and I am hopeful we are going to be able to take \nthis amendment up on PNTR for central Asia during this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as the Senate debates the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act, ATPEA, I wish to call attention to another \nissue vital to the long term success of the Andean nations in the world \neconomy.\n  International arbitration was created in order to mitigate the risks \nof overseas investment due to political consideration and capricious \nchanges that can affect legal institutions. It gives investors and \nsovereign nations an agreed-upon mechanism to resolve disputes. \nArbitration is a key building block to attract foreign investment, \npromote modernized legal systems, and provide for the kind of legal \neconomy that we are seeking to foster with this legislation.\n  For this reason, Congress stipulated in the recent Andean Trade \nPromotion Act, ATPA, that beneficiary countries were required to \nrecognize as binding and enforce international arbitral awards in favor \nof U.S. citizens and companies. I am concerned that the U.S. Government \nhas not done enough to ensure that one beneficiary in particular, \nColombia, has lived up to this requirement. Before Congress passes new \nlegislation on this matter, shouldn't we hold countries accountable for \nviolating this criterion under the previous legislation?\n  Unfortunately, Colombia has a disturbing trend of disregarding \nbinding arbitration rulings. The Colombian Government has refused to \nabide by rulings of arbitration tribunals that are unfavorable, \nlaunching aggressive campaigns to undermine arbitration. It has \nutilized the inefficiencies of its internal legal structures to avoid \npayment. This blatant disregard for arbitration harms companies that \nhave already invested in Colombia, dissuades others from investing much \nneeded capital, and violates the qualification criteria for ATPA and \nATPEA.\n  In one case, a 22-month binding arbitration tribunal, agreed to by \nthe Colombian Government, ruled that Colombia must pay $61 million due \nto what it defined as reprehensible behavior and breach of contract. \nDespite concerns raised by Members of Congress, the Colombian \nGovernment has refused to even discuss the issue with the American \ncompanies. The cost to the Colombia economy in lost international \ninvestment due to this lawless behavior may be greater than any aid \nthat we can provide, and indeed, raises questions about U.S. aid.\n  For these reasons, I call on the President of the United States and \nthe U.S. Trade Representative in particular to hold Colombia, and any \nother country that fails to uphold the qualification criteria for \nATPEA, to the letter of the law under consideration today. The \nadministration is seeking expanded trade benefits, but it should first \nrequire that Colombia implement the rulings of arbitration panels. To \ndo otherwise would undermine the intended effect of this legislation in \nlifting these developing nations to the status newly industrial \ndemocracies governed by the rule of law.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise today to address the House version \nof the Andean Trade Act (H.R. 3009). First, I strongly support fair and \nfree trade. Second, I favor granting the President trade promotion \nauthority. Third, I believe that certain improvements can be made to \nhelp workers who lose jobs due to international competition. And \nfourth, I do believe the current Andean Trade Act should be extended.\n  However, as currently drafted, this is an Act that could have an \nadverse impact on the people of Virginia. In particular, Southside \nVirginia has been especially hard hit the past few years by the loss of \ntextile and apparel jobs. Textile manufacturers in the United States \nare finding it more difficult, if not impossible, to compete with the \nlow cost of overseas labor and limited environmental protection laws.\n  We must fully consider the potential impact of this Andean Trade \nproposal rather than rush into a convoluted procedure for voting on \nunrelated, albeit important, issue. The men and women involved in the \nmanufacturing and production of textile and apparel products are \nsuffering. We need to find ways to help these individuals, not bring \nadditional heartache. The House version of this bill unnecessarily \nincreases the amount of non-U.S. yarn and fabric coming into our \ncountry. The existing law has been sufficiently beneficial.\n  The U.S. textile and apparel industry, which employs 1.4 million \npeople and accounts for 8 percent of all workers in our country, has \nfallen on hard times. Over the past five years, the textile industry \nhas lost about 180,000 jobs,\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\nnearly one-third of the industry's workers. During this same time, \nthere have been at least 220 textile plants that have closed their \ndoors and ceased operations.\n  Last year alone, 116 mills closed in the United States. The workers \nat these locations lost their jobs as domestic producers struggled to \ncompete with cheaply priced imports. As a matter of fact, almost \n140,000 textile and apparel employees have lot their jobs in the last \n15 months.\n  Just yesterday, DuPont Textiles and Interiors announced that it will \nbe reducing its workforce by more than 2,000 employees worldwide. \nUnfortunately, 200 of those workers will be from Virginia.\n  Also in Virginia, we've lost Tultex, VF Imagewear, and Pluma. And, \nBurlington Industries in Pittsylvania County, which makes synthetic and \nwool products, has been forced to eliminate thousands of jobs.\n  As you know, the Andean nations are well known for their production \nof these products as well. Burlington and others will no doubt be \nimpacted by the increase of products into our nation from these Andean \ncountries.\n  My vote to oppose cloture is to take a stand for the right of \nSenators to fully consider the House version of this bill and offer \namendments. As I have stated, I am a firm believer in free and fair \ntrade agreements that will, on balance, benefit millions of Americans. \nBut what has been happening in the textile and apparel industry is not \ndesirable for the people of Virginia.\n  One aspect of trade is that some workers will almost inevitably have \nto move to other jobs. When workers are displaced, we must reasonably \nhelp ease the impacts of international competition. A bill I introduced \nlast year, the Homestead Preservation Act (S. 1848) can assist these \nworkers who have lost jobs due to international competition. This \nproposal would provide workers who have been displaced from their jobs \nbecause of international competition to become eligible for a secured \nloan so that they my continue making their mortgage payments on their \nhome for up to one year while they find new employment.\n  In summation, I strongly support trade promotion authority to tear \ndown tariffs and barriers to American products, goods and services. But \ntrade promotion authority ought to be considered separately from the \nextension of the Andean Trade Act. I, nevertheless, look forward in the \nnext few weeks to working with my colleagues to fully examine the House \npassed version of the Andean Trade Act and am hopeful that the Senate \nwill pass a version that is not so harmful to U.S. textile jobs. My \nvote on procedure is to allow Senators the opportunity and right to \ncalmly review, debate and revise the House passed version of the Andean \ntrade bill without the confluence and distraction of other issues that \nshould be addressed separately.\n  In the end, we need to pass three separate bills dealing with trade \npromotion authority, trade adjustment assistance, and the Andean Trade \nAct. Each of these measures should be accorded individual scrutiny, \namendment and ultimate passage. Indeed, the tactic of merging these \nissues together can result in the House rejecting the most important of \nall three--trade promotion authority. This ploy to join all these items \ntogether can culminate in the unfortunate failure to pass any of these \nmeasures this year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to H.R. 3009.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business and the time run against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have used this illustration on other \noccasions--I hope not too many, but I know I have used it before--and \nthe reason I do it is, for me, it is illustrative of what is taking \nplace in the Senate.\n  When I was a little boy, I lived in a small town in southern Nevada. \nI had a brother who was 10 or 12 years older than I, and he got a job \nwith Standard Stations one summer. That was a big deal for us. He was \nout of high school, and they transferred him to Las Vegas to be an \nassistant manager to a service station in Ask Fork, AZ. As a little \nboy, I never traveled anyplace, and he agreed to take his little \nbrother to Ask Fork, AZ. Oh, I was excited about going there. I do not \nknow how long he spent there, probably about a week or 10 days, but \njust the anticipation of the trip was really amazing because I had \nnever been anyplace.\n  So I went to Ask Fork, AZ. It was a little railroad town in Arizona, \nvery large compared to where I was raised, in Searchlight. When I \narrived there, I learned my brother had a girlfriend. I thought he was \ngoing to be taking me every place, but he did not take me anyplace \nbecause he had this girl with whom he was involved.\n  He did take me to meet her little brother, who was about my age. So I \nspent a lot of time with him. I have never forgotten that because it \nwas his house and they were his games and his equipment. Every game we \nstarted to play, I could beat him; it did not matter what it was. But I \nnever won anything because he kept changing the rules so I could never \nwin.\n  I went home, having seen a lot of the world, at least in my eyes--Ask \nFork, AZ--having spent a week or 10 days with this boy about my age, \nand had never been victorious in anything because, I repeat, every time \nhe would change the rules in the middle of the game anytime I was \nbeginning to win.\n  I bring that to the attention of the Senate because that is what we \nhave going on in the Senate now is the same kind of a deal with \nterrorism insurance. It does not matter what we do; it is not good \nenough. We start with this, we try that. Okay, that sounds good. We \noffer it in the form of a unanimous consent agreement. Well, that is \nnot quite right; I think we had better change this. No, we cannot agree \nto allow you to bring that to the floor.\n  Weeks have gone by, and we now have no legislation in the Senate to \ndeal with the serious problem the country is having. I will bet the \nPresiding Officer has had people call her and come to see her--\nrealtors, people from banks and other financial institutions, insurance \npeople, developers--saying: Senator, why have you not done something \nabout terrorism insurance? My construction job cannot go forward. The \ninsurance companies will not write me insurance.\n  They have come to me, and I have responded the way I think we all \nhave: Well, this is something we should try to do something about.\n  Senator Daschle has been trying to get something to the Senate. He \nhas worked with Senator Dodd, he has worked with Senator Hollings, he \nhas worked with Senator Sarbanes, and we have agreed to bring \nlegislation to the floor. Last Thursday, I offered a unanimous consent \nagreement. I am not going to do that tonight--there is no one present \nfor the minority--but I would like to, and I should. I would like to \nhave them again object to the unanimous consent request to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. We have also gone to the extreme. We first \nstarted out by saying: Why don't we have two amendments? They said: We \nwant more than two. We said: How about four? Now we are at four \namendments.\n\n  I cannot understand why we cannot do that. There is something about \nthe bill that people do not like, have an up-or-down vote with an \namendment.\n  We attempted to move the Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer bill last December. \nThere was no disagreement about the base bill, but over the amendments \noffered and the time to dispose of the amendments. On April 8, we tried \nto get another agreement to take up the legislation, and there was no \nobjection to base text. The Republicans always agreed to the underlying \nDodd-Sarbanes as the vehicle to bring to the floor. Now the objections \nare no longer about the number of amendments and the time agreements, \nbut they are opposed to bringing it up.\n  A strange thing happened last June. The Democrats took control of the \nSenate. It is a slim margin, but we still have control of the Senate \nand we control the agenda. The minority might\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nnot like that but that is the way it is. That is the rules of the \nSenate. Therefore, Senator Daschle has a right to determine what \nlegislation is going to be brought forward. The majority leader \ndetermines what bills are brought to the floor. If the minority is \nopposed, they have a right to offer amendments and attempt to modify \nthe text of the bill. When it comes to terrorism insurance, this does \nnot seem acceptable.\n  I want the world to know--because I don't want anyone from Nevada to \nthink I am doing anything to hold up this legislation, or that any \nDemocrat is doing anything to hold up this legislation; we are not--we \nare ready to legislate on terrorism insurance. As I have said, we have \noffered to bring up the bill with four amendments on each side. It \ngives everybody an opportunity to make the changes they seek. They \nobject to this. The legislation is must-pass legislation. We need to \nget it out of here and get it to conference.\n  The White House says publicly they desperately want us to do \nsomething. They should weigh in with the Republican Members of this \nSenate and help move something forward. Treasury Secretary O'Neill \ntestified today that the lack of terrorism insurance could cost 1 \npercent, at least, to gross domestic product because major products \nwill not get financing due to lack of insurance.\n  It is not just insurance companies increasing their policies or \nchanging them. Banks are refusing to finance large projects because \nthey lack insurance coverage. Policies are going through the roof or \nthey are excluding terrorism from the coverage. This has a devastating \neffect on the economy, and it will get worse.\n  I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to review \ntoday's testimony from Secretary O'Neill before Senator Byrd and the \nAppropriations Committee. The time to act is now. We can take up this \nlegislation and move it very quickly or we can continue to keep \nchanging the rules in the middle of the game and wind up with nothing. \nThat would be very bad for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in a period of \nmorning business; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to respond to a recent \nrecommendation by the Administration to end fixed-rate consolidations \nof federal student loans in order to address a $1.3 billion shortfall \nin Pell Grant funds.\n  I fully agree with the President that we need to fund the Pell Grant \nprogram. But, as a constituent of mine in Montana recently said, ``It \nmakes no sense to rob Peter to pay Pell.'' Pell Grants are just one of \nthe federal government's efforts to help students afford the rising \ncosts of a college education. Moreover, Pell Grants are only available \nto low-income students.\n  Importantly, the federal government offers a variety of student aid, \noften in the form of subsidized or low-interest loans, to extend help \nto low- and middle-income students and families that don't qualify for \nPell Grants. In fact, many Pell Grant recipients must also apply for \nloans in order to meet their education costs. These loans offer hope to \nstudents as they seek the advanced education, exposure to new ideas, \nand acquisition of new skills they require to secure good paying jobs.\n  We need to be consistent in sending that message of hope to students. \nIn fact, we need to be more vigilant in sending that message in states \nlike Montana, where the average cost of attending a public university \nhas increased by 228 percent for in-state students and 257 percent for \nnon-residents over the past 10 years. Those increases mean larger \nstudent loans, larger student debt, and greater student sacrifice. And \nI am very concerned about the kind of sacrifices Montana students must \nmake to pay back an $18,000 student loan in a state whose average per \ncapita income barely surpasses $20,000.\n  Simply put, we need to do more to help students invest in themselves, \nnot less. Offering a fixed-rate interest on consolidated loans helps \nstudents; eliminating that option places additional financial stress on \nstudents. Good common sense tells me that we can not close this door on \nour students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3555-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3555-S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOL WEEK\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last Thursday I joined my \ncolleagues, Senators Lieberman, Hutchinson, Carper and Bayh, in \nintroducing S. Res. 254, a resolution to designate the week of April \n29th through May 2, 2002 as National Charter Schools Week. This year \nmarks the 10th Anniversary of the opening of the nation's first charter \nschool in Minnesota. In the last ten years, we have come a long way \nsince that auspicious moment when one teacher collaborating with \nparents started a school specifically designed to meet the needs of the \nstudents in the community.\n  Today, we have well over 2,000 charter schools serving approximately \n579,000 students. Charter schools are immensely popular: two-thirds of \nthem report having waiting lists, and there are currently enough \nstudents on waiting lists to fill another 1,000 charter schools.\n  Charter schools are popular for a variety of reasons. They are \ngenerally free from the burdensome regulations and policies that govern \ntraditional public schools. They are founded by principals, teachers \nand parents who share a common vision on education. Perhaps most \nimportantly, charter schools are held accountable for student \nperformance.\n  Since each charter school represents the unique vision of its \nfounders, these schools vary greatly.\n  For example, in South Central Los Angeles, two former union teachers \nfounded the Accelerated School, a charter school designed to serve \nstudents from the community. Students attending the school outperform \nstudents from neighboring schools. In fact, student performance at the \nAccelerated School exceeds district-wide average performance levels. \nOriginally a K-8th grade school, the founders are now planning on \nadding a high school.\n  In Petoskey, Michigan, the Concord Academy provides an arts-focused \ncurriculum that infuses the arts into the overall curriculum. The \nschool has a 100 percent graduation rate which exceeds the graduation \nrate for the suburbs. The Concord Academy also spends an average of \n$2,500 less per student than traditional public schools. Like many \ncharter schools, they are getting greater results using less money.\n  These are but a handful of the success stories in the charter school \nmovement.\n  I expect that we will see the popularity of charter schools continue \nto grow. Last year, the President signed into law the No Child Left \nBehind Act, which gives parents in low-performing schools the option to \ntransfer to another public school. The Act also provides school \ndistricts with the option of converting low-performing schools into \ncharter schools. I believe these provisions will strengthen the charter \nschool movement by creating more opportunities for charter school \ndevelopment. And, as parents exercise their right to school choice, the \ncall for charters schools will grow.\n  I commend all those involved in the charter school movement. They \nhave led the charge in education reform and have started a revolution. \nA recent study found that charter schools have had a positive impact on \nschool districts. Districts with a large number of charter schools \nreported becoming more customer service oriented, creating new \neducation programs, many of\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nwhich are similar to those offered by charter schools, and increasing \ncontact with parents.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit a charter school this week to \nwitness firsthand the ways in which these innovative schools are making \na difference, both in the lives of the students they serve as well as \nin the community in which they reside.\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate \nResolution 254, which designates April 29 through May 3, 2002, as \n``National Charter Schools Week,'' and was passed by unanimous consent \non April 25, 2002. I am an original cosponsor of this resolution with \nSenators Lieberman, Gregg, and Carper, and I am proud to support our \nNation's charter schools and highlight their impact on effective school \nreform across the country.\n  Charter schools are laboratories of reform and excellence. By \nallowing increased flexibility and autonomy, charter schools are able \nto implement new ideas, while still being held to high standards. \nCharter schools are also public schools, and must serve disadvantaged \nstudents and students with disabilities, often doing so with increased \nsuccess. Studies have shown a link between increased student \nachievement and enrollment in charter schools. Most importantly, \nparents and communities are satisfied with charter schools, evidenced \nby two-thirds of charter schools having waiting lists.\n  The charter school movement continues to move forward as more and \nmore states have passed laws authorizing charter schools. My home state \nof Arkansas is in the early stages of implementation, with six charter \nschools open at the beginning of the 2001 school year.\n  With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act earlier this year \nand our continued support for charter schools across the country, we \nare saying to our parents, teachers, and students that our efforts are \nfocused on increased academic achievement for all children. I hope that \nthe charter school movement continues to grow and spurs innovation and \nreform to strengthen our nation's public school system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3556-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON'S DAILY CARDINAL ON \n                         ITS 110TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison's Daily Cardinal newspaper on its 110th \nyear of independent publication. As a proud UW alumnus, I can attest to \nthe Cardinal's tradition of public service and exceptional journalism.\n  Since 1892, student journalists at The Cardinal have gained valuable \nreporting experience while covering some of the country's most \nimportant news, from the declaration of war in 1941 to the events of \nSeptember 11. The Cardinal's achievements have been recognized by the \nLos Angeles Times and Associated Collegiate Press and the Society of \nProfessional Journalists, who named The Cardinal's Election 2000 \ncoverage the Nation's best. Their excellence is further evidenced by \nthe accomplishments of outstanding alumni like CNN correspondent Jeff \nGreenfield and ESPN chief of correspondents Andy Katz.\n  The Daily Cardinal is a source of pride for UW-Madison students past \nand present, and the State of Wisconsin. I commend The Cardinal for its \naccomplishments and look forward to celebrating its future \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3556-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO SCOTT HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 17 \nmembers of the Scott High School Science Olympiad team for winning this \nyear's state Science Olympiad Tournament on April 20 at Western \nKentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Next, the team will \nhave the unique opportunity to compete in the national competition at \nthe University of Delaware on May 18.\n  Throughout the state competition, the students had the chance to \ncompete in a variety of events covering all areas of science including: \nbiology, chemistry, physics, anatomy, and mathematics. Some of these \nevents required projects to be built in advance and taken to the \ncompetition while others include laboratory testing and other more \nconventional means of testing. I firmly believe that this competition \nwas an extremely beneficial experience for all involved. The students \nhave acquired useful and applicable information on a variety of \ninteresting and engaging subjects while learning the importance of \nteamwork and competition. In order for Kentucky to keep up with the \nrapid pace of the scientific community, students, like those at Scott \nHigh School, must possess the desire to learn in depth about such \ntopics as mathematics, biology, physics, and be able to apply this \nknowledge outside of the classroom.\n  I once again congratulate the Scott High School Science Olympiad team \nfor their state title and wish them the best of luck in the upcoming \nnational competition. Their dedication and hard work has not gone \nunnoticed. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their \nhard work and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3556-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CELEBRATING OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT'S 65TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

The port greatly \ncontributes to the economic success of California and the nation. More \nthan $4 million worth of cargo moves through the port each year. In \naddition, the Port of Hueneme is the nation's number one seaport for \nexporting citrus products and conducts business with countries \nincluding Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany and Japan.

Mr. President, yesterday I joined my \ncolleagues, Senator Edwards and Senator Clinton, in introducing the \nSchool Service Act of 2002. This legislation will offer new support to \nschool districts across America that want to give their students the \nopportunity to learn through community service.\n  Service-learning is much more than just community service done by \nschool students, it is a method of classroom instruction that engages a \nstudent's intellect through hands-on work outside the classroom that \nbenefits the community at large. Research shows that students \nparticipating in service-learning make gains on achievement tests, \ncomplete their homework more often, and increase their grade point \naverages. Service-learning is also associated with both increased \nattendance and reduced dropout rates. It is clear to educators across \nthe country that service-learning helps students feel more connected to \ntheir own education while strengthening their connection to their \ncommunity as well.\n  Thousands of students across Oregon participate in formal service-\nlearning, and nearly every student in Oregon engages in community \nservice through their schoolwork at some point or another, they just \ndon't know that it's called service-learning. The School Service Act \nwill give local schools and school districts the resources they need to \nformalize their commitment to service-learning. Under this legislation, \nschool districts are eligible to apply for grants if they choose to \nmake meaningful community service a requirement for graduation. It is \nmy hope that\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nschools will take advantage of this funding opportunity, and give their \nstudents the chance to experience the benefits of an education tied to \ncommunity service.\n  My own State of Oregon is a national leader in service-learning, and \nI hope that this bill will help schools in my state continue their \ncommitment to reclaiming the public purpose of education. I also hope \nthat the School Service Act will encourage the further spread of \nservice-learning across America, because I believe that it will improve \neducation and, perhaps as important, instill students with an ethic of \npublic service that will stay with them throughout their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3557-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN.

After tours at 12 different bases in 20 years \nhe answered his nation's call once more. In October of 1965, Colonel \nJeffords reported to Vietnam for what would turn out to be his final \ndeployment. On Christmas Eve 1965, just as President Johnson announced \na week long bombing halt in North Vietnam, Colonel Jeffords' family \nreceived the painful telegram declaring him Missing in Action. His \nfamily learned that while on an armed reconnaissance mission, just \nsouth of Ban Bac, Laos, Colonel Jeffords' C-47 ``Spooky'' had been shot \ndown.\n  Deryl Jeffords was only 13 years old when her father was shot down. \nShe was forced to remember him through the letters that he wrote from \nVietnam. Those letters never reflected any sign of fear, resentment or \nanger at being in Vietnam. To Colonel Jeffords, it was not a duty to \nserve in Vietnam, it was an honor. I was recently contacted by Ms. \nJeffords, who told me about her father's life. Moved by the heroic \nstory of Colonel Jeffords, I felt it necessary to rise on the floor of \nthe United States Senate, to give her father the respect, honor, \ndedication and recognition that he so richly deserves from our country. \nColonel Jeffords is an American hero, who fought for all citizens, so \nthat we could keep the freedom that we enjoy today.\n  Colonel Jeffords will always be in the heart and soul of his family \nthat he left behind. None of us should ever forget Colonel Derrell B. \nJeffords, for he represents the very heart of what our country stands \nfor. God Bless him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3557-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 27, \n1993 in Queens, NY. A gay man was beaten by two teenagers yelling anti-\ngay slurs. Junior Guerrero, 18, and Michael Ithier, 19, were arrested \nin connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3557-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE NASHUA HIGH SCHOOL AP GOVERNMENT CLASS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Tarin Lafrance and her Nashua Senior High School AP \ngovernment class. The class was chosen to represent the State of New \nHampshire in the ``We the People . . .'' national competition. Nashua \nwill compete against other States in analyzing and interpreting the \nConstitution of the United States as it applies in everyday life.\n  As a former schoolteacher, I commend Tarin Lafrance and the entire \nclass for their hard work in this competition. The students' dedication \nis evident as shown through their strong commitment to excellence in \neducation. I applaud their efforts and innovative interpretations of \nthe Constitution. In working to gain a better understanding of our \ndemocratic Republic, the class studied the historical background of the \nConstitution, the three branches of government, judicial review, the \nBill of Rights, and the Constitution as it applies in today's society. \nSo much of our Nation's history revolves around the Constitution, and \nmore importantly, this document serves as the foundation of all our \nGovernment's decisions. Nashua's commitment to education is a positive \nexample for the Granite State.\n  I commend all members of the class and wish them continued success as \nthey travel to Washington, DC, to showcase their presentation.

His \ncareer has been long and distinguished in both print and broadcast \njournalism, reporting on hundreds of issues each year. His dedication \nto the readers of New Hampshire is evident in the stories he writes; I \ncommend him on success. As Jerry so humbly stated, ``I have never tired \nof covering business in the Granite State, where the entrepreneurial \nspirit is alive and well. It's a spirit I've seen every day in the men \nand women who take the risks associated with businesses and job \ncreation, so that they and others may enjoy their perceptions of the \nAmerican dream.''

He has made time over the past decade to \nvolunteer his services and expertise to the center, teaching classes \nand taking clients on a pro bono basis. Peter's time spent volunteering \nhas been crucial to the center's clients. Without his contributions, \nthe ITRC would not have been able to offer competitive and complete \nservices to New Hampshire's small businesses.\n  New Hampshire's small business community is privileged to have such a \ndedicated member of their community.

A bill to prevent and punish counterfeiting and copyright \npiracy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAnticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002, along with Senators Allen, \nHollings, Boxer, Murray, Smith of Oregon, Nelson of Nebraska, and \nDorgan.\n  In February of this year, I held a hearing entitled, ``Theft of \nAmerican Intellectual Property: Fighting Crime Abroad and At Home,'' \nand I issued a report on the status of our fight against this crime.\n  What I learned is that every day, thieves steal millions of dollars \nof American intellectual property from its rightful owners. Over a \nhundred thousand American jobs are lost as a result.\n  American innovation and creativity need to be protected by our \ngovernment no less than our personal property, our homes and our \nstreets. The Founding Fathers had the foresight to provide for \nprotection of intellectual property, giving Congress the power to \n``promote the progress of science and useful arts'' by providing \ncopyrights and patents.\n  American intellectual property represents the largest single sector \nof the American economy, employing 4.3 million Americans. It has been \nestimated that software piracy alone cost the U.S. economy over 118,000 \njobs and $5.7 billion in wage losses in the year 2000. Even more, the \nInternational Planning and Research Corporation estimates that the \ngovernment loses more than a billion dollars worth of revenue every \nyear from intellectual property theft.\n  To put that in perspective, with a billion dollars in additional \nrevenue, the American government could pay for child care services for \nmore than 100,000 children annually. Alternatively, $1 billion could be \nused to fund a Senate proposal to assist schools nationally with \nemergency school renovations and repairs.\n  There's another problem. Counterfeiters of software, music CDs and \nmotion pictures are now tampering with authentication features. \nHolograms, certificates of authenticity, and other security features \nallow the copyright owners to distinguish genuine works from \ncounterfeits. But now, highly sophisticated counterfeiters have found \nways to tamper with these features to make counterfeit products appear \ngenuine and to increase the selling price of genuine products and \nlicenses. Put another way, not only do crooks illegally copy American \nintellectual property, they also now illegally fake or steal the very \nfeatures property owners use to prevent that theft.\n  Copyrights mean nothing if government authorities fail to enforce the \nprotections they provide intellectual property owners. The criminal \ncode has not kept up with the counterfeiting operations of today's \nhigh-tech pirates, and it's time to make sure that it does. The \nAnticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002 update and strengthen the Federal \ncriminal code, which currently makes it a crime to traffic in \ncounterfeit labels or copies of certain forms of intellectual property, \nbut not authentication features. For example, we can currently \nprosecute someone for trafficking in fake labels for a computer \nprogram, but we cannot go after them for faking the hologram that the \nsoftware maker uses to ensure that copies of the software are genuine.\n  In addition, many actions that violate current law go unprosecuted in \nthis day and age when priorities, such as the fight against terrorism \nand life-threatening crimes, necessarily take priority over crimes of \nproperty, be they intellectual or physical. Moreover, the victims of \nthis theft often do not have a way to recover their losses from this \ncrime. For this reason, the Anticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002 also \nprovide a private cause of action, to permit the victims of these \ncrimes to pursue the criminals themselves and recover damages in \nfederal court.\n  Current law criminalizes trafficking in counterfeit documentation and \npackaging, but only for software programs. The Anticounterfeiting \nAmendments of 2002 update and expand these provisions to include \ndocumentation and packaging for phonorecords, motion pictures and other \naudiovisual works.\n  America is a place where we must encourage diverse ideas, and with \nthat encouragement we must protect those ideas. They are the source of \nour music, our art, our novels, our movies, our software, all that is \nAmerican culture and American know-how. The\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nAnticounterfeting Amendments of 2002 give our ideas the protection they \ndeserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anticounterfeiting \n     Amendments of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) American innovation, and the protection of that \n     innovation by the government, has been a critical component \n     of the economic growth of this Nation throughout the history \n     of the Nation;\n       (2) copyright-based industries represent one of the most \n     valuable economic assets of this country, contributing over 5 \n     percent of the gross domestic product of the United States \n     and creating significant job growth and tax revenues;\n       (3) the American intellectual property sector employs \n     approximately 4,300,000 people, representing over 3 percent \n     of total United States employment;\n       (4) the proliferation of organized criminal counterfeiting \n     enterprises threatens the economic growth of United States \n     copyright industries;\n       (5) the American intellectual property sector has invested \n     millions of dollars to develop highly sophisticated \n     authentication features that assist consumers and law \n     enforcement in distinguishing genuine intellectual property \n     products and packaging from counterfeits;\n       (6) in order to thwart these industry efforts, \n     counterfeiters traffic in, and tamper with, genuine \n     authentication features, for example, by obtaining genuine \n     authentication features through illicit means and then \n     commingling these features with counterfeit software or \n     packaging;\n       (7) Federal law does not provide adequate civil and \n     criminal remedies to combat tampering activities that \n     directly facilitate counterfeiting crimes; and\n       (8) in order to strengthen Federal enforcement against \n     counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress must enact \n     legislation that--\n       (A) prohibits trafficking in, and tampering with, \n     authentication features of copyrighted works; and\n       (B) permits aggrieved parties an appropriate civil cause of \n     action.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 402A of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 to define the terms different campus and different population; to \nthe Committee of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nMexico to introduce the TRIO Education Access Act of 2002, which will \nimprove access to higher education by ensuring that these programs are \navailable to all those in need.\n  While many students in my State benefit immensely from the TRIO \nprograms, misguided regulations are preventing Wisconsin's two year \ncolleges from receiving funds to begin more than one TRIO program for \nthe entire State.\n  Many students today dream of going to college, but the things that \ncan put college out of reach for some students don't always get the \nattention that they deserve. Students who face these additional \nbarriers to higher education need a helping hand, and thanks to the \nTRIO Program, more students are getting the help they need.\n  The TRIO Program was so named because there were originally three \nprograms, all of which had roots dating back to Lyndon Johnson's \nadministration in the 1960s. Today TRIO consists of eight programs that \noffer vital advice and academic support to middle and high school \nstudents hoping to get into college, and it continues to offer that \nsupport to students after they enter college and begin working toward \ntheir diploma.\n  Many Federal education programs have come and gone, but the TRIO \nprograms have not only survived, they've thrived and expanded to aid \nmore than 10 million Americans.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, many students at the University of \nWisconsin's two-year colleges could reap tremendous benefits from the \nservices the TRIO programs have to offer.\n  But today, because of the way that TRIO grants are structured, UW's \n13 two-year colleges can only be considered for TRIO grants \ncollectively, instead of applying for grants to serve each campus.\n  The Department of Education has ruled that the unique structure of \nthe University of Wisconsin's two-year system, a centrally run system \nwith 13 branch campuses, does not meet the criteria of having \n``independent'' campuses.\n  This decision deeply concerns me, as the Federal Government is simply \npenalizing UWs' two-year colleges simply because of their \nadministrative structure.\n  As a result of the Department of Education's decision, only one TRIO \nProgram, the Student Support Services Program, is available to these \ntwo-year colleges. UW--Waukesha is home to a thriving Student Support \nServices Program, which offers students counseling and vital academic \nsupport and skills development.\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n  But UW's two-year colleges deserve to have access to all the TRIO \nPrograms available to four-year institutions, such as Upward Bound, \nTalent Search, and Educational Opportunity Centers.\n  In different ways, each of these programs has helped students break \nthrough difficult economic or physical circumstances to successfully \nenter and graduate from college. Students in the Upward Bound program \nare four times more likely to earn an undergraduate degree than those \nstudents from similar backgrounds who did not participate in TRIO.\n  Students in the TRIO Student Support Services program are more than \ntwice as likely to remain in college than those students from similar \nbackgrounds who did not participate in the program.\n  By discriminating against the unique structure of the University of \nWisconsin's two year colleges, the Department of Education hurts the \nvery population the TRIO Programs aim to serve.\n  That's why it's so important that the rules at the Department of \nEducation be changed, so that Wisconsin's two-year colleges have the \nopportunity to apply individually for the TRIO grants they see fit.\n  By clarifying the ``Different Campus'' and ``Different Population of \nParticipants'' in the TRIO regulations, this legislation makes UW's \ntwo-year colleges eligible for all the programs TRIO has to offer. No \ndefinition or regulation should get in the way of qualified Wisconsin \nstudents gaining access to TRIO programs and the chance to earn a \ncollege degree.\n  I have heard from many Wisconsinites who have shared their personal \nstories about how TRIO had made a difference in their lives. TRIO \noffers hope to millions of students across the country who dream of a \ncollege education, and students at the University of Wisconsin's two-\nyear colleges should be no exception. Waukesha can be proud of the TRIO \nprogram that has served so many students at UW-Waukesha.\n  Now it's time to give UW-Waukesha, and other two-year colleges around \nmy State, an opportunity to open more TRIO programs, and open the doors \nof higher education to more Wisconsin students.\n  I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2425. A bill to prohibit United States assistance and commercial \narms exports to countries and entities supporting international \nterrorism; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Cooperative \n     Antiterrorism Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The use of terrorism is detestable and an illegitimate \n     means of political expression.\n       (2) International terrorist organizations pose a direct \n     threat to the United States, and this threat is becoming more \n     acute and more difficult to prevent.\n       (3) The threat from international terrorism is made far \n     more dangerous by the proliferation of chemical, biological, \n     and radiological weapons and the means to produce those \n     weapons.\n       (4) The prosecution of the war against international \n     terrorist organizations must continue until the threat they \n     pose to the people and interests of the United States is \n     eliminated.\n       (5) The United States can only win the war against \n     terrorism if it receives cooperation from other countries and \n     entities.\n       (6) Protecting the United States homeland and United States \n     interests overseas from terrorism is of the highest priority \n     in the foreign relations of the United States.\n       (7) Cooperation in the global war against international \n     terrorism must be a primary focus of United States foreign \n     relations, United States assistance, and international \n     security relations.\n       (8) Winning the global war against international terrorism \n     requires cooperation from the international community, \n     especially in the areas of preventing the financing of \n     terror, sharing information on international terror networks, \n     eliminating terror cells, and in preventing the promotion of \n     virulent anti-Americanism with the intent to incite violence \n     and the glorification of terrorism in state-owned media and \n     state-controlled schools.\n       (9) The promotion of terrorism, intolerance, and virulent \n     anti-Americanism in state-owned media and state-controlled \n     education systems is abhorrent and poses a long-term threat \n     to the safety and security of the United States as well as \n     the community of nations.\n       (10) All countries and entities must be encouraged to \n     cooperate in the global war against international terrorism.\n       (11) Some foreign governments and entities are doing little \n     to counter proterrorist and prointolerance messages to mass \n     audiences, including to school age children.\n       (12) Countries providing direct or indirect assistance to \n     international terrorist organizations undermine the direct \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (13) Countries demonstrating indifference to or providing \n     actual endorsement of international terror as a legitimate \n     political tool make a direct threat to the security interests \n     of the United States.\n       (14) United States economic assistance programs and the \n     transfer of United States Munitions List items are a critical \n     tool of United States foreign policy and winning the global \n     war against international terrorism.\n       (15) Countries receiving United States assistance and the \n     export of items on the United States Munitions List should be \n     expected to support the global war against international \n     terror.\n       (16) Several existing laws, including the USA Patriot Act \n     of 2001, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n     1996, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export \n     Control Act, and the Export Administration Act of 1979 (or \n     successor statute), prohibit the provision of United States \n     assistance, and the licensing for export of items on the \n     United States Munitions List, to countries supporting terror \n     or not fully cooperating in antiterror efforts of the United \n     States. It would be appropriate in the implementation of \n     these laws to apply the definition of ``fully cooperative in \n     the global war against international terrorism'' set forth in \n     this Act, including preventing promotion of terror in state-\n     owned and state-controlled media and educational systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) no United States economic assistance, other than \n     humanitarian assistance, may be provided to any foreign \n     country or entity that is not making a maximum effort to be \n     fully cooperative in the global war against international \n     terrorism; and\n       (2) no license for export of an item on the United States \n     Munitions List to a country or entity may be issued if that \n     country or entity is not making a maximum effort to be fully \n     cooperative in the global war against international \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND \n                   COMMERCIAL ARMS EXPORTS.\n\n       (a) United States Economic Assistance.--If the President \n     determines that a country or entity is not making a maximum \n     effort to be fully cooperative in the global war against \n     international terrorism--\n       (1) no United States economic assistance may be provided to \n     such country or entity; and\n       (2) the United States shall oppose and vote against any \n     lending from any international financial institution, \n     including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, \n     the Asian Development Bank, or other related institutions to \n     such country or entity.\n       (b) Commercial Arms Exports.--No license for the export of \n     an item on the United States Munitions List to any country or \n     entity may be issued if the President determines that such \n     country or entity is not making a maximum effort to be fully \n     cooperative in the global war against international \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT FOR AN ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Report.--The President, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, and the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, shall prepare an unclassified annual report \n     that--\n       (1) contains a list of each country or entity for which the \n     President has determined that there is credible evidence that \n     such country or entity is not being fully cooperative in the \n     global war against international terrorism under section 4; \n     and\n       (2) describes for each country or entity listed under \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (A) the specific failures of each country or entity to be \n     fully cooperative in the global war against international \n     terrorism;\n       (B) the reasons why such country or entity is not fully \n     cooperative;\n       (C) the efforts being made by the United States Government \n     to promote greater adherence by such countries or entities \n     with the global war against international terrorism; and\n       (D) any removal of a country or entity from the list in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Transmission to Congress.--\n       (1) Report.--The report required by this section shall be \n     submitted to Congress every year as a section of the annual \n     country reports on terrorism required by section 140(a) of \n     the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 \n     and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656(f)).\n       (2) Briefing.--The President shall make the appropriate \n     officials available to provide\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\n     a classified briefing to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress if such committees request additional clarifying \n     details on why a country or entity is listed under subsection \n     (a)(1).\n\n     SEC. 6. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       United States economic assistance or exports prohibited by \n     section 4 may be provided to a country or entity described in \n     that section if the President--\n       (1) determines that permitting such assistance or exports \n     is important to the national security interests of the United \n     States; and\n       (2) not later than 15 days before permitting such \n     assistance or exports, furnishes a report describing the \n     United States economic assistance or exports to be provided \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Expression of support for terrorism against the united \n     states.--The term ``expression of support for terrorism \n     against the United States'' means a pattern of actions or \n     expressions that are designed to provoke or incite anti-\n     American violence, advocate international terrorism, or to \n     glorify the use of violence against citizens or government \n     officials of the United States.\n       (2) Fully cooperative in the global war against \n     international terrorism.--The term ``fully cooperative in the \n     global war against international terrorism'' means a country \n     or entity that has the necessary legal framework and, to the \n     maximum extent possible, is enforcing efforts to--\n       (A) prevent the knowing financing of terrorism, including \n     preventing--\n       (i) direct financial payments to any terrorist \n     organization;\n       (ii) any terrorist organization or any entity supporting a \n     terrorist organization from receiving financial services such \n     as brokering, lending, or transferring currency or credit;\n       (iii) any person from soliciting funds or items of value \n     for a terrorist group; and\n       (iv) any humanitarian or other nongovernmental organization \n     from providing financial support to terrorist organizations;\n       (B) share intelligence information with the United States, \n     including--\n       (i) releasing information to the United States related to \n     any terrorist organization;\n       (ii) cooperating in investigations conducted by the United \n     States; and\n       (iii) providing, to the extent possible, access to \n     individuals suspected of or supporting terrorist \n     organizations to United States investigators; and\n       (C) act against terrorist organizations, including--\n       (i) preventing terrorist organizations from committing or \n     inciting to commit terrorist acts against the United States \n     or its interests overseas;\n       (ii) preventing terrorist organizations from operating safe \n     houses or providing transportation, communication, \n     documentation, identification, weapons (including chemical, \n     biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training \n     to terrorists; and\n       (iii) in the cases of a country--\n\n       (I) investigating suspected terrorists within its national \n     territory;\n       (II) enforcing international agreements and United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions against terrorism; and\n       (III) curbing any domestic expression of support for \n     terrorism against the United States and its allies in state-\n     owned media, state-sanctioned gatherings, state-governed \n     religious institutions, and state-sanctioned school and \n     textbooks.\n\n       (3) Humanitarian assistance.--The term ``humanitarian \n     assistance'' means any humanitarian goods and services, \n     including foodstuffs, medicines, and health assistance \n     programs.\n       (4) Terrorist organization.--The term ``terrorist \n     organization'' means an organization designated as a foreign \n     terrorist organization by the Secretary of State under \n     section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1189).\n       (5) United states economic assistance.--The term ``United \n     States economic assistance'' means--\n       (A) any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (including programs under title IV of chapter 2, relating to \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation);\n       (B) sales, or financing on any terms, under the Arms Export \n     Control Act;\n       (C) the provision of agricultural commodities, other than \n     food, under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954;\n       (D) financing under the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945; and\n       (E) does not include humanitarian assistance or other \n     assistance that is intended to support cooperative \n     antiterrorism, peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, \n     nonproliferation and counter-proliferation programs, or \n     funding for nongovernmental organizations promoting education \n     and democratic institutions.\n       (6) United states munitions list.--The term ``United States \n     Munitions List'' means the defense articles and defense \n     services controlled by the President under section 38 of the \n     Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 2428. A bill to amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleagues, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Reed and Mr. Feingold the National Sea Grant College \nProgram Act Amendments of 2002, legislation to reauthorize the National \nSea Grant College Program Act.\n  Congress established the Sea Grant program back in 1966. Since that \ntime Sea Grant has provided the Administration and Congress a \ncomprehensive vehicle that engages our best universities to respond to \ncomplex and changing ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes issues. The 31 Sea \nGrant programs, located in coastal and Great Lakes States and Puerto \nRico, serve as the core of this dynamic national network of over 300 \nparticipating institutions involving more than 3,000 scientists, \nengineers, educators, students, and outreach experts.\n  Sea Grant's legislative charge is to ``increase the understanding, \nassessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's \nocean and coastal resources by providing assistance to promote a strong \neducation base, responsive research and training activities, and broad \nand prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques''. Sea Grant has \nconsistently proven its value to taxpayers as a program that supports \nrigorous, high quality research that is directly responsive to the \nconcerns of coastal constituents. The Sea Grant Program brings academic \ncreativity and expertise to bear on a host of issues affecting the \noceans, coasts and Great Lakes.\n  Most decisions that affect the coastal environment are made locally, \nand, through the Sea Grant Colleges, the federal government has the \nability to partner with state and local constituencies to address \nnational problems at state and local levels. Moreover, many coastal \nissues cross State jurisdictions and need to be addressed regionally. \nIn addition to its state-based infrastructure, Sea Grant has developed \na system of regional networks for organizing multi-state responses to \nregional/ecosystem-level problems.\n  The current administration proposed moving the Sea Grant program from \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF. I do not support such a move. The Sea \nGrant program has been a success in NOAA and one has to wonder if \nsomething is not broke why should we fix it. This is obviously the case \nwith Sea Grant and I see no reason why we should move the program from \nNOAA to NSF.\n  Allow me for a moment to point out one area where the Sea Grant/NOAA \npartnership is working. As Chairman of the Oceans, Fisheries and \nAtmosphere Subcommittee I know first-hand the struggles that commercial \nfishermen face as we try and rebuild our stocks. Sea Grant is currently \nworking in coastal communities to better document the social and \neconomic impacts of fishery regulations on communities, so that we can \ndevelop regulations that not only preserve and protect are valuable \nmarine resources but also protect the fabric of our coastal \ncommunities. As you may know, the National Marine Fisheries Service is \none of five line offices within NOAA, that is charged with regulating \nall of our domestic commercial fisheries. One thing that all of us from \ncoastal states will agree on is the need to improve our knowledge of \nfishing communities and how regulations affect the lives of the people \nwho live there.\n  A unique feature of the existing National Sea Grant College Program \nAct, which is maintained through this reauthorization bill, is that the \nmajority of grants awarded require that every $2 of federal funds be \nmatched by $1 of non-federal funds that are usually provided by host \nuniversities, as well as state or local governments, thus providing \noutstanding leverage as well as strong regional support for the federal \nfunds awarded.\n  Because Sea Grant is non-regulatory and science-based, it serves as \nan ``honest broker'' among a wide range of constituents. In an age that \nemphasizes multi-disciplinary, goal-oriented, performance-measured \npartnerships, Sea Grant has demonstrated its capability to effectively \ndeliver relevant science and services.\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\n  In short, Sea Grant offers numerous economic opportunities, problem-\nsolving processes and programmatic efficiencies for the federal \ngovernment to achieve its marine and coastal science agenda. Based on \nthe Sea Grant College Program's remarkable capabilities, excellent \ntrack record, and cost effective use of federal funds, I ask for your \nsupport in quick passage of this reauthorization bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan above-the-line deduction from certain expenses in connection with \nthe determination, collection, or refund of any tax; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help ease the financial burden for the millions of Americans \nthat find themselves extremely confused and frustrated every year as \nthey try to prepare their tax returns. This year's tax filing deadline \nexpired on April 15 for most American taxpayers, and the 17,000-page, \n2.8 million-word tax code was more complex than ever. One estimate is \nthat it now takes 28 hours and six minutes to tackle the Internal \nRevenue Service's 1040 form and do the necessary record keeping.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, it is estimated that in 2002, \nindividuals and small businesses will spend approximately 5.8 billion \nhours complying with the Federal income tax code, with an estimated \ncompliance cost of over $194 billion. This amounts to imposing a more \nthan 20 cent tax compliance surcharge for every dollar the tax system \ncollects. By 2007, the compliance surcharge is conservatively estimated \nat $244.3 billion. Under current law, there is a way for those \ntaxpayers who itemize and accumulate tax preparation fees up to at \nleast 2 percent of their Adjusted Gross Income to receive a financial \nbreak from the IRS to help offset the cost of having a tax preparer \ncalculate their tax. The problem is that there are millions more low- \nor middle-income individuals and small business owners trying to \ndecipher the same complicated instructions and forms, for which there \nis no tax break.\n  Since 1985, we have more than doubled the pages in the instruction \nbooklet that accompanies the 1040. In response to this increased \ncomplexity, American taxpayers are seeking professional help at a \nrecord level that equals almost 60 percent of all returns filed. I \nbelieve it is time that we acknowledge how difficult our current tax \nsystem has become and help the millions of Americans who have to look \nto outside help in filing their yearly tax returns. I suggest that \nsince the Federal Government is the party responsible for creating this \noverly complicated code, it is the Federal Government that should bear \nthe burden of the costs that are incurred in its compliance.\n  My proposal is simple, my legislation provides for the expenses that \nare incurred by a taxpayer in having their return prepared to be fully \ndeducted. This would be treated as an above-the-line deduction and \nwould allow for anyone who pays for these services to deduct up to $500 \nof these costs. Further, for those who already qualify to have their \npreparation cost be deducted because they reach the 2 percent \nthreshold, they can opt not to have this deduction apply and continue \nto have their tax preparation fees be deducted under the current \nguidelines.\n  I believe the legislation that I have introduced today will provide \nmuch needed relief to the millions of American taxpayers that are \nforced to comply with this complex code. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for parity in regulatory treatment of \nbroadband services providers and of broadband access services \nproviders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Nickles, \nCleland, Brownback, Miller, Hutchison, and Hutchinson to introduce \nlegislation that is designed to rejuvenate the struggling \ntelecommunications and high-tech sectors of our economy. The Broadband \nRegulatory Parity Act of 2002 requires the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, to adopt rules that establish a level playing field \nfor all broadband service providers in order to spur investment in \nbroadband technology and to ensure that consumers can obtain the \nbenefits of free and open competition.\n  Federal and State regulations on the books today governing high-speed \nInternet access are based largely on an outdated view of the telecom \nand high-tech industry. Both Federal and State regulators continue to \nview the emerging broadband market through different sets of eyes, \nfocusing their regulatory policies on the type of provider rather than \nthe type of service. Cable, wireless, and satellite providers face no \nregulation of their broadband networks, while telephone companies are \nheavily regulated. The effect of this disparate regulatory treatment \namong providers has been to construct a barrier to new investment in \nbroadband networks by incumbent local telephone companies.\n  I am not alone in calling on the FCC to level the regulatory playing \nfield for broadband providers. Several weeks ago, the High Tech \nBroadband Coalition, a group comprised of six leading trade \nassociations representing the computer, telecommunications equipment, \nsemiconductor, consumer electronics, software and manufacturing \nindustries, filed comments with the FCC requesting the removal of \nburdensome, outdated regulations that are hindering investment and \nlimiting competition in high-speed Internet access.\n  In order to promote free and fair competition in the broadband \nmarket, my legislation requires the FCC to promulgate regulations, \nwithin 120 days of enactment, to achieve regulatory parity between \nbroadband services providers and facilities. The key provision in my \nbill is, I believe, the 120-day requirement for FCC action. The FCC, to \nits credit, is attempting by means of a tortuously slow process to move \nin the direction of regulatory parity among broadband services and \nproviders. Once the FCC completes action on its rulemakings, however, \nits orders will certainly be appealed, just as the FCC's March 14, \n2002, order declaring cable modem service to be an information service \nhas already been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit. To effect this needed regulatory parity, we need the \nexpert agency to accomplish this reform with the necessary fine tuning \nthat will further the public interest, but we need the force of \nCongressional action to bring about prompt results. I urge prompt \naction on this legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Breaux today \nto introduce a bill that will allow all providers of broadband services \nto compete under the same rules and regulations. This bill will bring \ncertainty to the regulatory environment ensuring more Americans will \nhave a choice in their broadband service provider.\n  Access to broadband is crucial to consumers and communities in \ntoday's economy. High-speed connections to the Internet can provide a \nlifeline to small businesses, schools and hospitals, and can help \ncommunities prosper and grow in the Information Age.\n  But unfortunately, different rules for competing high-speed Internet \ncompanies are stifling competition. Phone companies that offer the same \nservice as wireless, satellite, and cable companies face different \nrules and regulations that raise costs and slow innovation. These rules \nmake it more difficult and expensive for phone companies to provide \nbroadband service, leaving millions of consumers without access to \nhigh-speed connections and millions more with only one choice.\n  This service disparity is growing wider, and dozens of communities \nare at risk of being left behind, especially rural areas and inner-city \nneighborhoods. This bill will help close the Digital Divide and help \nensure that all Americans have choices for high-speed Internet \nservices. This issue is not about choosing winners and losers, it is \nabout helping to ensure that high speed Internet service is not only \navailable but competitive and affordable all across the country.\n  The Breaux-Nickles bill is a free-market, deregulatory approach to \nencourage private companies to rapidly deploy this new technology. It \ndoes nothing to change what the 1996 Telecom Act sought to accomplish, \nto open up the local voice telephone market to competition. At the \ntime, no one envisioned the growth of the Internet. In fact, the web \nbrowser had just been invented. This bill simply eliminates regulations \nthat were intended for the legacy network but have been mistakenly \napplied to new infrastructure investment.\n  The goal of this bill is to provide an economic incentive for local \ntelephone companies to upgrade their networks and to rapidly deploy \nhigh-speed, broadband services throughout the U.S. According to the \nmost recent nation-wide data, there are approximately 11 million high \nspeed Internet subscribers. Of that total, 7.2 million currently use \nhigh-speed cable modems and 3.5 million use Digital Subscriber Lines \n(DSL) provided by the telephone companies.\n  Today's rules are not only unfair but they are a disincentive to \ndeployment. No company will invest the capital required to upgrade \ntheir network and deploy new technologies when they are required to \nprovide this new, upgraded technology to their competitors at a \ngovernment-set price. If high speed, broadband service is going to be \ndeployed rapidly throughout the country, especially in rural areas, the \nanswer is not more rules and regulations, but a market-based \nderegulatory approach.\n  For a new market to evolve quickly and efficiently, government should \nnot regulate the market out of existence before it has a chance to \nflourish. In fact, yesterday's Wall Street Journal had an editorial \nexpressing concern about over-regulation at a critical time, it states, \n``Then the digital revolution ran headlong into the FCC and Congress, \nwhose tender mercies enfolded consumer broadband at the moment of \ncreation.'' It is not too late to encourage growth and innovation. As \nthe Wall Street Journal points out, ``There's still plenty of Internet \nand telecom enthusiasm out there, if only regulators will let it \nblossom.''\n  With regulatory certainty, companies have the incentive to invest. \nFor example, earlier this week, in my home State of Oklahoma, less than \ntwo weeks after Gov. Frank Keating signed the first state broadband \nparity law in the country, SBC Southwestern Bell announced a massive \nprogram of technology investment that will nearly double the number of \nOklahoma towns with access to high-speed DSL Internet Access Service.\n  This initiative will bring high-speed DSL Internet service to 37 more \ntowns, and expand access by building new broadband equipment in another \n25 towns that already have the service. The initiative will make DSL \navailable to about 137,000 more homes and businesses in 62 Oklahoma \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nSBC is making this investment at a time when they, and other \ntelecommunications companies, have dramatically slashed capital \nspending throughout the country.\n  This is the kind of investment that regulatory certainty and real \ncompetition bring and that is why I strongly support this legislation. \nIf we can do for the country what we have done for the state of \nOklahoma, Congress will go a long way toward reversing the economic \nslide currently enveloping the telecom sector. When all broadband \nproviders are allowed to compete under the same rules, consumers win \nand the economy wins. I am pleased to sponsor this bipartisan approach \nto promoting competition for broadband services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3573-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 255--TO DESIGNATE THE WEEK BEGINNING MAY 5, 2002, AS \n         ``NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reid, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Thomas, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Helms, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Akaka) submitted the \nfollowing resolution, which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 255\n\n       Whereas the operation of correctional facilities represents \n     a crucial component of our criminal justice system;\n       Whereas correctional personnel play a vital role in \n     protecting the rights of the public to be safeguarded from \n     criminal activity;\n       Whereas correctional personnel are responsible for the \n     care, custody, and dignity of the human beings charged to \n     their care; and\n       Whereas correctional personnel work under demanding \n     circumstances and face danger in their daily work lives: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, \n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND \n                   EMPLOYEES WEEK.\n\n       That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning May 5, 2002, as \n     ``National Correctional Officers and Employees Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring our Nation's correctional officers and employees. This \nresolution reaffirms our support for the more than 200,000 corrections \nprofessionals who work in the face of danger while monitoring and \nreforming criminals and maintaining the safety of our communities.\n  I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Stabenow, Reid, Boxer, Kennedy, \nCleland, Cantwell, Wyden, Thomas, Bingaman, Domenici, Jeffords, Murray, \nRoberts, Feingold, Helms, Sarbanes, and Akaka have joined me in \nsubmitting this resolution today.\n  The job of correctional officers and employees is a dangerous, and \noften thankless, one. Most of us leave for work knowing that we will \nreturn home safe and sound at the end of the day. But, corrections \npersonnel are not afforded this luxury. They put their lives on the \nline every time they begin a shift.\n  Tragically, many correctional officers have been permanently injured \nor killed in the line of duty. In all, more than 361 correctional \nofficers and employees have died while on duty. This year, we honor \nnine: John Burkett III, Wayne Mitchell, James Salvino, Gregory Collins, \nGeorge Turner, Richard Huffman, Virgil Reel, Timothy Williams, and \nRodney Welch, whom we lost during the past year. We must not forget the \nsacrifices made by these heroic individuals for our public safety.\n  These courageous officers all died while performing the normal day-\nto-day tasks their jobs asked of them. Whether they died transporting \ninmates or responding to disturbances within their facilities, their \nloss reminds us of the many brave acts that take place daily among \ncorrectional officers and employees.\n  Since prison security never rests, officers work all hours of the day \nand night, weekends, and even holidays. But, corrections professionals \ndo much more than just watch over prisoners. They also play an \nimportant role in reforming them and in lowering recidivism rates. \nThrough literacy programs and vocational training, they work hard to \ntransform offenders into productive, law-abiding members of society, \nwhich is sometimes no easy task.\n  The efforts of America's correctional officers and employees to make \nour world a better, safer place too often go unnoticed. Few of us can \ntruly appreciate the perils faced daily by these courageous public \nservants. We not only owe them our recognition, but our gratitude as \nwell. To that end, I am pleased to offer this resolution to designate \nthe week beginning May 5, 2002, as National Correctional Officers and \nEmployees Week, and to honor and acknowledge their diligence and \ndedication to our public safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/30/senate-section/article/S3573-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 256--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE \n           SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING FOR THE 107TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.
