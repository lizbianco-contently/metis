Mr. President, I ask the time I consume not be charged \nagainst either Senator Conrad or Senator Voinovich.\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. First of all, as has been announced, we have now resumed \nconsideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. The majority \nleader indicated that both Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd have every \nintention of finishing this bill today so we can go on to the Interior \nappropriations bill tomorrow. The majority leader has authorized me to \nstate it is his wish we could complete that legislation sometime on \nThursday--Interior appropriations. If we did that, the majority leader \nsaid there would be no votes on Friday. So it would be really good if \nwe could do that. It will take a lot of cooperation from everyone.\n  The majority leader has also asked me to express his appreciation to \neveryone for the cooperation on the Patients' Bill of Rights. It was a \nvery contentious issue. Both sides worked, offered very difficult \namendments for everyone to consider. It was done. It was done in an \nexpedient way, and we arrived at a conclusion at an earlier time than \npeople expected.\n  There are 14 amendments today. We have every expectation that some of \nthem will be accepted by the managers of the legislation. Others, \nperhaps, can be worked out. The two managers of the bill have asked \nthat we work to try to get time agreements on each of the amendments, \nand we will do that.\n  We hope we can arrive at a situation today where there can be votes \nat 2:15, as has been announced earlier. We expect, with the cooperation \nof Senator Voinovich and Senator Conrad, that can be done, and we will \nwork toward that end.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask the \ntime be equally charged against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Conrad \namendment as a result of the quorum call?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 47\\1/2\\ minutes on each \nside.\n  Mr. REID. For the edification of Members, we have had a general \nagreement that we will try to put in writing that we will complete this \ndebate on these two amendments in approximately 90 minutes. They have \nagreed and consented to having a vote at 2:15 on Conrad first and \nVoinovich second, with 6 minutes equally divided between the two before \nthe vote. We will write that up. I have explained to the Senators that \nwhen we get that written up, we will interrupt them so people will know \ndefinitely when the votes will occur.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the primary reasons I wanted to \nserve as a U.S. Senator was to have an opportunity to bring fiscal \nresponsibility to our Nation and help eliminate the terrible debt with \nwhich we will surely burden our children and grandchildren. As my \ncolleagues know, for decades successive Congresses and Presidents spent \nmoney on things that, while important, they were unwilling to pay for \nor do without. In the process, we ran up a staggering debt and \nmortgaged our future.\n  Today, our national debt is at $5.6 trillion, which costs us over \n$200 billion every year in interest payments. From the time I arrived \nin the Senate, I have been working to rein in spending and lower our \nnational debt. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, I have sponsored and \ncosponsored a number of amendments designed to bring fiscal discipline \nto the Federal Government.\n  For instance, in 1999 and 2000, we offered an amendment to use the \nentire on-budget surplus to pay down the debt. Also, in an effort to \nbring spending under control, Senator Allard and I offered an amendment \nin June of 2000 to direct $12 billion of the fiscal year on-budget \nsurplus toward debt reduction. The amendment passed by an overwhelming \nmargin of 95-3 and committed Congress to designate the on-budget \nsurpluses to reduce the national debt, keeping those funds from being \nused for additional Government spending.\n  Our amendment provided the mechanism to assure that Congress will \nbegin the serious task of paying down the debt. Further, this past \nApril, Senators Feingold, Gregg, and I offered an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2000 budget resolution designed to tighten the enforcement \nof existing spending controls. Our amendment created an explicit point \nof order against directed scoring and abuses of the emergency spending. \nGiven this commitment to fiscal responsibility, the huge spending \nincreases we have seen in the past 2 years have been troubling for me \nand for a lot of other Members of this body. I am worried that they \nwill lead us back to our deficit spending and debt accumulation.\n\n  I was encouraged, however, with the budget that the President sent to \nus this year. The President's budget relies equally on three primary \nprinciples. I refer to them as the ``three-legged stool.'' They are tax \ncuts, restrained spending, and debt reduction; all three of them fit \ntogether. This isn't just what the President proposed. It was what \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called for in his \ngroundbreaking testimony before the Senate Budget Committee earlier \nthis year. Chairman Greenspan said that he hoped the recent increases \nin Federal spending was only an aberration. He went on to say that we \nneeded a tax reduction because surpluses were accumulating so fast that \nthey were overwhelming our ability to repay the national debt without \nhaving to pay a premium. This is precisely what the President's tax cut \ndid.\n  The President's proposal to cut taxes was responsible precisely \nbecause it was coupled with two other legs of this budgetary stool. \nWithout limits on spending and maximum efforts to pay down the debt, I \ncould not have supported in good conscience the proposed tax cuts.\n  Ultimately, Congress passed the budget that achieves all three \nobjectives of the three-legged stool. It cuts taxes, restrains spending \nto a responsible level, and pays down the available publicly held debt \nover a 10-year period. Little did we know how the tax cut would be \nneeded to jump start the economy and restore consumer confidence. I \ndon't think we knew that until recently when we saw what has been \nhappening to our economy.\n  Hopefully, with the tax reduction, lower interest rates, and action \nby Congress to curb energy costs, we will see an improvement in the \neconomy and a restoration of the public's confidence in the economy.\n  We have taken the first step to implement the budget agreement by \nenacting the President's proposed tax cuts with a large bipartisan \nmajority. Tax cuts are now law and are a done deal. I know some Members \nof this body believe that those tax cuts were too much. But the fact is \nthat a majority of us felt they were reasonable and less than what the \nPresident asked for.\n  But our work is not yet finished. We still need to enact legislation \nto lock in the other two legs of the budgetary stool. We need a \nmechanism to restrain spending and pay down the debt. That is precisely \nwhat our amendment does. It is the teeth that ensures that we will pay \ndown the debt and limit spending. Lockboxing the Social Security \nsurplus is the key to protecting our accomplishments thus far and \nenforcing our budget agreement.\n  I want to call your attention to this chart, which basically shows \nthat all during the 1990s we had the deficit, but that deficit would \nhave been much larger than was reported because we used the Social \nSecurity surplus to pay for things that Congress was unwilling to pay \nfor or to do without. So as you can see, all the way up until the year \n2000, we had a real deficit; there was no surplus whatsoever. It was \nonly until 2000 that we saw a real on-budget surplus, and it wasn't \nuntil 1998 that we weren't using the Social Security surplus. The point \nis that we do not want to return to what we were doing in the past, and \nthat is using the Social Security surplus.\n  I think that my colleagues can see on this chart, and so can the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\ntaxpayers, that the Social Security surplus, if you can see this, is \nsignificant all the way during this next decade. What my amendment \nwould basically do is to make sure that all of this money is used to \npay down the debt and to restrain spending by the Members of this \nSenate.\n  I have every reason to believe if we don't pass this amendment, there \nis a good chance this money will be used to pay for spending.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, Congress has not been able to resist \nspending Social Security. I was an earlier supporter of the Abraham-\nDomenici Social Security lockbox that was first offered in 1999.\n  I voted in favor of the lockbox on several occasions. Laying out a \nthoughtful and well-reasoned budget plan is not enough to guarantee we \ndo not stray back to spending the Social Security surplus. Good \nintentions are not enough.\n  Our lockbox strengthens the existing point of order against spending \nthe Social Security surplus. Our lockbox makes it out of order to use \nthe Social Security surplus in any one of the next 10 years, contrasted \nwith the current budget resolution.\n  This is an important improvement. The existing point of order is \nwritten so it is possible to use the Social Security surplus in the \nfuture and is not possible to call a point of order. My amendment would \nprevent that.\n  Most important, my amendment contains an automatic enforcement \nmechanism. If OMB reports that the Federal Government will spend the \nSocial Security surplus, an automatic across-the-board sequester will \nbe put in place by OMB, and the size of the sequester will offset the \nuse of the surplus.\n  This is the ultimate enforcement mechanism. If the Social Security \nsurplus looks as if it will get spent, OMB stops it from happening. \nThis mechanism is our safety valve which will ensure we stay on course \nto limit spending and pay down our debt.\n  Spending cuts under my amendment would cut into both discretionary \nand mandatory spending. Mandatory spending for the most needy in \nsociety would not be affected by these cuts. My amendment would exclude \nSocial Security, food stamps, and other programs that are excluded from \nsequesters under the Deficit Control Act of 1985, and to prevent an \ninadvertent sequester, my amendment builds in a margin of error. This \nmargin is equal to one-half of 1 percent of outlays. Because it is so \nhard to calculate the aggregate level of spending from year to year, I \nthink this is a reasonable measure and OMB supports it. It would \nprevent inadvertent sequesters.\n  My amendment is straightforward and relies on existing law. I \nprimarily build on existing budget process and mechanisms. We all know \nSocial Security is off budget, and my amendment reinforces that \nposition.\n  My amendment does not modify any budgetary conventions or pretend \nSocial Security is something that it is not. Everyone knows the Budget \nAct points of order have their limitations. Someone has to call them, \nand too often no one does call them.\n  Take the use of Budget Act points of order against appropriations \nbills. The appropriations bills that pass early in the session can \ncontain outrageous spending increases, and they are immune from the \nSocial Security point of order because they do not threaten the Social \nSecurity surplus. It is only when we take up the last appropriations \nbills that it is obvious that the cumulative effect of our actions \nmight cause a problem.\n  Until we take up the last appropriations bill, it is pure conjecture \nas to whether we might spend the Social Security surplus. The use of \nomnibus appropriations bills makes this all the more problematic. By \nthe time we reach that last appropriations bill around here, it is too \nlate. Large spending increases could have already been done, and we all \nknow how bad Congress wants to get out of town when that last bill \nrolls around. For this reason, no one is willing to call a point of \norder that threatens to derail the train or a carefully worked out \ncompromise needed to pass the last appropriations bills.\n  This is the shortcoming of points of order, and that is why we need \nan automatic enforcement mechanism to protect the Social Security \nsurplus. The existence of an automatic Social Security sequestration \nwill force Congress to act. I am no fool, however. I know that if \nCongress wants to spend money, it will. With 60 votes, we can do just \nabout anything here, and just as we raise the discretionary spending \ncaps and the debt ceiling, we can vote to undo this mechanism, but it \nwill force Congress to act and will put Congress on record as violating \nthe Social Security surplus. People of America should know that is what \nwe are doing. It should not be hidden.\n\n  My colleague across the aisle, on the other hand, relies exclusively \non points of order to enforce his lockbox which we will be hearing more \nabout and, in my opinion, this is a serious weakness.\n  We in Congress spend and spend. For fiscal year 2001, with strong \nencouragement of the Clinton administration, my colleagues in Congress \nincreased nondefense discretionary spending by a staggering 14.3 \npercent. I want everybody to hear that--14.3 percent. Think of it, a \n14.3-percent growth in nondefense discretionary spending, and we \nincreased overall spending by 8 percent. We grew the size of the \nFederal Government by 8 percent. We spend, and we spend.\n  As we begin to consider spending for fiscal year 2002, the President \npresented a modest, responsible budget that called for a 4-percent \ngrowth rate. Congress tacked on more spending and passed a bipartisan \nbudget that called for a 4.7-percent increase in Federal spending. We \nspend.\n  We then took up an education bill intended to reform schools in an \neffort to ensure we were properly preparing our children for the 21st \ncentury, a goal I wholeheartedly support. Unfortunately, reform in \nCongress means more spending. We passed an education bill that \nauthorized an incredible 62-percent increase in Federal spending on \neducation--62 percent. Again, we spend.\n  If I can refer to this chart, my colleagues can see just what has \nhappened to spending in Congress in the last couple of years. The \nbudget caps that were put in place in 1997 in the budget agreement were \nsupposed to cap spending in 1998 at 52.7, in 1999 at 53.3, in 2000 at \n53.7, and in 2001 at 54.2. The red line is what we actually spent. Look \nat this increase. Starting in 1997, we increased spending.\n  From looking at that, one can see that walling off the Social \nSecurity trust fund from spending is something that has to be done. We \nhave proven time and again that we are very good at one thing: spending \nother people's money. I remind the President and others that prior to \n1999 we were spending that Social Security surplus regularly. This \namendment ensures we will not spend that money. It ensures it will go \nwhere it belongs: paying down the national debt and providing a \nfirewall against irresponsible spending. We must make sure history does \nnot repeat itself.\n  If, however, the economic prosperity this Nation has enjoyed recently \ncontinues to fade--and I hope it is just a temporary situation--any \nsurplus projections are likely to be revised downward and that Social \nSecurity surplus will, again, be in the crosshairs. It will be in the \ncrosshairs because Congress's yearning for spending has not abated, for \nexample, as I mentioned, the 62-percent increase in education. The \nPresident now is asking for more money in defense spending.\n  Given the spending trajectory and the possibility of continued \neconomic softness and that the surplus will not be as large as \nprojected, we could be bumping against the Social Security trust fund. \nWe cannot let that happen. There is a real risk of it happening. We \nneed to rein in the spending and protect Social Security from these \nspending threats. We need to lockbox it. Once lockboxed, the Social \nSecurity surplus will go to our debt reduction as our budget and the \nPresident's original plan intends and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan has recommended.\n\n  It is Congress's irresponsible record of spending that has \naccumulated the $5.6 trillion in debt that now hangs over our children \nand our children's children. Paying off the debt will free up the 11 \npercent of the Federal budget which currently goes to debt service so \nwe can focus on other needs such as Social Security reform.\n  There is what at first appears to be an alternative to my amendment, \nand that is the amendment offered by my\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\ncolleague from North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nUnfortunately, I do not think it measures up to the amendment I have \noffered. I would like to take a moment to address the second-degree \namendment of my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Its enforcement measure, in my opinion, is not as tough as mine. \nTherefore, my colleague's measure can easily be dodged by a Congress \nunder pressure to spend more or which simply lacks the same commitment \nto debt reduction and spending restraint we have shown in our budget \nresolution.\n  The Senator's amendment purports to lockbox the Medicare surplus, but \nthere is no such surplus. There is no Medicare surplus. It is money \nthat does not exist. The Part B deficit exceeds the so-called Part A \nsurplus. For fiscal year 2002, the net position of the Medicare \nProgram, when we combine Part A and Part B, we have a negative $52 \nbillion that is coming from the general fund. Medicare is an on-budget \naccount, unlike Social Security, which is currently in a huge deficit \nand which relies upon direct infusions from the general fund.\n\n  I note that some tried harsh words to differentiate between Parts A \nand B, but the fact is we are still talking about the same program. \nConsidering them separately and pretending they are off budget are \nsimply not intellectually honest deductions and are a faulty premise on \nwhich to base legislation. If you want the appearance of action, \ncoupled with the security of inaction, don't vote for my amendment, \nvote for the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I want to be frank with the President and my colleagues in the \nSenate. Many gave thought to the idea of ``lockboxing'' Part A of \nMedicare. I think our colleagues know there is a Part A and Part B. \nPart A is funded by deducting money from people's Social Security check \nand by everyone paying into the Medicare trust fund. We take in more \nmoney than is spent out for Part A.\n  However, Part B, which is the nonhospital portion of Medicare, does \nnot take in enough money. The Medicare Part A surplus projected for the \nyear 2002 is $36 billion; Medicare Part B deficit is $88 billion. In \neffect, we are taking $52 billion out of the general fund of the United \nStates to support Medicare. I am sure a lot of people getting Medicare \ntoday think the money coming out of their Social Security, the money \nsons and daughters are paying into the Medicare fund, is taking care of \nit. That is not the case. That is not the case.\n  When you combine Part A and Part B, the taxpayers of the United \nStates subsidize Medicare. There is not enough money in the Medicare \nfund from the money coming in every year and the money being taken out \nof people's Social Security and the money they pay in for Part B. We \nare subsidizing it. To talk of a Medicare surplus when you see these \nnumbers, is not being truthful. The surplus projected for the next 10 \nyears shows the Medicare surplus for Part A is $393 billion. Whoopee. \nPart B, the deficit is $1.36 trillion. The overall subsidy coming from \nthe general fund of the United States is $643 billion. For us to talk \nabout lockboxing this, to me, really does not make sense. I know some \ntalked about doing this last year, but the only reason it was brought \nup was the concept it would help restrain spending. When you see the \ntotal budget picture, the Medicare surplus is part of the on-budget \nsurplus. It is in deficit. We ought not talk about locking off \nsomething that is not there.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Conrad second-degree amendment \nbecause I don't think it will be enacted. In my opinion, it is a poison \npill. It pretends there is a sacrosanct Medicare surplus which does not \nexist and which was never walled off. I predict today if the second-\ndegree amendment is passed by the Senate, the entire provision will be \nremoved from the conference report of this bill. That money is going to \nbe needed to pay for spending in the budget we now have, particularly \nif we increase education 62 percent, as some colleagues would like to \ndo, and we entertain the President's request for more money for \ndefense.\n  On the other hand, if you want to make sure the money is there to \nfollow through on what we promised the American people, if we want to \npay down the debt as we promised--we said we want to pay down the debt \nand we want to restrain spending--if we want to do that without \ngimmicks, the pure Social Security lockbox that will do that, I request \nmy colleagues support this amendment.\n  I am not proposing this today for political reasons. It is popular. I \nwant to lockbox Social Security. I want to lockbox Medicare. The fact \nis, this is very serious business. I testified before Congress in 1985 \nas president of the National League of Cities. At that time, spending \nwas out of control. What happened was during the Reagan years--some of \nmy colleagues might not like to hear it--we reduced taxes, but at the \nsame time we reduced taxes which was supposed to stimulate the economy, \nat the same time we increased spending astronomically. What President \nReagan received was money for the defense initiative, and what the \nother colleagues received was money for domestic spending. It was \nduring that period of the 1980s where we saw the national debt \nskyrocket, and we gobbled up Social Security.\n  We need to be fiscally responsible. The way to do that is lockbox \nSocial Security so it can be used for deficit reduction; lockbox it so \nit can not be used for spending. I think we can leave here with our \nhead high and it will be something we may very well need by the end of \nthis year if things do not work out as well as we hoped.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio and I see the same \nproblem, but we have a different approach to solving the problem.\n  The Senator from Ohio says the Social Security is endangered. I \nagree. I say not only is the Social Security trust fund endangered but \nso, too, is the Medicare trust fund. Despite the words from the Senator \nfrom Ohio, there really is a Medicare trust fund. It really is in \nsurplus. We know that. That is from the reports from this \nadministration. Those are what the reports from the Congressional \nBudget Office make very clear.\n  Here is the ``Medicare Budget Outlook,'' from chapter 1, from the \nCBO, table 1-7 ``Trust Fund Surpluses.''\n  Under ``Medicare, Hospital Insurance (Part A),'' the trust fund is in \nsurplus each and every year of the years under consideration.\n  Part B, referenced by the Senator from Ohio, is in rough balance.\n  What the Senator from Ohio has confused with his charts, is that Part \nA has always been funded in one way, under one formula, and Part B has \nbeen funded under a different formula. Part A is funded by deductions \nfrom payrolls of employees all across the country. As I indicate, Part \nA is in surplus.\n  Part B is funded by premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries and by \ngeneral fund contributions. That is not in deficit as asserted by the \nSenator from Ohio. That is incorrect. Long ago, Congress determined \nPart B would be funded in part by contributions from the general fund, \nin part by premiums. We decide that level of contribution from the \ngeneral fund as a matter of law. We make that determination. It has \nnothing to do with the Part B trust fund being in surplus or deficit. \nIn fact, the reports of the Office of Management and Budget and the \nreports of the Congressional Budget Office show that the Part B trust \nfund is in rough balance because of that funding mechanism. It is not \nin deficit. That is an inaccurate statement. Part A is in surplus. So I \nbelieve the proper policy here is to give protection to both the Social \nSecurity trust fund and the Medicare trust fund, not just the Social \nSecurity trust fund, because the truth is Medicare is headed for \ninsolvency even sooner than Social Security.\n\n  I believe we ought to save the Social Security surplus and save the \nMedicare surplus; we ought to provide protection to both. It is \ncritically important that we do so.\n  The amendment I have offered in the second degree to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Ohio protects the Social Security surpluses in each \nand every year, takes the Medicare Part A trust fund surplus off \nbudget, just as we have done with Social Security, and gives Medicare, \nthe same protections as Social Security and contains strong enforcement \nfor both. This is an amendment that received 60 votes on the floor of \nthe Senate last year. Sixty\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\nMembers voted for protecting both Social Security and Medicare. I hope \nwe will do that again.\n  To go to the specific comparison of the two amendments I think would \nbe useful to our Members.\n  First, on the question of taking Medicare off budget, my amendment \ndoes so, to provide the same protection we have provided to Social \nSecurity. The basic idea is a simple one. Should we be using Medicare \ntrust fund money or Social Security trust fund money for other \npurposes? Should we be using that money to fund the other operations of \nGovernment? My answer would be that at a time of economic growth we \nsimply should not. We should not be raiding trust funds, retirement \nfunds, health care funds, to pay for other functions of Government. We \nshould not be using Medicare trust fund money to pay for national \ndefense. We should not be using Medicare trust fund money or Social \nSecurity trust fund money to pay for education. We should not be using \ntrust fund money to pay for tax cuts. We should not be using trust fund \nmoney to pay for the park system. The fundamental reason not to is we \nneed that money to make the funds solvent.\n  We have the baby boom generation coming along. If we use that money \nfor other purposes, it is not available to pay down debt or to address \nthe long-term liability in those programs. The fundamental effect is we \ndig the hole deeper before we start refilling it.\n  My amendment would take the Part A trust fund off budget and protect \nit just as we do Social Security. The Voinovich amendment does not. He \ndoes not protect Medicare like Social Security.\n  The second question is, Does it protect Medicare surpluses? My \namendment, the Conrad amendment, does. It creates supermajority points \nof order against any legislation that would decrease the Medicare trust \nfund or increase trust fund deficits in any fiscal year. The Voinovich \namendment has no such provision.\n  On the third question of protecting Medicare against cuts, yes, on \nthe Conrad amendment. We exempt Medicare trust funds from mandatory \nsequesters. We do not think those funds that are dedicated to Medicare \nshould be used to cover up the deficit in other places in the budget. \nWe do not think Social Security funds should be used for that purpose. \nWe do not believe Medicare funds should be used for that purpose. We \nhave already separately taxed people for Medicare and Social Security. \nThey are in surplus. To take their funds to pay for other functions of \nthe Federal Government is just wrong. No private sector entity could do \nthat. There is not a private sector entity in America that could raid \nthe retirement funds of their employees to pay the operating expenses \nof the company. There is not a private sector firm in America that \ncould take the health care trust funds of their employees and use them \nto fund the other operations of the company. That is illegal. It would \nbe illegal under Federal law if any private sector organization tried \nto do it.\n\n  Why don't we apply the same principle to ourselves? Why don't we say: \nLook, trust fund money? That is a different category. It is a different \ncategory from other spending. If we are going to do that, we have to \ntreat the Social Security trust fund and Medicare trust fund in the \nsame way. My amendment does. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio \nsimply does not. In fact, the amendment of the Senator from Ohio would \nrequire Medicare to be cut. Under his sequester, Medicare could be cut, \ndefense could be cut, any other part of Federal spending could be cut; \nit is undifferentiated. It doesn't matter whether it is a trust fund or \nother operations of Government; under the amendment of the Senator from \nOhio, they could all be cut.\n  I do not think that is right. I do not think it is right to treat the \nMedicare trust fund the same way as other Federal programs when there \nis a shortfall in Social Security--to cut Medicare to make up for it? I \ndon't think so. I do not think that is the right principle at all.\n  The fourth question: Do we protect on-budget surpluses? Yes, under \nthe Conrad amendment we create a supermajority point of order against \nthe budget resolution or other legislation that would cause or increase \nan on-budget deficit for any fiscal year; in other words, taking out \nSocial Security and Medicare, treating them as trust funds. That is \nwhat they are supposed to be, that is what they are designed to be, and \nwe ought to treat them as such. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio \nis the same as my amendment in that regard.\n  Protecting Social Security? The two are the same.\n  On the final question, providing for cuts in Medicare, education, \ndefense, and other programs, no, my amendment does not provide new \nsequesters beyond existing mandatory and discretionary sequesters under \nthe Budget Enforcement Act. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio \namends the Budget Enforcement Act to sequester spending in any year the \nestimated on-budget spending exceeds one-half of 1 percent of total \nestimated outlays, regardless of what caused the deficit--regardless of \nwhat caused it.\n  Under his proposal, even if it was a tax cut that caused the \nshortfall, you have to go out and cut Medicare; you have to go out and \ncut defense; you have to go out and cut education, even though it was \nnot a spending increase that caused the problem. If it was, instead, a \nshortfall in revenue or if, instead, it was some other provision that \ncreated the problem--a tax cut, for example, that caused the \nshortfall--his answer is the same in every case: You cut spending. It \ndoesn't matter what the cause of the problem is; you treat them all the \nsame. I do not think that makes sense or stacks up.\n  Under the amendment my colleague from Ohio is offering--I call it the \nRepublican broken safe because there is not a penny reserved for \nMedicare--you are protecting Social Security, which my amendment does \nas well, but he does nothing for Medicare. I do not think that is the \nway we want to go.\n  I will go back to my colleague from New Mexico, who I see is on the \nfloor now. This was his statement back in 1998:\n\n       For every dollar you divert to some other program you are \n     hastening the day when Medicare falls into bankruptcy, and \n     you are making it more and more difficult to solve the \n     Medicare problem in a permanent manner into the next \n     millennium.\n\n  He was exactly right when he made that statement. That is why I offer \nthis amendment today, to protect Social Security and Medicare, to treat \nthem as trust funds, because that is the way they were designed, that \nis the way they were set up, and that is the way we ought to treat \nthem.\n  This chart shows we are already in trouble. Under the budget that was \npassed, with the tax cut that was passed, with the economic slowdown \nthat is occurring, in the fiscal year 2001, the year we are in right \nnow, you can see we started with a $275 billion forecasted surplus, but \n$156 billion of that is Social Security money and $28 billion is \nMedicare trust fund money. When you take those out, you have $92 \nbillion left. Then you take out the tax bill. That is $74 billion. If \nyou take out what is in the budget resolution that passed both the \nSenate and the House, that is another $10 billion out of this year--\nmost of it in the bill that is before us right now, the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Then when you look at the interest associated with \nthe first two, we are down to a margin of only $6 billion this year.\n  Now we have been told by the administration we can anticipate--to be \nfair, this is Mr. Lindsey, Larry Lindsey, the President's Chief \nEconomic Adviser, who did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and said \nwhen we adjust the number that he used for the different baselines, we \nwould lose another $20 billion this year because of the economic \ndownturn. That puts us in the hole this year by $17 billion. That puts \nus into the Medicare trust fund by $17 billion.\n\n  That is before any appropriations bill has passed. No appropriations \nbill has passed. There is no spending beyond what is in the budget, and \nwe are already in trouble. And for next year you can see the same \npattern, but it is more serious in that we are using all of the \nMedicare trust fund next year, plus we are even using some of the \nSocial Security trust fund--only $4 billion but, nonetheless, the \nnumbers show that with the economic slowdown this year, we can \nanticipate lower receipts next year. If you look at all of the numbers \nand you look at how much of the money is in the trust funds, you\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nfind that we have a problem this year and next year.\n  If we go even further and look at the next 10 years, what we see is \nthat we have problems in the Medicare trust fund in the first 4 years. \nEvery year we are into the Medicare trust fund just based on the budget \nthat has passed, based on the tax cut that has passed, based on the \neconomic downturn we see so far. And that is before we consider the \nPresident's request for billions more for national defense. We are in \ntrouble already. We are into the trust funds already before we consider \nthe President's defense requests, before we consider any new money for \neducation.\n  Remember, we just passed an authorization bill with over $300 billion \nof new money for education. This is before we have any money for \nnatural disasters. And we typically have $5 to $6 billion for natural \ndisasters every year. This is before the tax extenders are passed. \nThose are popular provisions. The research and development tax credit--\ndoes anybody believe we are not going to extend the research and \ndevelop tax credit? Does anybody believe we are not going to extend the \nwind and solar tax credits? If we do, it is not in the budget. And it \njust makes the problem more severe.\n  I say to my colleagues, we are into the trust funds before any of \nthese additional measures, before the President's defense requests, \nbefore any new money for education, before money for natural disasters, \nbefore the tax extenders are provided for, before the alternative \nminimum tax problem is fixed. And I am not talking about a total fix to \nthe alternative minimum tax; I am just talking about a fix to the \nproblem created by this tax bill that has been passed. Just fixing that \nmatter is a $200 billion cost. This is before any further economic \nrevisions. And we have been alerted by the Congressional Budget Office \nto expect a further downward revision to the long-term forecast because \nof the weakening economy.\n  Colleagues, what could be more clear? We have a responsibility to \ndeal not just with the short term but with the long term as well.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, these unanimous consent requests have been \ncleared by both leaders and both managers of the bill that is now \nbefore us.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 90 minutes \nfor debate equally divided between Senators Voinovich and Conrad--and \nthis would go back to the time when they started their debate earlier \ntoday, which there is probably----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Pardon me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. If I could complete the request--on the subject of both the \nVoinovich amendment No. 865 and the Conrad amendment No. 866, that at \n2:15 p.m. there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided between \nSenators Voinovich and Conrad prior to a vote in relation to the Conrad \namendment; that following the disposition of his amendment--that is, \nthe Conrad amendment--there be 6 minutes equally divided between \nSenators Voinovich and Conrad followed by a vote in relation to the \nVoinovich amendment, as amended, if amended.\n  I want to make sure it is clear, all time already consumed by Senator \nVoinovich and Senator Conrad be charged against the 90 minutes. I also \nsay, to alleviate any questions anyone might have, there will be points \nof order raised against both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object--\nmaybe I didn't hear it--did you reserve some time for the Senator from \nNew Mexico to speak?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Voinovich has some time. I assume that is where \nyour time will come from, because we are already working under a time \nagreement that was entered into yesterday.\n  How much time remains for Senator Voinovich?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes.\n  Under the unanimous consent request, there would be 21 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. Twenty-one minutes.\n  I ask Senator Voinovich, would you yield some of that time to the \nranking member of the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. Voinovich. I would be more than happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You said you would?\n  Mr. Voinovich. Yes. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not use over 10 minutes, I say to the Senator. \nIt would be 7 to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. Voinovich. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the \nFeingold amendment No. 863, there be 30 minutes for debate divided as \nfollows prior to a vote in relation to the amendment: 20 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Feingold, 10 minutes equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member, with no second-degree amendments in order \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the Hollings amendment No. 873, there be 40 minutes for \ndebate divided as follows prior to a vote in relation to the amendment: \n20 minutes under the control of the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings; 20 minutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote; further, that this debate \ncommence upon the conclusion of the debate on the lockbox amendments \nthis morning--that is, the Voinovich and Conrad amendments--and that, \nfurther, a vote in relation to the Hollings amendment occur upon \ndisposition of the Voinovich amendment, as amended, if amended, with 4 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to the vote. And to clarify, \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee or \ntheir designees would control the 20 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to this unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me, through you, to my friend from North \nDakota, express my appreciation for his courtesy in yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just pick up where I left off and \npoint out that while we are in a period of surpluses now with respect \nto Medicare and Social Security, we all know what is to come. The \nCongressional Budget Office has alerted us. The Comptroller General of \nthe United States has alerted us. The Social Security Administration \nhas alerted us. Medicare has alerted us. And they all have told us the \nsame thing: That when we get past this decade--in the next decade when \nthe baby boomers start to retire--these surpluses turn to massive \ndeficits. That is what happens. The cash deficits begin in the year \n2016, and then they grow geometrically as more and more baby boomers \nretire.\n  That should warn us, that should alert us that we should not be using \nthe trust funds for other purposes. We should not be using the Medicare \nand Social Security trust funds to fund other operations of Government. \nYet we are poised to do that this year. We are poised to do it to an \neven greater degree next year. And we are poised to do it for the next \ndecade even in a time of strong economic growth.\n  Let's think about that. Let's think about it soberly. The \nadministration is not forecasting an economic slowdown next year or the \nyears thereafter; they are forecasting strong economic growth. In that \ncontext, the numbers reveal we will be using trust fund monies to fund \nthe other operations of the Federal Government. I do not think that is \nright.\n  Mr. Novak said, in a column yesterday, that I am--what did he say?--\nan antique fiscal conservative.\n  Whatever name one applies to it doesn't make much difference to me. \nIt doesn't have anything to do with antique. It has to do with common \nsense. You don't take trust fund money to pay for other programs when \nyou know\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\nwhat is to come, and there is no one in this Chamber who doesn't know \nwhat is to come. We know we are facing a demographic tidal wave unlike \nanything we have ever seen in our Nation's history. We are going to go \nfrom a time of surpluses in these trust funds to deficits.\n  One of the ways to deal with it is not to use the money in the trust \nfunds for other purposes. That is the heart and soul of my amendment. \nWe ought to pass it.\n  Does that mean you are forced to have a tax cut in a time of economic \nslowdown? No, absolutely not. We have an economic slowdown now. I \nproposed $60 billion of tax cuts, of fiscal stimulus this year. That \nwas part of the proposal I put before my colleagues--far more fiscal \nstimulus than the President proposed. That isn't the correct \nsuggestion, that somehow we would force tax increases or spending cuts \nat a time of an economic slowdown.\n  They are not forecasting an economic slowdown for this year or next \nyear or the year thereafter. They are forecasting strong economic \ngrowth. We see from the numbers that their plan has put us into the \ntrust funds of Medicare and Social Security even at a time of economic \ngrowth. That doesn't make sense to this Senator. I don't think it makes \nany sense at all.\n  My colleague on the other side put up a chart suggesting that \nspending is out of control, that that is the problem. I have to give \nthe other side of the story. That may be the popular view, but it \ndoesn't match the facts.\n  This chart shows Federal spending as a share of the economy has gone \ndown each and every year for the last 9 years. There hasn't been some \nbig spending splurge. He talks about one part of Federal spending. That \nis the chart he had. The chart he had was not all Federal spending. No, \nthe chart he had was one part of Federal spending that has shown \nsignificant increases. He didn't tell Members that he was showing a \nchart that has just one-third of Federal spending. He didn't say that. \nHe made people believe that was all of Federal spending on that chart. \nHe knows and I know that is not the case.\n  He knows and I know that the proper way to compare Federal spending \nis as a share of our gross domestic product because that takes out the \neffects of inflation. That is the way to make the best comparison.\n  What do we see when we do that? We see that Federal spending in 1992 \nwas 22 percent of gross domestic product. Federal spending in this \nyear, 2001, is going to be 18 percent of gross domestic product. There \nhas not been some big spending explosion. That is not an accurate \ncharacterization to the American people.\n  The fact is, the share of money out of national income going to the \nFederal Government has gone down dramatically, from 22 percent of gross \ndomestic product to 18 percent of gross domestic product today. That is \nabout a 20-percent reduction, not some big spending binge. That has \nbeen a reduction in the share of national income going to the Federal \nGovernment for spending. That is a fact.\n  Under the budget we passed, spending is not going up as a share of \ngross domestic product or as a share of our national income; Federal \nspending is going to continue to decline. It is going to go down to 16 \npercent of gross domestic product. That will be the lowest level since \n1951.\n\n  Facts are stubborn things. The fact is, we do not have runaway \nFederal spending. We have Federal spending going down and going down \nsharply as a share of our national income, which every economist \nasserts is the appropriate way to measure so that we take out the \neffects of inflation and show real trends, what is really happening.\n  This is what has happened to Federal spending. Right now it is at the \nlowest level since 1966 on a fair comparison basis, measured as a share \nof gross domestic product. We can see we did have sharp increases back \nin the 1980s. That is true. He was correct on that. But since then we \ncan see Federal spending as a share of GDP has gone down and gone down \nsharply, gone down to the lowest level since 1966. We are poised, with \nthe budget under which we are operating, to go down to the level last \nseen in 1951.\n  This is an important subject. We do have a growing problem of dipping \ninto the trust funds to finance the other operations of Government, \neven in a time of economic growth. It is economic growth that is \nforecasted next year. Those are all the numbers that are being used to \nmake these analyses. The problem is significant and growing.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a stand and vote to protect not only the \nSocial Security trust fund but the Medicare trust fund as well. That is \ncommon sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 17 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Ohio has 21 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not here in the Chamber to discuss \nthe economics of the next 4, 5, 6, 10 years, nor am I here to conduct \nan argument with the Budget chairman with reference to the status of \nthe economy, what we are getting versus what we projected. In due \ncourse, we will get some projections that are authentic and we will be \ndown here to talk about the shortfall, which perhaps is a shortfall in \nrevenue, but we have nothing official. We have a statement out of the \nWhite House. There is a formula that could be applied if the economy \ncomes down by x amount or the tax take could be reduced by a certain \namount. My good friend Senator Conrad is building a proposed set of \nhearings around that. I look forward to them.\n  For now, let me say the biggest thing that has happened with \nreference to the surplus is, No. 1, the Congress, led by the Senate, \ndecided to increase the stimulus this year in this remaining part of \nthe budget cycle. We decided in conference and then voted, with very \nlarge votes, that $72 billion would be given back to the American \npeople during the remainder of this year. That is a very large sum. It \nis the most prudent thing we could have done.\n  Looking back, I am very glad we did it. The only thing we have going \ngovernmentally that might help this economy is to get some of these tax \ndollars back into the hands of taxpayers to see if it will build on \ntheir confidence as consumers or if they will use it to purchase items \nthat are currently under the rubric of heavy inventories that are \ndriving the economy down.\n  No. 1, the only big thing we have done is put in place a tax cut of \naround $72 billion in the first year, this year, and about $30 billion \nplus next year. To the extent that that reduced the surplus, I guess \none would have to ask: Should we now undo that tax measure?\n  I understand somebody is going to propose as an amendment that we \nreduce the tax cuts. I don't know if it is in the first year or what, \nbut the Senate followed our good friend, Senator Hollings, here in the \nChamber while we were doing the budget resolution and said we should do \nmore in the first and second years, and essentially the conference on \nthe tax bill gave in to the proposals coming forth from this body.\n  The second thing that has happened is even though the Congressional \nBudget Office had dramatically reduced the expectation of growth, they \nwent from about a 5.1 growth to an estimate for the relevant year of \n2.5 percent, so we were operating on a rather conservative set of \neconomics, but what has happened is a shortfall in the American \neconomy, or the downturn, which has gone on pretty long--much longer \nthan many expected--is apparently going to cause some diminution, some \nlessening of the taxes coming into the coffers than was expected. We \ndon't have the exact information from how or from whence.\n  So we have a tax cut that is our best hope of bringing this economy \nback and causing this downturn to be minimum, at its minimal duration, \nand to start back up as early as possible. I did not promote that tax \npackage with enough enthusiasm about it being needed for the economy \nbecause I didn't believe we had the shortfall coming and it would last \nthis long. I spoke of that tax cut to make Government smaller and leave \nmoney in the hands of the people. Other people thought it was an \nantirecessionary measure, and I am grateful they did it because it \nturns out to be right.\n  The $70 billion this year and the $30 billion-plus next year are \nprobably as\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\nclose to what the economic doctor would have prescribed to us if he \nwere looking at the veins of our economy and saying we better make some \nof them a little more robust. So that happened. The economic estimate \nwent from 5.5 plus to 2.5 by the CBO. Apparently, it is coming down \nbeyond that, but for how long and how much, I don't know. We will be \ngetting our numbers together and we can have a very interesting debate. \nWhat do we do if, in fact, this recession, this downward trend, lasts a \nlittle longer than expected? What do we do with reference to the \nshortfall in revenues? Do we increase taxes? Of course not. Do we just \ncut everything in the Federal programs 10 percent or 8 percent? Of \ncourse not. We won't do that.\n  Today, we have an amendment by the new chairman of the Budget \nCommittee that, I regret to say, I cannot support. I don't think it is \nthe right thing to do. First of all, this amendment is the same \namendment that was offered in the Senate and defeated by the Senate on \nthe Bankruptcy Act. The amendment the distinguished chairman is \noffering now, he offered then. Approval of it was denied by the Senate.\n  The second thing is, if we look at the entire Medicare Program \ninstead of just Part A, we will see that Medicare is already running a \ndeficit of $58 billion in 2002 and nearly a trillion dollars over 10. \nFor what does that cry out? It cries out for reform of the Medicare \nsystem, and it cries out loudly for a different delivery system and \nprescription drugs.\n  Incidentally, there is $300 billion sitting in this budget to be used \nfor prescription drugs if and when we get a bill. But we have said all \nof the moneys that are part of Medicare should be used to reform this, \nand certainly Medicare money should be used as part of a reform \nmeasure, including prescription drugs.\n  The second point is that it was voted down in the Senate on a \npoint of order. This splits Medicare in half. For the first time, we \nhad half of Medicare off budget, half of Medicare on budget. That \ndoesn't mean anything to anyone out there. But it is just totally the \nwrong way to help solve the long-term problem in Medicare. Doesn't \neveryone in this Chamber hope that as part of prescription drugs we \nactually reform Medicare so that it can deliver more for less? It is a \n25- or 30-year-old regime, in terms of what is paid for and deducted \nand all of those things. Those should be made modern in the reform \npackage.\n\n  This amendment won't permit that because it says the portion of the \ntrust fund that is for Medicare Part A is totally off budget, but Part \nB is on budget.\n  From my standpoint, we are going to just encourage more gimmicks when \nwe do this kind of thing. We are all aware that the surpluses were \ngenerated because we shifted home health services from Part A to Part B \nin 1997--a charade of sorts because that was a way of saying Medicare \nlooks better--but at the same time we took one of the biggest \ncomponents of their responsibility away from them. Anybody can do \nbetter on money if they have five mortgages and somebody says: Well, \ndon't count three of them; we will put them somewhere else and you can \nrun around and say all you owe are two mortgages and the other three \nare sitting over there somewhere and you are not going to do anything \nabout them.\n  I believe the most important thing we can do--and everybody has \npriorities--the most important thing we can do this year--and I think \nthe President is taking the first step tomorrow--is to get started on \nMedicare reform. My concept would be that the money in Medicare, Part A \nand Part B--and the $300 billion in this budget for additional \nprescription drugs--we package all that and pass a Medicare bill this \nyear. I think that is the right thing to do.\n  I could talk a lot longer about trust funds and how they relate to \nthe budget of the United States. But, for today, I believe the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, or the ranking member, whose bill is \non the floor, will make a point of order. The distinguished majority \nwhip has said a point of order will be made. I think it will be made in \neach case by a different Senator, one from each side of the aisle. This \nviolates the Budget Act and therefore a point of order lies against it. \nI don't think anybody who votes for that is going to make it stick that \nthey are against Medicare.\n  As a matter of fact, one might make the argument that if the Conrad \namendment is adopted and made law, which is a long way from now, you \nmight make it harder to get reform in prescription drugs because you \nwill be working off some arbitrary lines that took part of it off \nbudget and left part on budget. So we need reform, not just shuffling \nmoney around.\n  I look forward to many days of discussions with my friend, the new \nchairman. I look forward with enthusiasm to discussing what is \nhappening to the American economy. What should we do since the lull is \na little longer? I think we ought to start talking about that.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding time \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 10 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from North Dakota has just over 17 minutes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we always welcome the sage observations of \nthe former chairman of the Budget Committee and, probably not \nsurprisingly, we disagree. There is nothing in my amendment that \nprecludes reform of Medicare. I not only serve on the Budget Committee, \nI serve on the Finance Committee. I have been part of every reform \neffort on Medicare that has occurred. So I am in favor of Medicare \nreform, and there is nothing in my amendment that prevents further \nMedicare reform.\n  In fact, I believe this amendment is part of Medicare reform because \nit recognizes that the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare both \ndeserve protection. That is the reality. That is what is at the heart \nof this discussion and debate today.\n  Make no mistake, this talk about Medicare being in deficit is just \nerroneous. Let's review the Congressional Budget Office report.\n  Here is Medicare. Under the table that is headlined ``Trust Fund \nSurpluses,'' Medicare Part A, which is financed out of payroll \ndeductions, is in surplus each and every year of the 10 years of the \nforecast period.\n  Medicare Part B is in rough balance over the 10 years. In some years, \nit is down $1 billion and then it is in surplus by $3 billion, $2 \nbillion, $2 billion. The fact is Part B is in rough balance over the 10 \nyears.\n  The Senator says it is a deficit. It is not a deficit. It is a \nfunding mechanism we decided on in Congress for Medicare Part B. Part \nof the money comes from premiums. Part of the money comes from the \ngeneral fund. It is not in deficit.\n  The report of the Congressional Budget Office shows very clearly it \nis in rough balance. Part A is in clear surplus.\n  If you allow the money that is in surplus in the trust funds of \nMedicare to be used for other purposes, which we are now poised to do \nbecause of an unwise fiscal policy that has been put in place, guess \nwhat happens.\n  What does that mean? I do not think we want to force the Medicare \ntrust fund to go broke faster. It does not make sense to me.\n  The Senator from Michigan is seeking time. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank our Budget Committee chairman for his \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to be cosponsoring the amendment \nhe has offered to protect Medicare and Social Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add my name as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is a very simple, straightforward \ndebate: Are we going to protect Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds for their intended purpose, or are we going to allow them to be \nused for other purposes?\n  My friend from Ohio speaks about Social Security trust funds, and I \nshare his concern about protecting them, but that is not enough without \nincluding Medicare. I find it so interesting that in the Budget \nCommittee we have\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\nheard testimony from the Secretary of the Treasury about protecting \nSocial Security, and we have heard from the OMB Director about \nprotecting Social Security, but nowhere do they talk about protecting \nMedicare.\n  Then we turn around and review over 30 years of reports regarding the \nMedicare trust fund, the solvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund. \nFor over 30 years, we have acted as if there is a Medicare trust fund.\n  Now we are being told magically this year, with the new \nadministration, that there is no trust fund. I find that quite amazing. \nIn fact, there is a Medicare Part A trust fund. It is in surplus. It \ngoes for important health care purposes. Just ask our hospitals. It is \nimportant we protect those dollars for those who receive health care \nthrough Medicare.\n\n  I also find quite interesting the logic that if, in fact, there is \nnot a Medicare trust fund, there is no surplus; then rather than \nputting money into Medicare in order to strengthen it, we should spend \nit for other items. That is basically what we are hearing; that it is \nall right to spend Medicare for something other than health care for \nseniors and the disabled because somehow, through accounting \nmechanisms, we decided there is no trust fund.\n  The Conrad amendment, which is so fundamental and so important to the \npeople of our country, simply says we will not spend Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds for something other than the intended purpose. \nThis is absolutely critical. Those of us who stood in this Chamber and \nexpressed concern about the budget resolution, expressed concern that, \nin fact, Medicare and Social Security would be used to pay for the tax \ncut that passed, to pay for other spending, the reason Senator Evan \nBayh, Senator Olympia Snowe, I, and others offered something called a \nbudget trigger during that debate was simply to say we did not want to \nbe in this situation and that phase-in of the tax cuts would be \nsuspended if we were dipping into Medicare and Social Security.\n  That received 49 votes, not quite enough for adoption. We now move on \nthroughout the year, and we find ourselves, as our Budget chairman has \nindicated, poised to spend Medicare health care dollars for other \npurposes, not in the future but this year and every year until 2010.\n  The Conrad amendment simply says we will not do that; we will protect \nthe sacred promise of Social Security and Medicare; we will not spend \nSocial Security or Medicare for other than the intended purpose.\n  This is what we ought to make sure we put into place and protect for \nthe future, for those who are counting on us, who are paying into \nMedicare as well as Social Security and are counting on us to make sure \nthat health care is available to them when they need it.\n  I believe Medicare and Social Security are great American success \nstories and we ought to do everything in our power to guarantee that \nboth of those trust funds are strengthened and protected, not weakened. \nThe Conrad lockbox amendment protects those promises and those trust \nfunds for the future, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to strongly support the Conrad amendment.\n  I yield back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio controls 9 minutes 40 \nseconds. The Senator from North Dakota controls exactly 9 minutes.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. How much time does the Senator from North Dakota have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes forty seconds, and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota controls 9 minutes exactly.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I will make a couple of remarks and let \nthe Senator from North Dakota finish up on his time, and then I want to \ngive Senator Gramm of Texas the last part of my time, if that is \nacceptable to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio may proceed.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we have a saying in Ohio, especially \nnorth of Route 40, that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's \near. We are talking about a Medicare Part A surplus, and to not also \nrecognize that we have a Part B Medicare responsibility and argue that \nwe have a surplus when the figures show that when we put A and B \ntogether they are in deficit some $52 billion--there is no such thing \nas a Medicare surplus, if you are looking at Medicare as it really is, \nand that is Part A and Part B.\n  In this budget, we are going to have about $36 billion more than what \nwe expected in Part A, but on Part B--that is the out of hospital--we \nare going to be in deficit some $88 billion. When we put the two of \nthem together, we are in deficit $52 billion.\n  How can one talk about a Medicare surplus when we are in debt $52 \nbillion? If we take the next 10 years, we are going to take in $393 \nbillion more in Part A, but in Part B we are going to have to subsidize \n$1.36 trillion, and it all works out to be a deficit of $643 billion.\n  The point I am making is this: There is no Medicare surplus; it is a \nfiction. If we are to go along with the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, in fact, what is going to happen is it will be used to \npay down debt, and we will not have it to reform Medicare, which we \nneed to do. We will not have it to pay for the prescription drug \nbenefits that the American people are demanding we provide, and \nhopefully we are going to do something about it this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against that amendment and to support the real pure \nlockbox of Social Security that I suggest today.\n\n  I point out to the Senator from North Dakota that the sequester does \nnot take Medicare or Social Security. It exempts those under the Budget \nAct of 1985 so you don't have to worry, if the sequester goes into \nforce, taking anything--Social Security, Medicare, and some of the \nother things to which the Senator made reference. It is written in my \namendment and references the 1985 budget agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my staff says the Senator is incorrect \nwhen he says his amendment protects Medicare from the sequester, \nprotects Social Security. They assert after examining the amendment \nthat it does not protect Medicare from a sequester.\n  More importantly is the question of whether there is a trust fund \nsurplus. I ask the Senator from Ohio, does he dispute the report of the \nCongressional Budget Office? The report of the Congressional Budget \nOffice is as clear as it can be on page 19. I refer the Senator to \n``Trust Fund Surpluses.''\n  Here is Social Security. We all know it is in surplus. Medicare, \nhospital insurance, Part A, is in surplus every single year. Part B is \nin rough balance over the 10 years.\n  The Senator from Ohio has confused the funding mechanism for Part B. \nThe funding mechanism is part of the cost, for Part B is premiums paid \nby those who are Medicare eligible and the other part is a general fund \ncontribution. It is not in deficit. It is a choice made by Congress as \nto how to fund Part A, which are payroll deductions. That is how it is \nfunded. It is in surplus. Part B is funded by premiums for part of the \ncosts and by general fund contributions for the other part. It is not \nin deficit. It is a funding decision made by the Congress. Part A is in \nsurplus; Part B is in rough balance.\n  To suggest there is no surplus, I ask the Senator, what is his \nconclusion, this money doesn't exist? There is no surplus in Part A \nyear by year? I don't think so. It is as clear as it can be.\n  If one says there is no surplus and make it a jump ball, make this \nmoney available for other purposes, that is what will happen around \nhere. That is the implication of the Senator's position. I don't think \nthat is a wise position. I don't think it is a prudent position. It is \ncertainly not a conservative position. It is a position that says we \ncan use this money for any purpose; it doesn't matter. It doesn't \nmatter that we have a trust fund. It doesn't matter that these moneys \nare supposed to be protected. We will use them any place.\n\n  That is exactly what got us back into trouble in the 1980s. We raided \nevery trust fund in sight and put this in the deficit ditch and \nexploded the deficits\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nand exploded the debt. I don't want any part of repeating that process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 6 minutes 24 seconds controlled \nby the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from Ohio. There is only one person in \nthis Congress who has done anything to control spending thus far, and \nhis name is George Voinovich of Ohio. He got 35 Members of the Senate \nto sign a letter urging the President to veto spending bills that were \nover budget, that threatened the viability of Social Security and \nMedicare, and threatened the surplus. I congratulate him on that. He \nhas proposed a mechanism to be sure we do not spend the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  First of all, let me make it clear there is not a Medicare surplus. \nIf ever there has been a fraud, this is it. It is true that one part of \nMedicare has a surplus of $29 billion. But it is also true that the \nother part of Medicare has a deficit of $73 billion, so Medicare in \nterms of taking general revenue, losing money, is running a deficit of \n$44 billion.\n  Even the surplus in Part A is the product of a gimmick from the \nClinton administration where we took the fastest growing part of Part \nA, home health care, and ``saved'' $174 billion by paying for it out of \nPart B rather than Part A.\n  I am tempted to vote for the Senator from North Dakota's amendment \nbecause it makes it harder to spend money. I rejoice in that. But don't \nact as if there is a real surplus in Medicare and it is equivalent to \nthe genuine surplus which exists in Social Security.\n  There is an additional problem in that the Senator from Ohio has a \nsequester to enforce the protection of the Social Security surplus \nwhich does not exist under the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Let me outline what this is about. This is not about solvency of \nMedicare. It is not about solvency of Social Security. There are not \nreal trust funds for either. Both of these programs have phony IOUs \nthat the Federal Government prints, but it is a debt of the Federal \nGovernment to the Federal Government. It is like writing yourself an \nIOU and putting it in your left pocket and saying: I am richer by that \namount. The problem is you have to take money out of the right pocket \nto pay for it.\n  We are not using either one of these surpluses to provide for these \nprograms in the future. If the money were being invested in the name of \nthe people who are paying these taxes and those investments could be \nsold in the future to pay benefits, this would be a real debate about \nprotecting Social Security and protecting Medicare.\n  I am very interested in this debate because it is about protecting \nfreedom. It is about stopping a runaway spending machine. In the last 6 \nmonths of the Clinton administration, we increased spending by $561 \nbillion over the next 10 years, in a 6-month period. There has never \nbeen anything comparable to that in American history. There is still a \nmentality in this Senate that we can afford to do everything anybody \nwants to do. In fact, in the supplemental appropriations bill before \nthe Senate, we have half a dozen amendments that simply add more \nspending for little pork barrel projects and for great big programs, \nfor important items such as defense, for unimportant items such as \nsomebody's pet project. But the point is, we are still spending money \nas if it is water.\n  I am for both these amendments because they both make it harder to \nspend money. I would have to say that the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee has a power that no other Member of the Senate has \nbecause under the budget resolution he unilaterally controls $423.8 \nbillion worth of reserve funds, and simply by saying ``no,'' that money \ncannot be spent. No one is in a better position than the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee to deal with the crisis that he has \ntalked about.\n  When Senator Domenici was chairman, we had a surplus. We were not \nspending any of the so-called surplus in Medicare. We were not spending \na penny of the Social Security surplus. We had general surplus in the \nrest of the budget. Now that the Senator from North Dakota has taken \ncontrol and apparently things have almost spontaneously gone to hell, \nit seems to me he has a lot of explaining to do. I look forward to \nhearing it.\n\n  But the bottom line is, we have a proposal before us that sets up a \nprocess to make it much harder to spend the Social Security surplus. \nThen, if we spend it, it has an enforcement mechanism through a \nsequester. Every Member of the Senate that means it when they say \nanything about Social Security ought to vote for the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  In my opinion, the case for the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota is a much weaker case. There is not a Medicare surplus. There is \na surplus in one part of it, there is a deficit in the other, and we \ncreated the surplus by taking the fastest growing part out of it during \nthe Clinton administration and putting it into Part B. So the whole \nthing is kind of a fabrication. On the other hand, if we actually did \nnot allow this surplus to be--quote--spent, it would be harder to spend \nmoney. But there is another paradox, and that is you could not even \nspend it for Medicare.\n  So whatever you do on the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, \nI urge you to support the amendment of the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time controlled by the Senator from Ohio has \nexpired. The Senator from North Dakota has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is wrong about the \namendment of the Senator from Ohio.\n  I just say this. Some of what the Senator from Texas says I agree \nwith. I really do think we have a circumstance that requires us to \nthink very carefully about how we are going to deal with requests for \nadditional spending, requests for additional tax reductions, because, \nas I calculate it, the cupboard is bare. We are already into the trust \nfunds or are poised to be if the items in the budget resolution are \nenacted. We are into the trust funds, just based on the tax cut that \nhas passed, based on the budget resolution that has passed, and based \non reductions in revenue because of the economic slowdown.\n  Tongue in cheek, the Senator from Texas suggests it is my ascension \nto chairman of the Budget Committee that has somehow led to these \nevents. I can assure the Senator from Texas that it was not my becoming \nchairman of the Budget Committee that led to the economic slowdown, and \nit was not my ascension to the Budget Committee chairmanship that led \nto the passage of the budget resolution. I opposed it. It wasn't my \nposition as Budget Committee chairman that led to the passage of the \ntax bill. I opposed it because I predicted then we would face the \ncircumstance I believe we face now. That is, we have just done too much \nand the result is we have a problem.\n\n  I am not for raising taxes at a time of economic slowdown. I am not \nfor cutting spending at a time of economic slowdown because that would \ncounter fiscal stimulus, and we need fiscal stimulus. But looking ahead \nto times when the administration projects strong economic growth, it \ndoes not seem wise to me that we use the trust funds of Social Security \nand Medicare for other purposes. That just does not seem to be a wise \nthing to do. My amendment would prevent us from doing it.\n  It would not absolutely prevent us because you could get around it \nwith 60 votes. That is always true here. The Senator from Texas talks \nabout the power that I have. The power I have is actually rather \nlimited. The power I have is to release reserve funds that are in the \nbudget, but any action I take can be overcome by 60 votes in the \nSenate.\n  I have sent the very clear signal to the Secretary of Defense and the \nadministration with respect to their request for additional spending \nfor defense. By the way, I believe we need more money for defense. But, \ngiven our fiscal situation, the question becomes, Will it be taken out \nof the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security, or will it be paid \nfor by spending cuts elsewhere, or will it be paid for by additional \nrevenue? I do not believe it should come out of the trust funds of \nMedicare and Social Security. I think that is wrong. I think that is a \nmistake.\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from Ohio is deficient. No \nmatter what the cause of the shortfall is, he has only one answer. His \nanswer is: Cut spending everywhere else, other than Social Security. I \ndo not think that is the right answer. I think everything has to be on \nthe table, revenue and spending cuts, especially if the problem is \ncaused by tax cuts that were too big.\n  No matter what the cause, whether it is economic downturn, whether it \nis a tax cut that was too big, he has only one answer: Cut all spending \nother than Social Security. I do not think that is a balanced response. \nI do not think that is a balanced response.\n  Let me go again to the question of spending. I ask the Chair how much \ntime is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator has 55 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, the Senator from Texas talked about spending being \nout of control. I just beg to differ. I do not think that is what the \nrecord shows. As a share of GDP, Federal spending has gone down each \nand every year for the last 9 years, from 22 percent of GDP to 18 \npercent this year. Under the budget resolution that passed, Federal \nspending as a share of gross domestic product is going to continue to \ndecline, from 18 percent of GDP down to 16.3 percent, the lowest level \nof GDP since 1951. Discretionary spending, domestic discretionary \nspending is going to be at the lowest level in our history.\n  So, please, let's not be telling the American people there is some \nbig spending binge that has been going on here and put up a chart such \nas the one the Senator from Ohio has up there that has just one part of \nFederal spending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 873\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senate will now debate the amendment of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. Madam President, I \nwant to yield to the distinguished ranking member of our Finance \nCommittee because he has a conflict. We want to try to accommodate \nthat.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. I will not consume all the time that has been allocated to our \nside. I will not be here to allocate other time, so anybody who wants \nto speak in opposition to the Hollings amendment is free to yield \nthemselves what time I might have remaining.\n  Even though Senator Hollings has not discussed his amendment--he is \ngoing to do that very shortly--I have strong opposition to his \namendment because his amendment would repeal the retroactive marginal \nrate cuts enacted on June 7, this year, barely 1 month ago. My \nopposition to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina is based both on procedural and substantive grounds. First, \nprocedural problems with the amendment: It is a tax amendment. As a tax \namendment, it obviously falls within the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. The bill before the Senate is an appropriations bill, not a \nfinance bill. As the senior Finance Committee Republican, I must oppose \nthis tax amendment on an appropriations bill.\n  Furthermore, if Senator Hollings were to prevail, this appropriations \nbill would become a Senate-originated revenue bill and, as such, it \nwould be blue-slipped when sent to the other body. In other words, this \namendment, if added to the underlying supplemental appropriations bill, \nwould kill the appropriations bill we are now considering, a bill that \nis so badly needed.\n  As bad as this amendment is procedurally, it is even worse \nsubstantively. This amendment would repeal all the retroactive marginal \nrate reductions in a recently passed tax bill. Those tax rate cuts are \nbased principally on the new 10-percent bracket for the first $6,000 of \nincome for single taxpayers and $12,000 of income for married \ntaxpayers. The retroactive, new tax percent bracket is the basis, then, \nfor the advanced refund checks of $300 for single people and $600 for \nmarried couples that will soon by mailed out by the Treasury Department \nstarting July 23. So the Hollings amendment, then, would stop these \nchecks dead in their tracks. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a way \nto say no to American taxpayers who now expect to receive the refund \nchecks.\n  These checks and the other retroactive rate cuts are, of course, a \nstimulus in the tax legislation that we just enacted. Just when the \neconomy is slowing down and when the economy, then, is in need of a \nstimulus, the Hollings amendment would pull the rug out from under our \nattempt to stimulate it. Frankly, I cannot think of a proposal more \ndamaging to the potential return to economic growth than the amendment \non which we will soon vote.\n\n  Soon, in a separate speech, I am going to discuss in some depth the \ntax legislation just enacted. Let me point out one important fact for \none to chew on in the meantime. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Federal taxes are at an all-time high of 20.6 percent of the \neconomy. That is higher than taxes were even in World War II. \nIndividual income taxes are at record levels as a percentage of the \nGDP. The tax legislation returns this overpayment--which is dragging \ndown American workers, investors, businesses, and collectively the \nAmerican economy--to the people.\n  What the Hollings amendment really says is, return taxes to their \nrecord levels. The Hollings amendment says high taxes are no problem \nand should be ignored in a slowing economy. Think about this, my fellow \nSenators. This amendment, in effect, raises taxes at a time we have a \nslowing economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and thank Senator Hollings for \nyielding to me to make these remarks at this point ahead of him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished then-chairman of the \nFinance Committee, when they reported out the tax cut, did not include \na rebate, did not include a tax cut for this present fiscal year, 2001. \nBut to not have it in all of a sudden has become, in his words, \ndangerous: Oh, this is a dangerous thing. I am just doing what he, as \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, reported out.\n  I have said: Look, let's not have a tax cut for the year 2001. That \nis exactly what President Bush said when he submitted his tax cut: \nLet's not have a tax cut for 2001. We will begin in 2002. That is what \nthe House of Representatives said when they passed the tax cut. They \nsaid: Don't have it for 2001. Let's begin in 2002.\n  Now, all of a sudden, to do that has become dangerous? a \nconstitutional question? I originated this particular rebate, which I \nask now to be repealed, in the Senate. The Senate did not raise a \nconstitutional point of order that it was a revenue measure that should \nderive in the House. Every one of the Republicans voted for it, without \nquestion, without point of order, without constitutional question. They \ndid not blue-slip it when it got over to the House of Representatives.\n  Now where are we? They talk about campaign finance in the morning \npaper and say the House is debating it and they are only going to have \n1 day of debate. But we are only going to have 15 minutes of debate \nhere this morning on campaign finance because that is all this is. \nNobody thinks now the minimal, too late, too little rebate is going to \nwork. I have not found anybody who really thinks mailing somebody $300 \nor $600 is all of a sudden going to trigger a recovery in a $10 \ntrillion economy--let me emphasize this. When it got to be about \nFebruary and March, and I really began to worry about the economy, \nwondering if there was anything that could be done, yes, there was a \nrebate being discussed. So I went to the financial minds on Wall Street \nand the economists--because I am a former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and I know whom to call and whom to talk to--and I said: \nLook, do you think a rebate will work? They said: It's 50-50, a flip of \nthe coin. It might, but probably will not. To make sure it works, they \ntold me the rebate ought to be at least 1 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of $10 trillion, which is $100 billion. And it certainly ought \nto cover as many taxpayers as possible.\n\n  So we set out with $100 billion, and we included the 95 million \nincome-tax payers and the 25 million payroll-tax payers, and do you \nknow what those\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nrascals did? Listen to this. They gimmickly said: The corporate taxes \ndue in September--namely, fiscal year 2001--we are going to move that \nover to October so we will have enough money for the campaign next \nyear.\n  Talk about campaign financing. Where are we going to take it away? We \nare going to take it away from, of all people, Dicky Flatt.\n  The Senator from Texas is always talking about little Dicky Flatt who \npulls the wagon and pays the taxes and builds the country and sits \naround the kitchen table. Poor Dicky Flatt gets nothing. And what does \nthis amendment say? Let's put everybody in Dicky Flatt's shoes. If he \nand the 25 million payroll-tax payers are not going to get anything, \nthen let's not give it to anybody because we can save $40 billion. To \npay for what? To pay for the defense, the $18 billion increase that \nSecretary Rumsfeld says we are going to need. To pay for what? The \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa re-allocated $250 million over 10 years \nfor education.\n  Everybody is asking: Where is the money? Instead of sobering up and \nlooking at it in a judicious fashion and saying, wait a minute, what we \nare really doing is borrowing, we will have to borrow some $40 billion \nto distribute around when we know it is not going to do the job.\n  Let me emphasize why I say borrow. Here in my hand is the debt to the \npenny. The U.S. Department of the Treasury publishes this on the \nInternet. The national debt now is up to $5.710 trillion. At the \nbeginning of the fiscal year it was $5.674 trillion. So, a surplus? \nCome on. The debt has gone up. We have a deficit, as of this minute, of \n$36 billion and it is going up.\n  I will take another bet if the distinguished former chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, will come out. I will \nstill jump off the Capitol dome. He wants me to, I know. But I will \njump off that dome if the deficit is less than $50 billion by the end \nof September. You watch. It is going up, up, and away.\n  Here are the CBO figures. These are my realities. You can see here, \nwe have ended the fiscal year 2000 with a $22.7 billion deficit, and at \nthe beginning of this year, CBO was projecting a $26 billion surplus \nfor 2001.\n  Then in May, they verified that $26 billion by saying: We are going \nto have to adjust it down by $6 billion. So it went down to $20 \nbillion. You can see that we Democrats have been fiscally responsible. \nWhen President Clinton came in office, he came in with a $403.6 billion \nincrease in the debt--a deficit of $403.6 billion. We have been going \ndown, down, down in the red, and we lost the Senate. Yes, because we \nvoted for an increase in taxes, a cut in the size of Government--over \n300,000 slots--and a cut in spending of over $350 billion. And what did \nthat do? The market and technology boomed for 8 years, and for 8 years \nstraight we have been reducing into the black and going right into \nsurplus. As of April 3, we had a $102 billion surplus.\n  Now, today, July 10, we are already back in the red. I voted for a \nbalanced budget under Lyndon Johnson, but I haven't been able to for \nthe past 34 years. I thought I could have until they came with the tax \ncut. And now they insist on it when they are going to give it to the \nrich. A stimulus was not even contemplated by President Bush, not \ncontemplated by Chairman Grassley of Finance, not contemplated by the \nHouse of Representatives. And it was certainly not contemplated for \nDicky Flatt, not for the 25 million payroll tax payers who really need \nthe relief. I had to put it in on the Senate side.\n  Oh, yes, they are buying the vote. That is all this is, campaign \nfinance. It is a sad thing because we thought we could stay on course \nfinancially.\n  You can see on the chart how at 22.7, we started going down in the \nred. Then we started back up, and now we are headed down to 75 and \nstaying. If we had stayed on course, we were going to remain in the \nblack, surplus, surplus, surplus. And that is what we heard from \nPresident Bush. Now he talks about stimulating, stimulating, when he \nhad no idea of stimulating. His tax cut included nothing for this \nparticular fiscal year.\n  I do not touch his tax cut. I lost on that particular vote. They \nstill have their tax cut beginning next fiscal year. But they put in, \nrather than a rebate, as I had it, of $500 and $1,000 and going to 120 \nmillion taxpayers in America, a rebate of just $300 and $600. They also \nleft out the most important of all taxpayers, the payroll tax payers, \nsome 25 million, who get nothing.\n  All I am saying is, wait a minute, let's save the money. Let's don't \ngo out and borrow it because we don't have it. Go over to the Treasury \nDepartment. And don't let them give you the doubletalk, either, when \nyou get over to Treasury. When I mention doubletalk, this is what I \nmean. Let me explain to my colleagues. They talk about private debt and \npublic debt, unified budget deficits and all this; we have had this \ngamesmanship for 34 years now. Debt held by the public has gone down \n$137 billion, but the debt held by the Government has gone up $173 \nbillion. That is where you get the deficit of $36 billion. So we are \nborrowing now.\n  I don't want to get into it with my distinguished chairman who is \ndoing an outstanding job trying to save Social Security and Medicare. I \ncan tell him, according to the Treasury records, as of this minute, \nthey have spent $173 billion of trust funds. You have a computer. Just \nlook up this information on the Internet.\n  I don't know where they got the $173 billion. I have my ideas where \nthey get it. They continue to spend. We passed 13-301. You have a \nSecretary of the Treasury running around, Secretary O'Neill, saying \nthere never has been any money in the Social Security trust fund. The \nGreenspan Commission, section 21, said put Social Security off budget. \nOn November 5, 1990, George Herbert Walker Bush signed it into law, 13-\n301, to put Social Security off budget in the sense that the President \nand the Congress were forbidden to report a budget that included the \nSocial Security trust funds. Everybody voted for it, 98-2 here in the \nSenate. But they totally ignore it. And now we have the Secretary of \nthe Treasury saying there never has been a trust fund.\n  That is how run amok this Government has become. It is time we sober \nup and stop spending money we don't have. Everybody is talking about \npaying down the debt, paying down the debt. A vote against this is to \nincrease the debt. I am saying let's hold the tax schedule where it is \nand, in short, do away with the rebate because it is not going to do \nany good. Everybody knows there is no chance of it. And in time, Madam \nPresident, we might find some money to take care of defense, take care \nof education, take care of the $6.5 billion for this supplemental bill. \nThat was never contemplated. We are looking for money as a way to pay \nit, and rather than going out and borrowing it, we are distributing it \naround to buy the vote. That is all it is going to do politically. It \nis not going to do anything economically. Maybe we can get back to some \nrational approach to our fiscal affairs.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan can do all he will with respect to the monetary policy, \nbut it is up to us to take care of the fiscal policy, the long-range \ninterest rates and everything else.\n  A headline from the Financial Times reads, ``Hard Landing Alert \nSounded for U.S. Economy.'' And again, Mort Zuckerman, editor in chief \nof U.S. News and World Report, says that consumer spending, capital \nspending, and exports are declining rapidly, that the economy is in \nworse shape than it looks.\n  With that confronting us, why are we running around borrowing some \n$40 billion to mail around knowing it is not going to do any good, \nconfronting funding Social Security, funding Medicare, funding the \neducation increase of $30 billion a year, funding the increase that \nSecretary Rumsfeld wants of $18 billion?\n  I retain the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 2 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote on the Conrad amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is an \namendment I offered last year that got 60 votes on the floor of the \nSenate. Earlier this year, it got 53 votes on the floor of the Senate. \nIt says we should protect both the Social Security and the Medicare \ntrust funds. We already provide some protection of the Social Security \ntrust fund. It would strengthen those protections. We would also \nprovide those same protections to the Medicare trust fund. Both of \nthese trust funds deserve protection. If we don't provide it, the money \nwill be used for other purposes.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. May I ask, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Conrad \namendment. In fiscal year 2002, the overall Medicare Program would \nrequire over $50 billion in general tax revenues. Over the next 10 \nyears, the Medicare Program would require over $600 billion in general \ntax revenues. We can't lockbox something that simply does not exist. It \nis a fiction.\n  This amendment, in my opinion, will harm our ability to reform \nMedicare and also harm our ability to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit that is so long due for the American people.\n  Furthermore, the Conrad amendment does not contain any real teeth in \nterms of a Social Security lockbox. It lacks any automatic enforcement \nmechanism to protect Social Security. I urge my colleagues to vote no \non the amendment and against the waiver of the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, I raise a point of order \nthat this amendment violates section 306 of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthat act for the purpose of the pending amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained during this \nvote on the motion to waive the Budget Act with regard to the Conrad \namendment, vote No. 221. Had I been present I would have voted ``aye.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 865\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Voinovich amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nAllard, Fitzgerald, and Hagel as cosponsors, and I also thank Senators \nSessions, Helms, and Crapo for their help on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask my colleagues to vote to support our Social \nSecurity lockbox amendment. Our lockbox strengthens the existing point \nof order against spending the existing Social Security surplus. Our \nlockbox makes it out of order to use the Social Security surplus in any \nsingle year of the next decade. More important, our amendment contains \nan automatic enforcement mechanism. If OMB reports the Federal \nGovernment will spend the Social Security surplus, an automatic across-\nthe-board cut in spending, a sequester will be put in place. The size \nof this sequester will offset the use of the surplus. This is the \nultimate enforcement mechanism. If the Social Security surplus looks \nlike it will get spent, the OMB stops it from happening. This will \nensure we stay the course on limiting spending and pay down the \nnational debt as we promised when we passed the budget resolution.\n  Spending cuts under this amendment would impact both discretionary \nand mandatory spending. Mandatory spending for the most needy in \nsociety would not be affected by these cuts. My amendment would exclude \nSocial Security, food stamps, and other programs that are excluded from \nsequesters under the Deficit Control Act of 1985. In reality, about $33 \nbillion of mandatory spending is subject to sequester. Hopefully, we \nwould never have to use the sequester.\n\n  This amendment is straightforward. It relies largely on existing law. \nIt primarily builds upon the existing budget process. We all know \nSocial Security is off budget and my amendment reinforces that \nposition. Our amendment does not modify any budgetary conventions, nor \ndoes it pretend Social Security is something it is not. We must make \nsure history does not repeat itself. For years the Social Security \nsurplus has been an all too readily available source of cash for \nCongress to spend. However, since 1999, there has been a political \nconsensus not to return to spending of the Social Security surplus, in \nlarge part because we have had an on-budget surplus that supplied the \nextra money.\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\n  If, however, the economic prosperity that this Nation enjoyed \nrecently continues to fade, although I hope this is a temporary \nsituation, and surplus projections are likely to be revised downward, \nthen the Social Security surplus will again be in the crosshairs. It \nwill be in the crosshairs because of Congressional yearning for more \nspending.\n  If you want to make sure money is there to follow through on what we \npromised the American people, if you want to pay down the debt, if you \nwant to control spending, and if you want to do it in an accountable, \nenforceable way, without gimmicks, vote for this amendment. I think \neveryone in this room knows this is the right thing to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment and urge them to vote for waiving \nthe point of order that will be raised against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Voinovich amendment does nothing to \nprotect Medicare. Just a few short months ago, every member of the \nRepublican caucus voted for protection for both Medicare and Social \nSecurity. What has occurred that would lead them now to forget \nMedicare?\n  This is not a wise course. In the name of protecting Social Security, \nthis amendment would cut Medicare. The sequester that is provided for \nin this amendment says, if we are on the edge of going into Social \nSecurity, cut Medicare, cut defense. It is a one-trick pony. It does \nnot matter whether the deficiency was caused by a tax cut, by an \neconomic downturn, or by excessive spending, the answer to each and \nevery one of them is the same: cut spending. It does not matter if the \nproblem was caused by too big a tax cut: cut spending. It does not \nmatter if the problem was caused by an economic downturn, the answer is \ncut spending. It is not a balanced approach.\n  The assertion that there is no Medicare surplus simply does not fit \nthe facts. This is the report of the Congressional Budget Office. On \npage 19, under the table ``Trust Fund Surpluses,'' it shows Social \nSecurity in surplus, it shows Medicare Part A in surplus, it shows \nMedicare Part B in rough balance.\n  The argument that the Senator from Ohio is making is that because we \nhave chosen, as a Congress, to fund Part B, in part by general fund \ntransfers, that that means Medicare is in deficit. That is not the \ncase. That is not the definition of the Congressional Budget Office; \nthat is not the definition of the Office of Management and Budget. All \nof them assert there is a surplus in Part A and rough balance in Part \nB.\n  We, as a Congress, have made the determination to finance Part B, by \npremiums in part, by general fund transfer in part.\n  This is not an amendment we should adopt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we already have a Social Security \nlockbox. The pending amendment contains matter within the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Budget Committee; therefore, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable \nprovisions of the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before a vote in relation to the Hollings amendment. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the first part of April when we \npassed my amendment authorizing a rebate, we had a $102 billion \nsurplus. Now, as of 3 o'clock this afternoon, according to the \nSecretary of the Treasury, the public debt to the penny--and anybody \ncan read it on the Internet--the debt now, instead of being a surplus, \nhas increased since the beginning of the fiscal year to $36 billion in \nthe red. In other words, we don't have the $41 billion for a rebate. We \nhave to go out and borrow it.\n  Common sense says that rather than going out and borrowing money and \nthrowing it to the winds, increasing the debt, the public would prefer \nthat we pay down the debt. At least that is what we tell them we are \ndoing.\n  If you look on the screen on channel 2, the Republican channel says \n``abolishes a tax rebate.'' ``President Bush and Congress promise to \nthe American people. . . .''\n  They didn't promise it. It was my amendment. I promised, as the \nfinancial world advised me, that it should apply to all taxpayers. What \nthey have done is broken my promise. Nothing is in this bill for the 25 \nmillion payroll-tax payers. In other words, you and I, Mr. President, \nwill get a rebate, unless you vote for my amendment. But the payroll-\ntax payers, such as Dicky Flatt--I don't know where the Senator from \nTexas is, but Dicky Flatt, the fellow who ``pulls the wagon and pays \nthe taxes, and builds the country, and sits around the kitchen table'' \ngets nothing.\n  Now, come on. If there is a conscience around here, let's talk sense. \nSave that $41 billion. We need it for defense. We need it for \neducation. We have increased education spending to $25 billion a year, \n$250 billion over 10 years. We need it for prescription drugs. Let's \ndon't throw the money around and then cry the rest of the year here \nthat we don't have the money.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nHollings amendment. The Hollings amendment would repeal the retroactive \nmarginal rate cuts enacted on June 7th of this year. That is barely \nover 1 month ago.\n  My opposition to the amendment is based on both procedural and \nsubstantive grounds.\n  On the first problem the amendment's procedural problems, it is clear \nthat, if adopted, this amendment will cause the underlying supplemental \nappropriations bill to violate the origination clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. If\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nsent to the House, the bill would certainly be ``blue slipped.'' So, \nthis amendment, if adopted, kills the supplemental.\n  The second problem is the substance of the amendment. This amendment \nwould repeal all of the retroactive marginal rate reductions in the \nrecently passed tax bill. Those rate cuts are based principally on the \nnew ten percent bracket for the first $6,000 of income for single \ntaxpayers and $12,000 of income for married couples.\n  The retroactive new ten percent bracket is the basis for the advance \nrefund checks of $300 for a single person and $600 for a married \ncouple. The Hollings amendment stops these checks dead. A vote for the \nHollings amendment is a way to say no to American taxpayers who now \nexpect to receive refund checks. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a \nvote against the stimulus in the tax bill we just passed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will vote for the Hollings amendment \nand wish to explain my reasoning. The amendment focuses on the \nconsequences of the massive tax cut, namely that we are facing a \nHobson's choice--either raid the Social Security and Medicare HI trust \nfunds or forgo needed spending on defense, education and other \npriorities. This is a choice that will bedevil us for years to come \nuntil we come to our senses regarding a tax cut we can afford.\n  The Hollings amendment seeks to avoid this Hobson's choice by \nrescinding a portion of the excessive tax cut. I would prefer that he \nrescinded aspects of the tax cut other than the rebates. I was an early \nadvocate of rebates to help us with the current economic slowdown. I \nwas disappointed in the rebate that was finally adopted in the tax bill \nbecause it is not being paid to tens of millions who filed tax returns, \nbut I still support rebates.\n  If we don't face reality regarding the tax cut, however, we will be \nfaced again and again with the Hobson's choice regarding the trust \nfunds. We have urgent priorities to modernize our defense establishment \nand to fund the education reform initiative, both issues where I have \nexpended considerable effort over the years. The problem we will face \nis that so much of the government's revenue base has now been spent \nthat any national priority that requires more support, like defense or \neducation, will have to be shelved or funded at the expense of the \ntrust fund surpluses.\n  As Chairman Conrad has explained, the President's budget plan means \nwe may well raid these trust funds this year even if we do not go \nforward with these urgent priorities. We won't know for sure until the \nnew budget estimates are provided in August and at the end of the \nfiscal year, but we may spend down these trust funds even if we do not \nexceed the budget resolution limits.\n  I applaud Senator Hollings for raising this issue, and for seeking to \navoid this Hobson's choice. While this amendment affects rebates that I \nsupport, it brings needed attention to the overall box the \nAdministration has placed us in and the difficult choices we will have \nto make. This amendment attempts to avoid our dipping into the trust \nfund surpluses. There are other ways to accomplish the same goal and I \nwill be exploring them as we struggle with the consequences of the tax \nbill, the need to defend the trust funds and fund urgent defense and \neducation reforms. This is a Hobson's choice we did not have to face \nand that is why I voted against the tax bill and will vote for the \nHollings amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes. I yield 1 minute to \nSenator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with deep reluctance, I oppose my good \nfriend from South Carolina. I must say that I compliment him because it \nwas earlier that he suggested to me the stimulus to get the economy \ngoing. He was foresightful of that fact, and because of that \nrecognition, we now find that the economy does need to be stimulated a \nlittle bit. I compliment him for that.\n  I must oppose him on this amendment, however. This is a revenue \nmeasure. It has not been before the Finance Committee. In fact, it has \nin a certain sense been before the committee because it was part of a \nlarger bill and the committee voted against it.\n  Second, this is a revenue provision on an appropriations bill. Under \nthe Constitution, it will be blue-slipped by the House. The House will \nautomatically reject it.\n  Beyond that, we just passed a tax bill. Let's not have a yo-yo, up-\nand-down tax bill. We can modify it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the American people should understand \nthat if this amendment is adopted, it will stop the rebate checks in \ntheir tracks. It is almost as if we want to take the money back from \nthe people before we ever give it to them.\n  They are saying: Congress did something right. And those who look at \nthe American economy say: Hey, they did something right. It is about \nthe right time to have a big tax cut.\n  I do not believe you will find one economist of renown and repute in \nthe United States who will say in the middle of this downturn we should \nincrease taxes. Ask somebody. I asked a bunch of them. They said this \nmight not be the greatest tax plan, but cut the taxes and leave it \nalone.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Hollings, he did a good thing when we had \nthe budget resolution before us. He was ahead of us. He said put more \nof it in the early years. We went off to conference and followed his \nadmonition. Now he thinks that is too much.\n  The checks that are in the mail, if they could get at them, knowing \nthe post office, could even be stopped in a week if we adopted this \namendment.\n  It is the wrong thing to do to the people; it is the wrong thing to \ndo for the American economy, and certainly for the Congress it is \nabsolutely the epitome of moving in the wrong direction when the \ncountry has problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n873. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nconsiders the following amendments, they be considered with the \nfollowing limitations, with no second-degree amendments in order prior \nto the vote in relation to the amendment:\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n Wellstone amendment No. 874, there will be 60 minutes equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; on the Schumer amendment, No. 862, \nthere will be 30 minutes equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum so we may examine this \namendment for just a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Minnesota, we almost have this \nworked out so that everyone will know what is happening until the end \nof the day. I know my friend from Minnesota is anxious to offer his \namendment. We have imposed upon him to offer his amendment out of \norder. If we wait another 2 or 3 minutes, everything could be done. I \nask if my friend objects if we go into a quorum call for a couple more \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was trying to accommodate Senators.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield before he puts in the quorum call?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I merely want to say, in explanation, that the Senator from \nMinnesota was about to proceed at my request. I did not know the state \nof the situation. I apologize for that. But I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, before we go into a quorum call, that \nvery efficient staff have typed up a couple different versions of a \nunanimous consent request, the final one of which should be here \nmomentarily. I have been conferring with the minority manager, and we \nshould have it just about wrapped up, I say to my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, in the words of \nAlexander Pope: ``Thou art my guide, philosopher, and friend.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, has my colleague suggested the absence \nof a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to S. 1077; that \nany votes ordered with respect to these amendments occur in the order \nin which the amendment is debated, and that no second-degree amendment \nbe in order prior to a vote in relation to the amendment: Wellstone \namendment No. 874; Bond amendment No. 872, with 30 minutes equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; McCain amendment No. 869; \nFeingold amendment No. 863; Schumer amendment No. 862; a managers' \namendment, with 5 minutes equally divided; provided further that there \nbe 30 minutes of general debate on the bill, with Senators McCain and \nGramm of Texas controlling 5 minutes each, and the remainder equally \ncontrolled by the two managers, Senators Byrd and Stevens; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of all time, the Senate proceed to vote in a \nstacked sequence, with 5 minutes equally divided and controlled between \neach vote, and that the votes, after the first vote, be 10-minute \nvotes, and that the first vote in the sequence not occur prior to 7:45 \nthis evening.\n  Madam President, we are hopeful and confident we can make the 7:45 \ntime. We have spent a little time trying to come up with this \nagreement. This has been gone over with Senator Byrd.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the 30 \nminutes equally divided between Senator Byrd and myself includes the 10 \nminutes for Senators Gramm and McCain, but we are at liberty to yield \nthat to any person on the other amendments, if necessary; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I express my appreciation to my friend \nfrom Minnesota who is his usual courteous self. He has been very \npatient. I yield the floor for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 874\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 874.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this amendment would increase funding for what is \ncalled the LIHEAP, the Low Income Energy Assistance Program. It would \nprovide $150 million in emergency funding for this fiscal year for the \nLIHEAP program.\n  The amendment would be offset directing the Secretary of Defense to \nrescind $150 million in fiscal year 2001 funds out of administrative \ncosts.\n  There have been many General Accounting Office Inspector General \nstudies of the Pentagon budget that have talked about administrative \nwaste going far beyond $150 million. Out of the whole budget, we are \njust saying take $150 million from all of the administrative waste--\ntalking about tens of billions of dollars--and transfer that to the Low \nIncome Energy Assistance Program.\n  This is a safety net program which provides essential heating and \ncooling assistance to almost 5 million low-income people, many of them \nsenior citizens, many of them disabled, many of them working poor, many \nof them working poor families with children.\n  Let me explain why I bring this amendment to the floor. Right now, \nnational estimates show--and this is shameful--that only 13 percent of \nthe households eligible for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program \nactually receive any assistance at all. That is because since 1985, \naccounting for inflation, the truth is, the funding has declined by 70 \npercent. For many low-income families, the energy costs are as much as \n20 percent of the monthly budget.\n\n  The Low Income Energy Assistance Program is a lifeline program that \nprovides additional grants of money to people when they are in dire \nneed of such assistance. When they don't get this help, if they are \nelderly, they don't buy the prescription drugs they need. They don't \neat what they should be eating.\n  They don't have enough money for food. I am not exaggerating.\n  I am also talking about cooling assistance. While I come from a cold-\nweather State, we also have emergency cooling assistance, but for many \nStates that is not unimportant. There are poor people, many of them \nelderly, who run into a lot of difficulty. We have had some summers \nwhen they died from exposure to the heat, struggling with asthma and \nwhatnot and without any cooling assistance whatsoever.\n  I recognize the hard work that has been done by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. In his supplemental request to the Congress, \nPresident Bush requested only $150 million of additional money for \nLIHEAP emergency\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\nfunding. I am sorry. I have to say it: This does not represent \n``compassionate conservatism.'' It was inadequate. The President's \nrequest would not even have been enough to assist low-income families \nwho are currently in arrears from this past year's devastating winter.\n  Chairman Byrd and Chairman Stevens, recognizing the inadequacy of the \nadministration's request, doubled it. They deserve the credit for doing \nso. However, while the $150 million requested by the President was \ninadequate, the $300 million certainly does a better job, but it is far \nfrom adequate. It doesn't meet the needs of millions of working \nfamilies and seniors who are facing unbelievable energy costs no matter \nwhere one goes in the United States.\n  In addition, all of the LIHEAP funds appropriated for this year have \nbeen released, and nearly half the States have already exhausted or \nnearly exhausted their funding.\n  It is clear that we are currently nearing a crisis situation. A study \nwas just completed by the National Energy Assistance Directors \nAssociation, and they found that 28 States and the District of Columbia \nwere either out of funding or had very low balances; States reporting \nthat they were out of funds: The District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, \nMaine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, \nWashington, and Wisconsin; States reporting very low balances: Alabama, \nColorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, \nTexas, Vermont, Virginia, and Utah.\n  This survey also found that arrearages and threats of shutoffs \nincreased to 4.3 million households. This past winter was a living hell \nfor a lot of low-income people. Energy costs in the State of Minnesota \nwent up 40 percent. We have this deadly combination of our not \nproviding the funding that is needed over the years, so that only about \n15 percent, 14 percent of the people who are eligible get the help, and \nin addition, with the dramatic increase in energy prices, it is an even \nfar worse situation.\n  Let me be specific. Alabama needs an additional $5 to $6 million for \nsummer cooling, especially if the State experiences the severe summer \nthat has been predicted. Colorado may have to discontinue its summer \ncrisis intervention program and the summer fan distribution program for \nlack of funding. Georgia needs an additional $1 million for summer \ncooling and to provide assistance to the 20,000 households that owe \napproximately $80 million in natural gas bills alone.\n  The Illinois program estimates it needs $15 to $20 million for a \nstatewide summer program and $15 million for arrearage shutoff \navoidance assistance. Kansas has had to resort to prorated benefits for \nwinter heating assistance to compensate for the higher number of \napplicants and fuel costs. Kentucky needs $7 million to operate a \ncooling program. Minnesota needs an additional $13 million to cover the \napplications received this year and provide the same level of services \nas last year. New Hampshire has responded to the increased demand for \nassistance this winter season. It goes on and on.\n\n  Madam President, many States need the help and, as I said before, it \nis the cooling assistance. It also provides the money right now over \nthis critical period for the cold-weather States to purchase energy at \na lower price than they would be able to do later. It also provides \nresources for States to help low-income people pay some of the bills \nthey have not been able to pay so that they are not shut off, because \nright now they can be shut off by the utility companies. Again, many \nSenators come from States where home heating prices went up by 40 \npercent this past winter.\n  I also want to make clear to my colleagues that this emergency \nfunding will carry over to the next fiscal year. Advance appropriations \nwere eliminated in last year's appropriations cycle. As of October 1, \n2001, States will have totally exhausted their LIHEAP funds. The \ncarryover of this amendment will ensure that many States will be able \nto pre-buy heating fuels for the next heating season, and summer \npurchases have greatly benefited low-income households, providing them \nwith more fuel for their money.\n  This amendment could be offset again by directing the Secretary of \nDefense to transfer $150 million from the whole Pentagon budget in \nadministrative expenses for fiscal year 2001. I want to remind \ncolleagues that the President has requested $343 billion for the \ndefense budget in the next fiscal year, at a time when the Department \ncan't even complete an internal audit. I am just saying transfer $150 \nmillion in administrative expenses.\n  Now, again, let me be really clear. This is a successful program. It \nis a lifeline program. It is for the most vulnerable citizens in our \ncountry. We have not provided the funding and the assistance that is \nnecessary, and it is the reason I bring this amendment to the floor--\nrecognizing the good work of the Appropriations Committee. As a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, I listed all sorts of other States that are in trouble \nright now either for cooling assistance or in trouble as they look to \nthis next year.\n  We ought to be providing the funding. This is just one vote that \ncalls on us to try to get our priorities straight. The President's $150 \nmillion was hardly compassionate conservatism; doubling it was good \nwork, but it doesn't come close to meeting the needs over the next 3-\nmonth period, doesn't come close for what is needed for cooling \nassistance, doesn't come close for what use States can make to provide \nassistance to people so they don't get cut off by utilities. It doesn't \nprovide advance funding for States such as Minnesota that are going to \nwind up in a real financial crunch next year because the home heating \ncosts are going to be high and we are not going to provide the \nnecessary funding.\n  At the very minimum, can't we take $150 million in administrative \ncosts from the whole Department of Defense budget, which is well over \n$300 billion, and put it into emergency low-income energy assistance \nfor poor people, working poor people, for children, for the elderly, \nand for the disabled?\n  I say to my colleagues that we know right now this has been a \nsuccessful program. We also know that the program has continued to be \nunderfunded, and we know firsthand that over half the States in the \nUnited States of America are out of money. I gave you a report on which \nStates are almost out of money. We have a hot summer month coming up. I \ndo not believe we should pass this opportunity to utilize the \nsupplementary emergency vehicle, which is for emergency purposes, to \nbring additional relief to vulnerable citizens in this country. This \namendment is a modest step in this direction, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n\n  Also, because I know that the chairman and the ranking minority \nmember want to continue to move things forward, I believe I have made \nmy case, but I also want to kind of put this into a broader context. I \nreally worry about where we are heading. We pass these tax cuts, we \npass this budget resolution, and every day you read editorials and \narticles and you are looking at the figures which Senator Conrad and \nSenator Byrd have laid out for us, and it is becoming crystal clear \nthat what we have done is we have not been very intellectually \nrigorous.\n  We are not going to have the funding on present course. We had these \nRobin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts. It is really over $2 trillion over the \nnext decade, and it is only going to get worse. And now, at the very \ntime when I thought we were going to have additional resources to work \nwith, we are being told that soon we are going to be dipping into \nMedicare trust funds, Social Security trust funds, and that we don't \nhave any funding. We can't help, in the year 2001, people who need \nlifeline assistance, low-income people who need emergency assistance.\n  And then I say to the ranking member, who has been such a leader on \neducation, we were told during this debate about the ESEA that there \nwould be the funding. Where is the funding going to come from? Where \nwill we get the money to fully fund the IDEA program? Where is the \nmoney coming from for title I?\n  Then there is the prescription drug benefit. Everybody who campaigned \nfor office campaigned on this issue. Are we going to say we have \nactually so little money, that the copays are so high--I don't know \nabout the State of Washington, but I bet it is the same. The income \nprofile of senior citizens in Minnesota is not high at all. You have \ntoo\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nhigh a copay and people--if you don't deal with the catastrophic \nexpenses, you are not providing the help. Are we going to be told again \nwe can't afford to do it?\n  Are we going to be told we can't do anything on affordable housing? \nBarbara Ehrenreich wrote a book called ``Nickle and Dimed.'' She is a \nfine writer. She went incognito and lived in different communities \ntrying to find out what you do. She worked at Wal-Mart. She had a \nchapter about Minnesota, and there is a paucity of affordable housing, \nrental or home ownership. For many, it is just not there. But we can't \ndo anything. We are in a straitjacket. So we have amendments proposed \nthat will add to the Pentagon budget and take away from workforce \ndevelopment, take away from dislocated worker funds. On the Iron Range \nin Minnesota, LTV just shut down; 1,400 workers are out of work.\n  I say to my colleague from West Virginia, take away from the steel \nloan fund. What kind of tradeoffs are we getting into? This is becoming \na zero-sum game. We have a strong defense, but we don't help people who \nare out of work. We don't help rebuild industries that are so critical, \nas a matter of fact, to our national defense. We put more money into \neducation, and we don't have money for prescription drugs or for job \ntraining.\n  We passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am proud of this piece of \nlegislation. The whole question of health security for all is still out \nthere.\n  Affordable child care: We all say we are for the children. Where is \nthe funding for Head Start, and for affordable child care, and for \naffordable higher education?\n  What about veterans? Who is going to make the commitment to a decent \nhealth care budget for veterans? Who is going to do anything about \nhomeless veterans?\n  I am just telling you that this is a small amendment, but this small \namendment tells a larger story. I am not raiding Medicare or Social \nSecurity. I am not doing any of that. This is just a transfer. I am \njust saying, out of the whole Pentagon budget--the huge, over $300 \nbillion budget--$150 million in administrative costs can be transferred \nto this program so that we can do a little bit better by way of helping \nvulnerable citizens in our country.\n  That is the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield time in opposition to the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the Wellstone amendment, dealing with \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, is a very noble goal. I \nhave no quarrel with this goal but, most respectfully, this matter has \nbeen addressed in this bill.\n  The amendment that is proposed would cut funding for the Department \nof Defense by $150 million at a time when we are trying our best to \nincrease funding. The amendment would allow the Secretary of Defense to \nchoose which programs under his jurisdiction would be curtailed.\n  None of us wants to curtail readiness, but this blank check to \nadministrative programs would force the Secretary to identify those \nthat he considers of lower priority. I always ask myself: In a Senate \nof 100 Members, can we ever agree upon what is of more priority?\n  Most respectfully, I inform my colleagues that the Secretary could \ntake funding from several items that this body has supported over DOD's \nreluctance, and we have done this for many years.\n  For example, we have a fund for the Youth Challenge Program which \ntakes high school dropouts and turns their lives around. It is a most \nsuccessful program that is under the auspices of the National Guard. It \nhas saved our Nation countless millions of dollars. We have kept these \nyoung students out of prison. We have kept them out of crime. I do not \nthink any one of us would want to cut off that program.\n  This amendment could very well force the Secretary to stop programs \nto clean up the environment. One may ask: In what environmental program \nis the Defense Department involved? Over the years, we have been \nclosing bases, and all of our military bases, because of the nature of \nthe work, are polluted. We have unexploded ordnance in the target \nranges. There is oil pollution all over the place because we have had \noil dumps. If the communities want to use these bases, how can they go \nabout it under our laws? They have to be clean before people of the \nUnited States can utilize the bases that have been closed by the action \nof Congress. Do we want to stop that program?\n  Then we speak of our cultural heritage. The Department of Defense now \nhas a Legacy Program which protects cultural heritage.\n  There is a program I am certain the author of this measure wants to \nsee continued, and that is the program which supports Native American \ntribes. For example, at this moment, we are closing clinics and \nhospitals, not only here but in Europe. We constantly find that our \nNative Americans do not have proper hospital facilities, and so we get \nthese old, secondhand beds, old secondhand operating tables, and old \nsecondhand x ray machines to help the first citizens of this land. Is \nthat high priority or low priority?\n  Then we come to the National Guard. This has been a battle from day \none. Is the National Guard of low priority or is it of high priority?\n  These are the types of programs the Secretary is likely to curtail or \ncut out to carry out the intent of this amendment.\n  I argue that we are already underfunded in the Department of Defense. \nThat is why we are hopeful this Senate will approve this measure which \nwill add $5.5 billion to the Department.\n  This amendment is a noble one, but I believe it aims at the wrong \ntarget. Others can speak more knowledgeably about the adequacy of \nfunding. I know it is a worthwhile program, but understand, it is \nalready fully funded for this fiscal year.\n  I have had people ask me: Why is the Department of Defense spending \nmoney for defense when we do not use an aircraft, when we do not use \nthe carriers, when we do not use the submarines? Thank God, Madam \nPresident, we do not use the submarines. Thank God we do not have to \nuse the bombers. Thank God we do not have to use the carriers because \nif we were using them, we would be at war. But since we are prepared, \npotential adversaries think twice before they decide to get into action \nwith us.\n\n  Much as I admire the purpose, much as I admire the noble goal, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 12 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take 3 minutes, I say to my colleague. I want \nto respond to my good friend from Hawaii by saying three things. First, \nthere is not a better person in the Senate. I hate disagreeing with \nhim.\n  I listened carefully, and I want him to know in the language of this \namendment, we make it clear:\n\n       In determining the accounts to specify, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall take into consideration the need to promote \n     efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and productivity within the \n     Department of Defense, as well as to maintain readiness and \n     troop quality of life.\n\n  We do not talk about taking money out of any of the programs. We are \nnot talking about cutting programs that are especially important for \nyouth or especially important for Native American people. We are \ncertainly not talking about anything that goes away from readiness and \ntroop quality of life.\n  The only thing we are talking about is administrative expenses. The \nPentagon has not even been able to complete its internal audit. We all \nknow there is way more than $150 million in administrative waste in an \nover $300 billion budget. I am saying do not take it out of programs, \nand I am certainly saying do not take it out of anything that deals \nwith troop quality of life or readiness. I am simply saying take it out \nof the administrative waste and put it into the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  The vote is about whether or not we want to take some money out of \nadministrative expenses from over a $300\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nbillion budget and put it into this program.\n  My colleague talked about this program being fully funded, but the \nfact is, we have only 14 percent of the families who are eligible who \nare able to benefit because it has been so underfunded over the years. \nWe just went through a 40-percent increase in heating costs this past \nwinter which has thrown everything helter-skelter with States not \nhaving the money, with not enough cooling assistance, people in \narrears, people faced with utility shutoffs, with States worrying about \nnext year. I don't think anybody from any of these States can make a \npoint that we don't need more funding for this program. If I thought we \nalready had the funding we need, I would not bring this amendment to \nthe floor. I believe it is quite to the contrary.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 23\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator from Hawaii yield me 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this amendment would add another $150 \nmillion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, in addition \nto the $300 million already included in the bill. The additional LIHEAP \nfunds are offset by an administrative cut in the Department of Defense \nto which Mr. Inouye has very ably addressed his remarks in opposition \nthereto.\n  I am a strong supporter of LIHEAP; it helps many low-income \nhouseholds facing rising fuel costs, pay to heat their homes. However, \nboth the House-passed and the Senate committee-reported version of this \nsupplemental already recommend an additional $300 million for LIHEAP, \nwhich is double the amount recommended in the President's budget \nrequest. The committee-reported bill brings the fiscal year 2001 LIHEAP \nappropriation to $2 billion, and with the carryover funds from the \nprior year, funds available for LIHEAP would total $2.155 billion in \nfiscal year 2001. This compares to $1.844 billion in fiscal year 2000--\nan increase of $311 billion.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. He makes a very \ncompelling argument. Ordinarily I would want to support him in the \nposition he has taken. However, the committee-reported supplemental, as \nI have already indicated, is a balanced bill; it is a fair bill. While \nI would like to provide additional resources for energy assistance to \nlow-income people in the country, I believe the best way to quickly get \nsupplemental LIHEAP funding to members in need is to approve the \ncommittee bill without this amendment so that the bill can be more \nimmediately sent to conference and on to the President for his \nsignature.\n  If I have any time remaining, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. On behalf of the committee, I move to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur in a stacked sequence \nlater this evening.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 872\n\n  Mr. BOND. I call up amendment numbered 872.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, in recent years we have witnessed some \nvery serious and troubling discussions in the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee. We have noticed how American fighting men and women are \nbeing committed to engagements of all kinds all around the world. We \nknow that the budget for the Defense Department has come down \ndramatically.\n  I was one saying when the Berlin Wall fell we could probably save 30 \npercent or more of our military budget because we could cut back and \nstill maintain the force we needed. We were in a position where we were \nsupposedly able to pursue two major regional contingencies at once. \nThat was the theory.\n  Unfortunately, as we went farther and farther into more assigned \nmissions, it became very questionable whether we could even do that. We \nasked questions from both sides of the aisle in our Appropriations \nDefense Subcommittee hearings about the resources we were providing for \nthe Department of Defense. I believe it was about 2 years ago about \nthis time of year we had then-Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen before \nour committee, a former member of this body. We all respect him \ngreatly.\n  I asked point blank: Mr. Secretary, do we have the money that is \nnecessary to support our fighting men and women?\n  I believe his answer was something like: We do not have the resources \navailable for the missions we have been assigned.\n  That was the beginning of the realization we had grossly underfunded \nthe Department of Defense.\n  I am very pleased we have a defense supplemental before the Senate. I \nknow these are tight times. There has been an effort to work with the \nadministration, with the bipartisan leadership of both bodies, to find \nhow we can provide vitally needed resources for the Department of \nDefense. My personal view is we may not have provided enough. That is \nwhy I have offered this amendment.\n\n  On May 24 of this year, the Associated Press ran a story on \ncannibalization, the lack of military spare parts. According to a GAO \nreport, the Pentagon system for dispensing spare parts for airplanes, \ntanks, and other equipment is broken and officials are not sure how to \nfix it. At least 154,000 times a year a military mechanic takes a part \nfrom one airplane and puts it on another because a new spare part is \nnot on hand, according to the GAO.\n  This cannibalization is a very questionable process. It is a waste of \ntime and money. It costs 1 million extra work hours a year and risks \ndamaging the aircraft, as well as the morale of the mechanics doing the \nwork, several testified. Once cannibalized, a multimillion-dollar \naircraft can sit idle for months or years, said Neal Curtin, GAO \nDirector of Defense Issues. In one case, about 400 parts were removed \nfrom a plane that eventually had to be shipped by truck to the \nmaintenance depot to be rebuilt. Witnesses said the cannibalization is \nwidespread because the services are trying to maintain readiness on an \naging fleet in a time of increased deployments.\n  LTG Michael Zettler, Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force \nInstallation, said cannibalization is only used when it is absolutely \nmission critical, and acknowledged in a prepared statement that it is \ndone more than is desirable but blames some of it on design problems \nshowing up years after abuse, resulting in a widespread need for more \nparts than specified, and fewer companies are making fewer parts--\nhaving left the market during the Pentagon 1990 downsizing.\n  Pentagon spokesman RADM Craig Quigley said: You do what you need to \ndo given the availability of parts. It is largely an issue of funding. \nI use the family car as a good example. The older it gets, the more \nrepairs you will do, but it is expensive to buy a new car.\n  This GAO report follows an earlier report that said the Department \ninventory management is ineffective and results in excessive stocks of \nsome parts more than others. Though the problem has been under scrutiny \nsince 1990 and the services have formed committees, study groups, and \nprograms to fix it, no one has the statistics on how big the problem \nis, according to the GAO Director. Because they view cannibalization as \na symptom of spare part shortages, they have not closely analyzed other \npossible causes or made concerted efforts to measure the full extent of \nthe practice.\n  The Pentagon has been unable to document how many times it is done, \nthe reasons, or how much time and money it has cost. It also cannot \ndetermine which cannibalizations are necessary, what alternatives are \navailable, what improvements or changes need to be implemented, to what \nextent morale would be increased by reducing the workload.\n  My point in going through that article is simply to note that we are \nin a sorry situation where we are preparing to send our air men and \nwomen into combat without the spare parts we need. We grab a part from \na Hangar\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\nQueen, another aircraft that is increasingly disabled, and take that \none part to keep the planes flying. That means the planes we are \ncannibalizing are less and less able to carry out their assigned \nmission.\n  My amendment is, I believe and I hope, a responsible amendment which \nadds $1.430 billion for the fiscal year to the Defense Department. I \nbelieve the money is desperately needed by forces and can be spent in \nwhat remains of the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The \namendment is operative only if and to the extent that the President \ndeclares it an emergency. The President would have control over whether \nto spend these funds. They could only be spent in the current fiscal \nyear on problems which are very serious and which we understand from \nour sources are in dire need.\n  This amendment includes funds that will be directed exclusively to \noperations and maintenance and personnel accounts of each of the four \nservices. This is money the Pentagon, in our view, needs right now to \nensure that critical repairs and training are not delayed further. Our \ntroops need to believe there is truth behind our words and that help \nis, indeed, on the way.\n  Consider this pressing challenge, the parts shortages and \ncannibalization from other pieces of equipment to which I just \nreferred, specifically to aircraft. It is required throughout the \nmilitary to keep our aging equipment going. To give an idea of the \nimpact of the shortages, the GAO report found that shortcomings in \nspare parts increase maintenance costs by forcing maintainers to do \nthings such as cannibalize needed parts from other aircraft, taking \nparts from one airplane to another to get one operational, meaning it \ntakes two airplanes to get one ready to go. That essentially doubles \nthe maintainer workloads, turning one repair into two.\n  Parts swapping also pushes costs up by increasing part failure rates. \nComponents are more susceptible to breakdown when they are removed from \none unit to another. Previously-installed parts have shorter in-service \nlife than new parts.\n  When maintainers cannot do what they have been trained to do--that \nis, to fix airplanes--that leads to lower retention rates. The people \nwho are in the job of doing the very critical work--making sure we \nprovide the very best machines for our pilots--leave and go into the \nprivate sector. It is demoralizing to watch the mission-capable rates \nof airplanes drop due to a lack of spare parts. The maintainers want \nnothing more than to be provided the equipment and parts they need to \ndo their jobs.\n  I applaud and thank the President for his initiative in submitting \nthis supplemental, but I do differ with the administration's view that \nthe funding currently provided is sufficient. Saying we will solve the \nproblem in fiscal year 2002 is not going to help the problems we \ncurrently face as a result of the circumstances we have created. Our \ntroops are tired of hearing us say help is on the way, only to be \ndisappointed when it never comes.\n  It is time for us to show them that we, indeed, want to provide them \nthe resources they need efficiently and safely to do the missions we \ngive them. There are far too many examples of services being forced \ninto situations where they must borrow from operations and maintenance \naccounts just to keep operations going and to purchase much-needed \nspare parts and equipment. Meanwhile, infrastructure continues to \ndeteriorate at an alarming rate.\n  I will have printed in the Record excerpts from testimony of our most \nsenior military personnel before the House Armed Services Committee in \nSeptember of last year. For the benefit of my colleagues, allow me to \nread just a few.\n  From Admiral Vern Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, Department of the \nNavy:\n\n       I currently have a backlog of . . . $5.5 billion in \n     infrastructure. . . . We are currently not funding this \n     account sufficiently so that we arrest the growth in critical \n     backlog and we have to do better.\n\n  General Shelton had this to say:\n\n       We can ill afford to take away from the current readiness \n     accounts today. In fact, in some cases I think you've heard \n     the Chiefs say they've still got shortfalls. . . . We have \n     got to find a way--and that means more money to be able to \n     modernize the force.\n\n  Madam President, there are quotes from other members of the Joint \nChiefs, and others, pointing out just how far we have come and how much \nfurther we need to go. This amendment before us provides $27 million \nfor the Marine Corps. During last month's testimony, General Jones, the \nMarine Corps Commandant, told me he would have to find this money \nelsewhere by reprogramming funds if he did not receive it prior to the \nend of the fiscal year.\n  Real property maintenance shortfalls remain incredibly high. Just \nconsider a recent report that two-thirds of the Army National Guard \ninstallations will maintain a status of C-4, which means \n``significantly impairs mission performance.'' Installations continue \nto deteriorate because the funding we are providing is not sufficient \nto halt the decline.\n  Madam President, the current supplemental does not begin to reverse \nthe slide in real property maintenance, and we cannot be sure future \nbudgets will either. My colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, \nrefrained from offering an amendment to this supplemental that would \nhave added $204 million for additional Blackhawk helicopters, but he \nmade the point our Army aviation program is in deep trouble and is in \ndire need of additional funds if we are to get it back on track.\n  I came to the floor a month or so ago to point out that in the \nNational Guard in Missouri, 75 percent of the helicopters are not \noperational. If we were running a museum, that would not be bad. But we \nexpect our National Guard to be ready to be called on in a national \nemergency, and I can guarantee in our State of Missouri, and every \nother State, when there is a natural disaster, whether it is a flood, \ntornado, fire, or some other disaster, we want to be able to call on \nthe National Guard. Three out of four planes in the Missouri National \nGuard are not airworthy. That means not only are they not ready, but \nthe men and women who are supposed to fly them cannot train in them.\n  This is a serious situation that affects all branches of the Active \nand Reserve and the Guard. No matter where we turn, we find pressing \nneeds both in our readiness accounts and in our modernization accounts. \nThat is why I think it is essential we plus-up the current \nsupplemental. Every dollar counts. I hope we can find support for it. I \nknow the Members of this body understand the situation. I have been \nassured by people at the Pentagon that funding I seek to add could and \nwould be used to fund current needs, and therefore I ask my colleagues \nto support this amendment that adds slightly more than $1.4 billion to \nthe supplemental.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield myself just a couple of \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have great respect for the Senator from Missouri. I am \nconstrained to advise him, Senator Byrd and I gave our word to the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget that we would not \ninclude any emergency funds in this supplemental appropriations bill \nthis year. We did so because we were informed that there was, in fact, \na substantial increase request to be presented by the President for the \nyear 2002. We have, as all Members of the Senate know, received that \nrequest. It is substantial--over $18 billion. This money that is in the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri could not be spent before that \nwould be available anyway.\n  So I hope the Senator might consider relying upon us to work with him \nin the future and help us honor our commitment to the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  I see my good friend from Hawaii seeks some time. Would he like to \ncomment also?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, if I may.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I wish to advise my colleagues that in crafting this \nsupplemental bill we considered two criteria, and both of them were \nrequested by the Republican administration, requested by the Department \nof Defense.\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\n  First, any program receiving supplemental funding must be able to \nexecute this funding during the current fiscal year. The current fiscal \nyear ends in 2\\1/2\\ months, just a few days away. Second, that the \nfunding could not wait until fiscal year 2002. It is the view of \nPresident Bush that the supplemental request has satisfied this \nobjective.\n\n  I believe the modest changes made by the committee have improved this \nmeasure, increasing readiness and health care funding by $229 million.\n  I will remind the Senate that from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year \n2001, the Congress added $49 billion to the DOD budget, much of it for \nvarious programs that concern the distinguished Senator from Missouri, \nin some cases operation and maintenance funds appropriated for the same \nactivities identified in the supplemental request, such as spare parts, \nbase operations, and depot maintenance.\n  My point is, the Defense Subcommittee has a demonstrated record of \nconsidering both the funded and the unfunded requirements of the \nDepartment before marking up a piece of legislation. The funding \nprovided in this bill, most respectfully, I believe meets the urgent \nneeds of the military within the funding constraints set by the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2001 approved by this body.\n  This act avoids emergency spending to demonstrate fiscal restraint. \nMuch of the funding proposed by this amendment could not be spent \nresponsibly in 2\\1/2\\ months. The Department would struggle to obligate \nthe funds before the end of the fiscal year. Some would even be \nobligated to cover workload at the maintenance depots that would carry \nover to next year in violation of the Department's own restrictions.\n  I point out to the Senator from Missouri that the Appropriations \nCommittee has addressed programs that he seeks to fund with his \namendment. Specifically, runway repairs for the Masirah Airfield in \nOman are addressed in the military construction section. The committee \nhas addressed the Army's second destination transport costs. Those \nfunds were reduced in the bill passed by the House. It seems that the \nunfunded requirement list submitted to the Senator is currently \noutdated.\n  So for all the above reasons, Madam President, I therefore must \noppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Missouri \nwould yield 2 or 3 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri controls 36 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 10 minutes in \nopposition.\n  Mr. BOND. How much in support?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri controls 36 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Thirty-six seconds. I would like to reserve the 36 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator from Arkansas 4 or 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nyielding a brief period of time out of order.\n  I express my gratitude and my appreciation to Senator Stevens for his \nwillingness to accept into the managers' amendment an amendment I had \nproposed that provides $24 million in emergency funding that is offset \nin the amendment but is essential for cleanup from devastating ice \nstorms in the States of Arkansas and Oklahoma.\n  I also express my appreciation to the chairman, Chairman Byrd, for \nhis cooperation in this very vital funding.\n  I will make my comments brief. I know there are many desiring to \nspeak and many amendments we are considering. But while December of \n2000 has come and gone, and many have forgotten those many months ago, \nit will not be a time that is quickly forgotten in the State of \nArkansas. It is certainly a time I will never forget.\n  For many, it was anything but a merry holiday season. On December 12, \nand again on December 26, Arkansas was hit by two major winter storms. \nThe Arkansas Department of Emergency Services said: ``These two storms \ncombined created the most widespread and financially devastating \ndisasters in our state's history.''\n  Life in most parts of Arkansas came to a halt as snow, sleet, and 2 \nto 4 inches of ice covered much of my State for weeks. To the Senator \nfrom Alaska, that may not sound like much, but I will tell you, the \ndamage, the devastation that was done was unparalleled and \nunprecedented in Arkansas history.\n  As a result of the December 12 storm, more than 250,000 Arkansans \nlost power. At the time, that was considered the worst storm in 70 \nyears.\n  By the time the first storm passed, more than 40 counties in Arkansas \nhad been declared disaster areas. FEMA officials came in and said they \nwould be in the State to do preliminary damage assessments on December \n26, but they could not do it on December 26 because on Christmas \nmorning Arkansans awoke to sleet, which turned to freezing rain by late \nafternoon and continued for 3 days. Western Arkansas was covered with \nmore than 3 inches of ice. Power lines were down, homes and vehicles \nwere damaged by falling limbs, and over half a million electrical \ncustomers lost their power just at the time many of them had their \npower restored from the first storm.\n\n  Arkansas received a Federal disaster declaration on December 29. \nEventually, 65 out of 75 Arkansas counties were declared disaster \nareas.\n  Despite the recovery efforts, many scars are going to remain in \nArkansas for years and years to come. It is July and the Forest Service \npersonnel are still working to remove damaged timber, reopen roads and \ntrails, and repair facilities.\n  The Ouachita National Forest in western and central Arkansas took the \nbrunt of the damage. The weight of the ice brought down an estimated \n500 million board feet of timber. Now that Forest Service personnel \nhave fought their way into many of the most remote areas of the forest, \nthat estimate may increase to as much as 800 million board feet.\n  I personally visited the forest this spring. I was shocked at the \nextent of the damage. All 1.8 million acres of the Ouachita National \nForest were damaged to some extent. Twenty-six hundred miles of roads \nand six hundred and twenty-five miles of trails were closed or blocked. \nRoads, trails, and recreation areas in the heaviest damaged areas \nremain closed even to this day.\n  Now fire experts have evaluated the fuel loading in the forest and \nfound that it is more than 10 times normal levels. Normally, there is \nabout 5 tons of timber lying on the forest floor per acre. After the \nstorms, that number jumped from 40 to 60 tons per acre. And in the \nhardest hit areas you get a little idea of it: The hardest hit areas \nhave 80 tons of fuel per acre.\n  Wildfires on a 1.8 million-acre forest are difficult to respond to \nunder normal conditions, but roads and trails into the most remote \nparts of the Ouachita are still impassable.\n  So as the threat of fire grows with each passing summer month, my \nmain concern is for the 843,000 Arkansans living along and around the \nOuachita National Forest. And that doesn't include the three ranger \ndistricts in Oklahoma that are of interest to Senator Nickles and \nSenator Inhofe as well.\n  The Forest Service is doing everything it can, but if this situation \ndoes not change, in the next two summers we will see uncontrollable \nwildfires in the Ouachita National Forest.\n  So I appreciate this $24 million being included in the managers' \namendment. I repeat the words of the Arkansas Department of Emergency \nServices: ``These two storms combined created the most widespread and \nfinancially devastating disasters in our state's history.'' It is now \nimpacting tourism. It is impacting our entire economy.\n  I have been working with the Forest Service, and I believe this $24 \nmillion will provide the kind of relief to ensure the proper cleanup of \nthat fuel in the Ouachita National Forest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank Senators Stevens and Byrd and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 872, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I claim the remaining time I have.\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\n  I appreciate very much the very strong statements made by the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. These are men of great experience, dedication, and \nunderstanding. I look forward to working with them to achieve what we \nthink is vitally important in filling the readiness gap.\n  Madam President, I would like to have been able to pass the amendment \nthat I have introduced, but having learned to count in third grade and \nhaving some experience counting in this body, I defer to the greater \nwisdom of the senior Members and request that my amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 863\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now turn to my amendment, No. 863.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcCain be permitted to offer his amendment upon completion of debate on \nthe Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kerry, be added as original cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this amendment strengthens America's \ncontribution to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria, the plagues of the 21st century, and some of the foremost \nthreats to security in the world. To pay for this funding increase, my \namendment would make additional rescissions in procurement funds for \nthe troubled V-22 Osprey program.\n  The global HIV/AIDS pandemic threatens security and stability around \nthe world in a chillingly comprehensive way.\n  As Dr. Donald Berwick movingly wrote last month in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       The earth has AIDS; 36.1 million people at the end of the \n     year 2000. In Botswana, 36 percent of adults are infected \n     with HIV; in South Africa 20 percent. Three million humans \n     died of AIDS in the year 2000, 2.4 million of them in sub-\n     Saharan Africa. That is a Holocaust every two years; the \n     entire population of Oregon, Iowa, Connecticut or Ireland \n     dead last year, and next year, and next. More deaths since \n     the AIDS epidemic began than in the Black Death of the Middle \n     Ages. It is the most lethal epidemic in recorded history.\n\n  The International Crisis Group, or ICG, is a well-respected private, \nmultinational organization founded to build international capacity to \nprevent and contain conflict. Many of my colleagues are familiar with \ntheir reports on international hot spots from Macedonia to Burundi.\n  The ICG recently released a report entitled ``HIV/AIDS as a security \nissue.'' This report states:\n\n       Where it reaches epidemic proportions, HIV/AIDS can be so \n     pervasive that it destroys the very fibre of what constitutes \n     a nation: individuals, families and communities; economic and \n     political institutions; military and police forces. It is \n     likely then to have broader security consequences, both for \n     the nations under assault and for their neighbors, trading \n     partners, and allies.\n\n  The report goes on to note that the crisis also affects personal \nsecurity. As was noted on this floor recently, some reports indicate \nthat if current trends continue, 15-year-olds in some of the most \nseverely-affected countries will actually be more likely than not to \ndie of AIDS.\n  The crisis affects economic security. Analysts predict that in \nBotswana, the pandemic will reduce government revenues by 7 percent, \nwhile the costs of fighting the disease increase by 15 percent.\n  The crisis affects communal security. In Lusaka, Zambia, I visited an \norphanage, of sorts, where committed volunteers worked by day with \nnearly 500 children orphaned by AIDS. But by night, there was space for \nonly fifty of these children. The rest were on the streets.\n  By 2020, some 40 million African children will have lost one or both \nparents to the disease. In Zimbabwe, even the healthy find it \nincreasingly difficult simply to attend the many funerals of their \nfamilies and friends and still fulfill their job responsibilities.\n  The crisis affects national security. According to UNAIDS, in sub-\nSaharan Africa, some military forces have infection rates five times \nhigher than those of their civilian populations.\n  The crisis affects international security. Sub-Saharan Africa is in \nthe midst of an urgent crisis. Infection rates are on the rise in \nEastern Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, and the Caribbean. The \nconsequences of this pandemic at all societal levels poses a serious \nthreat to international peace and stability. Our country's prosperity \nand progress cannot be divorced from the global context in which we \nlive.\n\n  That HIV/AIDS is a security issue is no longer revolutionary \nthinking. In January of last year, the National Intelligence Council \nproduced an intelligence estimate entitled ``The Global Infectious \nDisease Threat and Its Implications for the United States,'' a report \nwhich framed the issue in much the same fashion.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell said recently that he ``know[s] of no \nenemy in war more insidious or vicious than AIDS, an enemy that poses a \nclear and present danger to the world.''\n  But while many have absorbed the astounding--in many ways \nterrifying--statistics about this crisis, and many, including our \nSecretary of State, appear to have grasped its terrible implications, \nthe U.S. policy response remains woefully inadequate.\n  We have all talked about the need to do more. Today we have an \nopportunity actually to do it.\n  Of course, addressing AIDS takes leadership, and as the chairman of \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, I am aware \nof the difference that energized leadership, such as that exhibited in \nUganda and Senegal, makes and that it makes a critical difference when \ncountries take on in a meaningful manner the fight against AIDS.\n  But America's leadership is required as well. UN Secretary General \nKofi Annan has called for a global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria. This is a true emergency affecting national security. The \nUnited States must answer the call.\n  My amendment would increase funding for this vital effort by $593 \nmillion. And the funding in this amendment is completely paid for. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this amendment is budget \nneutral. The amendment offsets the increased funding, dollar for \ndollar, with reductions in procurement of the troubled V-22 Osprey \nprogram.\n  Over the last 2 decades, HIV/AIDS has infected 60 million people, \nkilled more than 20 million people, slashed life expectancies, and has \nleft millions of orphans in its wake. We now know to a certainty the \nnational security reality of the AIDS pandemic. But even after 20 years \nof research, development, and testing, we still don't know if the V-22 \nOsprey will work.\n  This amendment would not endanger the integrity of the Osprey \nproduction line, nor would it affect money that has been obligated as \nof April 2001.\n  But serious questions and concerns continue to cloud the Osprey \nprogram. Thirty Marines have died in Osprey crashes since 1991. \nUnanswered questions remain regarding the validity of maintenance \nrecords and the safety and viability of this aircraft.\n  The final report of the blue ribbon panel appointed by former \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen to review the program recommended a \n``phased approach'' to proceeding with the Osprey program. The blue \nribbon panel concluded that the Osprey ``is not ready for operational \nuse.''\n  I agree with that conclusion. I also concur with the panel's \nrecommendation that procurement should be reduced to the minimum \nnecessary to maintain the production line until the myriad design and \nsafety problems are addressed and further testing is done to ensure \nthat this aircraft is safe. My amendment does just that.\n  The underlying bill rescinds $513 million in Osprey procurement \nfunds--$150 million from the Navy and $363 million from the Air Force. \nWhile I am pleased that the underlying bill zeros out the Air Force \nprocurement budget for the Osprey, it still leaves about $944 million \nin the Navy's aircraft procurement account for a program that has been\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\ngrounded indefinitely and that is headed back into the research, \ndevelopment, testing, and evaluation stage for the foreseeable future.\n  The committee report accompanying this bill says that this funding \nwill be used to procure eleven of the Marine Corps version of the \naircraft, the deeply flawed MV-22. This is five fewer Ospreys than were \nauthorized for fiscal year 2002, but in my view, it is still eleven \nmore than we should build this year.\n  My amendment would rescind an additional $594 million intended for \nthe Osprey from the Navy's aircraft procurement account. It leaves \nenough funding in place to maintain the integrity of the production \nline, and it does not affect the funding that the Navy has obligated \nfor this program as of April 2001.\n  Based on the formula that was used when the Navy suspended production \non two other troubled aircraft programs, the T-45A and the SH-60F, the \nminimum required to sustain the production line for the MV-22 is about \n$350 million. In the case of the T-45A, the Navy maintained the \nproduction line with 28 percent of its original funding; 34 percent of \nthe funding was maintained for the SH-60F. The $350 million that my \namendment would leave in place is the average of what the Navy left in \nplace to maintain the production lines for these two programs.\n\n  We know the Osprey is broken. The Navy and Marine Corps are working \non ways to fix it. And we should allow that process to move forward. \nBut, we should not spend scarce taxpayer resources on building new \nOspreys that will require costly and extensive retrofitting later.\n  So I think this is a great example of where we have to make a choice, \nand I think the choice is clear.\n  My amendment would scale back funding on a troubled program that \nplainly needs a thorough review. And it would increase our response to \nthe world's greatest urgent threat to human life, the AIDS pandemic.\n  AIDS is a security issue, but it is also unquestionably a moral one. \nOur response is a measure of our humanity. We are not civilized, we are \nnot just, and we cannot lay claim to common decency, if we simply \naccept millions of deaths and dismiss them as simply the problem of \nanother continent.\n  Sadly, we are living in a time of plague. We have an obligation to \nfight it. History will judge us all.\n  Last month, the UN General Assembly conducted a special session on \nthe pandemic. Let us begin today to match our response to our rhetoric. \nThis amendment is fiscally responsible, it is the right thing to do, it \nis in the U.S. interest, and it reflects our national values. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do we have, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes each under the control of \nthe managers, and 8\\1/2\\ minutes is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from Arkansas want?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. If either the Senator from Alaska or the Senator from \nWest Virginia will yield it, I will need about 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I am simply here to extend my \nheartfelt thanks to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and to \nSenator Stevens from Alaska for the people of Arkansas.\n  Right before we broke for the Fourth of July recess, I joined with my \ncolleague, Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma, in writing to both the chairman \nand the ranking member to express to them our concern on behalf of our \nconstituents. During the winter of 2001, our home States of Arkansas \nand Oklahoma suffered through some of the most devastating storms in \nrecorded history. On December 29, 2000, President Clinton declared a \nmajor disaster for our States, triggering the release of Federal funds \nto help people and communities recover from the severe ice storms that \nhad blanketed our home States.\n  Unfortunately, the assistance provided to date has not been \nsufficient in getting our communities back on their feet. Farmers, \nranchers, and timberland owners have been hardest hit. These ice storms \nadded more than 10 times the normal amount of downed timber on the \nground in Arkansas' Ouachita National Forest.\n  This year, Arkansas and Oklahoma have the potential to have one of \nthe worst fire seasons in our history. With the massive amount of fuel \non the ground, wildfires will burn extremely hot and fast, which will \nmake it difficult to control or to contain. With the funding outlined \nin the emergency supplemental bill, our residents can complete the \ncleanup effort while also working to prevent massive forest fires this \nfall.\n  It would not be possible without the wonderful bipartisan working \nrelationship of these two gentlemen who have worked steadfastly with \nboth of our delegations to make sure we can provide our residents with \nwhat they need in order to keep our families, our forests, and \ncertainly our communities safe. I thank both of these Senators on \nbehalf of my constituents in Arkansas for the work they have been \nwilling to put into this effort.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for her \nexceedingly kind remarks concerning my efforts and the efforts of my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Stevens from Alaska. There need not be \nany doubt in anybody's mind that the Senator stands up for her \nconstituents and ably represents them. This is just another example of \nthat.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Alaska has 5 minutes. The Senator from \nWisconsin has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for allowing me \nto proceed on this amendment. I do oppose the amendment Senator \nFeingold has offered. I do so because of my great interest in this \nsystem.\n  The V-22 represents the best new technology in aeronautics adapted by \nthe military air system that I have seen in my time in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, it has had some bad circumstances, and we all regret \ndeeply the difficulty it has had.\n  I have spent a considerable amount of time with the Marines, in \nparticular, on this system and have discussed them personally with the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps. I will be very brief in saying that I \nbelieve this amendment is untimely and it is not in the best interests \nof our Marine Corps system.\n  I do believe, as the Commandant has written to me today, that the V-\n22 Osprey is the Marine Corps' No. 1 aviation priority. I think we \nshould be very slow to terminate or disturb such a system which is \nbeing developed in the best interests of our men and women in the \nMarines.\n  In particular, if it proves successful, as I pray it will, it will \ntake our men and women across the beach. We will not see visions again \nin any war of our people hitting the beach and being slaughtered at the \nedge of the water. They will be able to fly from smaller ships and all \nover the place and enter into any battle zone by air, and they will \nhave a better opportunity of survival and success in defending our \nNation's interests in a time of war. It is a military asset of great \nvalue to our Department of Defense.\n  I intend to oppose the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me today by General \nJames L. Jones, Commandant of the Marine Corps, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 10, 2001.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens, the restructuring of the V-22 program \n     as recommended by the Panel to Review the V-22 resulted in \n     proposed changes to the FY01 funding profile. Those changes \n     were presented in the Administration's FY2001 Supplemental \n     request. Your committee subsequently marked the\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n     program, making adjustments to the Navy funding and zeroing \n     the Air Force procurement funding. While the Marine Corps \n     would prefer that the Air Force remain an active participant \n     at this stage of the V-22 program restructure, we understand \n     your Committee's mark. That mark does allow the program to \n     remain viable.\n       Unfortunately, Amendment 863 of S. 1077, currently being \n     considered on the floor of the Senate, so radically reduces \n     aircraft procurement funding that the resultant effect is \n     termination of the V-22 program in FY 2001.\n       As you know, Senator Stevens, the V-22 Osprey is the Marine \n     Corps' number one aviation priority. It will revolutionize \n     combat assault in a manner not seen since the introduction of \n     the helicopter more than 50 years ago. The V-22 Osprey is the \n     only vertical lift, assault support aircraft that provides \n     the combination of range, speed, and payload which fulfills \n     the Marine Corps' medium lift requirement. The Osprey met or \n     exceeded all Marine Corps' key performance requirements and \n     is projected to meet or exceed all Air Force/SOCOM key \n     requirements. It carries three times as much, five times as \n     far, twice as fast as the Vietnam era CH-46 Sea Knight it is \n     replacing. The V-22 Osprey is a key enabler allowing Marine \n     expeditionary forces to rapidly respond to unpredictable, \n     unstable situations throughout the world. Additionally, the \n     V-22 is also the only vertical lift aircraft that can rapidly \n     self-deploy to meet USSOCOM's mission requirement--completion \n     of the critical long-range infiltration/exfiltration mission \n     in one period of darkness.\n       Senator Stevens, a better course of action would be to \n     support the Review Panel's recommendation to restructure the \n     V-22 program that uses a phased approach to a return to \n     flight and tactical introduction. However, the amendment \n     currently under consideration by the Senate would cause a \n     production line shut down and any remaining FY01 funding \n     would be used to terminate the contract. Other potential \n     impacts include:\n       Labor rate increases due to business base reduction;\n       Production loss of learning due to potential layoffs (loss \n     of experience, going back up the curve);\n       Inflation cost increases due to moving quantities to the \n     right;\n       Material burden increases;\n       Material cost increases due to economies of scale impacts \n     (quantity reductions);\n       Vendor elimination causing loss of learning for materials \n     and re-qualification costs;\n       Obsolescence costs and other non-recurring cost;\n       Increased manufacturing inefficiency; and\n       Personnel layoff.\n       Should quantities change for V-22, labor wrap rates for \n     other Bell and Boeing Programs would also be adversely \n     impacted.\n       Senator Stevens, clearly these negative impacts were not \n     intended by the Panel to Review the V-22, the \n     Administration's restructuring of the program or your \n     Committee mark-up of the FY2001 Supplemental bill. In a world \n     that is often chaotic and unpredictable, the V-22 Osprey \n     provides the Nation with an aircraft that can deal with any \n     situation--from humanitarian relief to full combat \n     operations. I request your support to keep this critical \n     program viable as the FY2001 Supplemental request proceeds \n     through the Senate.\n       I have provided a similar letter to Chairman Inouye, \n     requesting his support.\n           Semper Fidelis,\n\n                                               James L. Jones,\n\n                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps,\n                                   Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I realize that time is limited. If I \nmay, I will quote from the letter dated July 10, 2001, from the \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, GEN James L. Jones. I believe this \none paragraph, the third paragraph, says it all:\n\n       As you know, Senator Stevens, the V-22 Osprey is the Marine \n     Corps' number one aviation priority. It will revolutionize \n     combat assault in a manner not seen since the introduction of \n     the helicopter more than 50 years ago. The V-22 Osprey is the \n     only vertical lift assault weapon aircraft that provides the \n     combination of range, speed, and payload, which fulfills the \n     Marine Corps' medium lift requirement. The Osprey met or \n     exceeded all Marine Corps' key performance requirements. . . \n     . It carries three times as much, five times as far, twice as \n     fast as the Vietnam era CH-46 Sea Knight it is replacing. The \n     V-22 Osprey is a key enabler, allowing Marine \n     expeditionary forces to rapidly respond to unpredictable, \n     unstable situations throughout the world.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this amendment will wipe out the V-22 \nprogram, and if at a later time we find it necessary to revive that \nprogram, it will cost billions.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, of course, I have enormous regard for \nboth speakers in opposition, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, but I want them to know how carefully we crafted this \namendment to avoid the consequence they both mentioned.\n  This amendment does not kill the Osprey program. It is not \ninconsistent with the statement of the Senator from Alaska that this \nmay well turn out to be the best new technology. It is not inconsistent \nwith the Commandant's letter where he says this is the No. 1 priority \nof the Marines. We do not contradict that at all.\n  In fact, I respect the fact there is a real effort out there to try \nto fix the problems with the Osprey. This does not kill the Osprey \nprogram. I understand some of our people sadly have died in these \nhelicopters, but I also know yesterday there was an unfortunate \naccident involving the helicopters they want to replace.\n  I want to be candid about this. There may well be a need for an \nimproved helicopter. This amendment does not kill the Osprey program, \nand that is the only argument that has been made against the amendment.\n  The amendment is carefully crafted. What this amendment allows is to \nhave the research and the consideration that needs to be done on the \nOsprey actually completed, to have the tests done, to make sure people \nare going to be safe in this helicopter, and at the same time allow \nSenators to vote to do what they must do: To enhance the international \neffort against the AIDS pandemic. It is truly a win-win proposition \nthat does not threaten the Osprey.\n  Specifically, in response to the Commandant's letter that was just \nprinted in the Record, it simply is incorrect in terms of the budget \nimplications. This amendment does not shut down the production line. \nThat is what is being suggested, but it does not. There are still \nOspreys in various stages of construction that are being built with \nboth fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000 resources. We do not impact \nthose Ospreys. They will continue to be produced on the production \nline.\n  More important, the experts at the GAO have specifically stated a \nvery different conclusion. According to the GAO, the Osprey production \nline is currently being maintained with the completion of between four \nand seven planes per calendar year. Four planes were delivered to the \nMarines in 1999; five were delivered in 2000; six planes have been \ncompleted since December 2000 but have not yet been delivered because \nthe fleet remains grounded and no flight testing of those planes can \ntake place.\n  Each Osprey costs about $83 million to produce. This amendment \ncarefully leaves in place--it does not wipe out the program--$350 \nmillion in fiscal year 2001 money, plus the $102 million the Navy has \nalready obligated, for a total of $452 million remaining in the \nprogram.\n  At $83 million per aircraft, this $452 million would purchase five \nOspreys, and given the current production rate, as I just pointed out, \nno more than seven Ospreys have been delivered in any one calendar year \nanyway.\n  In my view and in the view of the blue ribbon panel, this program \nshould be reduced to the minimum necessary to maintain production until \nthe aircraft undergoes redesign and further testing. It is still \nunclear how much retrofitting will need to be done on the existing \nOspreys and how much it will cost or if it will be cost-effective or \neven possible to retrofit the existing Ospreys. The Department of \nDefense has said it will take about 1 year to do the additional \nresearch and testing needed to determine the status of the Osprey \nprogram.\n\n  Clearly, if we are talking about budget prudence and caution and \nmaking sure we do not waste millions of dollars, this amendment is the \nway to go. It is prudent to wait and see what the results of the tests \nare, obviously, before we increase the rate of production above the \ncurrent five to seven per year.\n  I reiterate, we do not kill the Osprey program. We do not stop it. We \nsimply make sure we only use it at the minimum level that it is \ncurrently at and maintain the production line so it can be studied and \nso the additional resources that would have gone to it make a serious \ncontribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS around the world.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I hope my \ncolleagues who are following this debate in their offices will pause \nfor a moment to consider what we are about. How many times have we come \nto this Senate Chamber and voted for resolutions, voted for ideas that \nsay we are pledged to fighting the AIDS epidemic in Africa? Sadly, it \nhas almost become commonplace here.\n  We voted for amendments and budget resolutions because, frankly, they \nare messages we send out for the world to read. But this amendment from \nthe Senator from Wisconsin is real. It is an amendment which comes up \nwith millions of dollars to deal with a crisis that faces the world; \nnot just a crisis facing the United States, it faces the world.\n  This crisis is the AIDS epidemic in Africa. The Senator from \nWisconsin visited Africa a week or two before I did last year. We both \ntalked about it. It was a profound, transforming experience to visit a \ncontinent that is consumed with disease and to realize that people with \nwhom you are having casual conversations are likely to be the casualty \nof those diseases. Whether it is AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria, Africa \nis dying.\n  The question for all of us who live in this prosperity and wealth in \nthe rest of world is whether we care, and if we care, it is not enough \nto pass a resolution saying we care. The important test is whether we \nwill put our money on the table. That is the test not only for this \nPresident and this administration, it is the test for all of us.\n  I support this amendment. I believe the Senator from Wisconsin is \nshowing real leadership, and if all of the Senators who have voted for \nthe resolutions expressing their heartfelt concern about this epidemic \nin Africa will come forward and vote for this amendment, I think we \nwill have shown that we are prepared to put our money where our mouths \nhave been.\n\n  I still think back to those moments in Africa when I was visiting. I \njust read on the way over here some of the things I had written and \nabout which I had forgotten. I thought about going to a clinic in \nMbale, Uganda, and listening to a beautiful choir of Ugandans who were \nall dying from AIDS, who set up in front of us and sang a song \nentitled, ``Why Me, Why You, Why Him, Why Her, Why Me.''\n  As I looked into their eyes, I thought: I will never forget this, \never, the courage I saw in that clinic.\n  Their courage should be matched by our commitment. This disease, this \nepidemic is not just destroying Africa; it is a test for the rest of \nthe world. Will we respond to this holocaust of the 21st century or \nwill we turn away and say the most prosperous nation in the world \ncannot come up with a singular symbolic contribution to end this \nscourge?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois not \nonly for his tremendous eloquence but for his genuine compassion and \ncommitment on this issue. It is moving to me to see a Senator stick to \nthis effort and be willing to race down to the Chamber and speak in \nsuch a moving way. I thank him and hope we get the kind of vote this \nclear choice deserves.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, in 1983, at my request, we started the \nArmy's infectious disease section to determine whether there could be a \ncure for AIDS or prevention of its transmission. Since that time, we \nhave spent more money than all the world put together in trying to \ndefeat AIDS. The way to help our great friends in Africa is to find a \nway to cure AIDS but not to take money from a system that needs \nprotection under the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator have anything further?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the other Senators yield their time, I will yield \nmine.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have a brief statement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I intend to move to table if the Senator would like to \nspeak prior to that motion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator wants to proceed, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I oppose the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold. This amendment provides funding to address the \nAIDS epidemic, which is a problem of astounding proportions affecting \nmillions in the world today. There is a very laudable purpose behind \nthe amendment. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the committee-reported \nbill which contains $100 million for the Global AIDS Program is a fair \nand commendable approach under the present circumstances and at the \npresent time. The $100 million for the Global AIDS Program was included \nin the committee bill at my own request. I made the request at the \nurging of the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Daschle. The President \ndid not request supplemental funds for this purpose, but we worked in \ncommittee to identify noncontroversial offsets for this important \nprogram.\n  I believe the committee has produced a fair bill, a responsible bill, \na balanced bill. I believe the most effective way to get this essential \naid to the people who need it is to approve the committee bill, without \nthis amendment, so the bill can be taken to conference and sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I shall move to table and I do so with apologies to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, who is, as I have already indicated, offering \nan amendment that is laudable. I think we have responded in the \ncommittee, and under the circumstances I think the committee bill \nshould be approved as is with respect to this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered. The vote \nwill be delayed until later this evening under the previous order.\n\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized to \ndebate his amendment numbered 869, with 2 hours equally divided. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am not quite ready with the amendment \nso I suggest the absence of a quorum. I understand the time will be \ntaken from my allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 869, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodification to my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's \nmodification of his amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I have no \nintention of objecting--if we may just study the modification \nmomentarily?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, the time to be \ntaken from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 869), as modified, is as follows:\n       After section 3002, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3003.

amounts:\n       (A) From the amounts for Transit Planning and Research, \n     $90,000,000.\n       (B) From the amounts for Job Access and Reverse Commute \n     Grants, $116,000,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to explain the modifying amendment removes the \noffsets of title XI of the maritime subsidies and also the cut in the \nExport-Import Bank subsidy. So the remaining offsets will remain. I \nwill go through those in a few minutes, but I want to emphasize that \nboth the Export-Import Bank rescission and the Maritime Guaranteed Loan \nProgram have also been removed. There have been increases in the \namounts of offsets for transit planning and research to $90 million and \njob access to $116 million. So I will now be glad to discuss that with \nthe managers of the bill, if they have any additional questions.\n  I am pleased to have the support and cosponsorship of Senators \nLieberman, Landrieu, Kyl, and Carnahan as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  Basically what it does is it adds a total of $847.8 million in \nadditional spending, all of it for personnel, operations and \nmaintenance, and a very small amount, $45 million, for procurement. So \nvirtually all of this--$800 million of the $847 million--is for the men \nand women in the military, the Reserve personnel, including funds to \nremove sailors and Marines from food stamps, and operations and \nmaintenance, which, as we all know, is very badly underfunded.\n  This amendment funds the bare minimum that the military services have \nsaid they need. We must prioritize our spending and, in my judgment, \nfully funding the readiness of our forces must be our first obligation. \nThis amendment will add $847.8 million to the defense portion of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, yet it will not \nexceed the budget resolution caps because it is fully offset by 12 \nseparate rescissions from non-defense programs. This amendment will \nincrease the President's supplemental budget request from $5.5 billion \nto $6.34 billion. Most of the funding offsets in the amendment were \nadded last year by Congress in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations \nbills and will not be obligated by this October, according to various \nagency heads. In other words, much of the money I propose to rescind \nwill not be spent this year--no matter how seemingly worthy the cause.\n  Later this month, the President will send to Congress the Pentagon's \nOmnibus Reprogramming Request for Fiscal Year 2001. I am told that the \nreprogramming request is about $850 million. The services will have to \nreprogram or transfer critical money from other key readiness and \nmodernization accounts to adequately pay and train our service men and \nwomen. Our military services, stretched thin and overworked, are \nraiding Real Property Maintenance readiness funding--already $16 \nbillion underfunded--and other key accounts, just to ensure that they \ncan pay much-needed bonuses to retain servicemembers.\n  We have sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines--some still on food \nstamps--living in very old, dilapidated homes because the military \nservices keep reprogramming critical funds to shore up other equally \nurgent needs. In Arizona, for example, there are marines at Yuma Marine \nCorps Air Station living in World War II-era barracks. Base Commanders \ntell me that they have deferred maintenance for the past 10 years \nbecause they need to fund higher priorities--and who can blame them. We \nshould fund the services adequately, instead of forcing them to make a \nHobson's choice.\n\n  Recent terrorist threats have clearly demonstrated the dangerous \nimpact of the military funding shortfalls. In late June, U.S. Navy 5th \nFleet warships in ports of the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Gulf \nof Oman, were ordered to sea, after several reports that Osama Bin \nLaden, the world's most notorious terrorist, was said to be planning a \ncomprehensive attack on U.S. and Israeli targets in the Mideast.\n  The U.S. ships had to leave port, since the U.S. Coast Guard--which \nhad primary responsibility for protecting U.S. Naval ships after the \nUSS Cole attack--had to pull out its port security forces due to lack \nof adequate funding or reimbursement from the U.S. Navy, whose budget \nalready is underfunded. The U.S. Navy then had to implement an \nemergency Presidential recall of Navy Reservists, resulting in a nearly \n$2 million unfunded liability not addressed in this supplemental. This \namendment pays for these critical force protection efforts.\n  In 1998, the service chiefs confirmed many of the alarming readiness \ndeficiencies that had been identified by countless sources.\n  The imperative for increasing military readiness and reforming our \nmilitary is as strong today as it was then, It is my firm belief that \nas elected officials, providing for a strong national defense is our \nmost serious obligation. Anyone who dismisses our readiness problems, \nour concerns with morale and personnel retention, and our deficiencies \nin everything from spare parts to training is blatantly ignoring the \ndire reality of this situation.\n  Too often in the last century, we ignored warnings from the military \nthat our armed forces were too weak to\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\nmeet the many grave challenges they face. Today, we must listen to our \ncommanders, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  The service chiefs have indicated that they need at least $30 billion \nmore per year for modernization and readiness accounts. Listen to \ndetailed testimony before the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees on September 27, 2000--just eight months ago--by our current \nJoint Chiefs on the underfunded needs of our military services, and the \ndramatic, harmful consequences likely to occur if we fail to adequately \nfund these requirements.\n\n  General Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       [C]ontinuing to improve our current readiness posture to \n     desired levels while preparing for tomorrow's challenges will \n     require additional resources. . . . The $60 billion projected \n     by the QDR [for procurement] will not be enough to get the \n     job done.\n\n  General Shelton continues:\n\n       [O]ur long-term ability to sustain our [military] equipment \n     is slipping. One cause is due to the negative effects of a \n     higher than planned tempo of operations on our aging \n     equipment. This high tempo and the associated wear-and-tear \n     require more frequent maintenance and repair, further \n     highlighting the need for recapitalization and modernization \n     of our forces. Moreover, we have not been able to procure \n     enough new equipment to reduce the average age of our force \n     structure. It is also important to note that we believe this \n     higher maintenance tempo has also had a deleterious effect on \n     the hardworking troops attempting to maintain this aging \n     equipment, which directly impact retention of our quality \n     force. At posts, camps and stations, such items as housing, \n     fuel lines and water lines, as well as facilities where \n     people work and live, have outstripped their useful life. . . \n     . and this directly impacts our ability to provide a decent \n     quality of life for our troops. . . . How much more funding \n     is needed? . . . Well in excess of $60 billion is needed to \n     maintain our readiness.\n\n  Gen. Eric Shinseki, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, testified that $30 \nbillion more per year is a move in the right direction, but even that \ndoes not take into account Army transformation costs or shortages in \ncritical ammunition needs:\n\n       We have training shortfalls in institutional training, \n     training support, training range modernization, and combat \n     training center modernization. Real Property Maintenance is \n     currently funded at 75 percent of requirement, a funding \n     level that will not slow or prevent the ongoing deterioration \n     of existing Army facilities. . . . At this rate, it will take \n     the Army about 157 years to fully revitalize our \n     infrastructure.\n\n  Any of my colleagues who read the recent study conducted by the U.S. \nArmy about the personnel situation in the U.S. Army today should be \nappalled and deeply disturbed by the findings of the U.S. Army about \nthe lack of confidence amongst the young men and women about their \nleadership, about their future, about their lack of desire in \nretention. We are losing captains in the U.S. Army at a greater rate \nthan at any time in the history of the U.S. Army.\n  Adm. Vern Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, concurred in testimony \nthat $30 billion more in total each year is required:\n\n       I am concerned about the inventory levels of Precision \n     Guided Munitions. . . . We are still below the current \n     warfighting requirement. The shortfall of precision munitions \n     is a major risk driver for our forces . . . with our current \n     inventory, execution of a second MTW will rely more on the \n     use of non-precision munitions, thereby increasing the risk \n     to our pilots and the potential for collateral damage.\n\n  Madam President, I have a lot of quotes.\n  Admiral Clark continues:\n\n       It is critical that we begin to fund 100 percent of our \n     manning, maintenance, ordnance, modernization, \n     recapitalization and training requirements. . . . We have not \n     been doing that. Improving the quality of our workspaces \n     requires a commitment to both Real Property Maintenance and \n     MILCON, both of which are seriously underfunded.\n\n  Admiral Clark continues:\n\n       [M]anpower is our most urgent challenge. . . . In retention \n     we remain below our goal. [T]oday--\n\n  He is talking about last September--\n\n       I am 14,000 people short: almost 8,000 at sea, and 6,000 \n     ashore. That has to be redressed soon. We are at war for \n     people. It has to be reflected in our budget. . . . [A]nd we \n     will need the help of Congress.\n\n  Gen. Michael E. Ryan, Air Force Chief of Staff, testified that the \nAir Force needs at least $11 billion more per year:\n\n       [A]ir Force readiness has not turned around--at best these \n     efforts have leveled off the decline. . . . The overall \n     combat readiness of our combat units is down 23 percent since \n     1996. Because we must assure the readiness of our engaged \n     forces overseas, we have done it at the expense of our \n     stateside units. The reasons for these readiness declines \n     have their basis in operations tempo, past underfunding of \n     spares, dealing with older and aging systems, and a workforce \n     that is less experienced because of retention declines.\n\n  General Ryan also contends:\n\n       [T]he Mission Capable (MC) rates of our aircraft have \n     continued to decline by over 10 percent since 1991. Mission \n     Capable rates are directly proportional to how much time an \n     aircraft is not available because of not having parts in \n     supply or because maintenance work needs to be done on the \n     aircraft to make it ready. Some of our units are not getting \n     as much flying as they should get, because of our inability \n     to generate the aircraft because of mission capability rates. \n     We have not had enough funding to do that adequately.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       [T]he overall retention rate remains a serious concern. We \n     fell below our end strength authorization of 361,000 \n     active duty members by 5,300. . . . And that is probably \n     5,000 under what is required. So a total of 10,000 short \n     right now.\n\n  Madam President, I am again reminding my colleagues, I am talking \nabout testimony that was given last September to the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n\n       Enlisted retention levels are below goal. . . . A shortage \n     of 1200 pilots exists today, the additional bonuses have made \n     an impact. [Moreover,] [b]ecause of funding shortfalls, we \n     have significantly under-invested in base operating support, \n     Real Property Maintenance, family housing, and military \n     construction. We cannot continue to mortgage this area of our \n     force readiness without significant long-term effects. Over \n     the past six years we have averaged an investment in \n     infrastructure at a 250-year replacement rate. Industry \n     standard is 50 years. We have a $4.3 billion Real Property \n     Maintenance backlog.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James L. Jones, testified \nthat the Marine Corps needs at least $1.5 billion more per year for \nmodernization alone, including $220 million for basic ammunition:\n\n       We are at a point where failure to rectify modernization \n     and readiness shortfalls can no longer be ignored. . . . It \n     is readily apparent that we are fast running out of short-\n     term fixes for budget shortfalls. One-time increases in \n     defense spending are not the solution. A sustained period of \n     increased funding is required in order to ensure the future \n     readiness of your Corps.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       [T]he countless hours of maintenance on our aging ground \n     systems directly impacts the life of our Marines. Many of our \n     aircraft are approaching block obsolescence. The majority of \n     our key aviation equipment is older than the Marines who use \n     it. . . . Since 1995, the direct maintenance man-hours per \n     hour of flight increased by 33 percent and there has been a \n     58 percent increase in our ``cannibalization'' rate.\n\n  ``Cannibalization'' means stealing parts from one airplane to make \nanother one operationally capable.\n\n       During the same time period the full mission capable rate, \n     though still within acceptable parameters, has decreased by \n     9.45 across the force. These statistics represent data for \n     all Marine Corps aircraft and show a declining level of \n     readiness.\n\n  General Jones also maintained that:\n\n       [W]e continue to have a deficit of approximately 10,000 \n     family units. Our backlog of Maintenance and Repair . . . \n     amounts to over $600 million. Budget limitations force us to \n     make hard choices that result in funding only our most \n     critical construction requirements. Although we have reduced \n     our MILCON--\n\n  Military construction--\n\n     replacement cycle to approximately 100 years, it is still \n     twice the industry standard.\n\n  The testimony to the service chiefs is alarming. It underscores the \nrationale for this amendment. It seeks simply to respond to basic \nrequirements of our military services just until the end of this fiscal \nyear, which occurs in fewer than 75 days from now.\n  The amendment will help our service men and women recognize their \nGovernment's firm commitment to: Adequately provide for modernization; \nensuring equipment maintenance--including reversing the deficiency in \nspare parts availability--is adequately funded; sufficiently funding \ncritical training needs, including flying hours; beginning to resolve \nthe broad pay and benefits disparity that affects our service men and \nwomen; starting to reverse the high rates of attrition across the \nservices; continuing to take service members off the food stamp rolls; \nand ensuring at least minimum force protection efforts to help prevent \nfurther U.S.S. Cole-type terrorist attack.\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n  I urge your support for this critical amendment.\n  Madam President, I outlined shortfalls and deficiencies within the \nDepartment of Defense that far exceed--far, far exceed--this $847 \nmillion amendment.\n  But I would point out that this administration, with my wholehearted \nsupport, and this Secretary of Defense are doing everything they can to \nrestructure and reorganize the military and impose necessary savings. I \nbelieve a very good faith effort is being made on the other side of the \nriver at the Pentagon. I am proud of the efforts Secretary Rumsfeld is \nmaking. I look forward eagerly to supporting him in whatever \nconclusions and recommendations they make because he has gathered \ntogether some of the best military minds in America to come up with \nthese proposals.\n  But they have not been forthcoming yet. We have some very deep and \nsevere short-term needs. I was fully expecting--fully expecting--when \nthis administration came in that there would be significant increases, \nincluding in this supplemental appropriations bill. I appreciate the \nefforts of the managers. But I say to the managers, it is not enough, \nnor is this amendment enough. But I cannot imagine why these urgent \nneeds, which are being addressed on a personnel and operations and \nmaintenance basis, would be rejected.\n  There may be some questions about the offsets.\n  There is a $30 million offset from the Department of the Treasury \n``Salaries & Expenses'' for the 2002 Winter Olympics security. In this \nrescission we only cut half of the money added for the Olympics by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee during markup of the supplemental bill. \nWe still leave $30 million for this program, adding to the $220 million \nin total Federal funding in the fiscal year 2002. It is difficult to \nunderstand why the need for Federal funding for safety and security \npurposes for the Olympic games has more than quadrupled since the 1984 \nSummer Games in Los Angeles and more than doubled since the 1996 Summer \nOlympics in Atlanta.\n  Compared to the 23 venues spread over a 500-square-mile area used for \nthe Los Angeles Olympic Games and the 31 venues located in 8 cities \nthat spread from Miami, FL, to Washington, DC, for the Atlanta Games, \nthe Salt Lake Games will utilize only 14 venues located within a \nsignificantly smaller geographical perimeter. Yet the current total of \nFederal funding for safety and security purposes, which includes this \n$60 million in supplemental funding, is $220 million. The total funding \nfor safety and security for Los Angeles, $68 million, and Atlanta, $96 \nmillion, combined was far less than what will be spent on the Salt Lake \nWinter Games. Last year's GAO report demonstrated that taxpayers have \nshelled out $1.3 billion in subsidies for Salt Lake City alone.\n\n  As to the NASA shuttle electric auxiliary power units, $19 million: \nThis amendment would rescind the remaining $19 million of FY 2001 funds \nfor this program, whose implementation NASA has chosen to terminate. \nAccording to NASA, the anticipated remaining funding for FY 2001 is $19 \nmillion. Following the results of the EAPU review process that found \ntechnical flaws and cost overruns in the program, NASA has determined \nthat the prudent action at this time is to terminate EAPU \nimplementation while NASA formulates a plan on how to proceed with this \nupgrade project. The electric auxiliary power unit, EAPU is one of the \nseveral upgrade programs that NASA is developing for the Space Shuttle \nprogram.\n  As to the NASA life and micro-gravity research, $40 million: The FY \n2000 VA/HUD appropriations bill earmarked $40 million for a space \nshuttle mission, R-2 for life and micro-gravity research. Due to delays \nin overhauling the Shuttle Columbia the shuttle mission has been \ndelayed and will not be launched in 2001. The supplemental \nappropriations bill would broaden the use of the $40 million for life \nand micro-gravity research that was earmarked for a special shuttle \nmission and other Space Station research in FY 2001. This amendment \nwould rescind this earmark.\n  As to Commerce Department's ``Advance Technology Program,'' known as \nATP, $67 million: This amendment would rescind the funds that the \nCommerce Department carried over from last fiscal year and again and \nexpects to be left over again at the end of this fiscal year. The \nPresident's FY 2002 budget request has requested no funds for the \nprogram. Historically, I have fought this program as corporate welfare, \nbecause it has given awards to Fortune 500 companies such as General \nElectric, Dow Chemical, the 3M Company, and Xerox.\n  As to the Labor Department unspent balances in worker employment \ntraining activities, $141.5 million: This is the same amount rescinded \nby the other body for this program. The House supplemental \nappropriations bill rescinded $359 million from the $1.8 billion in \nadvanced funding provided in the FY 2001 Labor/HHS Appropriations Act \nfor adult and dislocated worker employment and training activities. The \nSenate bill only rescinded $217.5 million from these employment and \ntraining activities. We increase the amount rescinded by $141.5 million \nfrom these same activities so that we merely do the same thing as the \nHouse did and rescinded $359 million in total. Even with the \nrescission, States will still have $5.1 billion available to support \nthese activities in 2001--$455 million over amounts available in 2000. \nThe reason for this rescission is that when the advance appropriations \nwere provided, it was not anticipated that there would be such high \nlevels of unspent balances in these programs.\n  As to the Transportation Department Job Access Reverse Commute Grants \nProgram, $76 million: This offset in the amount of $76 million \nrepresents surplus funds from the Job Access Reverse Commute Program \naccount that remained unused at the end of FY 2000. The enacted FY 2001 \nbudget authority for this account was approximately $100 million. When \nadded to the surplus funds from FY 2000, this account contained nearly \n$176 million. I have been informed by the budget office of the \nDepartment of Transportation that this account has a current \nunobligated balance of $146 million, which means that in the past 9 \nmonths of the current fiscal year, only about $30 million has been \nspent. We are thus rescinding only $76 million out of the total amount, \nleaving nearly $50 million for the Transportation Department to use \nover the next 82 days for this purpose.\n  The Transportation Department transit planning and research, $34 \nmillion: The offset of $34 million is surplus funds which remained in \nthe transit planning and research account at the end of fiscal year \n2000.\n  As to the Commerce Department International Trade Administration, \nExport Promotion Program, $19 million: The International Trade \nAdministration's trade development program helps U.S. industries export \ntheir products. This program amounts to a corporate subsidy. There is \nno need to burden the American taxpayers with this program. U.S. \nindustries wishing to export goods and services should pay for this \ntype of counseling themselves. The fiscal year 2001 omnibus \nappropriations bill appropriated $64.7 million to this program. \nAccording to the Department of Commerce, $21 million remains unexpended \nin this account.\n  As to the Emergency Steel Guaranteed Loan Program, $126.8 million: \nThese are loan guarantees to qualified steel companies. There remains \n$126.8 million in unspent balances in the account for fiscal year 2001 \nout of a total appropriation of more than $129 million. I am told that \nnone of this money will be spent in the 82 days left in this fiscal \nyear.\n  As to the Treasury Department U.S. Customs Service Byrd antidumping \namendment funds rescission, $200 million: The ``continued dumping and \nsubsidy offset'' was added in the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture \nappropriations conference report--the wrong way to do business, I say \nto the managers of the bill, the wrong way to do business. However, the \nimportant point is that the entire sum of money collected during the \ncurrent fiscal year under this law is not being spent. CBO scores the \nByrd amendment at $200 to $300 million annually, and the chief \nfinancial officer of the Customs Service confirms this figure for \nfiscal year 2001. None of the money that is being collected throughout \nfiscal year 2001 will be disbursed to companies this year. In fact, it \nwill not be disbursed until the second quarter of fiscal year 2002. The \nmoney that has been collected since\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nthe law was signed in October 2000 but which will not be disbursed in \nfiscal year 2001 is currently sitting unused in the general treasury.\n  I am philosophically opposed to this program that distorts trade \npolicy by taking antidumping duties levied to protect U.S. companies \nand actually redistributing duties collected to those very companies, \nproviding them a double reward: punitive tariff rates for imports from \noverseas competitors, as well as a slush fund of public money.\n  Again, the point here is that none of the $200 million collected \nannually for this program will be spent this year and sufficient funds \nwill be collected next year to meet the law's fiscal year 2002 \nobligations.\n  I have described the offsets because every one of those programs \nwhich this money is being reduced from, most of it unused at this time, \npales in significance to the importance of taking care of the men and \nwomen in the military. Which is more important, decent housing for the \nmen and women in the military or Commerce Department international \ntrade administration export promotion programs?\n  We have to always set priorities. I argue that the priority that \nexists today and that those of us on this side of the aisle promised \nthe American people as a result of the election last year was that we \nwould do a much better job of taking care of the men and women in the \nmilitary than had been happening in the previous 8 years.\n  I strongly urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Texas may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nsupport the amendment for a lot of reasons.\n  The most important reason I support it is that this is an amendment \nwhere a Member of the Senate has actually gone through a $2 trillion \nbudget, a budget that spends $7,000 per man, woman, and child in \nAmerica, and found $800 million that he believes is a lower priority \nthan the things for which he would increase funding in the military.\n  It never ceases to amaze me that in a government where we spend $2 \ntrillion--that is with a ``t''--every year, over and over again, \nMembers of the Senate stand up and offer amendments to increase \nspending on some favored program, and almost never, ever do they \nsuggest that there is something in the Federal Government that is a \nlower priority than the thing they believe is a high enough priority to \nincrease spending to fund.\n  I think you can quarrel, though I do not quarrel, but you can quarrel \nwith almost any one of the choices the Senator from Arizona has made. \nBut you can't quarrel with the logic of the Senator from Arizona, which \nis that our job is setting priorities. He argues that operation and \nmaintenance, housing, and improved capacity in the military, exceed in \nvalue the list of the $800 million worth of expenditures he would \nreduce or terminate in order to fund his amendment.\n  I believe these kinds of amendments need to be encouraged. I am in \nsupport of the amendment and I intend to vote for it. Let me also say \nthat it is hard for me to judge the statements being made about \ndefense. I can't forget that many of the same people who are now saying \nthat there is virtually no limit to what we could use in defense, \neither they or their predecessors, 2 or 3 years ago, were saying that \neverything was great in an administration that was dramatically \nreducing the real level of defense spending.\n  I believe we do need a top-to-bottom review at the Pentagon. I agree \nwith the Senator from Arizona that a good-faith effort--perhaps the \nbest effort in 10 or 20 years--is being undertaken by the Secretary of \nDefense. That effort is not going to produce results that will be \nuniformly happy, and I would have to say that of all of the proposals \nthat have been looked at--and I agree with all the people who, with \nunhappiness and bluster, say it was done the wrong way, we weren't \nnotified, and there are 101 explanations for being opposed to cutting \none program to fund another--but the bottom line is, we had an effort \nunderway to undo the one proposal to reprogram that had been made by \nthe Pentagon. I think, quite frankly, that sets a very bad precedent. \nSo I believe we do need a comprehensive review.\n  My dad was a sergeant in the Army. That is the extent of my knowledge \nabout the military. I believe in a strong defense. I am proud of my \nrecord in supporting defense. I think I have a base of support for \npeople who wear the uniform that is virtually second to none. But \nwhether or not we need to be in a position to fight two major conflicts \nat once is something subject to question. I am a lot more concerned \nabout modernization and recruitment and retention than I am about \ncontinuing to keep production lines alive. I think Eisenhower clearly \nwas right when he warned us so long ago that even with our best \nintentions about defense, defense spending would be driven by political \ninterests--something he called the ``industrial military complex.''\n  Let me sum up what I came over to say today. First of all, I commend \nthe Senator from Arizona for being the first person in this Congress \nand the first person in a long time who really not only thought we \nought to spend money on something we weren't spending it on, but who \nwas willing to actually name things he was willing to take it away \nfrom. It is interesting that all over America every day families make \nthese kinds of choices. The washing machine breaks down and so they \nhave to make choices. Maybe they don't go on vacation. Or Johnny falls \nand breaks his arm and it has to be set and it costs money. They have \nto make choices, and they are hard choices. We never seem to make any \nof those choices. I am attracted to this amendment because it does make \nthose choices, whether you agree with them or not.\n  Secondly, I believe we need more money for defense, but I think it \nhas to come in the context of a dramatic reform of defense spending. I \nthink one of the worst things we can do is to simply have a dramatic \nincrease in defense spending without going back and making fundamental \ndecisions about where the money needs to be spent. So I am not unhappy \nwith where we are in terms of a comprehensive review. Once we have a \nnew plan, once we set new priorities, then I am willing to do what the \nSenator's amendment has done, which is to take money away from lower \npriority uses. But I do think it is important that we know what we want \nto do.\n  So I commend our colleague for the amendment. I support it. I did \nwant to go on record as saying that I am concerned that many of our \ncolleagues are ready to stop the one effort the administration has made \nin terms of changing priorities. I think that sends a very bad signal. \nI think whether it affects individual States--and this is one that \nhappens to negatively affect my State--I don't think we can take the \nposition that every program change ought to be opposed if it affects \nour particular State. I think in the end you have to look at the big \npicture. I think we are all expected to work for the interests of our \nStates, but, in the end, it is the interest of the common defense of \nthe country that defense spending is about.\n\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time and for his amendment. I \ndon't have any doubt that, looked at in the aggregate, the $800 million \nof programs--no matter how meritorious any one individual might be, the \nmerits of those programs pale by comparison to the merits of the \nprograms he has proposed to take the money from and use for the \npurposes of defense funding. That is what our appropriations process \nought to be about. Unfortunately, it is not, and I think our Government \nis diminished as a result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if I might yield myself 10 minutes to speak \nin opposition to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Off of whose time does the Senator wish to \nconsume time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In opposition to the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is an hour in opposition to the McCain amendment. \nOn behalf of the chairman, I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I think we would be \nmaking a mistake to gut some important domestic programs that I think \nare critical to our being competitive in the global economy. I think it \nis critical that we make sure we also live up to the national security \nof our own country, which is the security of local communities where \npeople really have the opportunity for dislocated workers to rebuild \ntheir lives, where we are able to make investments in industries that \nare critical to the economic life of our communities and our country.\n  I don't doubt the judgment of the Senator from Arizona on some of the \nnew spending that he believes is critical for defense. I argue that I \nbelieve we should be able to find this money within DOD's budget.\n  I want to go over inspector general reports, which point to a very \nbloated, wasteful Pentagon budget, where there is more than enough \nmoney to meet my colleague's challenge. I think the amendment turns our \npriorities on their head, and I think it is a mistake. The Senator's \namendment would rescind $141.5 million, and that is on top of the $217 \nmillion that we have already rescinded for job training programs under \nthe Workforce Investment Act. My colleague from Arizona said the \nworkforce investment decision was designed to bring the Senate \nrescission to what the House did but, in fact, the House did not \nrescind any funds. So I think my colleague is in error on that point.\n  More important, I think it is a mistake in these times. I am speaking \nas a Senator from Minnesota, but as I said earlier, on the Iron Range--\nwhich is a second home for me and my wife Sheila in terms of how \nstrongly we feel about the people up there--we saw LTV Company pull the \nplug, and 1,300 steelworkers are out of work. These are taconite \nworkers. These were $60,000-a-year jobs, including health care. These \nfamilies are trying to recover. These workers are now dislocated. They \nare looking for other work. In farm country and in rural parts of the \nState, many people have been left behind.\n  I think it is simply the wrong priority to make additional cuts to \nadditional rescissions in assistance for dislocated workers. It is just \nnot right. It is not right. Moreover, in the Workforce Investment Act, \nwhich I wrote with Senator DeWine in a bipartisan effort, we did things \nto make sense by way of streamlining and having a good public-private \npartnership, and by way of being consistent in terms of what our \nnational priorities are, which I think is all about, again, the \nimportance of human capital, the importance of education, the \nimportance of people having the skills training and the people finding \nemployment so they can support themselves and their families. I do not \nthink it makes sense to make additional cuts in this priority program.\n\n  My colleague also would rescind nearly $127 million from the Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program. I do not know, but there are a lot of Senators, \nand I know there are Republicans as well, who come from a part of the \ncountry where the industrial sector is really important, where we have \nhad an import surge, where many workers, hard-working people--you \ncannot find any more hard-working people--are now losing their jobs, \nand we are talking about how to make an investment in this industry.\n  By the way, the steel industry is one of those industries that is \ncritical to our national security, in the critical role the steel \nindustry has always played by way of contributing to defense, much less \nthe infrastructure of highways and bridges within our own country.\n  Again, I find myself in major disagreement with this amendment.\n  Finally, if we are going to look for resources for the new needs \nidentified by Senator McCain, I think we can find it right out of this \nbloated Pentagon budget. I have no doubt there is at least $1 billion \nof waste that the Secretary of Defense can identify. Let me talk about \nwhat the Pentagon inspector general found by way of bookkeeping entries \nthat could not be tracked or justified:\n\n       We identified deficiencies in internal controls and account \n     systems related to General Property, Plant and Equipment; \n     Inventory; Environmental Liabilities; Military Retirement \n     Health Benefits Liability; and material lines within the \n     Statement of Budgetary Resources. We identified $1.1 trillion \n     in departmental-level accounting entries to financial data \n     used to prepare DOD component financial statements that were \n     not supported by adequate audit trials or by sufficient \n     evidence to determine their validity.\n\n  This is not a new problem. In fiscal year 1999, the inspector general \nreported there were $2.3 trillion in entries that could not be \ncorroborated.\n  Six years ago, the General Accounting Office put the Pentagon's \nfinancial management on its list of agencies that are at high risk for \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The inspector general also has uncovered many other examples of gross \novercharges in the Pentagon's accounting system. A March 13, 2001, \nreport listed the following gross abuses:\n  The Pentagon paid $2.10 for a body screw that cost the vendor 48 \ncents, a 335-percent markup.\n  The Pentagon paid 25 cents for a dust protection plug that cost the \nvendor 3 cents, a 699-percent markup.\n  The Pentagon paid $409.15 for a washroom sink that cost the vendor \n$39.17, a 945-percent markup.\n  The source: Office of Inspector General, Department of Defense \nreport. This was March 13, 2001.\n  If we want to find the money, let's look at some of the \nadministrative waste within the Pentagon. We can surely find that \nmoney. We can surely make that transfer instead of going after priority \nprograms that are also all about our national defense.\n  I argue, again, part of the definition of national defense is the \nsecurity of local communities where dislocated workers have the \nopportunity to rebuild their lives, to develop their skills, to find \ngainful employment where we have industries that have the capital that \ncan generate the jobs on which people can support their families.\n\n  Why in the world would we want to make cuts in these programs? I \nbelieve this amendment reflects the wrong priorities, and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Wyoming wishes to have time. I yield \nhim 7 minutes from the time in opposition to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Appropriations Committee for the \nfact they covered all of the expenditures. Senator McCain has covered \nthe expenditures, but before we vote for Senator McCain's amendment, I \nask that we give some serious concern to from where some of this money \nis coming.\n  I serve on the Small Business Committee, and we have worked on a \nnumber of ways to be sure people who lost jobs could have additional \ntraining. So I rise today to express some serious concern over the use \nof workforce investment funds to offset 2001 supplemental \nappropriations. While I do support additional appropriations for the \npurposes outlined in the underlying bill, dramatically reducing funding \nfor State and local workforce development programs to pay for it does \nnot seem prudent.\n\n  Again, I recognize the pressures placed on the appropriators, but I \nwould have expected that the Members responsible for oversight of such \nprograms would have been consulted as to the impact of such cuts on the \nprogram's ability to fulfill its purpose.\n  The programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act were agreed \nto through a strong bipartisan process, led by Senators DeWine, \nKennedy, Jeffords, Wellstone, and myself. I fear, given the apparent \nwillingness to cut funding for the act, that we did too good of a job \nin 1998 when Workforce Investment Act was enacted. What I mean by that \nis that we successfully streamlined the often duplicative and \ndisjointed collage of job training programs in existence prior to 1998. \nSo now, if these rescissions are adopted, there will not be any \nalternative workforce investment programs for people to access. The \npoint is, this money is the program. None of us can support this \nrescission and walk away thinking another workforce initiative will \nsimply absorb our constituents.\n  Moreover, a retroactive cut of this size will compound the challenges \nthat many States are already facing during the transition from the Job \nTraining Partnership Act, which my colleagues\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nknow as JTPA, to the Workforce Investment Act. Also--and no one is \nreally talking about this part--since States were due a portion of \ntheir annual allotment on July 1, they now are going to have to turn \naround and send a large portion of that back to Washington in the form \nof a rebate check. This just does not seem right to me.\n  I do not have any formulas at hand to demonstrate the value of \nworkforce development programs in the face of a slowed economy. It is \nsimply too early too soon, but what I can offer my colleagues is common \nsense. Now is not the time for us to scale back basic skills training, \nre-training of displaced workers, or innovative initiatives designed to \nspur long-range economic development in struggling communities. It is \nthese communities that need our help, and that is help that we promised \nlast year in the ``regular'' FY 2001 appropriations bill.\n  Again, I know the dilemma facing our appropriators is not easy. There \nis consensus that we need to provide immediate additional resources to \nour military, our farmers and others whose distress is our \nresponsibility. I also recognize that identifying unobligated current \nyear appropriations in July is like finding a needle in a haystack, but \nrescinding funds from people who are trying to make themselves \nemployable, to make themselves contributing members of their community \nis not exactly skimming fat off the top. This cuts to the bone in \nWyoming and in countless other States. My State, for instance, was due \nto receive $555,420 on July 1 for dislocated workers. I know this does \nnot sound like a lot to those of you from larger States, and it is not \na lot even in Wyoming, but it is crucial in Wyoming in the effort to \naddress the counties that have been hard hit by unemployment. So now \ninstead of $555,000, we will receive 62 percent of that, or \n$345,000. That is a 38-percent cut of already appropriated money. We \nare not talking about cutting a request; it is already appropriated and \nshould have been sent.\n\n  I can assure Members it will have an adverse impact on the progress \nwe have made in the implementation of the Workforce Investment Act and \nwill impact getting people retrained for currently useful jobs. My \nconcern over this rescission is clear, and I will not belabor my \nopposition. I ask that the able managers of the bill reconsider using \nworkforce investment funds to offset supplemental spending. I am happy \nto work with them and their House counterparts as they reconcile the \ntwo bills in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska for yielding \ntime. I wish to remind my colleagues, in crafting this supplemental \nbill the Department of Defense considered two criteria. These \nrequirements were that any program receiving supplemental funding must \nbe able to execute this funding during the current fiscal year, and the \ncurrent fiscal year has just about 2\\1/2\\ months remaining, and that \nthe funding cannot wait until fiscal year 2002.\n  I also wish to remind the Senate that from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal \nyear 2001 the Congress of the United States added $49 billion to the \nDepartment of Defense budget, much of it to the very programs that \nconcern Senators from Arizona. Some of the unfunded requirements \naddressed by the Senator in this amendment were identified by the \nservices in January and February before the Bush administration began \nits own defense review. And some of these items are funded in the \nfiscal year 2002 request.\n  We are committed to working with the Defense Department to avoid a \nsupplemental next year and fund all legitimate requirements. Many of \nthe items identified by the distinguished Senator will be funded in \nfiscal year 2002 or through the omnibus reprogramming request.\n  We understand the Senator's amendment seeks to fund anticipated costs \nthat DOD expects to materialize later this year. I wish to underline \n``anticipated costs'' because the intent of the Senator's amendment to \ncover this cost is very meritorious. However, the committees of \njurisdiction, the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee, have yet to receive this request. We have not received a \nrequest from the Department of Defense. The increases in question have \nnot been scrutinized by either of these committees. Therefore, we \ncannot validate to our colleagues this day that the amounts identified \nby the distinguished Senator from Arizona are the ones that the \nDepartment of Defense truly needs. We understand and support the \nconcept that the Senator offers in the amendment, but we do not believe \nwe can support the amendment until the committees have had a chance to \nstudy, to scrutinize the specific details of the request.\n  Until such time, we cannot advise our colleagues that this is what \nDOD really needs. Therefore, I must stand in opposition to the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will read from an article in the \nWashington Post dated May 31, 2001, titled ``Bush Eyes Additional $5.6 \nBillion For Military: Increase Is Far Less Than Services Expected,'' by \nRobert Suro and Thomas Ricks, Washington Post staff writers.\n  In part it states:\n\n       The supplemental budget request . . . does not include any \n     new money for ballistic missile defense which [Bush] has \n     depicted a top priority, or for the weapons systems and \n     operating costs that he said the Clinton administration had \n     grossly underfunded. Some senior military officers and \n     defense experts said yesterday the president's request is so \n     small that it will not fully cover the Pentagon's current \n     expenses.\n       ``This request is the barebones, just the items that are \n     absolutely to get by, and no one has any illusions that it is \n     anything more than that,'' said a senior military officer \n     speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       In the early days of the new administration, top military \n     officials said they hope to get much more, at least $8 \n     billion to $10 billion, in a supplemental that would, in \n     effect, be the first installment of a Bush buildup. But the \n     White House and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld decided \n     they would take care of only immediate needs in modifying \n     this year's defense budget. . . . The new priorities will not \n     be fully felt until the 2003 budget is unveiled next winter . \n     . .\n       Although relatively small sums are at play, compared to the \n     size of the defense budget, some senior military officers \n     have complained. ``On the campaign trail he said over and \n     over, `Help is on the way,''' said a flag officer . . . \n     ``Well, we are going to need help when the fourth quarter of \n     this budget year rolls around, and it is not going to be \n     there.''\n       In principle, supplemental spending requests are meant to \n     provide relatively small amounts for contingencies that arise \n     after the Federal budget is enacted. But the Pentagon, unlike \n     other Federal agencies, has regularly used supplementals to \n     fill out identity funds for basic operations, maintenance, \n     and supplies. Rumsfeld has warned that he intends to put an \n     end to this practice, beginning with a crackdown this year.\n\n  I certainly hope that will be the case.\n  I challenge a Member of this body to find any member of the U.S. \nmilitary leadership, any chief petty officer or sergeant who would tell \nthem this is enough, that what is in the supplemental is enough.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I don't intend to be an expert in \nmilitary matters, and I yield to those who do understand those matters. \nBut I have to rise to oppose Senator McCain's amendment with respect to \none of the offsets he has created that would cut the provisions in the \nsupplemental in half for those funds that would be appropriated in \nsupport of the Olympics.\n  I understand concern about the Olympics. I understand the sense that \nthis is a sporting event. What is the Federal Government doing with \nrespect to a sporting event? But I have to point out a few things with \nrespect to the Olympics that take it out of the realm of the pure \nsporting event.\n  The Senator from Arizona has talked about the Olympics in Atlanta as \nwell as the Olympics in Los Angeles. I attended the Olympics in Los \nAngeles because I was living there, and I recognize that we live in a \nvery different world than we did in 1984. The Olympics in Atlanta was \nthe first Olympics at which we had a bomb in the United States, and as \na result of the bomb that went off in Atlanta and the scare that came \nfollowing that, President Clinton issued Presidential Decision \nDirective No. 62, PDD 62, designating this as a Presidential event, \nchanging\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\nthe security arrangements of the Olympics forever. The whole \ncircumstance surrounding the Olympics, now, as a result of PDD 62 are \nfocused on international terrorism in a way that they were not in the \nmore simple days of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 or certainly even \nin Atlanta.\n  Now, as a result of PDD 62 creating this as a Presidential event, we \nas a government are now faced with these circumstances. And $52 million \nof the $62 million called for in the supplemental go to the Treasury \nDepartment and the Secret Service for a variety of functions \nsurrounding PDD 62 and its requirements. The first deals with the core \nmission of the Secret Service which has to do with protecting the \nPresident, protecting foreign dignitaries, and dealing with \ncounterterrorism. We are going to have an unprecedented number of \nforeign dignitaries attending these Olympics. That goes with every new \nOlympics. Every time there is a new Olympics, more foreign dignitaries \nshow up than 4 years before.\n  We must understand that the venues for these games, they being winter \nOlympics, are not focused around a stadium or a swimming pool. We are \ntalking about a 900 square mile area, including some of the most \nmountainous territory in the United States. To protect all of that area \nrequires a tremendous amount of effort on the part of the Secret \nService. That is what the money is going for.\n  There is a question of customs. We are getting people from all over \nthe world to come to the Olympics--people who, as we saw in Munich, can \npose as athletes and turn out to be terrorists, as well as athletes, \ntheir coaches, families, and, of course, spectators.\n  Dealing with customs in the Treasury Department is where part of this \nmoney will go. The ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, \nenergized obviously by the experience in Atlanta where there was a bomb \nthat went off, is now making sure that a great deal more activity is \ndone to prevent that than was done in Atlanta. It is only prudent to do \nthis. That is $52 million of the $60 million we are talking about in \nthis supplemental going to the Treasury Department for those kinds of \nfunctions.\n  The other $8 million goes to the Justice Department, the Agriculture \nDepartment, and the Interior Department. You would ask: What does \nAgriculture and Interior have to do with the Olympics? The fact is that \na very large portion of the Olympics will take place on Forest Service \nland, which is policed by the Department of Agriculture, and BLM land, \nwhich is policed by the Department of the Interior. These agencies have \nthe adequate facilities to deal with this, but, in the heightened \nactivity surrounding the Olympics, they will have to pay their people \novertime. They will get their people there. They have the trained \npeople to do it, but they will have to pay airfare. There will have to \nbe lodging. They will have to pay overtime. These agencies have been \nputting together this information.\n  We can complain maybe this should have been done in the previous \nbill, it should have been taken care of in the 2001 appropriations bill \nand we should not have it before us as a supplemental, but the fact is, \nif we do not get it prior to the end of this fiscal year, the proper \npreparations will not be able to be made.\n  This money is in the 2002 bill. The full $60 million is in the 2002 \nbill, which, in the normal course of governmental activity, that would \nbe the proper way to do it. The fact is, however, we cannot change the \ntime of the Olympic games. That is set in concrete, and if we do not do \nthe money in a more readily available upfront manner, we will find we \nare facing the challenge of trying to have the money in the pipeline \nwhile the games are taking place.\n  It seems in this situation, in the middle of the summer when the Sun \nis shining and it is hot outside, that this may not be a matter of that \nmuch pressing urgency. But if we have an international incident at the \nOlympics in Utah in 2002--if a foreign dignitary is attacked; if a \nterrorist attack goes on to try to embarrass any country--ours or any \nother--if there is a lapse in security and the fingers start to be \npointed as to where were the Americans, why weren't they prepared--it \nwill be a little difficult to say we wanted to put it off, we wanted to \ntake it out of the supplemental and have it take place in the 2002 \nbudget; we were only saving 4 or 5 months, but we wanted to use the \nmoney for something else for that 4- or 5-month period. I do not want \nto run that risk. I do not want to have the opportunity handed to an \ninternational terrorist that says the American Secret Service is \nunderfunded, the Forest Rangers and others involved with policing the \npublic lands have not been able to get their overtime in the right \nappropriations bill; we waited too late; the preparations were not \nmade; therefore, we had this event.\n  I respectfully suggest we reject the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona and, instead of having this money come in the 2002 bill, have \nit stay where it is now, in the supplemental bill. It will be easier to \nget a delay on some of these other things for 4 months, things that do \nnot have a firm time scale connected to them, than it will be to have \nthis money delayed for the Olympics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak against Senator \nMcCain's amendment to the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations \nlegislation. I fully appreciate the sentiment underlying this \namendment. The men and women of our Armed Forces deserve nothing but \nthe best in living conditions, pay, and working environment. I \nunderstand that this amendment would enhance the operations and \nmaintenance of the services. I have always supported legislation that \nprovides for our soldiers, airmen, and marines. However, I find that \none of the offsets to Senator McCain's amendment is totally without \nmerit.\n  I am vehemently against section 3003, paragraph (b) in Senator \nMcCain's amendment which reduces the salaries and expenses in the \nDepartment of Treasury by $30 million. The amendment does not address \nwhat the $30 million is for, but I will tell you this funding is for \nsecurity for the 2002 Winter Olympics. It pays the salaries and \nexpenses of law enforcement personnel.\n  Senator McCain's amendment seeks to add funding to the military that \nwould not dramatically improve our national security but the $30 \nmillion that he takes away from the Treasury Department's budget can \nhave a dramatic impact on safety at this international event.\n  For several years now we have worked very hard to ensure the public \nsafety of this major international event. The law enforcement budget \nhas been carefully planned, fully justified, and endorsed by this body. \nAny reduction to this budget would have a severe impact on the security \nof the Olympics and impose unacceptable risks. I am sure my colleagues \nagree that the safety of the Olympic athletes and spectators is of \nparamount importance, and a national responsibility when this Nation \nagreed to host the 2002 Olympic Games.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my serious concern \nabout a provision in Senator McCain's amendment which I believe would \nsignificantly undermine the commitment we made in the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, (TEA-21), to address our citizens' \nmobility needs. This provision would rescind funding for two crucial \nprograms run by the Federal Transit Administration: the Job Access and \nReverse Commute Program, and the Transit Planning and Research Program.\n  TEA-21 created the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program to provide \ntransit grants to assist states and localities in developing flexible \ntransportation services to connect welfare recipients and other low-\nincome people to jobs and other employment-related services. In \naddition, the program provides support for transportation services to \nsuburban employment centers from urban, suburban, and rural locations--\n``reverse commutes''--for all populations.\n  Even in a time of low unemployment, a person who cannot get to the \nworkplace cannot hold a job. Not everyone can afford access to an \nautomobile, especially those who are looking for employment. Public \ntransportation can be a vital component in helping these individuals \nleave the welfare rolls and enter the workforce.\n  In fact, investment in public transportation benefits all Americans. \nAs\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nthe numbers emerging from the 2000 Census show, the shape of America \nhas changed in recent years. The fact is that two-thirds of all new \njobs are now located in the suburbs, while much of the workforce lives \nin the city. For millions of Americans, transit is the answer to this \nspatial mismatch. And as cities and towns across America are \ndiscovering, public transit can stimulate the economic life of any \ncommunity. Studies have shown that a nearby transit station increases \nthe value of local businesses and real estate. Increased property \nvalues mean more tax revenues to states and local jurisdictions; new \nbusiness development around a transit station means more jobs.\n  I am therefore quite concerned to see that the McCain amendment would \ntake over $200 million away from transit programs. This amendment would \nbe a significant setback in our efforts to make transit services more \naccessible and improve the quality of life for all Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I rise today to further explain my \nopposition to the pending amendment offered by my good friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain. The Senator's amendment seeks to address \nworthwhile objectives such as providing for the operation and \nmaintenance of our armed forces and increasing funding for personnel \nneeds. I support these goals and believe they should be addressed.\n  However, the offset for this amendment troubles me for two reasons \nand it is because of these reservations that I cannot support the \namendment offered by Senator McCain. The first issue concerns the \nspecific funding recissions in the designated offset. For example, the \namendment rescinds $141,500,000 in Department of Labor funding \nearmarked for Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities and \nAdult Employment and Training Activities.\n  This funding is critical for my home State of Montana because we are \nin the midst of an energy crisis that has to date been responsible for \nover 1000 lost jobs. Retraining dollars are essential for helping these \nnewly laid-off workers develop new skills and learn new trades so they \ncan more quickly rejoin the workforce in a state that is already \nstruggling economically.\n  The second issue is the lack of separation between non-defense and \ndefense funding that this amendment proposes. The separation of defense \nand non-defense spending has served us well in meeting our nation's \nbudget priorities and making fiscally responsible decisions. Utilizing \nnon-defense funding to offset the additional spending of this amendment \nsets a precedent that I do not believe we should set. We should fund \nthe priorities, laid forth by Senator McCain, in a timely manner, but \nwe should not use existing funding in non-defense programs to \naccomplish our goal.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to provisions \nin the McCain amendment, and in underlying bill, S. 1077, which rescind \nfunds from programs supported under the Workforce Investment Act, \nincluding the Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Program and the \nAdult Employment and Training Activities.\n  The underlying bill rescinds funds from WIA in order to pay for \nimportant increases in funding for title I education services and Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. I support the need to increase \nessential funds for students in our highest-poverty schools and for \nlow-income individuals who are being hardest hit by increasing energy \ncosts. Indeed, I signed on in support of the increases for title I and \nLIHEAP. I do not think, however, we should increase funding for these, \ndefense or any other programs by taking money away from New York \nworkers at a time when these employment and training programs are most \nin need and are beginning to meet their potential.\n  At this time when upstate New York is facing more notice of layoffs, \nwe should not be cutting back our support for dislocated workers. Last \nyear, over 25,000 New York workers received notices warning them of \nlayoffs--an increase of over 7,000 workers from 1998.\n  Over the past several months, we have learned that hundreds of \nworkers at the Xerox facility in Webster, NY, will soon find themselves \nout of work; several hundred more New Yorkers who have spent years \nworking for Nabisco in Niagara Falls also recently received notice that \nthey would no longer have a job. Corning announced just yesterday that \nit will have to close three factories, resulting in a loss of nearly \n1,000 jobs.\n  At a time when we see signs of our economy weakening, this bill would \nreduce funds specifically designated to assist workers who are victims \nof mass layoffs and plant closures. With the rescission in the base \nbill alone, New York can expect to lose approximately 29 percent of its \ndislocated worker funds. I have received hundreds of letters from New \nYorkers--not only from concerned workers, but also from businesses who \nneed trained workers.\n  Why are my colleagues suggesting that we should rescind WIA funds at \na time when our economy is weakening and many of our workers will need \nthese critical funds to be retrained and relocated in new jobs?\n  They are claiming that States are not spending and obligating funds \nquickly enough. I agree. But, I also agree that States and local \ncommunities have made tremendous progress in implementing the Workforce \nInvestment Act.\n  Let's get the facts straight. States were not required to implement \nthe Workforce Investment Act until July 1, 2000. Beginning July 1, \n2000, States had 2 years to spend funds and were required to obligate \n80 percent of their funds. Many counties in New York are doing a \ntremendous job--Chautauqua County, for example, has obligated 95 \npercent of its dislocated worker funds, as well as 95 percent of adult \nfunds; the Town of Hempstead has allocated 90 percent of both its \ndislocated and adult worker funds; as has Erie County--all of which can \nexpect to lose funds under this rescission.\n  I do know that there are at least eight counties in New York that \nhave struggled in their implementation--working to get up to 19 Federal \npartners at the local level to offer services in One Stop training \ncenters--and, as a result have obligated 70 percent or less of their \nfunds. These counties need to do better and the State needs to do \nbetter in supporting their efforts. But, the way to do so is not to \ntake funds away from a fledgling program that is aimed to assist our \nworkers most in need of training and assistance.\n  I oppose these efforts to undermine the new Workforce Investment Act. \nI agree with accountability of Federal dollars, but I do not agree that \nwe should unnecessarily punish workers before allowing the program to \nget up and running.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone, may be mistaken. In fact, $359 million was rescinded in the \nHouse supplemental from the programs. I think he was inaccurate in his \nstatement that none was rescinded.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Utah may have to leave the floor. The \nSenator from Utah fails to mention that we have already shelled out \n$1.3 billion--``b,'' billion--in subsidies for the Salt Lake Olympics, \nfar more than any other Olympics in history, far more, for all kinds of \npet projects.\n  I asked 3 years ago, a simple request of the Senator from Utah, if he \nwould give us an assessment of how much in Federal dollars would be \nneeded. Of course, I never got an answer. In fact, we had a little \ndialog on the floor of the Senate.\n  Never once, never on any occasion has the Commerce Committee, of \nwhich I am the ranking member, had a request for authorization for \nfunds for the Salt Lake City Olympics--never once. Not on any single \noccasion, even though I have requested time after time, the committee \nof oversight that authorizes the funds and what may be required has \nnever, ever been approached.\n  Why not? Perhaps one of the reasons might be because we found out in \na GAO report that the taxpayers have shelled out $1.3 billion already \nfor the Salt Lake City Olympics for every kind of imaginable thing--I \nwill include the GAO report--every imaginable kind of project, none of \nwhich--or very little of which had to do with security. It had to do \nwith land acquisitions; it had to do with all kinds of things. Of \ncourse,\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nwe have never yet had a request for an authorization.\n  What do we find? We find a supplemental appropriations bill for $30 \nmillion for security. It sounds good. Why was the request not made a \nlong time ago? Perhaps, if the Senator from Utah had complied with the \nsimple request that I made as chairman of the oversight committee, that \nwe could get some kind of estimate as to how much it would cost the \ntaxpayers, we would not be going through this drill we are going \nthrough now.\n  I, again, urge the Senator from Utah to tell us how many of the \ntaxpayers' dollars are going to be needed to fund the Olympics, No. 1; \nand, No. 2, seek authorization through the authorizing committee for \nthose funds--which happens to be the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  I point out on this amendment that the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Department of Defense have not voiced objections. In the \ninterests of straight talk, they have not expressed support for this \namendment either. But there has not been any objection raised by the \nOffice of Management and Budget or by the Department of Defense to this \namendment. I hope Senators will take that into consideration.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 34 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I share many of the concerns that have \nbeen expressed by my colleague from Arizona. I am sure he understands I \njoin him in the desire that we assure the adequate protection and \nsupport for our men and women in the armed services. I do think the \namendment of the Senator is well intentioned. It is consistent with the \npriorities identified by Secretary Rumsfeld in his budget request for \nthe fiscal year 2002. That request provides for a substantial increase, \nwhich I shall discuss further, in defense spending, commencing with \nOctober 1 of this year--82 days away.\n  By the time this bill gets to the President, probably it will be 75 \ndays; by the time he signs it, it will be about 70 days; by the time \nthe money could be released by the OMB, and then released by the \nComptroller of the Department of Defense, that is about 60 days \nlater. So we are talking about the same time because their machinery \nover there is designed to follow through on the amendment that has \nalready been submitted by the Secretary.\n\n  I believe it is my duty to join the Senator from Hawaii, and others, \nin stating that we think this matter is better addressed in the fiscal \nyear 2002 Defense authorization and appropriations bills.\n  The Senator from Arizona talks about authorization. This matter is \nbefore the Armed Services Committee now. The Secretary has testified \nbefore that committee. They may come up with different priorities. I \nbelieve the Senator is right; we have a role in helping to determine \nthe priorities for defense spending.\n  We share that with the House of Representatives. Congress has the \npower of the purse. I do believe we should use it. But with the \nsituation going on now, Secretary Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs are \nworking on a comprehensive effort to redefine defense priorities. He \nhas submitted this amendment for 2002.\n  We are just now reviewing the details of the total request that was \nreceived just prior to the Fourth of July recess. I do not think there \nis any way we can determine the merit of Senator McCain's amendment \nuntil we better understand what the Secretary of Defense and the \nservices have presented to us in the amendment to the budget for 2002.\n  Several items in this amendment are likely to be accommodated in the \nDepartment's annual omnibus reprogramming. Every year, as we get down \nto this last quarter, the Department comes to us with reprogramming \nrequests which are approved, under existing law, by the Appropriations \nCommittees of both the House and the Senate. That shifts considerable \nmoney. We gave the Department of Defense, this year, through the \nDefense Appropriations Act, the authority to shift $2 billion from one \nfund to a fund of higher priority. We have to approve that, of course, \nbut that lifted the ceiling considerably. Annually, the Department \npresents to Congress reprogramming requests that shift from one purpose \nto an alternative higher priority. That is what we should do. We should \nlet the Department shift these funds and tell us where they want them \nshifted to, if they wish to do so.\n  But I am constrained to point out that the budget resolution for this \nfiscal year contains what we call a wall. It is a wall between defense \nand nondefense spending. The amendment by the Senator from Arizona \ncalls upon us to make moneys available from a substantial number of \nnondefense accounts for defense spending.\n  I want to assure you if the amendment were the other way around, \nsuggesting we should take money from defense and put it in nondefense, \nI am certain the Senator from Arizona would join me in vigorously \nopposing such an amendment. I think, in my role on the Appropriations \nCommittee, it is my duty to vigorously oppose this amendment because of \nthe attempt to shift money from nondefense accounts to defense accounts \nfor this fiscal year.\n  Later this month we are going to review the $330 billion spending \nproposal of the Department of Defense for 2002. I am sure that as a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain will work very \nhard on these matters. I am certain he will assist in determining \nwhether the priorities are correct as submitted by the Secretary, with \nthe approval of President Bush.\n  I do not believe we should shift funds from the nondefense priorities \nuntil we are certain that the funds are in excess of those programs' \nneeds. As a matter of fact, I do not think we should do it at all \nbecause that was our commitment, that we would keep a wall between \ndefense and nondefense spending. The budget resolutions for the last 4 \nyears--I believe 5 years--have spelled that out. And we have adhered to \nit. We, in the Appropriations Committee, have been quite clear about \nthat.\n\n  I have to confess, I did suggest that some of the defense moneys go \nto the Coast Guard, but I made that request because I believe they are \na semimilitary agency. They carry out some military functions, and they \nhave to have military equipment, military training, and military assets \non board their ships. But we have vigorously defended the concept of \nthe wall. Those people who vote for the McCain amendment are, for the \nfirst time, going to set the Senate on record as abandoning the concept \nof the wall.\n  I have asked the Parliamentarian if this is subject to a point of \norder because of this fact, and I have to ascertain that later. But I, \nfor one, believe in the wall because we put it up to protect defense \nspending, not the other way around.\n  I don't want to get political here, but in the last few years the \nPresident was not as much in favor of defense spending as the Congress, \nand therefore we protected the defense spending with the wall. I do not \nsee any reason now for us to turn around and renege on the commitment \nwe have made to protect that concept of separating defense and \nnondefense spending.\n  We should not shift these funds from other nondefense priorities. It \nis a matter of fact that there are substantial needs out there for the \nDepartment of Defense. I do not argue about that at all. I have to \nconfess, if I were the Secretary of Defense, I would be among those who \nwould be asking for even more than has the Secretary of Defense. I have \nevery reason to believe the Secretary of Defense has asked for more \nmoney than OMB has submitted to us because the OMB, with the overall \nproblem of controlling expenditures and meeting objectives in the \nnondefense area, has limited the Secretary of Defense in his request \nfor 2002. I think we understand that.\n  We are going to push that envelope as far as we can. But clearly the \nmoneys that have been requested now put this administration on record \nof requesting more moneys--I think almost $80 billion more--than the \nlevel of 2001 that will be spent in 2002 for defense. And that is--\nwhat?--less than 3 months away.\n  I really have objection to the McCain amendment because of where the \nmoney comes from. It cuts $41.5 million from the dislocated workers \nassistance program. It rescinds $100 million from the job training \nprogram. The committee bill already took some money\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\nfrom this dislocated workers program, but ours is from unexpended \nbalances of the program. This rescission takes it from the program, \nactually cuts job training programs for dislocated workers. And I will \nvote against that as a separate amendment.\n  Senator McCain's amendment also makes substantial reductions, \nsignificant reductions, in the international space station account. \nThis is at a time of extreme need. I have been spending some time \nlooking into the space program because of my extreme confidence in the \nAdministrator there and his demonstrated interest in pursuing the space \nprogram.\n  I am told the space program has some $4 billion in potential cost \noverruns already to meet the full promise of the first-class orbiting \nspace laboratory. The rescissions in this amendment would impact needed \nupgrades to the space shuttle, critical upgrades needed to ensure the \nsafety of our astronauts. I do not think we can afford to make a snap \njudgment because of a perceived need in the Department of Defense--\nperceived because I think those needs have been already met by the \nsubmission by the Department.\n  Why should we take moneys from the space account? We do not have any \njustification for that that I can find, that I can see. I think it is a \ncritical juncture now in the future of the space station. I believe we \nshould demonstrate our continued support for it.\n  There are a great many items in the Senator's amendment that disturb \nme. I hope other Members will take a look at it to see where these \nmoneys are coming from. They start on page 3 of the amendment. Not only \nare the funds reduced from the space account I just mentioned, there \nare funds from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nunder the heading ``Industrial Technology Services,'' that are reduced \nby $67 million for the Advanced Technology Program. There is another \n$19 million from the Department of Commerce for the International Trade \nAdministration. There are moneys that were provided under the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guarantee Loan Act.\n  I do appreciate the fact that the Senator has deleted the suggested \nreductions in the Maritime Guarantee Loan Program Account.\n  We also have a suggestion to take from the Department of Labor for \nthe Employment and Training Administration under the heading ``Training \nand Employment Services'' and for the dislocated worker account, as I \nmentioned, $41.5 million; adult employment and training activities, \n$100 million. Then from the Department of Transportation--here again, I \nthink this would be subject to a point of order--as I understand TEA-\n21, there is a wall in that, too. That money cannot be used for other \npurposes, but the amendment of the Senator from Arizona would take $90 \nmillion from the transit planning and research and $16 million from job \naccess and reverse commute grants under the Federal Transit \nAdministration.\n\n  All of this, to me, means that I appreciate the attempt of the \nSenator from Arizona to increase the amount of money for defense. If we \nhad money that would be free under the budget for 2001 as it exists \nnow, I would support the Senator's amendment to do so. But the \nSenator's amendment takes money from other accounts. I am being \nredundant now. These are nondefense accounts. And it takes the money to \nput it into the defense accounts to meet needs already covered by a \nbudget submission delivered to the Senate prior to the Fourth of July \nrecess which will for approximately the same time as this money could \nbe made available, it will be made available under the 2002 bill.\n  I cannot support it. I hope the Senate will not support the Senator's \namendment. At the appropriate time, I will make a motion to table the \nSenator's amendment. I do not wish to do so at this time because he \nstill has time remaining.\n  I ask how much time do I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 30 seconds. The \nSenator from Arizona has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

In February 2000, the SLOC revised this\n  request to $91 million. On March 3, 2000, FTA proposed a maximum contribution of $47.3 million for the 2002 Olympics and Paralympics. However, a\n  current bill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 4475, provides $56.8 million for Olympic buses and facilities and $9.5 million for the Olympic\n  Infrastructure Investment.\n\\5\\ Included in above for OTS.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It includes things such as land acquisition, Olympic \ninfrastructure, Olympic park-and-ride lots, light rail downtown to the \nUniversity of Utah, Olympic intelligent transportation system, commuter \nrail, intermodal centers, the list goes on and on of the $1.3 billion \nthat has already been spent before we tack some more onto this \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  I hope the Senator from Alaska will also work very hard to remove the \nnondefense appropriations from the defense appropriations bills.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut and reserve the \nremaining 4\\1/2\\ or 5 minutes for me before all time expires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby my friend from Arizona. I do so because I think this amendment makes \ntwo very important points. Those are points that have strength and with \nwhich I want to identify whether or not this amendment has any \npossibility of passing.\n  The two points are these: First, that we are not spending enough on \nour national security; second, Congress has recently adopted and the \nPresident has signed a tax cut package that will make it increasingly \ndifficult for us in the months and years ahead to find the resources to \nmeet the needs of our defense systems and structures and forces. Those \nare the two critical points.\n  We have in recent years tried in Congress, and succeeded on a \nbipartisan basis, to significantly increase the recommended budget \nlevels to sustain real growth in our defense spending. Beginning in the \nmid 1980s and going through about 2 or 3 years ago, every year spending \non defense dropped in real dollars. That was a peace dividend, people \nsaid. In fact, when you look at the constriction of spending in the \nFederal Government over the last decade or so, most of it comes at the \nexpense of defense; some of it obviously justified by the end of the \ncold war.\n  At the end of the cold war, America emerged in a very different world \nas the one superpower with extraordinary responsibilities for \nmaintaining the peace in our own interest and the world's interest \naround the world.\n  As I say, we began to turn that around. In real dollars we began to \nincrease defense spending 2 or 3 years ago.\n  Continuing this support must be a priority. We have to provide for \nimmediate needs in the fiscal year 2001 supplemental and to commit to \nfunding levels to maintain current readiness, as well as to modernize \nand transform our forces in the coming defense budget. I am deeply \nconcerned that if we do not, we may jeopardize our capacity to defend \nour interests here and abroad.\n\n  I have heard what my friend from Arizona has said. I couldn't agree \nwith him more about the statements made last year that ``help is on the \nway.'' In some sense, it appears that the check may have been lost in \nthe mail because although there are increases in defense in this \nsupplemental appropriations and in the budget President Bush has \nrecommended, they are inadequate to the needs of our defense. That is \nwhere I hope we in this body and Members of Congress, the other body, \nwill join together on a bipartisan basis to give the Department of \nDefense the funds it needs to protect us.\n  The defense supplemental for fiscal year 2001, as has been said, is \n$5.6 billion, which, as I understand it, is about half of the amount \nthat the service chiefs asked for. Although the fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequest from the administration is an increase, again, I don't think it \nis enough to meet our national security needs.\n  For instance, by my calculation, both procurement and research and \ndevelopment for the Army are less than that appropriated last year.\n  Navy procurement is lower by almost $2 billion than last year. As \nAdmiral Clark, the Chief of Naval Operations, testified at the Armed \nServices Committee today, we are now a 314-ship Navy and on a course to \nhead to 240 ships. It wasn't so long ago that we thought we needed 600 \nto protect us in the waters of the world. We are not meeting the needs \nof the Navy.\n  Air Force research and development, the investments in the ideas and \ntechnologies that will maintain our dominance in a high-technology \nworld are lower in this budget than they were last year.\n  It is all that which brings me to join with Senator McCain in this \namendment to make a statement not only about the short-term needs of \nthe military this year, which respectfully are inadequately met in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill, but also to raise an alarm about the \ninadequate funding in the budget submitted for fiscal year 2002 and \nabout the ever more difficult problems we will face in the years ahead \nas a result of the national resources that have been squandered in the \nadoption of a tax bill that gives most to the few and leaves little for \nthe broad national needs of our Nation.\n  This amendment adds $847.8 million to the amount requested by the \nPresident, a reasonable amount, mostly targeted toward short-term needs \nin the personnel and operation and maintenance accounts that must be \nfixed within the next 3 months. This is not extra, surplusage.\n  This money will be put immediately to critical national security \nuses, including $1 million to remove additional\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\nsailors and marines from food stamps--a national disgrace--and for the \nprotection of our forces in the Arabian Gulf. To do this, this measure \nincludes offsets. So it is, in that sense, balanced.\n  I realize that every dollar has an advocate and every cut here will \npain someone. In fact, some of them pain me. Senator McCain has chosen \nsome programs that I have supported and identified with. But the point \nis that there is a larger interest here, and that is that the short-\nterm military needs of our country are a higher priority now.\n  I believe the short-term military needs are a higher priority now. \nBut this, of course, is more than an issue of short-term spending. It \nis also a question of long-held values and responsibilities.\n  One of the most fundamental responsibilities we have under the \nConstitution is to provide for the common defense of our Nation. To \nfulfill that obligation, I am convinced we will have to significantly \nincrease defense spending over the next decade. This amendment is a \nsmall, but significant, step in that direction; immediately, it is a \nlarge statement of what is to come. I hope that together we will meet \nour obligations to our men and women in uniform and, therefore, meet \nour responsibility to provide for the common defense.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes under the Senator's \ncontrol.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The McCain amendment provides $848 million for defense that the \nPresident has not requested, is not assumed in the budget resolution \nand is not authorized. Many of the items that would be funded in the \nMcCain amendment will be considered as part of the annual DoD omnibus \nreprogramming request. DoD will cover many of these costs with their \nown offsets rather than through cutting non-defense programs.\n  Many of the non-defense offsets contained in the amendment are \nobjectionable:\n  Job training: The McCain amendment rescinds an additional $141.5 \nmillion from the FY01 job training funds, $41.5 million from dislocated \nworkers and $100 million from adult job training. This is in addition \nto the $217.5 million rescission already included in the bill. \nIncreasing the rescission above the $217.5 million risks actual cuts on \njob training services.\n  Security at Winter Olympics: The McCain amendment would cut $30 \nmillion from the Committee bill. The committee approved the funds to \nprovide security for participants and visitors to the 2002 Salt Lake \nCity Winter Olympics. The federal government is mandated under \nPresidential Decision Directive 62 to provide security for officially \ndesignated National Security Special Events. These funds were requested \nand fully paid for.\n  Advanced Technology Program: The amendment would rescind $67 million \nfrom the National Institutes for Standards and Technology Advanced \nTechnology Program. ATP is a valuable and well-managed innovation \nprogram. From the telegraph to the Internet to biomedical research, \ngovernment investment has spurred the development of new technologies \nand new fields, which have had great impact on and held enormous \nbenefit for the American people. According to the National Academy of \nSciences' National Research Council, ATP's approach is funding new \ntechnologies that contribute to important societal goals.\n  International Trade Administration, Trade Development: The amendment \nwould rescind $19 million. TD is responsible for negotiating and \nenforcing industry sector trade agreements such as these on autos, \ntextiles and aircraft. TD's mission is extremely important in the era \nof trade agreements such as NAFTA and the African Free Trade Agreement.\n  Oil/gas: $114.8 million has already been rescinded from the Emergency \nOil and Gas Loan Guaranteed Loan Program to help pay for the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act, RECA, and Global AIDS. This funding is no \nlonger available for rescission.\n  Steel: The amendment would rescind $126.8 million from the oil and \ngas and steel loan guarantee programs. The committee bill already \nrescinds $114.8 million from the oil and gas program. If the entire \n$126.8 million rescission came from the steel loan guarantee program, \nthen the ability of the steel loan guarantee board to help the steel \nindustry receive needed capital would be eliminated. This reduction \nwould come at a time when a record number of steel companies have filed \nfor bankruptcy (eighteen companies) and steel prices have fallen below \nlevels that prevailed during the depths of the 1998 steel crisis.\n  Access to Work: The McCain amendment would rescind over 80 percent of \nAccess to Work funding. This program has been very successful at \nstarting new programs at transit agencies to get welfare recipients to \nemployers that want to hire them. Many studies have shown that one of \nthe biggest problems in getting welfare recipients off the welfare \nroles and on to payrolls is transportation--getting them to work.\n  Antidumping: In the last 4 years, continued dumping or subsidization \nhas been found in roughly 80 percent of all administrative reviews \nconducted by the Department of Commerce. Industries affected include \nmany parts of agriculture, chemicals, consumer goods, industrial goods \nand components, and metals. The amendment would rescind $200 million \nfrom the Treasury program established last year to assist companies \nimpacted by unfair foreign trade practices. This rescission would \neliminate the program just when it is anticipated that the first offset \ndisbursements will be made by Customs toward the end of November 2001.\n  NASA: The amendment would rescind $40 million from Life and Micro-\nGravity research. In FY 2000, Congress fenced $40 million for a life \nand micro-gravity mission aboard the space shuttle. However, due to \ndelays in overhauling the Space Shuttle Columbia, and the need to \naccelerate the Hubble space telescope servicing mission, NASA was \nforced to reschedule the launch date May 2002. As a result of the \ndelay, the committee included bill language that lifts a restriction on \nthe use of the funds to give NASA the flexibility to reprogram the \nfunds for a Shuttle mission that will include a life and microgravity \nresearch experiment. Rescinding these funds will prohibit NASA from \nconducting a life and microgravity research experiment as directed by \nCongress, and put in jeopardy future research missions by threatening \nthe viability of NASA's contractor.\n  NASA electric auxiliary power units: The Senate should not rescind \n$19 million from the electric auxiliary power units. As part of the \nspace shuttle safety upgrades program, NASA initiated an effort to \ndevelop an electric auxiliary power unit in FY 2000 to upgrade the \nexisting power units to make them safer and more reliable. However \nafter the initial development phase, it became clear that there were \nsignificant technical hurdles that could not be overcome without a \nsignificant increase in the budget.\n  While this particular program was canceled by NASA, the overall Space \nShuttle Safety Program remains a top priority. NASA will redirect the \nremaining funds to address other key safety and reliability upgrades \nfor the space shuttle. There is no higher priority than protecting our \nastronauts.\n  Transit research and planning: The McCain amendment would virtually \neliminate funding for transit planning and research -$90 million, \nprovided in the FY 2001 Transportation Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will oppose and defeat the \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I gladly yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will someone get Senator McCain? He wanted \nto close. He has about 4 minutes remaining.\n  I want to spend a little time speaking tonight before we have these \nseries of votes. Floor staff has been kind enough to gather for me some \ninformation. Since the leadership has changed in the\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nSenate, we indicated we were going to try to stick to 15-minute votes \nand extend the time for 5 minutes, to make it a 20-minute vote, and \nwith 10-minute votes, extend it to 5 minutes to make it a 15-minute \nvote.\n  In the 13 days we have had votes, we have spent 179 minutes over \nthose times for a total of 3 hours. If one multiplies that out, over 1 \nmonth it will probably be about 5 hours. We are in session 9 or 10 \nmonths, so it is 45 or 50 hours we waste waiting for Senators to vote \nbecause committees are not adjourned in time--the excuses are \nunbelievable why Senators cannot get here within 20 minutes.\n  I hope everyone will respect other people's time. We are going to do \nour very best to stick to the 20-minute time limit. I have spoken with \nSenator Daschle. He agrees. Everyone will acknowledge that it is time \nwasted for everyone.\n  Since June 6, 179 minutes have been wasted. There are a lot of things \neach of us can do in 45 or 50 hours a year in wasted time. We, of \ncourse, could answer mail probably more precisely than we do if we had \nan extra 45 or 50 hours. We could review our mail more closely. We \ncould visit with constituents who come here. A lot of time we are \nwaiting for other Senators to vote and we are not able to see our \nconstituents or, if we do see them, we give them the bum's rush. We \ncould participate in congressional hearings more deliberately with an \nextra 45 or 50 hours. We could make telephone calls we simply do not \nhave time to make. We could do something such as go home and visit with \nour families and have dinner.\n  I hope everyone understands, there will be people who are going to \nmiss votes, but in fairness to everyone here, that is the way it has to \nbe. I hope committee chairs will allow members to leave early. It is \nvery difficult for us to say: Turn in the vote.\n  What we are doing is not partisan. Democrats and Republicans are just \nas responsible for the standing and waiting around. I wish it were just \nthe Republicans and we could blame them for it, but it is us. We are \njust as bad as they are.\n  There are going to be Democrats who will complain: Why did you \nterminate the vote? I had something real important to do. I was having \ndinner with my son; I was at a key point in the hearing. The excuses, \nmost of them, are very valid. But in fairness to all 100 Senators, we \nhave to have a time limit that is enforced.\n  I say that the staff, which is very good about this--they hate to \nturn in a vote when there are people not here because people yell at \nthem, but we need to move along and do this.\n  It is going to be bipartisan. We are going to do our best to make \nsure it is fair to everybody. Remember, we are talking about 50 hours a \nyear wasted just in not having our votes, not in 15 minutes, but in 20 \nminutes; not in 10 minutes--sometimes we have 10-minute votes--not \nhaving those votes in 10 minutes but 15 minutes. I am talking about the \ntime wasted over the 20-minute time limit.\n  I hope people will not be upset about this. I know some will. Maybe \nif we get in the habit of calling the votes on time, Senators will come \non time.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for yielding me time.\n  Senator McCain is not yet here. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains on the McCain \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes for the Senator from Arizona; 7 \nminutes for the opposition.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, Senator McCain asked to \nclose. What we could do is reserve his time and the motion to table and \ngo on to Senator Schumer to save time. Would that be appropriate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding the Senator from Missouri wishes \n5 minutes of the time in support of the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. REID. There are not 5 minutes. There are 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes left for Senator McCain.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will be glad to accord the Senator from Missouri 5 \nminutes of our time. The Senator is right; let's hold the time and let \nSenator Schumer start his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain \namendment be set aside, and that the 4 minutes be reserved for Senator \nMcCain and 4 minutes be reserved for Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, \nand we go to the Schumer amendment, which is the last amendment in \norder tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving that right to object, I wish the Senator would \nallocate that time to the Senator from Alaska. I have 2 minutes; \nSenator McCain has 4; the Senator from Missouri has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That will be taken from the Senator's time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify the request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 862\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 862.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe it is by the unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend, the Presiding Officer. Amendment No. \n862 is an amendment I have sponsored with Senator Reed of Rhode Island, \nSenator Reid of Nevada, Senator Dodd, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nCorzine, and Senator Johnson.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It rescinds in this emergency \nsupplemental $33.9 million for advance mailings from the IRS to the \nGeneral Treasury.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays if they have not been ordered. Have they \nbeen ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. I believe I have 15 minutes to debate \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Chair to notify me after I have consumed 7 of \nthose minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is a simple one. There is \nmoney in this supplemental appropriation to send out a notice within \nthe next week to 112 million taxpayers telling them they will get a \nrebate. The amendment is a simple one. It rescinds that money and gives \nit back to the committee. It does not spend it on any other specific \npurpose, but rather at this time when we are all desperate for money--\nwe just spent 2 hours on Senator McCain's amendment cutting money from \ndomestic programs so we can fund defense--this $33.9 million is needed.\n  Why do I think this money should be rescinded? Because the notices \nthey will fund are unnecessary, they are inappropriately political, and \nthey cost money that can be spent on other things, and I will talk \nabout each. Unnecessary. It makes no sense that we send each taxpayer a \nnotice that they are going to get a rebate. The rebate is self-\nexplanatory. It has been in all the newspapers. More people will have \nread it in their newspapers than a notice they get from the IRS. And \nif, indeed, we thought it so necessary to do, which I don't think we \nshould, it is certainly unnecessary to do it as a separate notice which \nwill cost all this extra money.\n\n  The idea that we have to notify taxpayers that they are getting a \nrebate doesn't make sense. We have never done it before--not in the \n1975 rebate, not when we have changed other tax laws. We have never \ndone it.\n  Second, I am against it because it is a political message. The \nmessage in this notification of the rebate says: We are pleased to \ninform you that the United States Congress passed, and President George \nW. Bush signed into law, the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation \nRelief Act of 2001 which\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\nprovides long-term relief for all Americans who pay income taxes.\n  It sounds to me a bit like a political ad. The IRS has always had a \nreputation for being apart from politics. When the IRS gets too \npolitical we try, justifiably, to pull it back. Yet here from the IRS \nis a notice. We don't send notices out to people when bad things \nhappen: We are happy to let you know because of laws that the President \nproposed and the Congress passed that you will get a lien on your \nproperty, that your property will get a lien because you haven't paid \nyour taxes. We just put on the lien. We don't send out notices about \nall the other changes in the law. We publish them in the Register and \nthen we go forward.\n  Finally, of course, I support this amendment because we are in very \ntough times. How many Americans would make it their highest priority to \nspend this $33.9 million on sending a notice of a rebate?\n  My colleague from Nevada, when I yield time to him, will give \nexamples of the alternatives on how we could spend the money. Clearly, \nthere are better purposes.\n  Secretary O'Neill wrote me that it wasn't feasible for mechanical \nreasons to include notification with the check itself. I take that to \nmean that, despite a quarter of a century of dramatic technological \nadvances and the impressive stewardship of Commissioner Rossotti, \nhailed as a world-renowned technology expert, the IRS is unable to get \ntwo pieces of paper into the same envelope--or less able than it was in \n1975 because they did it then.\n  Now, to boot, 523,000 taxpayers will receive an inaccurate notice, \nerroneously informing them that they will receive a larger rebate than \nthey will actually get. Some have said if we don't send this notice, \nthere will be lots of phone calls deluging the IRS. We are not in tax \nseason. I think they can handle the phone calls. I argue that knowing a \nsmall percentage of these notices are erroneous will trigger more phone \ncalls than if we didn't send this false message at all.\n  The bottom line is simple: We know why this mailing is being sent. We \nnow see political figures on television, Governors and mayors, putting \ntheir faces on, saying: Come to my State for tourism; or, sign up for \nour children's health care plan.\n  We all know what the purpose is, but never before has the Federal \nGovernment stooped to this level. And never before has the IRS, which I \nthink we all agree must remain above politics, been used for such a \nmessage. This notification is unnecessary and can be accomplished in \nother ways. It is political, in an agency which should remain above \npolitics. And it wastes a badly needed $33.9 million.\n  This amendment was narrowly defeated in the House. I hope this body \nhas its usual good sense, higher sense than the House, and passes this \namendment.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. We are hearing a great deal about politics in the debate \nregarding this amendment of the Senator from New York. We hear the \nnotices in the mail to inform taxpayers of the rebate checks are \nsomehow about ``politics.'' We hear the language used in a notice is \nabout politics.\n  Let me assure that the only thing that is about politics is the \namendment before the Senate. I make very clear the notices are being \nissued, being sent by Congress, because we gave that direction in the \nlegislation we passed. I read from the conference report of the \nrecently passed tax cut bill. Page 127 of the report says:\n\n       The conferees anticipate that the IRS will send notices to \n     most taxpayers, approximately one month after enactment. The \n     notices will inform taxpayers the computation of their checks \n     and the approximate date by which they can expect to receive \n     their check. This information should decrease the number of \n     telephone calls made by taxpayers to the IRS inquiring when \n     their check will be issued.\n\n  That is a quote from the conference report of the Congress of the \nUnited States, directing the Treasury Department to do what has been \nlabeled as pure politics. This is a statement of the conference report. \nThat is why these notices are being issued.\n  We are seeking to reduce confusion of taxpayers and minimize the \nburden on IRS employees. That is why the National Treasury Employees \nUnion, the union that negotiates with the Treasury Department, \nrepresenting those employees, supports the issuance of the letters \nbeing criticized.\n  I read from the last paragraph of the letter I have received from the \nNational Taxpayers Union:\n\n       On behalf of the employees of the IRS who are charged with \n     implementing the decisions of Congress with regard to the tax \n     code, I urge you to oppose efforts to cut funding for the \n     mailing of a notification to taxpayers with regard to their \n     tax rebates.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                             NTEU,\n\n\n                        The National Treasury Employees Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2001.\n       I am writing with regard to funding included in the FY 2001 \n     supplemental funding bill, H.R. 2216, that will allow the IRS \n     to mail notices to taxpayers informing them of the timing and \n     amount of tax rebate they will be getting. While NTEU has no \n     position on the wording of such notice, we strongly believe \n     that a notice will significantly reduce the amount of \n     telephone calls coming into the IRS with questions about the \n     tax rebate and ultimately reduce the costs associated with \n     administering the rebate.\n       The IRS already has great difficulty responding to all of \n     the telephone calls from taxpayers with questions. The volume \n     of calls will increase dramatically as anticipation of rebate \n     checks grows, thereby making it even more difficult for \n     taxpayers with other questions to get their calls answered. \n     Providing taxpayers with a notice in advance will hold down \n     the increase in calls and prevent a significant decrease in \n     the IRS' ability to provide customer service.\n       It is my understanding that the IRS has indicated that it \n     may go forward with a notice on the tax rebate even if funds \n     to mail it out are cut. Such a move would inevitably cause \n     erosion of customer service levels that are already suffering \n     from underfunding.\n       On behalf of the employees of the IRS who are charged with \n     implementing the decisions of Congress with regard to the tax \n     code, I urge you to oppose efforts to cut funding for the \n     mailing of a notification to taxpayers with regard to their \n     tax rebates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Colleen M. Kelley,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, these concerns about the impact on \nservices at the IRS are very real. The newsletter, Tax Notes, reported \non June 9, 2001, that when Minnesota issued rebate checks, the U.S. \nWest Company had to cut off phone service to the tax agency in \nMinnesota because the volume of calls brought down the system for the \nentire Minnesota State capital exchange.\n  In addition, notices are important to prevent taxpayers being subject \nto con games. The USA Today newspaper reported on July 5, 2001, that \ntaxpayers are receiving solicitations from con artists offering to \ncalculate their refund for $14.95. These letters being found fault with \nwill go far in preventing frauds and cons such as reported in USA \nToday.\n  Some want no notices at all sent, and some want the words of the \nnotice changed. Why are they upset? Because the letters start out by \nmentioning that we, the Congress, passed a bill that cuts taxes--the \nbill that provides long-term tax relief for all Americans who pay \nincome taxes and was passed by the Congress, in fact, and was signed by \nthe President of the United States.\n  That is the only way you increase or decrease taxes. It is not done \nby some magic wand being waved by somebody in Washington, DC. But this \ncomes as a shock, supposedly, to my colleagues. Some people are a \nlittle too busy with their lives to be thumbing through the \nCongressional Record after work, like maybe we do, but our constituents \ndon't do this.\n  So this letter provides a little overview and guidance, so people \nhave some contact as to what the letter discusses.\n  It should be clear this is not the first time the President by name \nhas been mentioned in some IRS notice. For example, a little less than \n2 years ago the IRS sent out a notice mentioning President Clinton. Can \nyou believe that? They sent out a notice mentioning President Clinton.\n  I have searched the Congressional Record in vain to find any \ncomplaints from any Senator about that specific notice.\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n  Also, if this notice were only about politics, why would the \nadministration also send out a notice to 32 million taxpayers, \ninforming them they will not receive a refund check? That hardly seems \na political thing to do. It is said we often find our own faults in \nothers.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not think I will yield. The last time I yielded to \nyou on the bankruptcy bill I did not get through my speech. I want to \nfinish my speech and then if you want to ask me a question, I will do \nit.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. A 10-second question.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, I will not, please. I appreciate the man, he is a \nfriend of mine, and I do not have any ill will towards him, but I just \ndo not want to yield at this point.\n  Would I suggest this amendment is about politics? I could not suggest \nthis amendment is about politics. But here is what we have to do. We \nhave to think of the reality of it. We are trying to make Government \nwork. When you are sending out $60-some billion in checks, you want to \nmake sure they go to the people they are supposed to go to, and you \nwant to know that the people know this is happening and what they are \nsupposed to do with it.\n  Some suggest we should have the notices, but the wording should be \nchanged. As stated earlier, I believe the wording is important to \nbetter inform taxpayers. Further, to rewrite and reprint the notice \nwill cost millions of dollars and delay the notices by weeks. Delay \nwould undermine the whole point of the notice: To better inform the \npeople prior to checks being issued.\n  Remember, you want to get the checks out on time because of the \nstimulus benefit that comes from this. That is not just my saying this \nas a Republican because you want to remember, the last week of March \npeople on the other side of the aisle said we ought to have an \nimmediate tax rebate to help the economy. So that is something we both \nagreed ought to be done.\n  This notice, the Treasury Department informs me, will actually be \ncost-effective. If there is no notice, the IRS will be flooded with \ncalls and will not be able to perform other valuable and important \nactivities. The language regarding notices is in the conference report \nbecause of concerns about the impact of issuing checks on IRS \noperations.\n  Finance Committee staff has met with the Treasury Department several \ntimes to ensure that the notice and check effort is performed with \nminimal trouble.\n  In addition, Senator Baucus and I have asked the GAO to oversee the \nnotice and check effort to ensure it is properly managed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to a cosponsor of the \namendment, the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New York \nfor the fiscal responsibility he is exhibiting with this amendment. The \namount of money to be saved, again, is $34 million, roughly? Mr. \nPresident, $34 million--this is astonishing, $34 million to send out a \nmailing? This doesn't pass the laugh test, frankly.\n  If I were to go home to my home State of South Dakota and talk to \npeople in the street to tell them we are going to send some checks--by \nthe way, which I voted for; I voted for the stimulus package, but we \nare going to add $34 million to the cost, from the taxpayers, to brag \nabout what we did in advance--they would not know whether to laugh or \nwhether to cry.\n  This is just astonishing, $34 million for a mailing. Are we going to \ndo this now when we do Patients' Bill of Rights? Are we going to send \nout a $34 million mailing? How about ag disaster payments? What else \nare we going to pass this year about which we are going to send out to \neverybody in the country what a wonderful job we are doing for them, \nthanks to your dollars?\n  Here we are in this body talking about, well, it doesn't look as if \nwe can afford to do as much as we should with school construction; \nprobably not enough money to advance Head Start where it ought to be; \nour GI bill enhancement, where we are trying to catch up with inflation \nso our military can get the education opportunities they should have, \nwe might not have the money; prescription drugs, we probably do not \nhave enough to set aside to do what we need to do. But wait, we are \ngoing to take $34 million of your money and send you a letter telling \nyou what fabulous things we are doing for you.\n  I don't know whether or not it is political. What I care about is if \nyou are going to carefully mind the people's money, this is not how you \nought to go about doing it.\n  I congratulate the Senator from New York for a little common sense, \nsomething I see all too seldom in the course of some of these political \ndebates.\n  Thank you to the Senator from New York. It seems to me this amendment \ndeserves support. Let's save $34 million, put it back in the kitty \nwhere the American people can have it for their benefit.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 6 minutes, or the remainder of my time, to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator who is just leaving the floor \nneeds to know that $34 or $33 million represents about 30 cents a \nletter. I think both he and I wish we could send out any kind of \ncampaign solicitation for 33 cents or 30 cents a letter. It seems to be \na pretty efficient operation to me. But here is what the IRS is saying \ntoday. Even though the Senator from New York is talking politics, the \nIRS is talking fraud. The IRS is talking scam. The IRS is trying to \nwarn the American taxpayer, who may or may not receive a rebate check, \nthat they better beware that there is somebody out there who wants to \ntake $14 or $15 or $20 of their money.\n  Let me refer to a scam operation known as Revenue Resource Center in \nBoca Raton, FL. Send in your check for $12.95 and an extra $2, and we \nwill calculate for you what your rebate is going to be.\n  The IRS is already going to calculate for you what your rebate is \ngoing to be. The Senator from New York knows that. What the Senator \nought to be saying is: Bravo, IRS, you may be stopping a multi-\nmultimillion-dollar scam operation.\n  The IRS has identified scams in four other States: in Mississippi, \nMissouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma, and they are anticipating there will be a \ngood many others before this is over with.\n  What does the IRS do in its letter? Not only does it say the Congress \nand the President provided this, on an effort on their part, but it \nsays here is how the calculation was made. If you have a question, make \na phone call. Here is the phone number.\n  That sounds pretty responsible to me. I suggest that is the kind of \ngovernment we ought to have. Is it political? I don't think it is. The \nSenator from Iowa mentioned that President Clinton was mentioned in an \nIRS letter. I have a copy of that IRS letter. Bravo. Bravo. Whether we \ntake credit for it--in fact, it was the Senator from New York who, in \n1995 said: When you do something you ought to tell your constituent \nabout it. So he quoted himself in the New York Daily News.\n  Is there anything wrong with what is going on? There is nothing wrong \nwith what is going on, in fact. I think what the Senator from New York \nand I know is you take this form right here; it is called 2001 Form 16-\nD. It looks like an official IRS form. Let me tell you it is a scam \nform provided by this group from Boca Raton, FL.\n  Right here it says:\n\n       Processing fee $12.95. Rush service add $2. Total payment \n     [$14.95].\n\n  If you got $14.95 from a few hundred thousand or a few million \ntaxpayers, my guess is you walk away with a bundle because you have a \nmailing address and you have a computer and you have a printer.\n  What the IRS is saying when they notify the taxpayer is: You are \ngoing to get your check and here is how it is going to be calculated.\n  They are even saying to some taxpayers: You are not going to get a \ncheck, and here is why you are not going to get a check.\n  My guess is this may have a lot less to do with politics, at least \nfrom the standpoint of the IRS, and a great deal more to do with \nefficiency of government. But most important, should not\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nwe go the extra step so we avoid the scams that the great genius of the \nhuman mind creates when they see an opportunity to take advantage of an \nolder person, or an innocent person who might be concerned that somehow \nthey are not going to get their appropriate check? So they are going to \nfill out this form and send it in to a group in Boca Raton, FL?\n  That is what the issue is all about. So we are going to use $34 \nmillion at a cost of about 30 cents a letter to about 130 million \nAmericans to notify them that all the information they need is right \nthere available to them, even how their check was calculated, and all \nof that is going to be made available by the IRS. And, oh, by the way, \nyes, you are right, Senator from New York. The front paragraph says: \nAnd this tax relief was provided for you by the Congress--I believe \nthat is Democrat and Republican--and by the President of the United \nStates, George W. Bush.\n  Let's stop the scam artists. Let's notify the American people when \nthey are going to get it, how they are going to get it, and how it is \ncalculated. It seems like the right thing to do--not the political \nthing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the cosponsor of \nthis legislation, the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this legislation has nothing to do with \nscams. It has nothing to do with partisan politics. It has everything \nto do with saving $34 million of taxpayer money.\n  As the Senator, for whom I have the greatest respect, and the 19 \nmembers of the Finance Committee say, this will provide a little review \nand guidance. Yes, it will, for $34 million.\n  There are a lot of domestic programs in need of funding. Thirty-four \nmillion dollars would do so much for education. We could do something \nthat deals with dropouts. Three thousand children are dropping out of \nschool every day.\n  We could do something about the national treasure of Nevada and \nCalifornia called Lake Tahoe. It is deteriorating every day because of \npollution. We could stop it if we had the money. It is a program that \nwe need to help. There are water systems all over America, in rural \nAmerica, that need help. We could do part of that with this money.\n  Our Nation is facing an energy shortage. The Energy and Water \nSubcommittee will fight for money to provide research and development \nfor energy. Thirty-four million dollars would mean a lot to our \nsubcommittee.\n  We ought do so many things.\n  Veterans: There has been a cutback in the veterans' budget this year \nby $30 million. We could take $343 million and provide help to the \nveterans. Grants are provided to the States for extended care \nfacilities, specifically talking about veterans.\n  On Medicare prescription drugs, we could do a little bit. But that \nwould certainly be something we could do.\n  Senator Chafee and I have a bill that gives centers of excellence $30 \nmillion a year so they can study links between breast cancer and the \nenvironment. That is certainly more important than a $34 million notice \nthat is going to go out.\n  There are disasters happening all the time. We used to have $250 \nmillion for Federal safe project impact grant programs. That was \ndeleted. It is wrong. The State of Washington found out how much that \nprogram helped.\n  This is something for which I don't blame the President. I don't \nblame the Finance Committee. I don't blame anybody. I think what we \nshould do, though, is recognize that dollars are very scarce. We should \ndo everything within our power to provide additional money for the \nprograms that are desperately needed; $34 million would do that. It is \nmore than the letter that would give a little bit of review and \nguidance, as my friend from Iowa said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 3 minutes 5 seconds. The \nopposition has 1 minute, 17 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator from North Dakota wish a minute?\n  I will reserve the remainder at the conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to support the amendment. I don't \nknow how it got to this point. But I was a tax administrator before I \ncame to the Congress. It is not, in my judgment, necessary to send out \na letter to say: By the way, here is what you are going to get. And \nthen you get it. Maybe afterwards they will send a letter to them \nsaying: Here is what you got.\n  That doesn't make any sense to me. It is $34 million. There are a \nwhole host of important things that can be done with $34 million.\n  The tax bill stands on its own. It was passed. It is now law. The \nAmerican people will be receiving a rebate. There does not need to be a \nsubstantial amount of money spent to tell them: By the way, this is \nwhat you will get in the mail very shortly. Send the check in the mail. \nThey would be much more appreciative of receiving the check than \nreceiving a letter saying they are going to get a check. Do not send \nthem a letter saying they are going to get a check. They will get a \ncheck. And maybe people will come to the floor asking to send them a \nletter saying they got a check.\n  None of this makes sense. This doesn't pass the test. Let's not do \nthis. This is a waste of money.\n  I will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it not the case \nthat we must finish the Schumer amendment before we go back to the \nMcCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator from New York willing to yield the \nremainder of his time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No. Mr. President, I believe I have 2 minutes. I would \nlike to conclude. If the other side would like to use their 1 minute \nremaining, I would then yield. I will wait for them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  There are three things to remember:\n  Remember that the union members working this issue for the Treasury \nDepartment to make sure the Government's work is done right and done on \ntime said it is very important that these notices be mailed out. That \nletter is a matter of record and is printed in the Record.\n  No. 2, remember that Congress ordered these letters to be sent. It is \na conference report from which I have already quoted. But remember we \nsaid that.\n  No. 3, these letters are already printed and in the envelopes. There \nwas a lot of labor put into this process. There was a lot of effort put \ninto it. If you want to waste that money, you waste that money by \nvoting for this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, in reference to the debate we have \nheard, give me a break. This letter, if you read it, is not going to \nreduce fraud. In fact, if we want to reduce fraud, we contain it right \nwith the check--not a letter that people are going to read through a \nmonth and a half in advance and then get the check. That is a bogus \nargument.\n  Second, President Clinton put his name on the notice that was on 527. \nThe letter of the Secretary of the Treasury is wrong. All that was \nprinted in the Record. President Clinton did not send out 112 million \npieces of paper bragging about what he was going to do.\n  The bottom line is simple. We all know what is going on here. This is \nnot an attempt to help the taxpayers; this is an attempt to pat \nourselves on the back because we did something good. We could spend \nbillions of dollars doing that. We all know that the same goal could be \naccomplished by putting the same notification in the same letter as the \ncheck. We are not doing that either.\n  At a time, I appeal to my colleagues, when we are scrounging around \nfor $5 million here and $10 million there, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member are trying their best \nas the members of the\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\ncommittee to find the dollars we need, give me a break. This is not the \nbest, the second best, the third best, the hundredth best, or the \nthousandth best way to spend $34 million to send a notification patting \nourselves on the back that you are going to get a rebate check and \nthere is going to be a long-term tax reduction. It is an absurdity.\n  If any of us cares about fiscal responsibility and balancing the \nbudget, we will vote for this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired.\n  The question occurs on the McCain amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona withholds 4 minutes. The Senator from \nMissouri withholds 5 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Alaska is \ngiving time to the Senator from Missouri. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is correct--in order to accommodate \nthe Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the McCain amendment. \nOur military has a number of pressing needs that simply are not being \nmet this year. I have seen this first hand in my home State of \nMissouri. Senator McCain has done the hard work by requesting that \nFederal agencies identify funds that are not being spent in this fiscal \nyear. These funds should be available and can be put to good use for \nbasic military operations and supplies.\n  This amendment will provide $200 million for quality-of-life \nimprovements for our military personnel, $600 million for operations \nand maintenance of our military equipment, and $45 million for force \nprotection of our fleet in the Arabian Gulf. Senator McCain has \nidentified these needs, and he has uncovered the resources to relate to \nthem.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a couple minutes to speak. I know \nothers have spoken at length about this underlying supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  I say to the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Missouri yielded \nme her remaining time.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from Hawaii. It is a hard job. It is not easy. We are \ntalking 80 days. And those days are shrinking as long as we take to \nresolve this in the supplemental.\n  There are a number of amendments that have been offered that under \nnormal circumstances I would probably support. The LIHEAP amendment is \na very important amendment for those of us who come from the Northeast. \nI find many down the list that are very appealing.\n  I think our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have done a \ngood job. I do not suggest that my good friend from Arizona, and \nothers, are not making a good case that additional resources may be \nnecessary to help our service men and women to improve equipment, but \nit seems to me that we are just a few days away from dealing with a \nlarger issue, the budget issue, in which these matters could be \naddressed. So when it comes to the pending amendment, I am going to \nreject the additional spending that is being proposed and support the \ncommittee's desire to adopt this supplemental, if we can.\n  I notice, as well, there are arguments being made that some of these \nfunds have been unexpended. I appreciate that. That is true. That is \nthe case, but it is also the case that we are not yet at the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  One of the things I want to see us discourage is agencies rushing out \nto spend dollars so that they will not face the kind of arguments they \nget here, where we are a few months away from the end of the fiscal \nyear and we start demanding that agencies spend money quickly because \nan amendment may be offered to take any unexpended funds. That is \nirresponsible spending, it seems to me.\n  So there are a number of areas here that are being targeted as \nresources to pay for some of these amendments that I hope my colleagues \nwill take some note of.\n  Worker training is one. Again, all of us understand the benefits of \nworker training. We have just heard news in the last few days that \nthere has been a loss of some 125,000 jobs in the month of June alone \nin the United States. I do not need to tell anyone in this Chamber how \njob training and worker training programs can make a difference for \nthose people. Those people getting new jobs, getting the skill levels, \nalso contribute to the strength of America. Certainly, the job access \nprogram is another one that has been tremendously helpful to so many \nmillions of Americans across the country.\n  So while all the money has not yet been expended in job access or job \ntraining programs, we are still several months away from the end of the \nfiscal year. In light of some of the new unemployment figures, those \ndollars may be very necessary before the end of the fiscal year.\n  So again, my compliments to those on this committee crafting this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is not perfect. They have not \nargued it is perfection. But I think it has done a good job in \nproviding additional resources for our military needs. And, in the \nweeks to come, we will be given the opportunity to debate the \nauthorization bill and the appropriations bill for the coming fiscal \nyear, at which point we can best address the matters raised in this \ndebate.\n\n  So my hope would be that my colleagues would applaud the work of the \nAppropriations Committee here and adopt this supplemental bill. The \ntemptation to support a number of these amendments is strong. But I \nthink we ought to resist that temptation and support the work of this \ncommittee, and then get about the business of dealing with the various \nappropriations bills as they come to this Chamber.\n  If there is any time left, I will be glad to yield it to those who \nmay want to debate this amendment further. But if not, I would yield \nback whatever time may remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have 4 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to simply urge the support of my \ncolleagues for the amendment that my colleague, Senator McCain, has \nbrought forward. We have to care about the lives and the safety, as \nwell as the ability to carry out the mission that we have entrusted to \nthem, of the young men and women in our military.\n  What Senator McCain is doing is nothing more than taking the word of \nthe military--the chiefs and the other military leaders of our \ncountry--about what they need, and providing a small amount of that as \na part of this supplemental appropriations bill--$847 million worth.\n  All of that money is offset from programs, frankly, that either can \nbe deferred or from funds which are not going to be spent before the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year. So there is very little in terms of \nloss of any program from the offsets. But this money would make a huge \ndifference to the men and women of our military, if we can get it into \nthe pipeline before October 1.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the amendment of Senator McCain \nto help the folks in our military and enable them to do the job we have \nentrusted them to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself what time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I outlined in some detail the testimony of \nthe service chiefs last September: The need for $30 billion more than \nthe current defense budget dollars. In a few days, the Department of \nDefense will come over with a reprogramming request. That will be for \n$850 million, which is really what this request is all about.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  What is a reprogramming request? It is a requirement to take money \nout of one category and put it into another because the wheels are \nabout to come off. They are going to have to take money from existing \nprograms and put it into what this amendment is all about: Personnel, \nreadiness, operations and maintenance, and the lives of the men and \nwomen in the military. This amendment puts money in the right accounts, \nand that is readiness and personnel.\n  Nothing is more important than the men and women in the military and \nnational defense. The Department of Treasury salaries and expenses \nisn't more important than defense. The NASA Shuttle Electric Auxiliary \nPower Units are not more important than defense. The Life and Micro-\nGravity Science Research is not more important than defense. The \nAdvance Technology Program is not more important than defense. The Job \nAccess & Reverse Commute Grants Program is not more important than \ndefense, nor is Export Promotion Programs or Emergency Loan Guarantees.\n  Nothing is more important than the security of this Nation. I hope \nthis modest amendment, which does have offsets, will be agreed to by \nthis body. It does not have an objection from the Office of Management \nand Budget nor from the Department of Defense.\n  So, Mr. President, the men and women of our military are suffering. \nThey need help. I promised them that help during the last campaign. \nThis is one very small way of beginning to deliver.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to point out to the \nSenate that part of the Budget Act gives us the power, in the \nAppropriations Committee, to make allocations to specific portions of \nthe budget. We have 13 separate bills.\n  The allocation to the Defense Department under the Defense \nappropriations bill for 2001 I made when I was chairman--and Senator \nByrd from West Virginia has modified that slightly, but it is still a \nlimitation--it is a limitation that prevents us from transferring money \nfrom one bill to another without the consent of the Senate.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona would increase the amount \nallocated to the Department of Defense for 2001 in excess of the \ncurrent budget allocation that both Senator Byrd as chairman, and I, \nwhen I was chairman, submitted to the Senate. The amendment by the \nSenator from Arizona has the unfortunate consequence of exceeding our \nallocation.\n  I make a point of order against the McCain amendment under section \n302(f) of the Budget Act. If adopted, this would exceed the allocation \nfor the Department of Defense for 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am deeply, deeply disturbed that the Senator from \nAlaska would not allow an up-or-down vote on this amendment, which is \npaid for--which is paid for. And if we are going to play that kind of \nparliamentary game, the Senator from Alaska can plan on a lot of fun in \nthe ensuing appropriations bills.\n  I move at this point to waive all points of order that may lie \nagainst this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I raise a question about this.\n  All points of order?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That may lie against this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: Is that in order under the Budget \nAct? This is a specific point of order. There are other points of order \nI may want to try, too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are other points of order, and I might want to try \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may make a motion to cover all \nBudget Act points of order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second. The vote will be \ndelayed under the current sequence.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of general debate on the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, don't we have a managers' amendment still \non the agenda?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now that Senator McCain's time has expired, that is in \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate at this time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 876\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall send to the desk a managers' \namendment. It consists of a package of amendments. These have been \ncleared on both sides, and I believe there is no controversy on them.\n  The first items are amendments by Senator Stevens, Senator Lincoln, \nand Senator Hutchinson for storm damage repair and relief in Arkansas \nand Oklahoma and emergency response and firefighting needs in Alaska. \nThe amendment provides a total of $26,500,000 with the necessary \noffsets.\n  The next amendment is offered by Senator Inhofe concerning the \nEducation Impact Aid Program. No additional funds are involved.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Boxer to provide $1,400,000 for the \nso-called ``sudden oak death syndrome''. This is from within existing \nfunds in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Next is an amendment by Senators Dorgan and Conrad to provide $5 \nmillion for emergency housing for Indians on the Turtle Mountain Indian \nReservation in North Dakota. It, too, is fully offset.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator McConnell making a slight \nmodification in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram Act. No funding is involved.\n  Next is an amendment to establish the new Senate committee ratio for \nthe Joint Economic Committee as a result of the recent change in the \nSenate majority. This requires an amendment to the underlying law;\n  An amendment concerning the B-1 bomber for Senators Roberts, Miller, \nCraig, Cleland, Crapo, and Brownback;\n  An amendment for Senator Patty Murray and Senator Cantwell providing \n$2 million for drought assistance in Yakima Basin in the State of \nWashington. It is fully offset.\n  Finally, an amendment by myself to provide $5 million for providing \nrelief from the severe recent flooding in my State of West Virginia. \nThis amendment is also fully offset.\n  Over the last several days and nights, thousands of West Virginians \nhave been digging out from the mud and muck left behind from severe \nflooding over the weekend.\n  Throughout southern West Virginia, especially, the rain fell hard and \nfast, dropping 8 inches of rain across the region before the clouds \nfinally let up. By then, the damage was done. The Guyandotte River was \nmeasured at 18 feet at Pineville, 5 feet above flood stage and above \nthe 1977 record of 17.76 feet. The Tug Fork was at 17.5 at Welch, 7.5 \nfeet over its banks and more than 4 feet above the previous high.\n  It is an almost indescribable scene for many families who have \nwatched their homes and their belongings washed away by the torrent of \nflood waters. For many families, this latest flood comes just a few \nweeks after they finished cleaning up from May's heavy rains that \nprompted a Federal disaster declaration from President Bush.\n  Today West Virginia's streams, creeks, and rivers are carrying \nrefrigerators, stoves, cars, and trucks. Tree branches are filled with \nruined clothing and debris. Water and sewer systems are washed out. \nRoads and bridges are buckled. Power is out. More than 3,000 homes have \nbeen damaged or destroyed.\n  In the McDowell County town of Kimball, the community is covered with \nthick mud. One woman described it aptly when she said: ``This whole \ntown is gone.''\n  For everyone, there is a feeling of disbelief at the devastation. But \nthere is also a strong determination to recover.\n  In an effort to speed Federal assistance, the managers' amendment \ncontains $5 million to boost the recovery effort. This is the amount \nthat the Natural Resources Conservation Service has stated that it \nneeds to remove debris and obstructions to waterways that pose a threat \nto private property or human safety. This is just a small step in the \nrecovery process, but it is an important step to make.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\n  I personally thank the thousands of National Guardsmen, local \nfirefighters, sheriffs' departments, police officials, Red Cross \nvolunteers, State Office of Emergency Services personnel, and the \ncountless others who have worked to save lives over the last few days. \nTheir efforts have helped to prevent this disaster from taking an even \nlarger tool on West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 876.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nbe considered en bloc.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am asking that they be considered, not adopted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. I want the amendment read.\n  Mr. BYRD. I didn't understand the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want the continued reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted. The clerk will continue \nthe reading of the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk continued the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the reading of the \namendment. The clerk will continue the reading of the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk continued the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the point of order against the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona be withdrawn and insert in lieu \nthereof a motion to table the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back time on the \nmanagers' amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the name of Senator Patty Murray was \ninadvertently omitted from the sponsorship of the $2 million drought \nassistance in the State of Washington. I add that name at this time. So \nit will read: An amendment by Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell \nproviding $2 million for drought assistance in the Yakima Basin in the \nState of Washington. It is fully offset. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Murray's name be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be amended to add a million dollars for FEMA for the \ndisaster storm Allison. I will present an amendment to the desk in \nwriting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I object. Is the amendment debatable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has 5 minutes under the time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes in general debate \ntime. He may use it now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is this concerning \nthe amendment on the B-1 that is included in this, or is this in \naddition to the 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Byrd has 5 minutes of general debate \non the bill. There are 5 minutes evenly divided between the two \nmanagers on the managers' amendment. Senator Byrd has 5 minutes in his \nown right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On the managers' amendment, none of us had ever seen it. \nIt was just presented. I notice that it is now an emergency for an \nadditional amount for State and private forestry, $750,000 to the Kenai \nPeninsula Borough Spruce Bark Beetle Task Force for emergency response \nand communications equipment, and $1.75 million to be provided to the \nmunicipality of Anchorage for emergency firefighting equipment and \nresponse to respond to wildfires in Spruce bark beetle-infested \nforests. Provided, that such amount shall be provided as direct lump \nsum payments within 30 days of enactment of this act.\n  That is an unusual amendment. There are forest fires all over the \nWest, including in my State. But, again, here is a managers' amendment \nworth many millions of dollars which none of us had seen or heard \nabout, but we will go ahead and pass it by a voice vote.\n  On the issue of the B-1, I believe very strongly that what we are \ndoing is micromanaging the Department of Defense. The amendment is led \non this side. I think the communications could have been and should \nhave been established with the Secretary of Defense. I believe strongly \nthat this amendment, which is going to be accepted, will not allow the \ntransfer of one B-1 bomber from one base to another--not one will be \nallowed to be transferred from one to another.\n  The sponsors of the amendment at least removed the preparation and \nplanning clause that was also preventive. I think it is a very \ndangerous precedent for us to start at the beginning of a new \nadministration and pass an amendment that says not one single airplane \nthat is a B-1 can be transferred from one place to another. Yes, there \nshould have been better communications. Yes, the affected Senators \nwhose bases have B-1 bombers in that State should have been better \ninformed. All of those things.\n  But for us to act in this Draconian fashion is something I think sets \na very bad precedent. We all know the Department of Defense needs to be \nrestructured and reorganized. This message being sent by this \namendment--don't tamper with our planes in our State--is not the right \nmessage to begin this very important period of restructuring and \nreorganizing our Nation's national security capabilities.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nworking with us on the amendment he has just discussed. It is a \nquestion of notification. We have not blocked--nor would we want to \nblock as a Senate--the ability of this Defense Department to plan. What \nwe do want them to do is plan with us in the process. We think the \nnotification point does that, and the amendment directs this in that \norder.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmanagers' amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 876) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \namendments be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will file the amendment I referred to \nfor the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed that we have just made an \nerror. I ask unanimous consent that in section 210(f) of the managers' \namendment the figure ``$38.5 million'' be ``$39.5 million.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 48, after line 3, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n         ``federal emergency management agency disaster relief\n\n       ``For necessary expenses in carrying out the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), $1,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended for costs related to tropical storm Allison.''\n       On page 14, after line 25, insert the following:''\n       ``Sec. 2106.

All time is yielded back.\n  The question recurs on the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. \nThere are 5 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my amendment takes $150 million and \nadds it to LIHEAP. This is a lifeline program for low-income families, \nmany of them with disabilities, many elderly, many working poor with \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, right now, only about 13 percent of households are \nable to benefit because this program is so severely underfunded. The \nmoney comes from administrative expenses in the whole Pentagon budget. \nIt does not come from any programs. It does not come from readiness or \nquality of life for our armed services. It comes out of administrative \ninefficiencies, and believe me, from inspector general to the General \nAccounting Office, there is way more than $150 million when it comes to \nadministrative inefficiency.\n  A study by the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association says \nthat 28 States and the District of Columbia are out of money or about \nto run out of money. These are our States that are telling us: We do \nnot have the money for cooling assistance this summer; we do not have \nthe money to help for those in arrears and could be faced with utility \nshutoff; we do not have the money as we approach this winter.\n  Last year, energy prices went up 40 percent. The very least we can do \nis to give this program, which is so important to the most vulnerable \ncitizens in this country, an additional $150 million to help us over \nthe next 3 months. It is not taken out of any significant program.\n  I am going to vote for this bill, but I certainly think, in the \noverall Pentagon budget of over $300 billion, we can find the $150 \nmillion in administrative inefficiencies.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield back the time in opposition to \nthe Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

We will stick with 15 on the others and \nmove this along as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 863\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Feingold-Durbin-Kerry amendment \nwould increase funding for the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria by \n$593 million, and it would offset that increase in funding by \nrescinding funds from the Navy V-22 Osprey aircraft procurement \naccount.\n  This is a chance for this body to move beyond rhetoric and take \naction in a fiscally responsible fashion to address the greatest health \ncrisis of our time, a pandemic that has killed 22 million people and \nmay infect 100 million by the year 2005.\n  U.S. leadership in the fight against AIDS is desperately needed now. \nObviously, there are problems with the Osprey program. Thirty Marines \nhave died in Osprey crashes since 1991. This troubled program is \ncurrently suspended, pending the outcome of investigations and further \nresearch, testing, and evaluation.\n  My amendment does not endanger the integrity of the Osprey production \nline. Let me repeat this. This amendment does not kill the Osprey \nprogram and does not affect the ongoing construction of planes that are \nbeing built with money from fiscal years 1999 and 2000.\n  What we have here is a clear choice, to use funds that are currently \nallocated somewhat irrationally and to redirect them towards fighting \nAIDS, an unquestionably worthwhile purpose that reflects our values, \nserves our interests, and may well be the greatest challenge \nconfronting the world today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and oppose the motion \nto table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment will wipe out the V-22 \nOsprey program. One of the best-kept secrets in the United States is \nthe role the U.S. Army has played in the battle against AIDS. The U.S. \nArmy, Department of Defense, has spent more money than all the moneys \nspent by other countries on the battle against AIDS. Our research has \ncome closest to victory. We have, in the next fiscal year, 2002, the \nfull amount requested by the administration.\n  We have not forgotten the problem. Yes, the United Nations has passed \na resolution, but we are still waiting for other countries to come \nforth with their moneys. Our country will come forth with our money but \nnot at the expense of the V-22 Osprey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 863.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 869\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the McCain amendment. \nThere are 5 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is not objected to by the \nDepartment of Defense or the Office of Management and Budget. The \namendment adds a bare minimum to fund defense readiness and personnel \nprograms. It is $850 million. There are offsets. Whenever there are \noffsets, there are some objections.\n  Nothing is more important, I believe at this time, than national \ndefense. And this money is earmarked for the men and women in the \nmilitary and their operations and maintenance accounts.\n  Very soon the administration will come over with a reprogramming \nrequest for $850 million, meaning that the wheels are going to come off \nunless they devote more money to exactly these accounts.\n  I hope we can vote to take care of the lifestyle, the readiness, and \nthe operations of the men and women in the military.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would mean that we would \nexceed the budget allocation for defense. There are 82 days left in \nthis fiscal year. The Department of Defense has already sent us, with \nthe President's approval, a request for $18.4 billion for 2002. That \nmoney will be readily available. This amendment is redundant in that \nrespect.\n  I have always supported defense in my day. I cannot remember ever \ndisagreeing on a defense amendment, but on this occasion it violates \nthe commitment we made to stay within the amount of the President's \nbudget. It takes funds from nondefense accounts and puts them in \ndefense accounts violating the wall concept that we have followed now \nfor 4 years. For 4 years, we have agreed to the amount to be spent for \ndefense and the amount to be spent for nondefense.\n  This amendment takes money exclusively from nondefense and puts it in \ndefense. If the tables were turned, I would obviously be violently \nopposed to taking money from defense and putting it into nondefense. I \nfeel obligated to defend the process which has saved the defense \naccounts over the past 4 years, and I urge that the McCain amendment be \ntabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table was previously made.\n  Mr. REID.

There are now 5 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided with respect to the Schumer amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Schumer \namendment. Earlier today, we had a 3-94 vote on the Hollings amendment. \nYou will remember the vote of 3-94 earlier today when the Senate \nrejected the Hollings amendment on repealing the tax decrease of a \nmonth ago. I think that was a vote of this body saying send the checks. \nThe conference report on that same bill directed the IRS, for very good \nreasons, to issue these notices that the Schumer amendment wants to \nrepeal. We have had the Treasury Employees Union saying send out a \nnotice to inform the taxpayers so that the Treasury employees would be \nable to do their job well, without always being on the phone informing \nthe taxpayers of what their tax refund might consist.\n  So if this amendment would pass, it would keep the taxpayers in the \ndark. It would help the scam artists preying on the poor and elderly, \nas we have been told before. It would play havoc with the important \nwork of the IRS. So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It has nothing \nto do with the tax cuts and getting back your checks. It has to do with \nperhaps the most foolish exercise that is part of this bill: $33 \nmillion so we can send people a notice that they are going to get a \ncheck. Well, if we were awash in money, maybe we should do that. But we \nare scrounging. I have such great respect for our leaders from West \nVirginia and from Alaska who are looking for $5 million here and $10 \nmillion there. And here we are going to spend $33 million to notify \npeople that they might get a check. Why not put the notice in the same \nenvelope as the check and save the money?\n  We all want to practice some form of fiscal conservatism--some of us \nso we might have a little money to spend on other programs, and some so \nthere might be more tax cuts. But no one from one end of this country \nto the other can justify spending $33 million to send a notice out \nahead of time saying: Your check is in the mail. It\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\ndoesn't stop fraud; it doesn't serve a purpose. At a time when we are \ndesperate for finding dollars, to waste money on this is a disgrace.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, regardless of party, to give our \nappropriations leaders some help and a little more money so they might \nbe able to do their jobs better. If you had to make a list of 10,000 \nthings we would want to spend the money on, this would not be it. I \nurge my colleagues to make this bill just a little bit better by \ncutting out this $33 million waste of money and use it for something \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 13 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me take advantage of that time. I \nwill take advantage of the opportunity to say, first of all, that all \nof these notices are already printed and ready to go. Do you want to \nthrow that money away?\n  No. 2, it is only part of the story that there is a message going out \nto tell people they are going to get a check and to expect it. There is \nalso a notice going out to 32 million people that they are not going to \nget a check, and that is a very important notice to go out, so that the \nIRS is not bothered by phone calls wondering whether or not they are \ngoing to get a check. I think it is very important that we do this \nright.\n  I ask for the defeat of the Schumer amendment and I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Schumer amendment No. 862.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I would like to ask the Senator from Alaska to \nconfirm my understanding of the intent of the provision regarding Fort \nGreely, AK, in section 1205 of this supplemental. I understand this \nprovision will allow the Secretary of the Army to modify a previously \nmade determination that the property in question was excess to the \nneeds of the Army and surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. \nModifying this decision will allow the Secretary of the Army to retain \nthis property until such time as a determination is made as to whether \nthis property is needed for any defense purpose.\n  Is that the intent of this provision?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Florida is correct. Clarifying the \nability of the Army to retain this property will allow the Secretary of \nthe Army to heat and otherwise maintain the buildings through the \nAlaska winter so that they are not irreparably damaged. This will allow \nthe buildings to be preserved until a future decision is made.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Alaska for this \nclarification. I was concerned that this provision was an attempt to \npredetermine a missile defense deployment decision.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I, too, thank the Senator from Florida for this \nclarification.\n\n\n           WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT DISLOCATED WORKER FUNDING\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to enter into a colloquy with my \ngood friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and my friend from \nPennsylvania, the ranking member of that subcommittee. I wonder if they \nwill respond to a few questions regarding job training programs under \nthe legislative jurisdiction of a subcommittee that I chair, the \nSubcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know my friend agrees with me that the supplemental \nappropriations bill before us presents a difficult situation affecting \nprograms funded by his Subcommittee. We both are very strong supporters \nof the $300 million in low-income energy assistance funding and the \n$161 million in title I education spending in the bill. That spending \nis urgently needed. The problem is that we must try to pay for that \nsupplemental spending from a pot of money that is simply too small. The \nbill as reported by the Appropriations Committee thus would offset a \nportion of that important new spending by making a rescission from \nunspent funds in a job training program for dislocated workers. I know \nmy friend is also a supporter of that important program, and I \nappreciate that the full Committee reiterated its support for the \nprogram in the committee report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, my good friend is correct. We are now having to make \nsome very, very difficult choices--really impossible choices--because \nthe pot of resources we are working with is too small. And you have \ncorrectly stated both what the committee has done as well as the \ncommittee's strong support for the job training program for dislocated \nworkers under the Workforce Investment Act. Our intent is to carefully \nmonitor the need for dislocated worker assistance to ensure that this \ncommitment is met and to take that need into account as we take up \nfunding for fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator. As I understand it, one of the \nfactors that the committee observed was a variation among the States in \nthe rate at which each State was drawing down their dislocated worker \nfunding allocations. My State of Minnesota, for example, has obligated \nvirtually all of its dislocated worker funding for this program year \nand will have expended nearly 85 percent of its funding. Other States--\nfor a number of understandable reasons--are predicted to have \nsignificant unexpended balances by the end of the fiscal year. To avoid \nundue hardships for States, such as Minnesota, that have been expending \nfunds at the expected pace, my understanding is that the bill contains \na ``hold harmless'' provision. That is, it provides a mechanism for \nexcess unspent funds to be re-alloted to States that have reached their \nlimits up to the levels these States would have received but for the \nrescission. Is this correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. That is correct. In addition, subsequent to our full \ncommittee action, we received Congressional Budget Office scoring that \nhas allowed inclusion of language postponing the rescission until the \nSecretary of Labor reallots the excess unexpended balances to the \nStates. Our goal with respect to the Dislocated Worker Program has \nalways been to try to ensure that no state finds itself\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nwithout the resources to meet its obligations. We believe that is \naccomplished through the ``hold harmless'' provisions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania. Now I want \nto clarify how it is we find ourselves in this situation of having to \nmake such difficult choices. Am I correct that at least part of the \nreason we are faced with a pot of resources that is so small is because \nof decisions made during the budgeting process to cap supplemental \ndiscretionary spending at $6.5 billion, to avoid triggering a \ngovernmentwide sequester during fiscal year 2001?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. My friend is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And, of course, it is also true that a huge portion of \nthe supplemental appropriations is going to support defense spending; \nam I not correct? So, another part of the reason that we are faced with \nthese difficult choices on where to find the resources to support \nurgently needed programs that provide a safety net for American \nfamilies is because of the priority being given to defense spending; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is it fair to say this is just the tip of the iceberg? \nThat the truly perverse choices we are being asked to make today \nbetween educating our children, heating our homes, and training \ndislocated workers are ominous harbingers of things to come as the full \nimpact of the $1.3 trillion tax cut is felt? Is that fair to say?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, my good friend is absolutely correct. Many of us \npredicted during the debate on the tax cut that we would be facing \nprecisely these impossible choices. It is upon us and it will only get \nworse.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my good friend. This is not a happy day, and I \nagree with the Senator's predictions that it will only get worse. I \nthink we need to look for some solutions to this larger problem. It \nseems to me inevitable that we must re-visit the unfortunate fiscal and \nbudgetary priorities that have been set.\n\n\n                        Crisis in Army Aviation\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment to this \nsupplemental appropriations that would have alleviated the emergency \nshortages of utility helicopters in the Army National Guard. Senators \nLeahy, Bond, Carnahan, Dodd, Lieberman, and Carper were cosponsors of \nthe amendment and some have short statements that they will enter.\n  Our amendment would have procured 20 new Blackhawks for those Guard \nunits in States with the most serious shortages of modern lift \nhelicopters. It is my understanding that there are between seven and \nnine States that are at a critical level, having no modern aviation \nassets.\n  Delaware is one of those States. The people of my State expect the \nArmy Guard to be there when emergencies hit. Unfortunately, the Army \nGuard may not be there because they do not have lift helicopters that \nare flyable. Let me repeat that and be more specific. Since January, \nthe Delaware National Guard has had no more than two UH-1 Huey \nhelicopters that were flyable--two out of a fleet of twenty-three, and \nthey have had two only rarely. The norm has been one. One vintage \nVietnam-era helicopter out of a fleet of twenty-three is all they have \nhad to fly for 6 months--6 months. This is absolutely insupportable. \nPilots cannot fly and stay proficient and the people who depend on the \nGuard can no longer be sure of their assistance in emergencies.\n  A week ago, the Secretary of Defense released his amended budget for \n2002. Unfortunately, there was only enough funding for 12 new Blackhawk \nhelicopters for the Army. This is incredible. It is completely \ninsufficient to deal with this problem. Over the next 5 years, the Army \nis retiring over 700 Vietnam-era helicopters that are no longer safe to \nfly, but nothing is replacing them. Instead of the 330 Blackhawks that \nare needed--130 for the active duty and 200 for the National Guard--\nless than 70, or about twenty percent of the requirement, are funded.\n  I have a copy of a letter sent to all of the leaders of the \ncongressional defense committees and the appropriations committees that \ndetails this critical problem. It describes the concern these generals \nhave that their ability to do their national security missions today is \nseverely impaired and that the situation will only get worse and \nqualified pilots and technicians leave the Guard because they are not \nable to do their missions or even train for them. The letter was signed \nby the 50 Adjutant Generals of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: The FY2001 Army Aviation Modernization \n     Plan requires the Army National Guard to significantly reduce \n     its aviation force structure by retiring over 700 grounded \n     Vietnam vintage utility aircraft by FY2004. These aircraft \n     have been replaced by requirements for 330 UH-60L utility and \n     HH-60L MEDEVAC helicopters. However, less than 20% of these \n     helicopters are funded from FY2002 through FY2007. Virtually \n     every state is currently short of its required H-60 \n     helicopters, and many states' capability to perform their \n     national security mission including protecting our nation \n     against the threat of weapons of mass destruction is severely \n     impaired by the lack of flyable aircraft.\n       The H-60 helicopter is the number 1 unfunded equipment \n     requirement in the Army National Guard. As the Defense \n     Committees discuss the FY2001 supplemenal and the FY2002 \n     defense budget, we request your support in two areas. First, \n     to add the procurement of 20 additional UH-60L Black Hawk \n     utility helicopters ($204 million) and 6 HH-60L (formerly UH-\n     60Q) MEDEVAC helicopters ($95.4 million) for the Army \n     National Guard to the budget. This will help alleviate an \n     immediate shortfall within the Army National Guard. Second, \n     to fix this problem in the long term we need your support for \n     a multi-year procurement of H-60s at a rate of 60 aircraft \n     per year for the next five years.\n       This problem has reached a critical phase. Without the \n     procurement of additional H-60 aircraft for our aviation \n     force to train and utilize, we will soon face a significant \n     loss of valuable pilots and technicians. Your support in \n     funding will assist in our efforts to continue to modernize \n     the aging National Guard fleet and provide our nation with \n     the best equipped and most relevant National Guard force.\n           Sincerely,\n         Major General Ronald O.

I have repeatedly asked the Army how it plans to address \nthe immediate needs of States like Delaware and the larger issue of a \nclear crisis in Army aviation. A crisis that impacts the readiness of \nour Army today and in the future. It was my hope that we would have a \nplan early this year. Nine months later, I am still waiting for a \ncomprehensive plan from the Army and I see no evidence that the new \nbudget addresses this problem.\n  I ask the distinguished Chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, who I know has long supported adequate funding for our \nNational Guard units, to seriously consider the problem this amendment \nwas intended to address. Twenty new Blackhawks this year is only the \ntip of the iceberg, but I believe we have a genuine crisis on our \nhands. It was an emergency nine months ago and it has only gotten worse \ntoday. Certainly, that is true in the state of Delaware and I have \nheard nothing from the Army to make me think that the same is not true \nin aviation units throughout the nation.\n  If, as I understand to be the case, the distinguished managers of \nthis bill believe that this funding cannot be designated as emergency \nfunding, then I hope that they will pledge to adequately address this \nissue within the fiscal year 2002 defense budget. I cannot go home to \nDelaware and tell them that we are aware of this crisis, have been for \nalmost a year, and yet did nothing and have no plans to do anything. \nThis problem must be addressed this year.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has \nconsistently been a strong supporter of, and advocate for, the National \nGuard. We have historically provided significant additional funding for \nthe National Guard where critical shortfalls were identified.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Delaware is aware, we have only \nrecently received the budget request for the Department of Defense and \nthere are ongoing discussions as to what the top line will ultimately \nbe for fiscal year 2002. However, we have appropriated additional \nfunding for National Guard Blackhawks for several years; for example, \nin fiscal year 2001, the Defense Appropriations Committee added funding \nfor the purchase of 6 additional Blackhawks for the Guard and for 11 \naircraft in fiscal year 2000. I agree with you that the National Guard \nmust be provided sufficient funding to carry out their important \nresponsibilities and aviation missions and we will do all that we can \nto address your concerns in the fiscal year 2002 Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague, and with his assurances, I will not \noffer this amendment. I do so only because of his assurances that we \nwill deal with this aviation crisis in the fiscal year 2002 defense \nbill and because I believe this supplemental is so vital to our \nmilitary that I do not wish to endanger its speedy passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I enthusiastically support Senator Biden's \ncolloquy. As a cochair of the Senate Guard Caucus, I find it alarming \nthat of the 1,885 Army National Guard helicopters nationwide, over a \n1,000 were recently reported as grounded because of a lack of spare \nparts. As recently as May it was reported that only 40 percent of the \nfleet of Army National Guard helicopters were flying.\n  Our skyrocketing maintenance costs require ever increasing resources \njust to maintain our aging fleet. Consequently our modernization \naccounts remain insufficient to replace aging aircraft, creating a \nviscious cycle. Senator Biden's effort today draws needed attention to \nthe alarming trends that we have seen in Army aviation within the past \nfew years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support to the \nspirit and intentions of the Biden amendment. The National Guard \nsuffers from a serious shortage of helicopters, and it is critical that \nthe Senate do more to address this threat to the readiness of the \ncitizen-soldier force.\n  The National Guard needs at least an additional 200 helicopters. This \nis not a number pulled out of thin air. It is the minimum number of \naircraft needed to carry out the Army Aviation Modernization Plan, \nwhich was developed by the office of the Chief of Staff of the Army. It \nis the road map for the entire Army's helicopter inventory for the next \n50 years. The plan will streamline the Army's aviation regiments. It \nreduces the overall number of helicopters in the Army's inventory, \nincluding the National Guard, while increasing capabilities through \ntechnological advances. Specifically, the service will retire 700 \nVietnam-era UH-1 Hueys, in exchange for 330 advanced UH-60L Blackhawks.\n  In streamlining and modernizing this force, the plan reaffirms the \ncritical role of our citizen-soldiers in our Nation's defense. It \nrecognizes that the National Guard is doing more than ever to defend \nthe Nation, whether at home or abroad. Indeed, every Member of the U.S. \nSenate will can tell you what a difference advanced helicopters have \nmade in a flood or medical emergency, while every field commander will \nsimilarly point out the critically important role of National Guard \naviation assets in a combat environment.\n  But the plan also has a much more practical bent. It seeks to avoid a \nlooming crisis in National Guard aviation. The Guard's current \ninventory of UH-1 Blackhawk and AH-1 Cobra helicopters is old, \nexpensive, and increasingly unsafe to operate. Units that possess \nupwards of 15 aging Huey and Cobra helicopters, may have only 2 to 6 \naircraft actually flying. By legislative mandate, the National Guard \nmust remove all of these obsolete aircraft from the flight-line by \n2004. Even when these units take full advantage of additional Kiowa \nhelicopters, they will be hard-pressed to maintain qualified pilots and \nan acceptable state of readiness when newer aircraft do not arrive to \nreplace them.\n  Given the Army's sensible plans and the looming dangers to National \nGuard aviation readiness, I have been surprised and disappointed by the \nArmy's reluctance to buy more UH-1's. For the past several fiscal \nyears, the Army has requested only 10 helicopters a year. In this \nfiscal year, the service has asked for a 12. It will take well over 20 \nyears to complete the plan at that pace.\n  I am especially disappointed by this meager request because the \nNational Guard Caucus, including members with helicopter units in their \nStates, have expressed its concern to the Army several occasions. At \nevery one of these briefings, meetings, and extended discussions Army \nleaders have admitted that a serious problem exists. Yet, when the \nbudget request moved forward, we get this paltry number.\n  I recognize that fiscal realities limit what Congress can do to \nrectify this situation on the supplemental. Nonetheless, I urge the \nSenate to examine this situation closely when it reviews the fiscal \nyear 2002 defense budget. I look forward to working with the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, fellow Guard caucus cochair Senator Bond, \nand longtime caucus member Senator Biden on this issue. I thank Senator \nBiden in particular for offering this amendment and bring further \nattention to this problem.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offered an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill to increase funding for the Global \nFund for AIDS, TB and malaria. My amendment was an attempt to get this \nSenate to put its money where its mouth is, and in a fiscally \nresponsible fashion to make a\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nsignificant contribution to the multilateral effort to fight the AIDS \npandemic--a contribution that could leverage more funds from other \ndonors. In the wake of the recent U.N. special session on AIDS, it \nseemed especially appropriate to take concrete action rather than rely \non mere rhetoric.\n  The amendment failed, but I do not want that vote to leave anyone \nwith the impression that there is no will in this Senate to address the \nglobal AIDS pandemic. Some were uncomfortable with the offset, which \ninvolved rescinding funds from the troubled V-22 Osprey procurement \nprogram for the remainder of the 2001 fiscal year. I believed that the \noffset was reasonable. Some were uncomfortable with the emergency \ndesignation in the amendment. The emergency designation was necessary, \nbecause the bill was already up against the cap on non-defense \nspending. It was also accurate. The AIDS pandemic is, unquestionably, \nan emergency.\n  While these issues may have led my amendment to defeat today, I do \nbelieve that this Senate will take meaningful action to address this \ncrisis. The very fact that the supplemental contains $100 million for \nthe Global Fund is a testament to the efforts of the appropriators and \nthe leadership. Indeed, I suspect that many Senators, including many \ncolleagues who opposed my amendment, are left uneasy by the AIDS-\nrelated consequences of the vote on my amendment, and I believe that \nunease will only strengthen our collective resolve to work together, in \na bipartisan and inclusive fashion, to make certain that the U.S. takes \nmeaningful action to strengthen prevention efforts, improve AIDS \nawareness and education, increase global access to treatment, support \nvaccine research, improve health infrastructure, provide services to \norphans, and support the Global Fund at an appropriate level--one far \nexceeding $200 million.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of language \nwhich was included in the manager's amendment to S. 1007. I am pleased \nthat Senators Byrd and Stevens have agree to accept my language which \nwill extend compensation to Department of Energy employees and DoE \ncontractor employees who suffered kidney cancer due to exposure to \nradiation while working at a DoE defense nuclear facility or nuclear \nweapons testing site.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act as part of the FY 2001 Department of Defense \nAuthorization bill. This measure provides $150,000 lump sum payments as \nwell as payments for medical coverage to Department of Energy Workers \nwho were made ill as a result of exposure to radiation. Unfortunately, \nwhen the final version of the bill was drafted the list of covered \ndiseases mistakenly did not include kidney cancer. This was \nunintentional, and the amendment I have offered will correct this \noversight.\n  The EEOICPA is well on its way toward implementation. Just last week, \nthe Department of Labor opened a resource center in Paducah, KY which \nwill assist workers and their families who were made sick from exposure \nto radiation while working at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. As \nmany have pointed out, the employees who worked at these facilities \nproducing the technology which helped America win the Cold War deserve \na grateful Nation's support and appreciation. This must include \ncompensation for those workers and their families who may have \ncontracted cancer as a result of their employment.\n  Again, I thank the managers for their agreement on this important \nissues of fairness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill's inclusion of $84 million for the \nbankrupt Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund.\n  From the 1940s through 1971, uranium miners, Federal employees who \nparticipated in above-ground nuclear tests, and downwinders from the \nNevada test site were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. As a \nresult of this exposure, these individuals contracted debilitating and \ntoo often deadly radiation-related cancers and other diseases.\n  These folks helped build our nuclear arsenal--the nuclear arsenal \nthat is responsible, at least in part, for ending the cold war. In \n1990, Congress recognized their contribution by passing the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act to ensure that these individuals and their \nfamilies were indemnified for their sacrifice and suffering.\n  However, the RECA Trust Fund ran out of money in May, 2000. \nConsequently, for over a year most eligible claimants have been \nreceiving nothing more than a five-line IOU from the Justice Department \nexplaining that no payments will be made until Congress provides the \nnecessary funds. Some of these claimants are dying while awaiting their \npayments.\n  Frankly, this is unconscionable. Those who helped protect our \nNation's security through their work on our nuclear programs must be \ncompensated for the enormous price they paid. Anything less is \nunacceptable.\n  The $84 million in supplemental appropriations would help rectify \nthis grave injustice by paying all of last year's approved claims as \nwell as the estimated claims for fiscal year 2001.\n  Passage of this appropriations bill does not end Congress' work. We \nmust also pass the Domenici-authored S. 448 or the Hatch-Domenici bill, \nS. 898. Both of these bills would make all future payments to approved \nRECA claimants mandatory and, thus, not subject to the annual \nappropriations process.\n  It is imperative that America not forget those who have tragically \nsuffered from their work on our Nation's behalf. This supplemental bill \nis a good step in the right direction.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to express \nmy support of the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations bill. \nThis bill contains funding, not only for the defense and security of \nour country, but also funding for the health and well being of American \ncitizens.\n  This bill contains funding I supported in committee for two issues \nthat are vital to many in my home State of Colorado. I am referring \nfirst to the funding for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA. \nFar too many people, especially in the West, now suffer from terminal \nillnesses that are the result of their work as miners who collected and \ntransported uranium ore that was used in the production of weapons for \nour Nation's defense. For many, the risk of working with radioactive \nmaterials was unknown, hidden or minimized. The $84 million included in \nthis bill will pay the IOU's our Nation made to these terminally ill \nworkers in lieu of money. We, as a Nation, have a history of issuing \nIOU's a shameful practice of which I am sure I don't need to remind my \ncolleagues. As a Nation we can and must do more than issue IOU's. \nHundreds of these beneficiaries live in Colorado and they are in \ndesperate need of that money that was promised to them last year. Dying \nhas a way of making people desperate, especially when the money \npromised them in useless IOU's could be used for their care. There are \nmany times we in this body act because we can. In this matter, we have \nthe opportunity to act because we ought to.\n  I thank my friends and colleagues, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, \nfor their assistance and support with this, as many of their \nconstituents are claimants as well.\n  I would also like to express my strong support for additional funding \nfor USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The $35 \nmillion included in this bill will allow APHIS to strengthen border \ninspections and improve monitoring of emerging animal and plant \ndiseases, including Mad Cow disease, Foot-and-Mouth disease, and other \nlivestock diseases. There has never been a case of Mad Cow disease in \nthe United States, and there has not been an outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth \nDisease since 1929. But, considering the potentially disastrous effects \nif either disease spreads to our country, we must do everything we can \nto protect the American food supply. As a rancher myself, and having \nheard from fellow cattlemen, I share their growing concern about the \npotential devastating impact of these diseases. Colorado is home to \n12,000 beef producers and 3.15 million head of cattle--more than the \nhuman population of 20 of our States. We must do all we can to protect \nthem. I would like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Kohl for \nhis support and assistance in this effort.\n  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Byrd and \nSenator Stevens for their leadership and\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\nsupport of this bill and particularly for their support of funding for \nRECA and APHIS.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant funding bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to first express my \nappreciation to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his \nwork on the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations bill. It is \nonly through his persistence and determination that we are able to \nbring this bill to floor within the spending limits proposed by the \nPresident.\n  I want to specifically thank Chairman Byrd for his work on an issue \nof great importance to California. This bill includes $20 million in \ndisaster assistance to crop growers in the Klamath Basin of northern \nCalifornia and southern Oregon who are faced with a total loss of \nincome resulting from a lack of water. I am very grateful that Chairman \nByrd saw the true emergency in this situation.\n  This year, the Klamath Basin is facing one of the worst, if not the \nworst drought in the Klamath River Project's 90-year history. Federal \ndisaster declarations have been issued by the USDA for Modoc and \nSiskiyou Counties in California and Klamath County, OR. Economic losses \nto the farming communities have been estimated at up to $220 million.\n  Over 200,000 acres of farmland are irrigated in the Klamath River \nBasin. There are roughly 1500 farming families in the Klamath \nIrrigation Project.\n  The Endangered Species Act requires the Bureau of Reclamation to \nreview its programs with consultation from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and the National Marine Fisheries Service, with the obligation \nto protect endangered species. In Klamath this includes two species of \nsuckerfish, the coho salmon, and the bald eagle. In addition to the \nEndangered Species Act, the Bureau of Reclamation must protect tribal \nfishing and water rights.\n  What little rainfall that has occurred this year must be first \napplied to minimize endangered fish species losses and then to \nmandatory Tribal Treaty obligations. This leaves literally no water for \nabout 85 percent of the Klamath Project-dependent farmers. And this \nproblem is not going to go away. Based on Bureau of Reclamation \nestimates, there will not be enough water for all users in 7 out of the \nnext 10 years in the Klamath Basin.\n  Lack of water in the Klamath Basin is a problem that requires a long \nterm solution. I am committed to working with the administration and my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to develop that solution.\n  Unfortunately, a long-term solution will not help the farmers today. \nThat is why this assistance is so critical and so necessary. I am \ngrateful that Chairman Byrd recognizes this need. I want to again thank \nthe chairman for making this assistance possible.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify a \nprovision of the fiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill \nregarding human space flight funding within the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration NASA. In its report, the Appropriations \nCommittee included language removing a restriction placed on $40 \nmillion in fiscal year 2000 Human Space Flight funding. The restriction \nrequired these funds to be used for a dedicated shuttle research \nmission. With various delays in the shuttle manifest, the STS 107 \nmission has been rescheduled for May 2002. Removing the restriction \nwill allow NASA to use the $40 million to cover costs associated with \nthe delay of STS 107 mission and for research to be conducted abroad \nthe International Space Station.\n  The followon shuttle dedicated research mission, also known as ``R \n2,'' is now not expected to fly until at least 2004. This mission was \nintended as a ``gap-filler'' to support the scientific community during \nconstruction of the International Space Station. At the same time, the \nagency is proposing to decrease funding for Space Station research in \norder to pay for cost overuns associated with building the vehicle \nitself. The life and microgravity science community is already under \nfunded. Continuing to delay the ``R 2'' mission will only exacerbate \nthe research community's already strained situation.\n  While I do not oppose this reprogramming request, I agree with my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee about the need to balance \nsuch requests with maintaining life and microgravity research conducted \naboard the shuttle and space station. While NASA certainly needs to \nmeet its obligations, I am concerned that the redirection of these \nfunds will ultimately preclude NASA from pursuing the dedicated \nresearch flight entirely. The Senate language associated with the \nsupplemental appropriations bill directs NASA to consult with Congress \non the research planned for the R 2 mission in the context of the \nfuture funding required to support space station research. I expect \nNASA to continue to work on the R 2 mission, or a suitable equivalent, \nand look forward to working with NASA and my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee in receiving and reviewing these research \nplans.\n\n\n                    ISRAELI PURCHASES OF U.S. GRAIN\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2001 supplemental appropriations bill regarding the purchase of \nU.S. grain by Israel. This issue is of concern because Israel has \nstated its intention to cut its U.S. grain purchases by more than 22 \npercent in the current year.\n  Historically, in every year since the Camp David Accords of 1978, \nIsrael has agreed to purchase 1.6 million metric tons of grain grown by \nAmerican farmers and to ship at least half that amount in United \nStates-flag commercial vessels. These are purchases important to \nAmerican agriculture and to the U.S. citizen merchant mariners critical \nto our national security. Every year, these purchases have been \nconsistent, until now.\n  Starting in 1979, and in every year since then, Israel has entered \ninto a side letter agreement with the United States for the purchase of \ngrain, recognizing that the cash transfer economic assistance Israel \nhas received replaced, in part, a previous commodity import assistance \nprogram for Israel.\n  Despite a level of U.S. aid in every year since 1984 that has been \nhigher than the 1979-1983 level, Israel never increased grain imports. \nHad proportionality been the test, Israel's purchases should have \nreached 2.45 million tons at least at one point. The commitment to \npurchase never grew as Israel's economic support fund assistance grew. \nAmerica, in generous friendship, didn't push for those purchases to \ngrow. And, as economic assistance to Israel has recently decreased, \nIsrael's commitment to purchase didn't change until now.\n  The Government of Israel has announced its intention to reduce grain \npurchases by more than 22 percent this year, from 1.6 million tons to \n1.24 million tons. This is not proportional, but disproportional. U.S. \neconomic assistance to Israel has declined only 12.5 percent this year. \nIf Israel's purchases of U.S. grain were not tied to increasing levels \nof U.S. economic aid, then those purchases should not be tied to a \nrecent downward fluctuation in economic aid. Such an overreaction \nignores history, is disappointing in view of our long-term friendship \nand overall relationship, and ignores the express intent of this \nCongress in providing aid in the past. Several times in recent years, \nCongress has enacted laws providing that, in administering assistance, \nthe President would guard against an adverse impact on such exports \nfrom the United States to Israel.\n  The amendment I offered this week simply would have reiterated for \nfiscal year 2001 the past Congressional commitment that this year's \nside letter agreement should be in accordance with terms as favorable \nas last year's agreement. I was prepared to pursue that amendment \nfurther. I remain concerned and disappointed over this year's side \nletter. However, with most of fiscal year 2001 past, with the need for \nthis supplemental bill to move quickly for the benefit of our national \ndefense and our men and women in uniform, and based upon discussions \nwith the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I would be willing to withhold at this time. I would like \nto yield to those two colleagues for a discussion on this matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is correct in stating that Congress, and our \nsubcommittee, has had a longstanding interest in this area and has \nconsistently monitored this issue. We are prepared\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\nto turn very shortly to consideration of the fiscal year 2002 foreign \noperations appropriation bill. I believe that would be the best vehicle \nfor consideration of this issue, in the regular order, when we can \nconsider all the policy ramifications for the entire, upcoming year. I \ncan assure the Senator of our continued attention to this matter, and \nof thoughtful, thorough consideration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the Senator of Idaho's concerns, and give \nhim my assurances that we will work together on this issue. Coming from \na farming State myself, I fully understand his interests in the \npurchase of American grain by Israel. Senator Leahy and I anticipate \nthat within the next few weeks the Subcommittee will mark up the fiscal \nyear 2002 foreign operations bill, and we look forward to working with \nthe Senator toward an acceptable resolution of this matter.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate my colleagues' comments and their willingness \nto address this issue again. I withdraw my amendment and thank them for \ntheir consideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to comment \nspecifically on Chapter 1 of the supplemental appropriations \nlegislation, S. 1077, and the provision of funding for the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act, or RECA as it is more commonly known.\n  Since the enactment of RECA in 1990 and the subsequent amendments in \n2000, thousands of Americans have received compensation based on their \nunknowing exposure to harmful radiation caused by the government's \nnuclear production and testing activities.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, last year, Congress passed the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Amendments of 2000, S. 1515. This law \nmade important changes to the original 1990 Act by updating the list of \ncompensable illnesses--primarily cancers--based on scientific and \nmedical information gathered over the past decade.\n  However, even before the enactment of RECA 2000, the Trust Fund \nbecame financially depleted. Starting in the Spring of last year, \napproved claimants began receiving ``IOUs'' from the Department of \nJustice rather than their checks.\n  Many of us are totally dismayed that the RECA Trust Fund is depleted. \nIt is totally unfair for the government to issue IOUs rather than \nchecks to the hundreds and potentially thousands of individuals who are \nexpected to be approved for compensation.\n  I know that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee agree, and \nthat is why they have included $84 million for RECA claims in this \nbill. It is my understanding that these funds are the amount necessary \nto cover all approved claims pending at the Justice Department through \nthe end of this fiscal year. And that is good news.\n  The bad news is that we still face a shortfall in funding over the \ncourse of the next 10 years. That is why I introduced legislation, S. \n898, along with my distinguished colleagues Senator Domenici and \nSenator Daschle to provide permanent funding for the RECA trust fund. \nSuch action would provide certainty to the thousands of claimants for \nwhom the program was enacted 10 years ago.\n  As I am sure my colleagues recognize, for the Federal Government to \npromise compassionate compensation to the RECA downwinders and workers \nand then not honor that commitment is simply unacceptable. It is \ninexcusable for the government to pledge this compensation and then \nissue nothing more than a simple IOU. This strikes at the very heart of \nour citizens' ability to have confidence in their government.\n  I have met with many of the RECA claimants in my state. It does not \ntake long to see the pain and suffering they have endured over the \nyears. This pain and suffering, I would add, has taken a toll on their \nlives and the lives of their families as well. Most of these \nindividuals are now retired; they live on modest incomes and fear that \ntheir declining health will only exacerbate their limited family \nfinances.\n  And let us not ignore the overwhelming and personal human tragedy \nthat many of these individuals already have died as a result of the \ninjuries they sustained while working for the government's nuclear \nproduction program. Today, we have the opportunity to right a wrong \nthrough passage of this legislation, and I hope that we do so at the \nearliest opportunity.\n  In closing, I particularly want to thank my good friend Senator \nDomenici, and his excellent staff, for their work on the Appropriations \nCommittee in securing these funds. Senator Domenici and I have worked \ntogether since 1990 on RECA. We have done so in the name of thousands \nof individuals across many states who were literally innocent victims \nof our nation's nuclear weapons program. I am appreciative for all \nSenator Domenici has done to make this program the success it has been.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my amendment to the bill will redesignate \nBuilding 1500 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, VA, as the \nNorman Sisisky Engineering and Management Building. I am joined by my \nVirginia colleague, Senator George Allen.\n  As a Navy veteran of World War II, Congressman Sisisky was proud to \nbe a part of one of the most extraordinary chapters in American \nhistory, when America was totally united at home in support of our 16 \nmillion men and women in uniform on battlefields in Europe and on the \nhigh seas in the Pacific--all, at home and abroad, fighting to preserve \nfreedom.\n  During our 18 years serving together, Congressman Sisisky's goal, our \ngoal, was to provide for the men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies.\n  The last 50 years have proven time and again that one of America's \ngreatest investments was the G.I. Bill of Rights, originated during \nWorld War II, which enabled service men and women to gain an education \nsuch that they could rebuild America's economy. The G.I. Bill was but \none of the many benefits that Congressman Sisisky fought for and made a \nreality for today's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.\n  His strength in public life was supported by his wonderful family; \nhis lovely wife Rhoda and four accomplished children. They were always \nby his side offering their love, support, and counsel.\n  He worked tirelessly throughout Virginia's 4th District, however, \nthere was always a special bond to the military installations under his \ncharge. As a former sailor, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard was high among \nhis priorities. He knew the workers by name and the monthly workload in \nthe yard. In consultation with his family and delegation members, we \nchose this building at the shipyard as a most appropriate memorial to \nour friend and colleague.\n  I waited until the special election was concluded so the entire \nVirginia delegation could join together on this legislation.\n  Norman Sisisky was always a leader for the delegation on matters of \nnational security. We are honored to join in this bi-partisan effort to \nremember Congressman Norman Sisisky and his life's work; ensuring the \nNation's security and the welfare of the men and women in uniform and \ntheir families.\n  Along with my remarks, I would like to include the remarks of the \nCommander Chief of the Atlantic Fleet, Admiral Bob Natter. Admiral \nNatter worked very closely with Norman Sisisky throughout his career \nand joins me and the entire Virginia delegation in supporting the \nnaming of Building 1500; the Norman Sisisky Engineering and Management \nbuilding.\n  Admiral Bob Natter, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet writes:\n  It is highly fitting to name the Norfolk Naval Shipyard's Engineering \nand Management building at the Navy's oldest and most historic shipyard \nafter Representative Norman Sisisky. Mr. Sisisky was on hand in 1983 \nfor the dedication and ribbon cutting of this building, which has \nbecome the most recognizable building on the shipyard. His dedication \nand service to our Navy, this great shipyard, and its many employees \nmirror the Norfolk Naval Shipyard motto of ``Service to the Fleet, any \nship, anytime, anywhere.''\n  From improvements in quality of life to technology that have made \nNorfork Naval Shipyard one of the finest yards in the nation, Mr. \nSisisky strongly supported the best interests of our Navy and our \nNation. Among a wide range of projects at the shipyard, he supported a \nnew bachelor enlisted quarters which today houses 300 Sailors and \nserved as a model for the entire Navy. He was an ardent supporter of a \nwaterfront improvement project that significantly\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nexpanded shipyard capabilities, including the capacity to conduct \nsimultaneous repairs on two DDG 51 class ships. He was personally \ndedicated to keeping this great public shipyard competitive, in cost \nand in unparalleled quality.\n  Perhaps most of all, the Sailors of the Atlantic Fleet and the \ndedicated men and women of the Norfolk Naval Shipyard who work \ntirelessly on our ships and submarines knew Norm Sisisky was their \nstrongest supporter and would fight for their best interests. His \npresence at nearly every important Navy event in the community made him \na popular, recognizable and appreciated friend among uniformed Sailors \nand civilians alike. He has made an indelible mark on this community \nand a lasting contribution to the Atlantic Fleet. We are honored to \nhave this centerpiece of the Norfork Naval Shipyard named after Norman \nSisisky, a great patriot who will forever be remembered as a great \nfriend of the Navy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the supplemental \nappropriations bill which we will vote on today includes much needed \nfunding for education.\n  Federal support to improve the educational opportunities of \ndisadvantaged students is provided under title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. Earlier this year, the Department of Education \nannounced the allocation of title I funds for qualified schools. The \nDepartment was forced to make cuts in the expected funding for all of \nthese school districts, due to a shortfall in the amounts appropriated \nfor this purpose last year.\n  This bill provides $161 million to cover that shortfall; $2.4 million \nof these funds will be allocated to schools in my State. With this \nfunding, schools in Mississippi will be able to continue to provide \nessential learning resources to students from preschool through 12th \ngrade.\n  In April of this year, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies, Senator Specter authorized me to chair a hearing in \nMississippi to examine the effectiveness of title I in my State. Our \npanel of witnesses included Mississippi Department of Education \nofficials and local school superintendents. The resounding message from \nthe hearing was that title I funds are vital to making good learning \nopportunities available to all of Mississippi's students.\n  One of the most compelling statements was that of Yazoo City School \nSuperintendent, Dr. Daniel Watkins who told of his experience at \nMontgomery Elementary School in Louise, MS. I want to share with the \nSenate some of his testimony, which I quote here:\n\n       I began my educational career in 1964 in Louise. My mother \n     was a single parent with 7 children.\n       My first 3 years at elementary school, I had a severe \n     speech impediment that allowed me to be quiet when I knew \n     answers. But I do remember, through title I funding, a speech \n     pathologist, to bring me out of my shyness. Again, I grew up \n     in a small delta town called Louise, with my mother being the \n     mother, the father, a provider and whatever else she needed \n     to be. Besides school, our work consisted of working in the \n     cotton fields.\n       My mother drove a school bus and worked in the school's \n     cafeteria. One of the happiest days of my mother's life was \n     when she received her GED. Needless to say, she stressed \n     education daily and yearly throughout my grade school life. \n     There were many needs in our school system back then, to the \n     extent that I did not quite understand, but I have since \n     learned that through the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act, the Federal Government reduced many of these needs. In \n     later years, I have seen the happiness of my mother as she \n     observes her daughter working with a parenting program in \n     Louisville, Mississippi, and two of her sons receiving \n     Ph.D's. Without the increasing help of title I, none of these \n     could have been achieved in the lives a poor Delta family.\n\n  Hearing Dr. Watkins' personal experiences is helpful in understanding \nthe real life consequences of title I and what it can do to broaden the \nhorizons of a young student. Dr. Watkins' story is, I think, a \nmarvelous testimony to the success of title I.\n  Dr. Watkins and the other witnesses at that hearing went on to tell \nin just as riveting testimony newer stories of title I providing the \nresources to reduce dropout rates, provide tutoring, increase literacy \nof parents and students, enhance teachers' skills, and overall increase \nthe likelihood of high achievement among the most disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  I am happy to provide the Senate with some of the good news about \ntitle I and I am very pleased that this bill will allow the \ncontinuation of the much needed services it provides.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I sincerely thank Chairman Byrd and his \nstaff, Galen Fountain and Chuck Kieffer, for all their hard work and \nconsideration on this bill. I would especially like to thank the \nChairman for his understanding the needs of my constituents in the \nKlamath Basin and thereby including these much needed payments in this \nbill. I would also thank Senator Stevens and his staff, Rebecca Davies, \nfor their understanding and support.\n  This amendment provides $20,000,000 for the farmer families in the \nKlamath Basin. While the Secretary has the discretion to disseminate \nthis money as she sees fit, I am pleased that we have an understanding \nwith the Bush administration that this money will be distributed as \ngrants or direct payments but not as loans.\n  The Klamath Basin stretches between southern Oregon and northern \nCalifornia. The water in the Basin is managed primarily by the \nDepartment of Interior's Bureau of Reclamation. The management of this \nwater has assured the continuation of a significant agricultural \ncommunity in the Basin. But this growing season the Basin is home to \n1,500 growers and their families whose farms are parched. It is home to \nthree National Wildlife Refuges and fish bearing lakes and rivers that \nare also parched. There is not enough water to go around.\n  I, and several colleagues, fought so hard for the $20,000,000 \ncontained in this bill for these farmer families because this money \nprovides our farmers the assurances they need to get through this \nseason. It provides the Basin farmers with the safety net they need as \nthe tightrope between agriculture and the environment is traversed. \nThis $20,000,000 safety net is necessary to keep these folks alive \nwhile the larger natural resource issues evident in the Klamath Basin \nare debated and ecological balance in the Basin is pursued. There is a \nbalance that can and should be struck and this money is, unfortunately, \na necessary step on that long and arduous journey.\n  There is a precedent for this appropriation in other USDA \nconservation programs. For instance, this money may be able to be used \nby the Secretary to purchase, under short term contracts, water \neasements for the sake of water conservation in the Basin. In this way, \nthe money will get directly to the farmer much like land easement \npayments under the conservation Reserve Program are made directly to \nthe farmer.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague and friend from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, and my colleagues and friends from California, Senators \nFeinstein and Boxer, in thanking the Chairman and Senator Stevens for \ntheir inclusion of this important provision in this supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak \nout on the Air Force's decision to substantially cut America's B-1 \nBomber force. As many of my colleagues know, as part of the 2002 \nDefense budget amendment, the Air Force announced its intentions to \nremove the B-1 Bomber from the Air National Guard Wings at McConnell \nAir Force Base in Kansas, and Warner Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, \nand consolidate the remaining bombers at two active duty Air Force \nbases in Texas and South Dakota.\n  The Air Force intends for this proposal to take effect immediately \nafter funds become available following the passage of the 2001 \nsupplemental appropriations bill, and desires that the entire project \nbe completed in a year or so. The Air Force justified this announcement \nto Congress by stating that this cut was a good way to realize cost \nsavings in 2002 Defense Budget.\n  The decision to cut and realign the B-1 force has been mishandled \nfrom the start. I support and have cosponsored this amendment in an \neffort to urge and allow the Air Force to give due consideration to \nimportant decisions.\n  I guess if you are not familiar with the men and women of the 184th \nBomb Wing, or if you just are not a student of defense policy, you \nmight be wondering what the big deal is. I think the best\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nway to explain what happened with this decision is to offer an analogy.\n  If a family decided to remodel their old house, the first thing they \nwould do is sit down with an architect and sketch out their ideas of \nwhat they want their house to look like. The architect would then take \nthese sketches and form a blueprint, the final plan that gives the \ninstructions to the carpenter who would in turn remodel the house.\n  The carpenter would never dream of deviating from this blueprint. \nAfter all, his job is to follow the architect's instructions, and \nrespect the family's wishes. It really wouldn't matter if he thought \nhis ideas were better than the family's. No family in their right mind \nwould ever hire a carpenter who wanted to re-design their home \naccording to his whims and wishes.\n  This is exactly what happened with the announcement to pull the B-1's \nfrom the Air National Guard. The Air Force is now on the verge of \nreversing a longstanding policy by saying that our national defense \nneeds would be better served if the B-1's were flown exclusively by the \nActive Duty forces. This decision was made in spite of the fact that \nthe blueprint for our national defense policy, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, has yet to be completed by the Secretary of Defense.\n  It is as if the carpenter has decided to begin construction before he \nhas been handed the plans. This questionable practice has raised other \nquestions: One, how can the Air Force make a decision to remodel the \nAir Force to meet future threats if the plans for meeting those threats \nare still works in progress? Two, in some of his previous statements, \nSecretary Rumsfeld has acknowledged that future combat missions will \ndepend on long range, precision strike bombers which are capable of \nreaching their targets from airbases within the United States. How can \nthe Air Force make a decision to cut the B-1 Bomber fleet when such a \ndecision seems to run contrary to Secretary Rumsfeld's previous \nstatements?\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I fully agree with \nthis assessment. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. to \nrely on other country's airstrips to stage our Air Force operations. We \nmust look to platforms that enable us to conduct missions from the \nsafety of America's shores.\n  No other bomber in today's Air Force can match the B-1 for \naccomplishing these missions. The B-1 has more payload capacity than \nthe Stealth B-2, and is much faster than either the B-2 and B-52.\n  While I agree that stealth technology is important to our Air Force, \nwe should be cautious about becoming overly reliant on it. If we cannot \nalways depend on stealth for surprise and protection, we will have to \nreturn to speed and maneuverability. The B-1, is the only bomber today \nthat meets this requirement.\n  So if the Air Force still needs the B-1, why cut the fleet from 93 to \n60? One excuse is that it will be cheaper, and that the Active Duty can \naccomplish this mission better than the Air National Guard.\n  But according to figures released by the Guard Wing at Mcconnell, the \nAir Force is simply wrong in this estimation. Consider just a few \nsimple facts.\n  The average B-1 Mission Capable rate for the Air National Judd is \n61.5 percent. The active component only rates 53,4 percent.\n  The average Total Mission Capable rate for the Air National Guard is \n19.9 decent, compared to the Active Duty's rate of 24.6 percent.\n  The Kansas Air National Guard opetes one of the Air Force's two \nEngine Regional Repair Centers and the Georgia Unite Provides avionics \nsystems repair for all the B-1's providing high-level expertise in \nreducing costs.\n  When confronted with these figures, how can the Air Force conclude \nthat the Active Duty can accomplish this mission in a more cost-\neffective manner than the Air National Guard? I am pleased that \nSenators Roberts and Cleland will be calling on the General Accounting \nOffice to see if this decision would make more economic sense that \nkeeping the Guard flying the B-1.\n  A force structure decision should never have been made without the \nguidance of a new national security blueprint. Even more important, \nsuch a decision should never have been made on false economic \nassumptions. We cannot afford to make hasty decisions.\n  Today, I join a bipartisan group of Senators consisting of Senators \nRoberts, Cleland, Miller, Craig, and Crapo in offering an amendment to \nthe 2001 Defense Supplemental Bill that will prohibit 201 funds from \nbeing used to carry any orders to cut or transfer the B-1. In spite of \nthe Air Forces announcement, we offer this amendment to put the Air \nForce on notice that hasty decisions regrading our national security \nare unacceptable to Congress.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand the very difficult job the \nAppropriations Committee has faced in producing this supplemental \nappropriations bill and I commend the leadership of the committee for \nits work.\n  However, it is very unfortunate that it was necessary to rescind $217 \nmillion in critical dislocated worker funding. I hope that this will be \na short-lived reduction and that it will be possible to eliminate this \ncut in conference. Further, I urge the committee to also reject the \nadministration's proposed further $600 million reduction in training \nprograms in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations.\n  In the 105th Congress the Workforce Investment Act was overwhelmingly \nsupported on a bipartisan basis. Few issues that we debate in Congress \nare as important to the future of this country as the lifelong \neducation and training of our workforce. We live in an era of a global \neconomy, emerging industries and company downsizing. It is imperative \nthat our delivery of services meet the employment and educational needs \nof the 21st century.\n  We now are embarking on the creation of a streamlined and vitally \nnecessary workforce development system. More authority is given to \nState and local representatives of government, business, labor, \neducation, and youth activities. There is a true collaborative process \nbetween the state and local representatives to ensure that training and \neducational services provided will be held to high standards.\n  Our global economy is creating wonderful opportunities for American \nworkers, but also great stress and anxiety. Today, the knowledge and \nskills workers must have on the job changes very rapidly. Companies and \neven industry segments enter and leave our States and communities with \nunprecedented speed.\n  Layoffs are announced throughout the country every week as a result \nof business consolidation, financial re-organization, a changing \nmarketplace or a slowing economy. For many years, the Connecticut \neconomy was dependent on defense-oriented industries. Training programs \nunder the Workforce Investment Act ensure that employees who are \nadversely affected by military and other downsizing will have access to \njob training and supportive services in order to acquire the skills \nneeded for employment in the technology driven economy of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Last week, Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported that U.S. \ncompanies cut nearly 125,000 jobs in June. The Department of Labor \nreported that new claims for unemployment benefits increased by 7,000. \nOn one day alone at the end of June three separate companies announced \nplans to eliminate 800 jobs in Connecticut. In the technology sector \nalone, almost 1,000 jobs cuts have been announced in Connecticut since \nthe beginning of the year.\n  I urge the committee to re-evaluate these cuts to the dislocated \nworker program. Now is not the time to be short-changing our workers or \nour communities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the first bill that Senator Byrd \nhas handled now as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I in \nmy new role as ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I thank \nSenator Byrd for his courtesy. I have not seen the supplemental handled \nas fairly and evenly as this has been. We have responded to almost \nevery request made by Senators from either side. I congratulate the \nSenator for this night and for the fact that the bill presented by the \nAppropriations Committee has been sustained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I tender my thanks to my friend, Senator \nStevens. Without his able cooperation and\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nassistance all the way, we would not have completed this bill today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays will be required after the \nclerk reads the bill for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third time and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2216, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2216) making supplemental appropriations for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 2216 is stricken, and the text of the Senate \nbill S. 1077, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment of the amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall it pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

I move the Senate insist on its amendment to H.R. 2216 and \nrequest a conference with the House of Representatives, and the Chair \nbe authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to; and the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Cochran conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member for their work on the \nsupplemental. We have come a long way since we closed prior to the \nFourth of July recess. We had indicated our desire to finish our work \non the supplemental by Tuesday night. We have done so. I am grateful \nfor that.\n  We will now be taking up the Interior appropriations bill. It was my \nhope to be able to move to proceed to the appropriations bill tomorrow \nat 9:30. Some of our Republican colleagues have objected to going to \nthe bill until matters pertaining to certain nominations could be \nclarified. As a result, we will not have a specific time we can \nannounce that we will be going to the bill. I am hopeful we can clarify \nthis matter involving nominations at the earliest possible time so that \nthere will not be any objections on the other side to moving to the \nInterior bill. My hope and my expectation is that we can finish the \nbill by Thursday night. Obviously, if we have to be here on Friday to \nfinish it, we will do that.\n  I indicated to Senator Lott that if we have finished with the \nInterior bill on Thursday night, my expectation would be we would not \nhave any rollcall votes on Friday.\n  I will shortly make a unanimous consent request with regard to the \nschedule tomorrow. We are not quite prepared to do that at this time. \nBut until that time, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Friday, June 29, I was necessarily \nabsent because I was needed in New Mexico. Anyone who is familiar to \nNew Mexico knows that water is a matter of life and future for us. On \nthis day, the Department of interior, the Attorney General for the \nState of New Mexico, the State Engineer, the Interstate Stream \nCommission, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District and the city of \nAlbuquerque all reached a 3-year agreement regarding one of the \nendangered species, the Silvery Minnow on the Rio Grande River.\n  There are many parties interested in the needs and recovery of the \nminnow and many groups have been working on river and riparian \necosystem restoration efforts upstream. The settlement proposal \nmentions that naturalized refuges are a necessary component of saving \nthe silvery minnow and I remain committed to helping make that happen \nover the next three years.\n  This agreement temporarily solves one of the most difficult to solve \nwater problems on the Rio Grande. I can't think of an issue that \naffects more New Mexicans, for this reason I decided that it was \nessential that I be in New Mexico and therefore, necessarily absent.\n  I would have voted for the First substitute version of the Patients \nBill of Rights had I been in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7418-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7418-S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, ``The system may well be allowing some \ninnocent defendants to be executed.''\n  Were these the words of Governor George Ryan, the Illinois Governor \nwho placed a moratorium on executions last year? They could have been, \nbut they were not. Were these the words of an attorney defending \nsomeone facing the death penalty? They could have been, but they were \nnot. Rather, these were the remarkable words of Supreme Court Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor--the same Justice O'Connor who has generally \nsupported the death penalty during her twenty years on the Court, the \nsame Justice O'Connor who has championed states' rights, including the \nright to carry out executions, the same Justice O'Connor who joined or \nwrote key opinions that made it more difficult for defendants facing \nthe death penalty to have their state sentences overturned in federal \ncourt, and the same Justice O'Connor who voted in favor of allowing \nexecutions of teenage children who committed crimes at age 16 or 17.\n  Justice O'Connor said, ``After 20 years on the high court, I have to \nacknowledge that serious questions are being raised about whether the \ndeath penalty is being fairly administered in this country.'' She \nuttered these words at a meeting before the Minnesota Women Lawyers in \nMinneapolis last Monday. Coincidentally, Justice O'Connor made these \nremarks on the 25th anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1976 Gregg v. \nGeorgia decision, which reinstated the death penalty as we know it \ntoday. Only four years earlier, in 1972, the Court had found the death \npenalty unconstitutional. But in Gregg, the Court found that sufficient \nsafeguards\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\nhad been implemented to allow states to resume use of the death \npenalty.\n\n  Since the Gregg decision, over 700 people have been executed in the \nUnited States and today over 3,700 people sit on death row awaiting \nexecution. Since the Gregg decision, the rate of executions have \nincreased: from one execution in 1981 to 98 executions in 1999, 85 in \n2000, and 39 so far this year.\n  Justice O'Connor also said, ``Unfortunately, as the rate of \nexecutions have increased, problems in the way which the death penalty \nhas been administered have become more apparent.'' She also said, \n``Perhaps most alarming among these is the fact that if statistics are \nany indication, the system may well be allowing some innocent \ndefendants to be executed.''\n  Justice O'Connor now joins Supreme Court Justices Harry Blackmun and \nLewis Powell, who also late in their lives came to reconsider their \nsupport of the death penalty.\n  But most importantly Justice O'Connor now joins the growing chorus of \nAmericans who are concerned about the risk of executing the innocent \nand the fairness of the administration of the death penalty.\n  Congress can and should play a role in ensuring fairness. We can \ncreate an independent, blue ribbon panel to review the fairness of the \nadministration of the death penalty at the state and federal levels. \nWith so many serious concerns about how the death penalty is applied by \nthe States and Federal Government, a simple, yet necessary, step is to \ncreate a commission to review these concerns. In addition, the Federal \nGovernment and all States that authorized the use of capital punishment \nshould suspend executions while a thorough review of the death penalty \nsystem is undertaken.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator \nLeahy that will take some important steps towards reducing the risk of \nexecuting the innocent, the Innocence Protection Act. But more can be \ndone and Congress should do more. Congress should create a national \ncommission on the death penalty and support a moratorium on executions \nwhile the commission conducts its work.\n  If we can agree that the system is flawed and runs the risk of \nexecuting innocent people, then we can also agree that we should \nundertake a thorough top-to-bottom review of the death penalty system. \nAnd while we do so, it is simply unjust to proceed with executions. I \nurge my colleagues to sponsor the National Death Penalty Moratorium \nAct. Congress should do everything it can to prevent even one innocent \nperson from being sentence to death.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7419-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 20, \n1991 in Russian River, CA. A 45-year-old gay man, Joseph Mitchell, was \nstabbed to death along Highway 116 by a hitchhiker. Paul Daniel Huyck, \n19, was arrested in Springfield, Oregon the first week of January 1992 \nin connection with the crime. He was charged with murder and violation \nof parole.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7419-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NEW MEXICO FLOOD AND FEMA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nacting quickly last summer in sending support to the Los Alamos \ncommunity following the Cerro Grande fires. This swift response, \ncoupled with the work of County officials, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers helped control \nanother act of mother nature that befell Los Alamos this past week.\n  Torrential rainstorms struck the region resulting in substantial \nflooding. In some areas the water swelled 60 feet as 1.75 inches of \nrain fell in less than one hour. Roads flooded and pavement was \nuprooted. Although at least six homes were evacuated, post-fire flood \nmitigation efforts prevented a much greater calamity.\n  Federal and local officials recognized a year ago that some of the \nfire damage created infrastructure problems that could lead to future \nflooding. This foresight proved decisive against the rushing \nfloodwaters.\n  For example, the largest bridge in the town of Los Alamos--which \nspans the Pueblo Canyon--was saved by Congress' action and the efforts \nof the Army Corps of Engineers. Last year, recognizing the potential \nfor floods, the Corps extended an 18-inch culvert to 7 feet in record \ntime. I visited the culvert site during construction and was very \nimpressed with the skill, dedication, and professionalism of the Corps \nof Engineers crew.\n  During the recent storms, the water swelled 55 feet and was within \nfive feet from the top of the bridge. The bridge withstood the \npressure, which it could not have done without the culvert. Without \nthat culvert, the waters would have flowed over the roadway and \nprobably destroyed the road and bridge. It would have cost $15 million \nto replace the bridge.\n  More importantly, if the bridge had been destroyed half of the \ncommunity would have been cut off from the laboratories and from all \npaved access to services and hospital facilities. Instead of direct \naccess to the town, residents north of the bridge would have been \nrerouted twenty miles on dirt roads that traverse deep canyons.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, this culvert and other mitigation \nmeasures protected Los Alamos from its second natural disaster in two \nyears. This is in large part due to the actions of my colleagues in \nCongress, and for this I extend my utmost gratitude. This assistance \nhelped the people of Los Alamos to once again persevere against the \nodds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7419-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SOUTH CAROLINA PEACHES\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize South Carolina's \npeach farmers for their hard work and their delicious peaches.\n  Today, peaches from my home State have been delivered to offices \nthroughout the Senate and the U.S. Capitol. Thanks to South Carolina's \npeach farmers, those of us here in Washington will be able to cool off \nfrom the summer heat with delicious peaches.\n  For a relatively small State, South Carolina is second in the Nation \nin peach production. In fact, this year farmers across my State planted \nmore than 16,000 acres of peaches. However, a late freeze has reduced \nthis year's crop size by 40 percent. Nevertheless, South Carolina's \npeach farmers wanted to give us, here in Washington, a taste of South \nCarolina. And as my colleagues can attest, these are some of the finest \npeaches produced anywhere in the United States.\n  As we savor the taste of these peaches, we should remember the work \nand labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. While \nAmericans enjoy peaches for appetizers, entrees and desserts, most do \nnot stop to consider where they come from. Farmers will be laboring all \nsummer in the heat and humidity to bring us what we call the ``perfect \ncandy.'' What else curbs a sweet tooth, is delicious, nutritious and \nsatisfying, but not fattening?\n  The truth is, our farmers are too often the forgotten workers in our \ncountry. Through their dedication and commitment, our Nation is able to \nenjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other \nfoods. In fact, our agricultural system, at times, is the envy of the \nworld.\n  As Senators and their staff feast on these delicious peaches, I hope \nthey will remember the people in South Carolina who made this endeavor \npossible: The South Carolina Peach Council, David Winkles and the \nentire South Carolina Farm Bureau. They have all worked extremely hard \nto ensure that the U.S. Senate gets a taste of South Carolina.\n  I am sure everyone in our Nation's Capitol will be smiling as they \nenjoy these delicious South Carolina peaches.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7420-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Now ten years later, Court TV has \naired more than 732 trials nationally and provides more than 60 million \nhouseholds with the opportunity to watch trials--as well as other \ncriminal justice-related programming--on a daily basis.\n  During those years, Court TV has provided the Nation with an \nextraordinary civics lesson, enabling Americans to see their own \ncriminal justice system first-hand. Viewers have seen some of the \nnation's finest judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys at work and \nhave watched the judicial process unfold--with the benefit of expert \ncommentators and analysts. As part of that civics lesson, Court TV has \nenabled viewers to watch live trial coverage--for the first time ever--\nof cases involving such issues as, among other things: appellate \narguments, breach of contract, jury selection, libel, medical \nmalpractice, negligence, parole hearings, product liability, and even \nwar crimes.\n  Mr. President, Court TV has also made a special commitment to helping \nreduce youth violence. Its public affairs initiative, ``Choices and \nConsequences,'' has received the cable television industry's highest \npublic service award, the Golden Beacon Award, for its efforts to keep \nour Nation's children out of our Nation's courts. A middle school \ncurriculum, based on trial coverage of cases involving youth offenders, \nhas been provided to more than 10,000 schools. A new high school \ncurriculum, which addresses bullying among other issues, is now \navailable online and through Court TV's ``Cable in the Classroom'' \nfeed. Cable television operators in more than 50 cities in 24 states, \nplus the District of Columbia, have also partnered with Court TV in \nsupporting ``Your Town'' town meetings, which have addressed a wide \nrange of issues affecting adolescents and have been aired nationally.\n  Earlier this year, Court TV chairman and CEO Henry Schleiff was \nhonored to be joined by the Speaker of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, J. Dennis Hastert, as well as Minority Leader Richard \nGephardt and our colleague, Senator Sam Brownback, among other \nCongressional leaders, in announcing a new ``media literacy'' campaign \ndesigned to help students distinguished between the positive and \nnegative images that they see in all forms of media--and to help them \nunderstand the consequences of actions in the real world that may seem \ninconsequential onscreen.\n  Court TV offers a unique mix of programming, including trial coverage \nby day and compelling stories of the criminal justice system in the \nevening. That mix has now made Court TV the fastest-growing basic cable \nnetwork in the nation. Its growth is testament to the fact that high-\nquality programming can be both educational and entertaining.\n  Today, I am pleased to recognize the important contribution that \nCourt TV has made to public understanding of the judicial branch of \nGovernment and to criminal justice issues more broadly, and we applaud \nand encourage its continued efforts to work with our nation's schools \nto reduce youth violence and help students understand that choices made \nin a moment can have consequences for a lifetime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7420-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7420-S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PHOENIX HOME LIFE MUTUAL \n                           INSURANCE COMPANY\n\n Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nPhoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company as it celebrates its 150th \nanniversary.\n  From its modest birth in 1851 as the Hartford-based American \nTemperance Life Insurance Company, the Phoenix has evolved into one of \nthe largest and most well-respected insurance companies in the world. \nIt has weathered many global watersheds of the nineteenth and twentieth \ncenturies--including civil war, depressions, and world wars. But true \nto its name, the Phoenix has emerged from these and other trials with \nan unswerving commitment to corporate innovation, social progress, and \ncommunity service.\n  The Phoenix's corporate ethos thrives on a unique and important \nprinciple--one that encourages employees to invest human capital as a \nmeans of promoting community development. As a result, Phoenix serves \nas a paradigm for businesses truly committed to improving the quality \nof life of the people they serve. In 2000 alone, the Phoenix Foundation \ncontributed $1.6 million to charitable organizations across the \ncountry.\n  The Phoenix encourages its employees to devote 80 hours of company \nand personal time to community activities each year. The company also \nrewards its top 20 professional advisors through the Donor Award \nProgram, which enables award recipients to designate up to $2,000 to a \nlocal charity. Over the years, the Donor Award Program has provided \nvital funds to many organizations, including the Juvenile Diabetes \nFoundation, Lou Gehrig Baseball, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \nFurthermore, Phoenix field offices have established a plethora of \nindependent donation programs--many of which have benefited \norganizations such as the American Cancer Society, Habitat for \nHumanity, the YMCA, and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.\n  I am proud that the Phoenix's commitment to community development has \nhelped many local organizations in the State of Connecticut. By lending \ntheir professional expertise, leadership, and time to a number of local \noutreach initiatives, Phoenix employees have worked assiduously to make \na difference in their communities. For example, Phoenix employees in \nthe Hartford office work in conjunction with Foodshare each summer to \ndeliver vegetables donated by Connecticut farmers to area soup kitchens \nand homeless shelters. And in 1999, a group of Phoenix employees \nplanned and organized Connecticut's first Adoption and Foster Care \nExposition--an event that successfully promoted greater public \nawareness of these two important social issues.\n  The Phoenix has made significant contributions to the education of \nchildren. Through long-term partnerships with local schools such as the \nFred D. Wish Elementary School in Hartford, Phoenix employees have \nworked individually with students in grades three through six to \nsharpen math skills and proficiency in the language arts. As a result, \nschools are seeing improved student attendance and higher student test \nscores. Phoenix also contributed $75,000 toward the establishment of \nthe Trinity College Boys and Girls Clubs--two Hartford-based \norganizations that provide education, culture, citizenship, health, and \nphysical education programs for neighborhood children and adolescents. \nIn terms of higher education, the Phoenix annually contributes $250,000 \nto a matching gifts program. The company has also spearheaded a $3 \nmillion ``Legacy Campaign'' to sustain and cultivate the\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nWalter J. ``Doc'' Hurley Foundation. Phoenix's generous contribution to \nthis worthy campaign will assist high school students in Connecticut \nand across the country through various scholarship and guidance \nprograms.\n  In recent years, Phoenix has made a strong commitment toward \npromoting the Special Olympics. In 1995, the company pledged an eight-\nyear commitment to Special Olympics International as its first Official \nWorldwide Partner, setting a new and unprecedented standard for civic \nresponsibility, a standard that few corporations can match. When the \nSpecial Olympics World Games were held in New Haven, CN, six years ago, \nover 60 percent of Phoenix employees volunteered their time while field \noffices across the country raised money to assist local chapters with \ntravel and lodging expenses.\n  Over the past decade, much of the Phoenix's financial vitality and \ncommunity commitment can be attributed to the hard work and vision of \nRobert W. Fiondella, the company's President and Chief Executive \nOfficer. Since taking the reigns of Phoenix in 1992, Mr. Fiondella has \nsuccessfully undertaken the challenge of further molding and guiding \nthe company in this new evolving era of business. With more than 30 \nyears of experience, Bob Fiondella represents the epitome of the \nPhoenix tradition by dedicating himself to both the company and the \nsurrounding community.\n  In its 150 years of existence, the Phoenix has become an \nindispensable asset to people and businesses of Connecticut and the \ncountry. Its contributions to both the business world and surrounding \ncommunities have been tremendous. It is therefore with great \nappreciation that I offer congratulations to the Phoenix Home Life \nMutual Insurance Company on its 150th anniversary, and wish the company \nand all those associated with it continued success for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7421-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7421-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the President Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7421-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7421-S7422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2661.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe active business definition relating to distributions of stock and \nsecurities of controlled corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce tax legislation \nwhich proposes only a small technical modification of current law, but, \nif enacted, would provide significant simplification of routine \ncorporate reorganizations. The legation is identical to S. 773 which I \nintroduced on April 13 of last year.\n  This proposed change is small but very important. It would not alter \nthe substance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly \nsimplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change \nwill alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary \nexpenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their \nbusinesses.\n  Past Treasury Departments have agreed, and I have no reason to \nbelieve the current Treasury Department will feel any differently, that \nthis change would bring welcome simplification to section 355 of the \nInternal Revenue Code. Indeed, the Clinton Administration in its last \nbudget submission to the Congress had proposed this change. The last \nscoring of this proposal showed no loss of revenue to the U.S. \nGovernment, and I am aware of no opposition to its enactment.\n  Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it \nadvantageous , or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. \nThe division of AT from its local telephone companies is an example \nof such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are \nmany, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to \nfocus on one core business.\n  At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders \nsimply have the stock of two corporations,\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\ninstead of one. The Tax Code recognizes this is not an event that \nshould trigger tax, as it includes corporate divisions among the tax-\nfree reorganization provisions.\n  One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very \nawkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of \ncorporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and \nburdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for \na single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward \nspinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I \npropose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary \ntransactions, while keeping the statue true to Congress's original \npurpose.\n  More specifically, section 355, and related provision of the Code, \npermits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide \non a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate \nbusinesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a \ncorporate division, or ``spinoff,'' including continuity of historical \nshareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business \npurpose, and absence of any device to distribute earning and profits. \nIn addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate \nentities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The \nproposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of \nthe Code.\n  Section 355(b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or ``look \nthrough'' rule for groups of corporations that operate active \nbusinesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a \nholding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active \nbusiness.\n  This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that \n``substantially all'' of the assets of the holding company consist of \nstock of active controlled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this \nlanguage is to prevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if \nthey own almost any other assets. This is in sharp contrast to \ncorporations that operate businesses directly, which can own \nsubstantial assets unrelated to the business and still engage in tax-\nfree spinoff transactions.\n  In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound \nbusiness reasons, hold other assets, such as non-controlling, less than \n80 percent, interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that \nhave been owned for less than five years, which are not considered \n``active businesses'' under section 355, or a host of non-business \nassets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff \ntransactions, but because of the awkward language used in section \n355(b)(2)(A), they must first undertake one or more, often a series of, \npreliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with \nthis inexplicable language of the Code.\n  Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and \nwithout any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere \nwith business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to \nbe prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound \nbusiness transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the \ncorporation and the businesses it operates.\n  There is no tax policy reasons, tax advisors agree, to require the \nreorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the \nactive conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor \nis there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single \noperating companies. Indeed, no one has ever suggested one. The \nlegislative history indicates Congress was concerned about non-\ncontrolled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, no \nconsolidated groups.\n  For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single \ncorporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the \nproblem created by the awkward language of section 355(b)(2)(A) is to \napply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a \nsingle entity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF ACTIVE BUSINESS DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 355(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (defining active conduct of a trade or business) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes \n     of subparagraph (A), all corporations that are members of the \n     same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) shall \n     be treated as a single corporation.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions or transfers after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1159. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to repair and \nexpand a wave attenuation system to protect fishermen and other boaters \nand promote the welfare of the town of Lubec, Maine; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lubec Safe \nHarbor Act of 2001.\n  Small communities up and down the coast of Maine literally depend \nupon the sea for their survival. From the rich fishing grounds that \nsupply Maine's great fishing industry to the beautiful coastlines that \ndraw tourist by both land and water, the sea provides Maine's coastal \ncommunities with their livelihoods.\n  But while the sea provides life and income to Maine's coastal \ncommunities, it can also take back what it gives.\n  One small community in Maine that has been particularly hard hit by \nthe sea's fury is Lubec. In 1997, a winter storm took the lives of two \nLubec fishermen.\n  Earlier this year, storms destabilized the existing wave attenuation \nsystem in Lubec and consequently caused extensive damage to the Lubec \nmarina. The destruction has been very difficult for this small town, \nwhose existence, like many coastal Maine communities, is largely \ndependent on fishing and tourists who arrive by boat. Without the \nattenuator, the marina, the pier, and the harbor will cease to function \neffectively. Without a harbor, Lubec can neither support its fishing \nindustry nor provide landing capacity for tour boats. Without a safe \nberth for their boats, the lives of Lubec's fishermen are further at \nrisk.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that directs the Army Corps of \nEngineers to construct a wave attenuation system for the Town of Lubec. \nFor the sake of the safety of the fishermen of Lubec and the well being \nof the community, this legislation directs the Army Corps to begin work \nimmediately. My legislation authorizes $2.2 million dollars for the \nArmy Corps to complete this project.\n  I call upon my colleagues to recognize the urgency of this situation. \nThe longer Lubec goes without a safe harbor, the greater the risk to \nthe lives of Lubec's fishermen, and the greater the threat to the \neconomic well-being of this coastal community. I ask my colleagues to \nhelp me pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Snowe. I know she will also work very hard on behalf of the \npeople of Lubec to see this legislation enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1160. A bill to amend section 1714 of title 38, United States \nCode, to modify the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide dog-guides to blind veterans and authorize the provision of \nservice dogs to hearing-impaired veterans and veterans with spinal cord \ninjuries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that would make guide dogs more available to veterans in need.\n  Service dogs, or ``guide dogs'', have traditionally been viewed as \nbeing helpful only to those who are visually impaired. However, in \nrecent years, primarily as a result of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, there has been a push to find alternative methods of providing \nassistance to people with various kinds of disabilities. While there \nhave been many technological developments in this field, there still \nremains a need for long-term assistance that allows for the most \npossible independence on the part of the disabled individual.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n  Specifically, my legislation would enable the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to provide hearing-impaired veterans and veterans with spinal \ncord injury or dysfunction, in addition to blind veterans, the ability \nto obtain service dogs to assist them with everyday activities.\n  There are numerous ways in which service dogs can assist their \nowners. Tasks such as opening and closing doors, turning switches on \nand off, carrying bags, and dragging a person to safety in the case of \nan emergency are just a few of the standard duties for service dogs. \nTheir ability to perform these types of duties makes them invaluable to \nthose who require day-to-day aid. Having this sort of assistance can \nmake a big difference in terms of offering not only physical support, \nbut companionship as well.\n  Various types of evidence illustrate the value of companion pets, not \njust to the disabled, but to everyone. The Journal of the American \nMedical Association published a trial study a few years ago that \nexamined the impact of service dogs on the lives of people with \ndisabilities--both in terms of economic and social impacts.\n  With regard to social considerations, researchers found that all \nparticipants had increased levels of self-esteem, independence, and \ncommunity integration. The economic benefit was exemplified through a \nsharp decrease in the number of paid assistance hours. Overall, the \nJAMA study concluded that service dogs can greatly improve the quality \nof life for the disabled.\n  In closing, I extend my thanks to the Paralyzed Veterans Association, \nwho assisted me invaluably in preparing this legislation. Their hard \nwork and dedication to this issue have been a great help, and I am \nproud to have worked with them to develop this bill.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in seeking to provide greater \naccessibility to assistance for disabled veterans. They have sacrificed \nfor all of us, and deserve every effort we can make to restore their \nsense of independence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. MODIFICATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF AUTHORITY TO \n                   PROVIDE DOG-GUIDES AND SERVICE DOGS TO VETERANS \n                   WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Enhancement of Authority.--Subsection (b) of section \n     1714 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(b)(1) The Secretary may provide any blind veteran who is \n     entitled to disability compensation with--\n       ``(A) a dog-guide trained for the aid of the blind; and\n       ``(B) mechanical or electronic equipment for aid in \n     overcoming the disability of blindness.\n       ``(2) The Secretary may provide a service dog to the \n     following:\n       ``(A) Any hearing-impaired veteran who is entitled to \n     disability compensation.\n       ``(B) Any veteran with a spinal cord injury or dysfunction \n     who is entitled to disability compensation.\n       ``(3) In providing a dog-guide or service dog to a veteran \n     under this subsection, the Secretary may pay travel and \n     incidental expenses (under the terms and conditions set forth \n     in section 111 of this title) of the veteran to and from the \n     veteran's home and incurred in becoming adjusted to the dog-\n     guide or service dog, as the case may be.''.\n       (b) Conforming and Clerical Amendments.--(1) The section \n     heading of that section is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1714. Fitting and training in use of prosthetic \n       appliances; dog-guides and service dogs''.\n\n       (2) The table of section at the beginning of chapter 17 of \n     that title is amended by striking the item relating to \n     section 1714 and inserting the following new item:\n\n``1714. Fitting and training in use of prosthetic appliances; dog-\n              guides and service dogs.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 1161. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nstreamline procedures for the admission and extension of stay of \nnonimmigrant agricultural workers; to provide a stable, legal, \nagricultural work force; to extend basic legal protections and better \nworking conditions to more workers; to provide for a system of one-time \nearned adjustment to legal status for certain agricultural workers; and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined several \ncolleagues this week in introducing a new, improved version of the \nAgricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act, the \n``AgJOBS'' bill.\n  We are facing a growing crisis, for both farm workers and growers.\n  We want and need a stable, predictable, legal work force in American \nagriculture.\n  Willing American workers deserve a system that puts them first in \nline for available jobs with fair, market wages. We want all workers to \nreceive decent treatment and equal protection under the law.\n  Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply.\n  American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a \ngovernment that works.\n  Yet Americans are being threatened on all these counts, because of a \ngrowing labor shortage in agriculture, while the only program currently \nin place to respond, the H-2A Guest Worker Program, is profoundly \nbroken.\n  The problem is only growing worse. Therefore, we are introducing a \nnew, improved bill. The name of the bill says it all--``AgJOBS''.\n  Our farm workers need this reform bill.\n  There is no debate about whether many, or most, farm workers are \naliens.\n  They are. And they will be, for the foreseeable future. The question \nis whether they will be here legally or illegally.\n  Immigrants not legally authorized to work in this country know they \nmust work in hiding.\n  They cannot even claim basic legal rights and protections. They are \nvulnerable to predation and exploitation. They sometimes have been \nstuffed inhumanly into dangerously enclosed truck trailers and car \ntrunks, in order to be transported, hidden from the view of the law.\n  In fact, they have been known to pay ``coyotes'', labor smugglers, \n$1,000 and more to be smuggled into this country.\n  In contrast, legal workers have legal protections.\n  They can assert wage, safety, and other legal protections. They can \nbargain openly and join unions. H-2A workers, in fact, are even \nguaranteed housing and transportation.\n  Clearly, the status quo is broken.\n  Domestic American workers simply are not being found to fill \nagricultural jobs.\n  Our own government estimated that half of the total 1.6 million \nagricultural work force are not legally authorized to work in this \ncountry.\n  That estimate is probably low; it's based on self-disclosure by \nillegal workers to government interviewers.\n  Some actually have suggested that there is no labor shortage, because \nthere are plenty of illegal workers. This is not an acceptable answer.\n  Congress has shown its commitment over the past few years to improve \nthe security of our borders, both in the 1996 immigration law and in \nsubsequent appropriations.\n  Between computerized checking by the Social Security Administration \nand audits and raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nmore and more employers are discovering they have undocumented \nemployees; and more and more workers here illegally are being \ndiscovered and evicted from their jobs.\n  Outside of H-2A, employers have no reliable assurance that their \nemployees are legal.\n  It's worse than a Catch-22, the law actually punishes the employer \nwho could be called ``too diligent'' in inquiring into the \nidentification documents of prospective workers.\n  The H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, and inflexible. It does \nnothing to recognize the uncertainties farmers face, from changes in \nthe weather to global market demands.\n  The H-2A status quo is complicated and legalistic. DOL's compliance \nmanual alone is 325 pages.\n  The current H-2A process is so hard to use, it will place only about \n40,000 legal guest workers this year, 2 to 3 percent of the total \nagricultural work force.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n  Finally, the grower can't even count on his or her government to do \nits job.\n  A General Accounting Office study found that, in more than 40 percent \nof the cases in which employers filed H-2A applications at least 60 \ndays before the date of need, the DOL missed statutory deadlines in \nprocessing them.\n  The solution we need is the AgJOBS Act of 2001.\n  This is win-win legislation.\n  It will elevate and protect the rights, working conditions, and \nsafety of workers. It will help workers, first domestic American \nworkers, then other workers already here, then foreign guest workers, \nfind the jobs they want and need.\n  It will assure growers of a stable, legal supply of workers, within a \nprogram that recognizes market realities. The adjusted-worker \nprovisions also will give growers one-time assistance in adjusting to \nthe new labor market realities of the 21st Century.\n  It will assure all Americans of a safe, consistent, affordable food \nsupply.\n  The nation needs AgJOBS. I invite the rest of my colleagues to join \nus as cosponsors; and I urge the Senate and the House to act promptly \nto enact this legislation into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, & Security Act of 2001--\n                                Summary\n\n       AgJOBS II is legislation reforming the current, cumbersome \n     H-2A agricultural guest worker program and, for non-H-2A \n     agricultural workers, creating a program in which farmworkers \n     now in the U.S. without legal documentation could adjust to \n     legal status.\n       This bill builds on the significant progress made last \n     year, in legislation, hearings, and extensive discussions \n     among Members of Congress, the Administration, and the \n     agriculture community. This new bill chooses from among the \n     best ideas in similar legislation introduced in the 106th \n     Congress (S. 1814, the original Agricultural Job Opportunity, \n     Benefits, and Security Act (AgJOBS)) and other proposals and \n     ideas discussed before and since.\n       Enactment of H-2A reform and adjustment of status \n     legislation is critically important to the continued health \n     of American agriculture. Reform is needed to provide a \n     stable, legal workforce and to extend basic legal protections \n     and better conditions to more workers.\n       According to the federal government's own estimates, about \n     half of our 1.6 million agriculture work force is not legally \n     authorized to work here. This is certain to be a low \n     estimate, because it is based upon self-disclosure by illegal \n     workers to government interviewers.\n     Highlights of reforms to the H-2A program\n       American workers should have the first opportunity to hold \n     American jobs. When enough domestic farmworkers are not \n     available for upcoming work, growers currently are required \n     to go through a lengthy and uncertain process of \n     demonstrating that fact to the satisfaction of the federal \n     government. A GAO study found that, under the current system, \n     the Department of Labor misses processing deadlines 40 \n     percent of the time, which increases costly delays and \n     discourages use of the program.\n       The new bill would replace the current quagmire with a \n     streamlined ``attestation'' process like the one now used for \n     H-1B high-tech workers, speeding up certification of H-2A \n     employers and the hiring of guest workers.\n       The new bill sets the prevailing wage as the standard, \n     minimum wage for guest workers admitted under the H-2A \n     program, instead of the unrealistic ``premium'' wage \n     currently mandated on H-2A employers (called the Adverse \n     Economic Wage Rate), that often combines completely \n     dissimilar worker categories in computing one wage rate.\n       Participating employers would continue to furnish housing \n     and transportation for H-2A workers. Other current H-2A labor \n     protections for both H-2A and domestic workers would be \n     continued.\n     Highlights of the new status adjustment program\n       To qualify for adjustment to legal status, an incumbent \n     worker must have worked in the United States in agriculture \n     for at least 150 days in any 12-month period in the last 18 \n     months. (The average non-casual farm worker works 150 days a \n     year.) The bill creates a one-time adjustment opportunity, \n     only for experienced and valued workers who are already in \n     the United States by July 4, 2001.\n       To earn adjustment of status and the right to stay and work \n     legally in the United States, a qualified worker must \n     continue to work in U.S. agriculture at least 150 days a \n     year, in each of 4 of the next 6 years.\n       During this 4-6 year period, the adjusting worker would \n     have non-immigrant status and would be required to return to \n     his or her home country for at least 2 months a year, unless \n     he or she is the parent of a child born in the United States \n     (i.e., a U.S. citizen), gainfully employed, actively seeking \n     employment, or prevented by a serious medical condition from \n     returning home. The worker may also work in another industry, \n     as long as the agriculture work requirement is satisfied. The \n     worker would have to check in once a year with the INS to \n     verify compliance with the law and report his or her work \n     history.\n       Upon completion of the status adjustment program, the \n     adjusted worker would be eligible for legal permanent \n     resident status. Considering the time elapsed from when a \n     worker first applies to enter the adjustment process, this \n     gives adjusting workers no advantage over regular immigrants \n     beginning the legal immigration process at the same time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Campbell, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Carper):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleagues Senators Biden, McCain, Campbell, Mikulski \nand Carper, to recognize the courage and commitment of America's fire \nservice and to pay special tribute to those firefighters who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Specifically, this \nlegislation requires that the United States flag be flown at half-staff \nat all Federal facilities on the occasion of the annual National Fallen \nFirefighters Memorial Service at Emmitsburg, MD.\n  Our Nation's firefighters are among our most dedicated public \nservants. Indeed, few would question the fact that our fallen \nfirefighters are heroes. Throughout our Nation's history, we have \nrecognized the passing of our public servants by lowering our Nation's \nflag to half-staff in their honor. In the past, this list has included \nelected officials, members of the Armed Services and America's peace \nofficers. In my view, our fallen firefighters are equally deserving of \nthis high honor.\n  For the past nineteen years, a memorial service has been held on the \ncampus of the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, to honor those \nfirefighters who have given their lives while protecting the lives and \nproperty of their fellow citizens. Since 1981, the names of 2,081 \nfallen firefighters have been inscribed on plaques surrounding the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Memorial, a Congressionally designated \nmonument to these brave men and women. On October 7, at the 20th Annual \nNational Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service, an additional 93 names \nwill be added.\n  Over the years, I have worked very closely with the National Fallen \nFirefighters Foundation to ensure that the National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial Service is an occasion befitting the sacrifices that these \nindividuals have made. In my view, lowering the United States flag to \nhalf-staff is an essential component of this ``Day of Remembrance.'' It \nwill be a fitting tribute to the roughly 100 men and women who die each \nyear performing their duties as our Nation's career and volunteer \nfirefighters. It will also serve to remind us of the critical role \nplayed by the 1.2 million fire service personnel who risk their lives \nevery day to ensure our safety and that of our communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this joint resolution be printed in the \nRecord and urge my colleagues to support its swift passage.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 18\n\n       Whereas 1,200,000 men and women comprise the fire service \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the fire service is considered one of the most \n     dangerous jobs in the United States;\n       Whereas fire service personnel selflessly respond to over \n     16,000,000 emergency calls annually, without reservation and \n     with an unwavering commitment to the safety of their fellow \n     citizens;\n       Whereas fire service personnel are the first to respond to \n     an emergency, whether it involves a fire, medical emergency, \n     spill of hazardous materials, natural disaster, act of \n     terrorism, or transportation accident; and\n       Whereas approximately 100 fire service personnel die \n     annually in the line of duty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That each \n     year, the\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n     United States flags on all Federal facilities will be lowered \n     to half-staff on the day of the National Fallen Firefighters \n     Memorial Service in Emmitsburg, Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/10/senate-section/article/S7432-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 124--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC, \nAND ITS FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS, AND ALUMNI ON THE UNIVERSITY'S 150TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 125 submitted earlier today by \nSenators Cantwell and Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res 125) commemorating 72nd Major League \n     Baseball All-Star game and to congratulate the Seattle \n     Mariners on hosting the All-Star game and on their \n     extraordinary start to the season.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution \nto commemorate the 72nd Major League Baseball All-Star Game and to \ncongratulate the Seattle Mariners on their extraordinary start to the \nseason.\n  The game of baseball is widely considered America's pastime. Walt \nWhitman once said: ``I see great things in baseball. It's our game--the \nAmerican game. It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with \noxygen, give them a larger physical stoicism, tend to relieve us from \nbeing a nervous, dyspeptic set, repair these losses, and be a blessing \nto us.''\n  Baseball also has been a reflection of our nation's struggles and \ntriumphs. During the Civil War, soldiers played baseball during their \nfree moments, whether in a fort or in a prison camp. In 1942, President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt requested that professional baseball continue \nduring the war effort to help maintain our nation's morale, even as \nbaseball stars such as Ted Williams and Bob Feller contributed to the \nwar effort on the front lines as soldiers. During the civil rights \nmovement, Jackie Robinson epitomized the struggle of African Americans \nas he broke baseball's color barrier and continued to fight prejudice \nthroughout his career. Now today, as our world has become smaller, the \ngame has become larger, uniting fans and attracting star players from \naround the world.\n  The All-Star game is a showcase of this special sport and of \nbaseball's most talented players, selected by baseball fans around the \nworld and by All-Star Managers Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine. It is \nalso a broader celebration of baseball as fans are treated to not only \nthe All-Star game between the National League and the American League, \nbut other events as well, including a FanFest featuring interactive \ngames and displays, a homerun derby by baseball's greatest sluggers, a \ngame between the top minor league baseball prospects of the American \nLeague and National League, and a softball game featuring All-Star game \nlegends and other celebrities.\n  It is an honor and pleasure for the City of Seattle to once again \nhost this celebration. In 1979, Seattle hosted the 50th All-Star game \nin just the third season for the Seattle Mariners. After two years of \nplanning, Seattle gave baseball fans what is still considered one of \nthe greatest All-Star celebrations in the history of the event.\n  That year, the Mariners were represented by only one All-Star, first \nbaseman Bruce Bochte. A deserving player on a struggling team, Bochte \nhad a pinch-hit, run-scoring single that evening--the first hit and RBI \nfor a Mariners All-Star.\n  This season, as Seattle hosts the 72nd All-Star Game, the Mariners \nare represented by eight players and Manager Lou Piniella. The eight \nMariners players are the most to participate from one team since the \n1960 Pittsburgh Pirates also had eight players. This collection of \ntalent--and the hard work, discipline, and determination that these \nplayers have demonstrated to reach All-Star status--is at the core of \none of the best starts in Major League Baseball history. The Mariners \nhave compiled a 63-24 record, the fourth best of all time after 87 \ngames. Importantly though, the team's success has resulted not only \nfrom the talents of All-Stars Bret Boone, Mike Cameron, Freddy Garcia, \nEdgar Martinez, Jeff Nelson, John Olerud, Kazuhiro Sasaki, and Ichiro \nSuzuki, but the contributions and teamwork of each player and coach.\n  The work of Mariners General Manager Pat Gillick must also be \nrecognized. Mr. Gillick has shrewdly made trades and acquired free \nagents who have contributed to the improvement of the Mariners both \nyears he has been with the franchise. The result has been a team of \nremarkable consistency, discipline, and talent. Last year the Mariners \nfinished with a franchise-record 91 victories and this year they are on \npace to win over 110 games.\n  Once again, I would like to commemorate the 72nd Major League \nBaseball All-Star game and the remarkable start by the Seattle \nMariners.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
