Give our chosen \nleaders grace to bring more light than heat to the Senate floor in the \nnext 4 days and, in so doing, to move us ahead as a nation.\n  In the springtime of 2001, let the actions of this body help us to \nknow one more time that we really are ``one Nation under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''\n  We ask these things in that name which is above every name.

Mr. President, this week we are going to take up one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that will occur this entire \nCongress--not this year, not next year, but the entire Congress. That \nis the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--extremely important.\n  In the last Congress, we did not complete it. We were refused the \nopportunity to debate and amend this legislation--we, the Democrats, in \nthe minority. Things have changed now. The Senate is divided 50-50. The \ntime has come that we work together on this and all legislation.\n  Last week, we did some very important work. We only had one vote last\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nweek, but it was an extremely important vote. It was on brownfields \nlegislation, legislation that will allow people all over the State of \nNevada and all over the State of Minnesota to clean up spots that are \nlightly polluted. They are not Superfund sites, but they are sites that \nright now people are afraid to go onto and develop a shopping center or \na park, the reason being, if they go upon the land, there will be a \nliability under the Superfund legislation. So the brownfields \nlegislation, which passed last week 99-0, will allow these \napproximately 600,000 sites all over America to be cleaned up. It will \ncreate over half a million jobs. It will create tax revenues for local \ngovernments of about $2.5 billion. It is important legislation. It is \nnot the number of votes we have; it is what we do with them.\n  There is presently pending before the Senate a cloture vote. We are \nscheduled to take that tomorrow morning. I hope that will be vitiated, \nthat we can just go to consideration of the bill.\n  There have been negotiations on this bill that continued even during \nthe weekend. Staff and members of the committee worked very hard to \ncome up with something on which we can all agree. There has been, as I \nunderstand it, general agreement on the substance of the bill. And that \nis important.\n  So I repeat, I hope we will be able to vitiate the cloture vote \nscheduled tomorrow. The cloture vote is not only unnecessary; it is \nunproductive. It is counterproductive. All the parties have been \nworking in good faith in a bipartisan manner to work out the \ndifferences, just as we did with the brownfields legislation.\n  When this bill was reported out of committee, there were some \nproblems with it. It passed 15-3, but there were still some minor \nproblems. Even though we had an overwhelming majority when it came out \nof the committee, we said to those people who had some concerns, let's \ntry to work them out; and we did. That is why the bill passed 99-0. The \nsame can happen with this education legislation. People worked in good \nfaith, in a bipartisan manner. Let's try to copy what happened in \nbrownfields legislation.\n  There are two key areas in this legislation. The language differences \nI understand are pretty well resolved. There are some funding \ndifferences, and they have not been resolved. But I think we should do \nit the American way, the way we have been doing it in this country for \nover 200 years. Let's bring this bill to this body, and then we will \nhave votes as to what we should do for the children of America as it \nrelates to education.\n  It would be most unfortunate to not turn to the bill. It seems to me \nit is wrong not to work on this legislation, debate it, however it \nneeds to be debated. We need to work out the policy differences. It is \nmy understanding that that has pretty well been done.\n  As I indicated, when this bill was last worked on, we did not \ncomplete the legislation. That was unfortunate. We cannot repeat the \nmistake that was made in the last Congress. As I have indicated, this \nis potentially the most significant legislation this Congress will \nconsider. It has the potential to be a landmark act that will greatly \nimprove our Nation's educational system.\n  No one--not Democrats, Republicans, or this administration--disagrees \nabout the need for educational reform. The question is, How are we \ngoing to do it? Our schools are desperate for reform.\n  Just take the State of Nevada as an example. In one school district, \nwhich is the sixth largest school district in America--the Clark County \nSchool District--we have to build one new school every month to keep up \nwith growth. Twelve new schools a year just barely makes it. We need \nsome help. We not only need help in building and renovating schools in \nNevada--as I indicated, we are building new schools--but around America \nthe average school is almost 50 years old. We need to renovate those \nschools.\n  In some of the schools we talk about high tech and digital divide, \nand you can't put this equipment in these old schools. So we need help \nwith construction moneys. We need smaller classrooms and we need \ncurriculum reform.\n  I am not one who runs from people saying, well, this is a local \nproblem; Congress, stay out of it. Education is a national problem. I \ndon't apologize to anybody in indicating that Nevada needs help with \neducation. Take, for example, the schools in Nevada. They are no \ndifferent than in Minnesota, the State of the Presiding Officer. In the \nState of Minnesota, we are educating students because of a Federal \nedict for disadvantaged children, those who are handicapped because of \nemotional problems, physical problems, mental problems. I am glad we \nare doing that; they deserve an education just as any other child. But \nin Minnesota, Nevada, and the other 48 States, it costs a lot of money \nto educate these children--about 40 cents to a dollar more for every \nchild. But the Federal Government has not lived up to its \nresponsibility. We are paying less than 10 cents--far less than that--\nand because of that, local school districts have to get this money from \nother programs.\n  In the State of Nevada, in the Clark County School District, which I \nhave talked about, they are actually considering having children pay to \nplay football or basketball. They are actually considering having \nchildren pay to play sports. A lot of people can't afford to pay to \nhave their kids play football. But poor kids need character-building \nathletics just as much as do well-off kids. How can we say this isn't a \nnational problem? If in the Clark County district the Federal \nGovernment fully funded the program for educating the handicapped, they \nwould have this money, which is millions of dollars, to enrich these \ncurriculum programs, to do some of the things we know need to be done.\n  It is time to carry out reform. But we can't build a Cadillac model \nand fund it with a Model-T budget. We need to make sure that if we are \ngoing to have reforms, the reforms are something other than just words. \nIf we are going to do a lot of testing--and I think we do now, but some \nexperts believe testing in certain areas is needed--and we are going to \nhold back certain children from progressing--I was in my office today \nwith a nice looking little boy from Nevada. He is 9 years old. He is \nhere with his grandfather. I said: How are you doing? You are a fine-\nlooking young boy. What grade are you in?\n  He said: I am in the third grade, but I was held back.\n  I said: Don't you ever tell anybody that you were held back. There is \nnothing wrong with being held back.\n  Well, this is the point I am making. Holding children back makes them \nembarrassed. He had to blurt out to a Senator that he was held back. He \ntalked well and he was fine looking, and I am sure he will do fine. \nSome children need to be held back, but we need curriculum changes so \nif they are held back, they have summer enrichment programs so when the \nnew school year starts, they are right with their buddies, their \nfriends, with the little girls in the neighborhood. We have to make \nsure if we are going to do all this testing, this curriculum advantage \nstuff, they have enough money to give school districts the resources to \nhelp these children, so if they are held back, it is only on a \ntemporary basis.\n  I hope we all understand--and I know everyone does--how important the \neducation issue is. We can't play around with it. This cannot be a \npolitical game for the Republicans or the Democrats. Wouldn't it be \nnice if we buckled down and said, OK, this is what needs to be done, \nand then do it. Then we would all walk out of here--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and have a joint press conference for a change, have our \narms around each other saying we have improved education for kids in \nMinnesota, in Nevada, and every place else.\n\n  To do this, we are going to have to get off this kick that you can do \nit on the cheap. If we are going to do education reform right, it is \ngoing to cost money. It is going to cost taxpayers money--me, the \nPresiding Officer, all of us.\n  As Robert Kennedy said in a speech to a bunch of doctors when he was \ntelling them about the needs in health care reform, as he talked about \nsome of the things that needed to be done in education, the first \nquestion he was asked was: Who is going to pay for this? He said: You \nare.\n  Well, Mr. President, that is how it works. If we are going to do the \nthings that need to be done to take care of children in America, we are \nall going to have to pitch in and pay for it. It may mean that we are \ngoing to have a tax cut that is less than $1.6 trillion. It may mean \nthat over the 10-year period we are going to have to have a few billion \nthat will go to education rather\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nthan tax cuts. Approximately 50 percent of the taxpayers will get the \nadvantage out of the Bush tax cut. The top 1 percent will get 40, 50 \npercent of the tax cut. I will bet you we could go to every one of \nthose so-called rich people and there isn't a single one of them who \nwould object to lowering their tax break a little bit to help the kids \nof America have a better education. There isn't a single one. If there \nare, they would be very few. People in America want kids to have a good \neducation.\n  So I say let's forget about the cloture vote, stop the posturing, and \nlet's all join to reform education and pay for the reform. Let's not \nreform education and leave it without the resources to do so. Let's not \nhave reform in name only. That would not help anyone.\n  We are very close to reaching agreement over the general principles \nthat would serve as a foundation of this legislation. I hope the \nmajority leader will vitiate the vote set for tomorrow, allow these \nissues to be resolved and just bring it to the floor, and we will start \ndebating the issues. I expect that we can work this out without a lot \nof trouble. We could do it orderly. It would be a way to efficiently \nconsider the bill.\n  So, again, I hope we realize that if there was ever an issue that \ncalls for a bipartisan approach, it is educating the kids in our public \nschool system. I am very favorably impressed that President Bush \ndropped his voucher proposal. He dropped it because it would not work. \nThe money that was called for would only help rich people because, with \nthe amount of money the poor student would get, they could not go to \nthe private schools anyway. I appreciate the President backing off of \nthat.\n  Now what we need to do is stop quibbling over a few dollars. I say a \nfew dollars because when you compare the few billion dollars--less than \n$10 billion--it would take to have a meeting of the minds on this bill \nto a $1.6 trillion tax cut, it is really not much money. I hope we can \ndo that. I think it would set such a great tone for this country. In \nevery poll conducted in America, the No. 1 issue is education. Let's \njoin together so we can say we improved education for the children of \nAmerica. I think that would make a pretty good Congress and make us all \nhappy and make the American people happy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, again on behalf of Majority Leader Lott, \nSenators are reminded that cloture was filed on the motion to proceed \nto the education bill last week. That vote will occur at 9:30 a.m. \ntomorrow. Following the vote, the Senate is expected to begin the 30 \nhours of postcloture debate. It is hoped that the debate time will not \nbe necessary and that the Senate can begin action on that bill during \nTuesday's session. Senators are further advised that they should be \nprepared for votes throughout the week.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly will yield.\n  Mr. REID. I stated before the distinguished Senator from Ohio \narrived, I think there should be some consideration given to vitiating \nthe cloture vote. I hope the Senator will transfer that information to \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will, indeed.\n  Mr. REID. We believe, on this side on the substantive issues, \neverybody is almost there. It appears the only difference we have is \nwith the dollar numbers. The motion to proceed will be agreed to \noverwhelmingly anyway. It seems to me it will set the wrong tone for \nthis important legislation if we have to go to it by a cloture motion \nhaving been filed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4021-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4021-S4025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SAVING OUR SCHOOLS: EDUCATION REFORM IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the issue before us now, education reform \nin our elementary and secondary public schools, is certainly one of the \nmost important issues facing our Nation. Education is something about \nwhich we all care passionately. I have a deep personal interest in \neducation as a Ohioan and especially as a parent of eight children and \nalso now the grandparent of six. I believe that a quality education for \na child today is the key to that child's quality of life in the future. \nAs parents and grandparents and citizens of our States and communities, \nwe have an obligation to ensure that all children receive a solid \neducation.\n  Failing to properly educate our children puts them at risk. As \nPresident John Kennedy once said: ``A child miseducated is a child \nlost.'' That is a child lost to ignorance. A child lost to drugs, \nalcohol, or violence. A child lost to poverty and apathy.\n  As we debate reform of our schools, I believe it is vital that we \nlook at exactly where we are as a society and how this is affecting our \npublic education system. Our society, as I see it, is divided along \neconomic and educational lines. This division is nothing new. Scholars \nand sociologists have been warning us for years that this is where our \nNation was heading, particularly if we did not properly educate our \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, we did not heed the warnings, and as a result, our \nNation today is a nation split into two Americas: One where children \nget educated, and one where they do not. This gap in educational \nknowledge and the gap in economic standing is entrenching thousands \nupon thousands of children into an underclass and into futures filled \nwith poverty and little hope and little opportunity.\n  That is exactly what is happening in my home State of Ohio and, \ntragically, what is happening across our country. Ohio generally is a \nmicrocosm of what we see in the country. When we look at this growing \ngap, the development of the two Americas, what we see in Ohio is also \nwhat we see in our Nation.\n  In Ohio, growing income and educational disparities are creating our \nvery own permanent underclass, especially in Ohio inner cities and in \nAppalachia.\n  What we see in Ohio, if I can take the Presiding Officer and Members \nof the Senate to Ohio, is something we see in many States. Most of Ohio \nis doing very well economically and doing well educationally. The \nchildren have a great future.\n  When we look across Ohio, we see two areas where that is not taking \nplace, where the children are not being educated as well as we would \nlike and where the income level shows that disparity. One place is in \nAppalachia. There are 20 or 25 counties in Ohio that are Appalachian \ncounties. The other area is in our core cities. Call them the inner \ncities. Call them the core cities. Either way, this is where we face \nmost of our challenges.\n  We cannot underestimate or understate this problem. It is a problem \nthat is not unique to Ohio. Rather, it is a huge societal problem, \nwhich is pushing society farther and farther apart, not closer and \ncloser together. It is a problem we must address.\n  How do we do that? How do we enable children in the underclass to \nrise above their circumstances, those circumstances which are beyond \ntheir control? How do we bring about equality and opportunity so each \nchild has a chance to lead a full, meaningful, productive life as an \nadult?\n\n  I believe the best way we can get to these children before we lose \nthem is through education. Horace Mann, a former president of Antioch \nCollege in Yellow Springs, OH--a community where my wife and I grew \nup--who is known as the father of public education, once said:\n\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\n\n       Education, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the \n     great equalizer, the great equalizer of the conditions of man \n     --the balance-wheel of the social machinery.\n\n  This is exactly what education can and should do. It should provide \nall children, regardless of their economic circumstances or family \nbackgrounds, with the tools they need to make it as adults in our \nsociety, with the tools necessary to rise above individual situations \nof poverty and instability, individual situations of hopelessness and \ndespair.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, today's educational system is \nnot always meeting this goal. Do not get me wrong. I am not blaming the \nschools for all of society's ills. Rather, I am suggesting that we as a \nsociety are failing to use the power and the potential of our schools \nto the maximum extent to help give our children the futures they really \ndeserve. No matter where a child lives, whether in Portsmouth, OH, or \nNew York City, every one of the 1.8 million children in the Ohio public \nschool system and every one of the nearly 47 million children in public \nschools nationwide, deserves the opportunity to learn and to become \neducated.\n  Let's face it; our schools have our children in their custody 7 or 8 \nhours a day, 5 days a week. That is not a lot of time, but it is time \nour schools and our country simply cannot afford to waste. A line from \na 1970 song says ``your dreams were your ticket out.'' For all too many \nchildren, children living in poverty and in broken homes, dreams alone \nare not enough. For those children, a dream and a solid education is \ntheir ticket out.\n  This is not a new concept. Historically, our schools have been the \nbest opportunity for children to move out, to move up, to advance, to \nchange their lives. Education has built our Nation. We are truly a \nnation of immigrants, immigrants who, because of public schools, \nescaped ignorance, illiteracy, and lives of poverty. A strong public \neducation tradition in this country kept entire generations from being \nmarginalized and left behind. For them, education was their ticket \nout--their ticket out of despair and toward opportunity.\n  When education is not working to give our kids the tools they need to \nmove ahead in life, those children suffer. Many of them, for example, \ndon't get their high school diplomas. Look at some of the class of 2000 \ngraduation rates for my home State of Ohio; look at urban centers. In \nAkron, OH, 72 percent of the city's high school children graduated last \nyear. That is actually a high rate for an urban area. In Toledo, only \n67 percent graduated. In Columbus, it was only 62 percent; Youngstown, \n59 percent; Dayton, 57 percent; Canton, 53 percent; Cincinnati, 51 \npercent; and in Cleveland, only 34 percent of the students who started \nhigh school actually finished.\n  Yes, that is right. Only one-third of the students in Cleveland, OH, \ngraduated. Two-thirds did not.\n  Before anyone becomes too complacent or thinks maybe they don't have \nthis problem in their States, let me remind the Members of the Senate \nthat these statistics are not unusual nor only for the State of Ohio. \nThey are typical of urban centers and urban areas. My guess is that if \nwe look at the other major cities in this country we will find similar, \ndisturbing statistics.\n\n  There is something wrong when we see statistics such as this. There \nis something wrong in Ohio and this country when that many children are \nnot graduating. There is also something wrong in this country when \nnearly one-third of college freshman must take remedial courses before \nthey can begin regular college level course work.\n  There is something wrong in this country when one-third of fourth \ngraders cannot read. The National Assessment of Educational Progress \ntested 8,000, fourth graders across the country for reading skills and \nranks them according to four levels of achievement: advanced, \nproficient, basic, and below basic. Tragically, 37 percent of those \ntested scored below basic. In other words, 37 percent of those children \nbasically could not read. It gets even worse when you break the ``below \nbasic'' group into categories. Sixty-three percent of African American \nfourth graders came into the category, 58 percent Hispanic, 47 percent \nof urban students, and 60 percent of poor children. All of them scored \nbelow basic, meaning they simply cannot read in the fourth grade.\n  I also wonder about another statistic. Nearly three out of four \nteenagers today attend a high school with an enrollment of more than \n1,000 students. I repeat, three-fourths of teenagers today attend high \nschools with enrollments topping 1,000 students. I worry about that. I \nworry about students in such big schools where it is too easy, many \ntimes, to get lost. I think we need to look at that.\n  Where do we go from here? How do we go about changing our societal \nmindset and our perceptions and our negligence in this country? The \nfirst thing we need to do is recognize that the answers lie mainly in \nthe hands of parents, in our local communities, among our local school \nboards, and among our State and local governments--not in Washington.\n  Nevertheless, Congress has a role to play, although a small one, in \nprioritizing or directing our limited Federal dollars where they can \nbest help disadvantaged students in disadvantaged districts.\n  I believe the best place to begin on the Federal level is by \nrestoring accountability and achievement with the single most important \nresource in the classroom--the teacher. When I think about teachers, I \nthink about something else that Horace Mann once said: ``Teaching is \nthe most difficult of all arts and the most profound of all sciences.''\n  I can certainly attest to that. As a college senior at Miami \nUniversity in Oxford, OH, I spent 4\\1/2\\ months student teaching at \nPrinceton High School, a high school north of the city of Cincinnati. \nThat was tough work. Teaching is tough. Teaching was one of the hardest \nthings I have ever done in my life. It was then I learned, firsthand \nfor the first time, that Ohio and America's teachers don't get the \nrespect, the admiration, nor the salaries they deserve. There is \nsomething wrong with that. There is something wrong with a system and a \nsociety that doesn't value the teaching profession as highly as other \nprofessions. Teachers, after all, shape lives. A good teacher has the \npower to fundamentally change the course of a child's life.\n  I am sure each one of us in the Senate can recall at least one great \nteacher who inspired us, who motivated us, who, yes, changed our lives. \nThese teachers guided us then, and they continue to influence us today. \nI can recall some of my teachers. I can still hear my senior high \nschool teacher, Mrs. Kappell. Whenever I write a letter or whenever I \ntry to compose a speech, I can hear her talking to me, telling me what \nto do, and many times, what not to do.\n  I can hear my junior high school teacher in American history, Mr. \nWingard, now Dr. Wingard, as he talked about that great American story \nof American history.\n  Teachers do change our lives, Mr. President. They do make a \ndifference. As a parent, I also know how important it is for children \nto have good teachers, for our children to enjoy being in the classroom \nand to look forward to going to school each day. When they don't have \nquality teachers, our children suffer for a whole year.\n  I am sure other parents have this experience: There is nothing better \nthan to find out that your child has a great teacher; to listen to that \nchild, when that child comes home from school, talk about what the \nteacher said; to hear the excitement a teacher can inspire about a \nparticular subject, whether it is science or American government or \nAmerican history or literature. There is nothing more important for a \nchild, other than parents, than to have a good teacher.\n  I have also had the experience, not often but it is an experience \nmost of us have had as parents, of our child having a teacher who \nwasn't that good. We all know how long 9 months can seem for the whole \nfamily.\n  It is so important for our kids that we attract the smartest and most \ndedicated in our society to the profession of teaching. We had better \nmove fast. The National Center for Educational Statistics predicts that \nin the next decade we will have to hire 1.7 million to 2.7 million new \nteachers just to replace\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\nthose who retire or leave the profession. While this exodus of teachers \nis certainly a daunting challenge and a very real pending problem, it \nis also an enormous opportunity. It is the single greatest opportunity \nfor us, as parents and as community members, to reshape the next decade \nof education in America.\n  When I think about this opportunity and I think about how we can \nshape education to the greatest benefit of our children, I am reminded \nof something my own high school principal, Mr. Malone, once told me. We \nwere getting ready to go into a new high school building. We were part \nof the baby-boom generation, so they were always building new buildings \nfor us. Mr. Malone came into our class and he said, ``We are going to \ngo into this new high school next week. We are so proud of it and so \nhappy about it. But I want you to remember one thing. I want you always \nto remember this: In education, there are only two things that really \nmatter. One is the student who wants to learn and the other is a good \nteacher. Everything else is sort of icing on the cake.'' What Mr. \nMalone said 35 years ago is still true today.\n  Recently I had the privilege of meeting with several teachers and \nadministrators and students from two of Ohio's schools of education--\nMarietta College and Ohio University. During those meetings, we \ndiscussed many of the issues today's teachers are facing and the \nchallenges that await the future generation of teachers. Those meetings \nreaffirmed my belief that, when you get right down to it, good teachers \nare second only to good parents in helping children learn. So any \neffort to restore confidence and improve quality in education must \nbegin with a national recommitment to teaching as a profession.\n  We are doing just that with the education reform bill before us. \nThrough the language I have written into this bill, we can expand, \nenhance, and encourage support for teachers all across America.\n  First, I have written a provision that will provide support for \npeople in other professions seeking a second career as a teacher. We \nneed to make it easier to recruit future teachers from the military, \nfrom industry, and from research institutions. These are people with \nestablished careers and real-world life experiences. They have a great \ndeal to give our students in the classroom.\n\n  But, getting this kind of talent into the classroom is easier said \nthan done. For example, if Albert Einstein were alive today and wanted \nto teach a high school physics class, requirements in some States would \nkeep him from even setting foot in a classroom. That, I think, is just \nabsurd. My provision would allow the use of Federal funds for \nalternative teacher certification programs. This would allow States to \ncreate and expand different types of alternative certification efforts.\n  Second, I have written a provision to provide support for teachers \nseeking to improve subject knowledge or classroom skills. This language \nthat we have written helps ensure that our teachers have access to \ntraining academies, where they can sharpen and improve their skills as \nteachers. There is just such a facility in Cincinnati called the \nMayerson Academy. Teachers can go there to learn from experienced \neducators, seasoned educators who can help them and guide them to \nbecome stronger teachers in the classroom. Plans are already underway \nfor a similar training academy in Dayton, OH.\n  No doubt, some of this support should be available to teachers in \nevery community in our country. It is not enough to train our teachers \nand then just send them out to the classrooms. We have to provide them \nwith the opportunity to constantly improve their skills. It is a \nscience. It is an art. It is both. It is a tough business, and we need \nto give them the help, the mentoring, and the expertise they need to \ncontinue advancing throughout their careers.\n  The Mayerson Academy was put together by the business community in \nCincinnati in cooperation with the teachers unions and in cooperation \nwith the public schools. It is the right way to go. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  Third, I have written a provision to provide support for teachers \nseeking new ways to teach math and science, history, or English. My \nlanguage expands the mission of the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, \nwhich is a national center located at Ohio State University that \nprovides teachers with the best teacher training and curriculum \nmaterials in the subjects of math and science. This clearinghouse \nscreens, evaluates, and distributes the multiple training and course \nmaterials currently available and makes it easier for teachers to \nquickly and efficiently access materials for the classrooms. My \nprovision expands the clearinghouse's mission beyond just math and \nscience to now include, under this language, subjects such as history \nand English.\n  Finally, I have written a provision to provide support for new \nteachers from experienced teachers who will serve as mentors. Many of \nour most experienced, most senior, most knowledgeable teachers are, \nunfortunately, about to retire. It is vital that we do not lose their \nexpertise before it is too late. We can utilize their skills through \nmentoring programs. My provision allows the use of Federal funds for \nnew and existing teacher mentoring programs.\n  I also believe we need to prioritize Federal funding to recruit and \nretain good teachers in our high-need urban and rural school districts. \nOne way to do this is by recruiting teachers from the military through \nthe Troops to Teachers Program. Last year we worked to save this \nprogram, and thank Heaven we saved it. We fully intend to do the same \nthis year.\n  Troops to Teachers assists retiring military personnel in gaining the \nState certification necessary to teach. Furthermore, Troops to Teachers \nhelps broaden the makeup and skills of our current teacher pool. \nFinally, it brings the best teachers to the schools and the children \nwho need them the most.\n  The fact is, the Troops to Teachers Program has been an unbelievable \nsuccess. We need to recruit more minorities to go into education. We \nneed to have more teachers who have a background in math and science. \nAnd, we need to recruit more men into teaching in our primary schools. \nTroops to teachers brings minorities and men and those with a \nbackground in math and science into the classroom. This is a program \nthat works. It is a program that makes a difference.\n  Let me say how delighted I was to see that the First Lady of our \ncountry endorsed this program. She has said that we should be putting \nmore money in the program and has been a very strong advocate for that.\n  We can also do much more to encourage good teachers to go into the \nclassrooms that need them most. Specifically, we can pursue efforts \ninvolving National Board certified teachers.\n  You may ask: ``What exactly is a National Board Certified teacher?'' \nWell, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an \nextremely rigorous certification program that identifies exceptional \nclassroom educators. This certification is a difficult, challenging, \nyear-long process that measures a teacher's knowledge of subject matter \nand, more importantly, his or her ability to teach that material to \nstudents. Last year, 331 teachers were certified in my home State of \nOhio by the National Board, increasing the State's total to 924 \neducators. I am happy to say it is the third highest of any State in \nthe Union. These teachers are some of our best educators, and we need \nto encourage them to teach in our most needy schools. That is why I \nhave been working with the Board to urge them to prioritize their \nfederal funding for teachers who teach in, or are willing to teach in \nlow-income school districts. I am pleased to report that the Board has \nagreed to make this a policy. I congratulate them for it.\n  In the future, Mr. President, we also need to increase the federal \ngovernment's funding for an important program for disabled students--\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Act. This worthwhile federal program \nis one of the largest underfunded mandates on our local schools.\n  Many of my colleagues have taken time to come to the floor in the \nlast few weeks to talk about this. I congratulate them for drawing \nattention to this problem.\n  We need to fully fund the federal government's commitment to this \nprogram, as it helps give teachers the ability to teach disabled \nstudents without detracting from the education of other students.\n  Finally, we can encourage teachers to teach in low-income districts--\nthe\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\nvery districts where children need them most--by re-examining the \ncurrent student loan forgiveness programs. This is an issue that I \nintend to pursue in future legislative initiatives.\n  I think there is more we can do. We need to look at this program and \nfigure out what we have to do in loan forgiveness to attract students \nto become teachers and to go to our Appalachian counties and our inner \ncities, or wherever good teachers are needed.\n  Now, while I strongly believe that the teacher is the most important \nresource in the classroom, there are other issues in education that we \nneed to address, like the program of drugs and violence in our schools. \nI have fought for--and will continue fighting--to improve the $925 \nmillion Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. This vital program, which I \nhave incorporated into the ESEA bill, provides funds to over 97 percent \nof school districts nationwide to keep our schools safe and drug-free.\n  The reality is that for many schools this is the only money they get, \nor the only money that they set aside, to deal with our drug problem. \nIt is vital that we continue to fund this program.\n  We need this program because a child threatened by drugs and violence \nis not be able to learn, and a teacher afraid to stand in front of the \nclassroom is unable to teach. And that--that is a situation we should \nnever, ever have in our schools. I hope to say more about this very \nimportant program as the Floor debate unfolds.\n  So I believe it is clear that the government can make a difference in \nrestoring quality and equality to education. On a federal level and on \na state level, the government can help target programs to those \nchildren in those districts most in need. However, the whole realm of \neducation is so big and so vital and so all-encompassing that it is \nsomething we cannot leave to the government, alone, to fix.\n  Parents and families and communities must take an active role in \nreforming our schools and in helping our best teachers stay in our \nchildren's classrooms.\n  I think it is important that every capable American become involved. \nEach one of us needs to volunteer directly in the classroom and to \nparticipate in some way in school activities. Parents need to go into \ntheir children's schools and help the teachers, or volunteer to read to \nthe classes, or help teach math or science, or history, or literature.\n  As I said, I talked to several teachers in Ohio recently. They told \nme about how exciting it was to have senior citizens come into their \nclassrooms and read to students on a one-on-one basis; or to help a \nstudent read; or to take a turn with the senior reading one page and \nthe child reading another page. These teachers told me that it was not \njust the senior citizen teaching and a student learning, although that \ncertainly occurred. But, it was the bonding and the relationship that \ndeveloped. It was that student knew someone cared about him or her. \nThat was just as important, or in many respects, it was more important.\n  I think each one of us can do something in our schools. Whether we \nhave schoolchildren in schools or not, each one of us, in some way, can \nmake a difference.\n  It is up to us to change our culture of complacency. It is up to us \nto help close the economic and educational gaps in our society.\n  Ultimately, education reform and the paradigm shifts that go along \nwith it are a journey toward the horizon--not a destination, but a \nnever-ending, forward-leading journey toward the future. So, as we move \ntoward that horizon--as we move ahead for the sake of our children--we \nneed to get back to basics--good teachers, safe and drug-free schools, \nand parental and community involvement in the schools.\n  I am confident that we will go forth in the days ahead to give \nchildren the tools they need for a bright and promising future.\n  I am confident that we will go forth to restore quality and community \nin our system of education.\n  We will go forth and establish a new way of thinking--a way of \nthinking that challenges and changes the current culture of education \nin America.\n  We will go forth and restore education's ability to ``equalize,'' as \nHorace Mann suggested.\n  And, as we do go forth toward that horizon--toward our future--we \nshould remember something Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\n       A child is a person who is going to carry on what you have \n     started. He is going to sit where you are sitting and when \n     you are gone attend to those things which you think are \n     important. He will assume control over your cities, states, \n     and nations. He is going to move in and take over your \n     churches, schools, universities, and corporations. The fate \n     of humanity is in his hands.\n\n  That sentiment is as true today as it was when Abraham Lincoln said \nit.\n  We cannot rest--we must not rest--until every child has teachers who \nare qualified to teach and schools that are safe, drug-free learning \nenvironments.\n  Our children's future and the future America--hang in the balance.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are now in morning business, I believe.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Until 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes, and then yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio for his very \nexcellent comments about education. There is certainly nothing more \nimportant in this country than education. There is nothing more \nimportant to the President, and nothing more important to this Congress \nand to the people of the country than to do something to strengthen \neducation. Hopefully, we are on the verge of moving into that area. We \nhave talked about it now for a good long time. It has been on the \nagenda and we are ready to move on it. Hopefully, we can do that very \nquickly.\n  I think the conversation and the dispute has been somewhat about the \nnotion of funding. I understand that. Obviously, funding is vital to \neducation.\n  I just came from Casper, WY. One of the board members wrote in our \nlocal paper about funding and how important it is. But at the same time \nthere are other issues. Funding alone does not make a successful \neducation program. I feel very strongly about that.\n  We have to have accountability. We have to have choices. We have to \nhave some measurement of productivity in order to have an education \nprogram and the kind that we want.\n  I am hopeful our friends on the other side of the aisle will not \ncontinue to hold up this matter. I think we ought to get on with it.\n  Is there disagreement on some issues? Of course. There will always \nbe. But there is agreement on our goal. And our goal is to strengthen \neducation in this country. We are not going to do it if we continue to \nhold off and be unwilling to move forward. I hope we do that.\n  Republicans have a strong agenda: returning control to parents, \ngiving them charter schools, giving them the opportunity, if the school \nis not performing, to move their child to another public school, \nsending dollars to the classroom, giving families greater education \nchoice, supporting exceptional teachers, and focusing on basic \neducation. I think these are the areas that are so important.\n  The delivery of these programs, of course, is quite different, \nwhether you are in Chugwater, WY, or Cincinnati, OH. So there has to be \nflexibility that is left to the people in local leadership positions to \ndecide how they can best use those dollars. I think the one-size-fits-\nall approach does not work.\n  Underlying this education debate is a basic philosophical difference. \nSome folks do not like the idea of letting local people make the \ndecisions. We went through that for almost 8 years, where Washington \nhad to decide what the Federal money was going to be used for. Now we \nare in a position where we do not need to do that. We do not need the \neducation bureaucracy calling all the shots. It is local people--not \nthe Federal bureaucrats--who know what needs to be done.\n  Then how do you have accountability? We do that by having some kind \nof testing, a measurement of progress, so kids in Wyoming who want to \nmove to California when they are older have a basic education that will \nallow them to compete because they have had a productive education.\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\n  I think the important thing to remember, too, is that since \nRepublicans took control of the Congress in 1995, Federal education \nspending has exploded. This President is asking for more money for \neducation than the previous President.\n  So we need to do those things. This is a direction in which we need \nto head. We need to do it now. I am getting a little exasperated, as \nmany Members are, that we cannot seem to move forward. We were prepared \nlast week to talk about this. We did not even get a chance to get to \nit. So we need to produce a bipartisan education proposal which \naccomplishes the goals of increasing accountability for student \nperformance, supporting programs that work, reducing bureaucracy, \nincreasing flexibility, and empowering parents. By focusing on \nsolutions rather than rhetoric, we will be able to accomplish those \nthings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my friend from Tennessee.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague from Tennessee yield for 10 seconds?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator yields.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do not think there is any order. My colleague from \nTennessee was here first. I ask unanimous consent that I follow the \nSenator from Tennessee in the order of debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We were until 3 o'clock. We are now \npast that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4025-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4025-S4034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming and my \ncolleague from Ohio for their superb statements on education. The first \nstatement expressed the underlying principles of accountability and of \nlocal control, of flexibility, as we go forward. I would like to \nreiterate the plea of the Senator from Wyoming that we be allowed, by \nour vote tomorrow morning, to proceed to address the bill that is \nresting on each of our desks and is ready to go, the Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers Act, which is S. 1, the bill on education and \nis really the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  I commend our colleague from Ohio for his superb statement over the \nlast 30 minutes or so addressing some of the most important, \nfundamental aspects of education as we look at our young children and \ntheir health and their safety as part of the education process.\n  We do have a great opportunity before us. I have been in this body \nfor the last 6 years, and we have discussed various aspects of \neducation--higher education, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA. We attempted to reauthorize ESEA last year but \nunsuccessfully for a whole host of reasons.\n  I am delighted by the leadership of the President of the United \nStates, President Bush, who made it the No. 1 agenda item in his \ncampaign. And again and again, as he has met with people--I think in as \nmany as 26 States thus far over the last 100 days--no matter what issue \nhe has been talking about, he comes back to education, the importance \nof education, and specifically talking about public education for \nchildren in kindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  We do have a great opportunity if we are allowed to proceed. I plead \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle that when we have this vote \ntomorrow morning we will be allowed to proceed to the bill so that over \nthe next 2 weeks we can, in a mature, sophisticated, systematic way, \naddress what I believe is important to every American. Clearly it is, \nif we look at the campaign for the Presidency, if we look at what has \nhappened over the last 100 days.\n\n  It was 18 years ago the report came out that we all refer back to, \nwhen the United States was declared a nation at risk. All of that \nfocused on education. That was identified 18 years ago. The unique \nthing that has occurred, whether you are Democrat or Republican on \neither side of the aisle, or Independent, is that all of us are slowly \nbut really coming together for the first time, uniting and trying to \nsolve the underlying problems, again, under the leadership of President \nBush.\n  It is a unique time in that all the major programs are up for \nreauthorization: the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the \nother programs which are coming due over the next 18 months or so.\n  It is a unique time where the public has come together, and where \nboth parties have come together under the leadership of the President. \nAlso, the process allows us to address what we call a reauthorization.\n  Today there is general agreement in Washington that our historical \napproach to K-through-12 education policy is not working. It is broken. \nIt needs repair. It deserves focus. It deserves reform if our goal is \nreally to leave no child behind. It is time to do that.\n  That is why I believe we in this body have to focus on this, meaning \nstarting today or tomorrow or this week, we have to consider serious \nchange, substantial change, and not just have a perpetuation of what we \nhave done over the last 35 years since 1965 when ESEA was first passed.\n  As we all go back to our districts and our States all across America, \nincluding communities all across Tennessee, the mandate is very clear: \nFix the problem. The problem is clear. The achievement gap is getting \nworse. We are not appropriately educating our children today.\n  We need to fix the problem, do whatever it takes, spend money, and, \nyes, invest more but make sure we spend it wisely. We need to focus on \nthe child. And most importantly--because you can say all of that--we \nmost do it now. We need to take the next 2 weeks to consider this \nlegislation. It is the most important item before the U.S. Government, \nI would argue and most of the American people agree. So let's do it \nnow. Let's stay on it. Let's go on it tomorrow morning and stay on it \nover the next several weeks until we finish.\n  There are lots of different principles that we can focus on as we \naddress this issue. We will be debating everything from how much money \nto spend, to the individual programs, to how do we actually reform and \nconceptualize or reconceptualized education today.\n  I think most of us--not knowing what the specific amendments will \nbe--will stress certain guiding principles as we go through the debate. \nI would like to mention several that are important to me.\n  The first principle will be this whole concept that we talked a \nlittle bit about last year in terms of flexibility and accountability. \nThose two words are key, and they mean lots of things to different \npeople. But I think fundamentally when we say ``flexibility,'' we mean \nfreedom; and when we say ``accountability,'' that is sort of the \nbuzzword for results, achievement, learning. I think we have to tie \nthat flexibility to accountability, or the results.\n  As we talk about Federal dollars--and the Federal dollars are not \nvery much; they are only about 7 percent of the overall education \ndollar spent in our communities; but it is a clear-cut obligation--I \nbelieve that no longer should we attach strings to those Federal \ndollars unless the strings themselves are attached to demonstrable \nresults. Those results are better education of our children in \ncommunities all across this country.\n\n  What is going to be different and is different in the underlying bill \nand in the negotiations over the last several weeks between both sides \nof the aisle is that, yes, we set the goal of accountability, of \nachieving those results, but how we get those results needs to be left \nto local communities. That means teachers and principals and parents \nand schools and communities. The how-to does not mean Washington, DC. \nIt does not mean the Senate. It does not mean the Congress or even the \nPresident of the United States. The\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nhow-to of education rests with flexibility, local control, local \nidentification of needs.\n  A second principle that will guide me, once we are allowed to bring \nthe bill to the floor, is the focus on the child. We say ``don't leave \nany child behind,'' but then when we consider legislation, too often we \nlook at systems, inputs, institutions, dollars, at the same time losing \nthe focus on the child. When I say ``focus on the child,'' I also mean \nfocus on the family, on the parents, the people who care most about \nthat child, on the teacher, all at the local level. We need to come \nback again and again to protect the interests of the children and their \nparents, without focusing first and foremost on what we do too often, \nand that is focusing on the bureaucracy, focusing on a monopoly, \nfocusing on a status quo. So the underlying principle that is an \nimportant one for all of us is focusing on the people, the child and \nthe parent.\n  The No. 1 concern of the Federal Government should be the education \nof our Nation's less fortunate children. Our obligation must be to \nthose children and not to the system itself. If we continue to focus on \nthe education of the child, that is the goal, that is the product, if \nwe do that and don't focus on the bureaucracy or the institution or the \nsystem or the input, we will create a system that will allow innovation \nand optimism in terms of creativity and figuring out new ways to do \nthings more effectively. There will be a stimulation of new thought, \nnew ideas, new ways of thinking about how to educate children.\n  That ties into a whole series of practical approaches which are \nmentioned in this document we will debate, such as allowing more \nchoice, more opportunity, discussing issues such as charter schools, \nthe opportunity of supplementary services. If in a typical classroom a \nchild is not learning, what sort of services should we give that child \nto supplement what everybody else is getting in the classroom; how is \nthat paid for? Where should the supplementary services be available? \nCan Federal dollars be used for that? That will be the debate.\n  It all comes from focusing on the individual child, what they need, \nwhat works, and what does not work: No. 1, matching freedom with \nresults; No. 2, focusing on the child.\n  No. 3 is information. We will have the opportunity to talk about \ninformation, but as I have been involved in the education debate, I \nhave been impressed with the lack of good, accurate, and timely \ninformation that is available to people who are interested in the \neducation of the child. That might be to teachers; it might be to \nparents, it might be to school board members. The lack of that timely \nand accurate information is something we absolutely must address. I am \nconvinced that if we give the flexibility and control that is necessary \nat the local level, people can make prudent decisions if they have \naccurate data.\n  Is one school better than another school? Is one teacher better than \nanother teacher? Are children in one group in similar situations being \neducated better than other children? If so, why? That means we do have \na Federal role to supply that information in an accurate and timely \nway.\n  Learning what is working, what is not working, that in itself will \nstimulate innovation and will stop us from rewarding failure. Again, \nrewarding failure by continually funneling money into systems that are \nnot working year after year has to be changed, and it will be changed \nonce we associate the fact that there are children trapped in schools \nthat are failing in spite of everything that society can do for them. \nOver time we can no longer reward that failure. We need to continue to \ninvest in that school. We need to give that school every opportunity to \nimprove. If it does not, we need to no longer reward what is failing \nwith Federal dollars, what is trapping individuals, maybe in a \ndangerous school, maybe an unsafe school, or a school where learning is \nnot taking place.\n  A fourth guiding principle for me will be that we in the Federal \nGovernment do have a very important role. People ask me when I go back \nhome: What is the Federal role? Why are you, a Senator, so interested \nin education? why do you believe so strongly in this bill called Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act? The answer is pretty clear. \nThe Federal role is to inspire. It is to empower. It is to set the tone \nand the tenure out of Washington that says: Leave no child behind.\n  It expresses a willingness to appropriately invest in leaving no \nchild behind. What goes on in this Chamber, what goes on in Washington, \nDC--and we have heard it from the President of the United States, who \nhas made this the leading issue in his Presidency and in the initial \ncampaign--is that education is important and is a high priority. If it \nis a high priority for the Senate, for this President, for the \nCongress, it will be, because of the bully pulpit, because of the \nleadership, it will be a high priority in Tennessee, in our States \naround the country, in our communities, in our school districts and, \nclearly, in our schools. We have to speak on behalf of needy children \nand their families. We need to spotlight the things that work but also \nshine that light on areas that do not work.\n  The Federal role, indeed, is setting those priorities, setting the \ntone and the content which becomes the national discussion on \neducation. It will be a part of setting that momentum for reform. The \nreform train is under way in our local communities, but we must hop on \nthat train and accelerate the momentum as we look to the future.\n  I mention these principles--I will close because there are other \nMembers who wish to speak--pleading with my colleagues to allow this \nbill to come to the floor. This initiative is important to each and \nevery one of us. If there is disagreement in some way on substance or \non policy, let us bring it to the floor. Let us talk about it. There \nhas been a lot of debate over the last several days on the adequate \nlevel of funding to accomplish these higher standards, eliminating or \nreducing the achievement gap, leaving no child behind. I hope we can \nbring that to the floor and debate it and through that discussion, \nthrough the amendment process, we will come to a conclusion where, \nindeed, we will leave no child behind.\n  Matching freedom with results, focusing on the children, keeping \ninformation current and flowing, recognizing that we in the Federal \nGovernment have a very important role, are the principles I will use as \nwe go forward in this very important debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to follow \nSenator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that I may follow the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the only thing I want to mention is, I \ndon't think I will take much more time, but I didn't say 20 minutes. I \nthink I will probably stay within that framework, although with the \nSenator from Arkansas out on the floor, it will take some teaching on \nmy part to get him to look at this in the right way. So it may take a \nfew hours. Seriously, I think I can do it in about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. First, the Senator from \nMinnesota, then the Senator from Arkansas, and then the Senator from \nMassachusetts will be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to try to present a little bit \nof data. First, I will talk about this motion to proceed. There are \nothers who will speak on this. I think Senator Kennedy, of course, is \nthe most prominent one who can speak to the state of the negotiations. \nOriginally, my objection to proceeding before the spring recess was \nthat I wanted to see what was in the bill. That includes policy and \nthere are legitimate concerns and differences of opinion about that--\nfor example, the Straight A's Block Grant Program. There are other \nconcerns about language dealing with testing.\n  I also want to know exactly what we are talking about by way of \nresources to, in fact, make sure that these children we are going to \ntest every year have the same opportunity to do well.\n  I don't want to see the Senate do something which could be very \nreckless, and I want to know what is in this legislation. So my \nobjection has been, and remains, that it doesn't make sense to proceed \nto a bill unless you\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\nknow what is in it. That is really what I have been saying. That is \nwhat I say today on the floor of the Senate. We need to have a chance \nto look at what is in this bill.\n  Mr. President, my second point is that I am in profound disagreement \nwith many of the things that I am hearing on this bill from some of my \ncolleagues. I am in, I guess, angry disagreement with Senators who say \nthat this is ``reform'' and this is all about--to quote my colleague \nfrom Tennessee--``appropriately invest to leave no child behind.''\n  If we are going to now have a Federal mandate--and quite frankly, I \nam amazed at the number of Senators, especially on the other side of \nthe aisle, who now are going to vote for a Federal mandate that will \nsay to every school district in every State, not just Title I schools \nthat they must proceed with these tests. This isn't just about Title I \nschools, this is about testing every child in every school district in \nevery State every year starting from age 8 to age 13. Who knows where \nthat comes from, based upon what research, what philosophy?\n  If that is going to be a Federal mandate handed down to every school \ndistrict in every school in the State of Minnesota, I want to put my \ncolleagues on notice. I will, in every way I know how to as a Senator, \ninsist that we have another Federal mandate that goes with it, which \nwould be that there will be equality of opportunity for every child to \nget a good education and to succeed and to do well.\n  But, do you know what? We are not going to do that. We are not going \nto do that. Now, let me just start out with the President's budget. The \nPresident's budget provides a $669 million net increase. So far that is \nwhat we have seen over the last fiscal year for the ESEA program--$669 \nmillion with $575 million in new money for title I.\n  The title I program for disadvantaged children is funded at a 30-\npercent level. As a matter of fact, you would probably need to get \nclose to $24 billion or thereabouts per year to fully fund Title I. We \nare at one-third that level. The President adds $575 million, and it is \n``Leave no child behind''? Can you explain to me how? No additional \nmoney for reading, for smaller classes, for teaching assistants to help \nthese children is there. Some of my colleagues say: ``We have spent all \nthis money on title I over the years.'' One-third of the children who \nshould be helped are helped!\n  By the way, the amount of money we spent on title I over the years \namounts to one-half of 1 percent of all the money we spent on education \nin our country during that time. It is hard to blame one program for \nnot leveraging huge progress in this area. But at the very minimum, \nsince this is what the Federal Government is about, how about a \ncommitment to fully fund title I?\n\n  I will have a triggering amendment on the floor of the Senate that \nwill say that we cannot mandate testing for every child in every school \ndistrict in every State until we first fully fund title I. It seems to \nme that if you are going to be serious about leaving no child behind, \nyou would want to make sure all these children have the same \nopportunity. Let's truly leave no child behind. My colleagues are \ntrying to argue we are going to realize that goal on a tin cup \neducation budget.\n  Now, if you are going to start measuring how children are doing as \nyoung as age 8, third graders, it is crystal clear that the most \nimportant variables in explaining how these children are going to do, \nis what happens to them before kindergarten. I am ashamed to say this. \nRight now, the Congress funds Head Start at a 50-percent level. Early \nHead Start, 1 and 2 years old--where we say it is even more important \nto get it right for these children from low-income families--is funded \nat a 3-percent level. Like Fannie Lou Hamer, the civil rights leader \nfrom Mississippi, said, ``I am sick and tired of being sick and \ntired.'' I am sick and tired of playing symbolic politics with \nchildren's lives.\n  I am going to fight like I never fought in my life as a Senator on \nthis issue. The President's budget is going to leave no child behind? \nThere is no significant increase in Head Start funding. We are going to \nhumiliate these children, fail these children, fail the schools, fail \nthe teachers, and then we are going to blame them, after we don't put \nforward the resources.\n  We should be a player in prekindergarten. We should get real about \nHead Start. We should get real about developmental child care and about \nmaking sure these children are kindergarten ready. But no, no, no, no, \nno. What we have instead is Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts with over 40 \npercent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent. So President Bush \ndoesn't have any money to invest in these children.\n  Where is this additional significant investment in education for \nchildren to make sure they all can do well on these tests?\n  The IDEA program: We are nowhere close to the $17 billion a year that \nrepresents the 40-percent commitment the Federal Government made to our \nschool districts. What do we get in the President's budget? We get in \nthe President's budget an additional $1 billion, barely half of the 40-\npercent commitment we said as the Federal Government we would make.\n  We are supposed to go forward with this legislation that sets up a \nFederal mandate that requires every school district to give these \ntests. But at the same time, we are not investing the resources to make \nsure there is equality of opportunity for every one of these children \nto do well in these tests. My colleagues call that ``reform''? And they \nhave the nerve to say this is realizing the goal of leaving no child \nbehind? We cannot realize the goal of leaving no child behind on a tin \ncup education budget. This is symbolic politics with children's lives.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I am amazed that all of a sudden \nthere is this support for this Federal mandate to tell every school \ndistrict in every State that they are going to do this testing. It is a \ngigantic unfunded mandate because of what I just said: We are not \nliving up to our commitment to provide the kids and the teachers with \nresources so they can do well.\n  I am going to have a number of amendments, and I think there will be \nstrong support. I have delved into this testing issue. I know Senator \nKennedy has been working hard on this. We absolutely have to make sure \nthis testing is done the right way so that we do not have single, low-\nquality standardized tests being used in the states.\n  I can quote from all sorts of studies. I will wait for that when the \namendments come up. I tell my colleagues, everybody who is involved in \nthe testing field, all of the studies that we ourselves have \ncommissioned to look at ``high-stakes testing,'' warn us: You better do \nthis right. You better have multiple measurements.\n  You better make sure this is not rote memorization.\n  You better make sure you do not force teachers into drill education, \nwhich is teaching the test, and which is going on all over the country.\n  You better make sure you truly are measuring the depth of knowledge \nof children.\n  You better make sure you take into account those children who come \nfrom families where English is a second language.\n  You better take into account children who have learning disabilities, \nsomething with which I have struggled and which has affected me on \nthese tests.\n  Mr. President, did you know that the National Association of State \nBoards of Education has determined the total cost to States to develop \nand implement 3 through 8 assessments could be as high starting out as \n$7 billion? If the simplest tests are used--which will be, frankly, an \nabuse of testing--the minimum cost would be $2.7 billion.\n  Do you know, Mr. President, what the President has budgeted for \ntesting for the school districts? It is $320 million. I say to my \nRepublican colleagues, I am amazed you are willing to vote for this \nunfunded mandate. I am amazed.\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues, I am amazed that we would go \nforward unless we first have some ironclad commitment from the \nPresident and from our colleagues that we will, in fact, also live up \nto our commitment to provide the resources for these children and these \nteachers and these schools.\n\n  We cannot do one without the other. We cannot move forward with \nlegislation until we know what is in it. We cannot move forward with \nlegislation until we have some agreement on some of the policy \nquestions some of us are raising.\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\n  Let me, one more time--I think I can do it in 2 or 3 minutes--spell \nout my position.\n  We must do testing the right way. Right now I think there is every \nreason to believe that this is a rush to recklessness. If we do not do \nthe testing the right way, we are going to drive teachers out of \nteaching. We want to get the best teachers. In fact, when I am in \nschools--I have averaged being in a school about once every 2 weeks for \nthe last 10\\1/2\\ years--I ask the students what makes for good \neducation.\n  Before smaller class size, before even repairing dilapidated \nbuildings, before discussion of good textbooks and technology, they say \ngood teachers. They all say we want to attract the best and the \nbrightest. Please think this through. We want to attract the best and \nthe brightest, but we are going to say to the best and the brightest: \nWhen you teach--I have two children who teach--we are going to tell \nthem when to teach, how to teach, and what to teach. You and your \nstudents are going to be measured by these tests every single year. \nMany of them will be standardized tests, simple, and everybody is going \nto be forced into worksheet teaching, drill education.\n  We already know who is not doing as well. Suburban schools are doing \nwell and the kids are doing well and thank God for that. It is the \nrural and the inner city where we have the most trouble. It is in those \nareas where we have the most trouble recruiting the teachers. Guess \nwhat. The best and the brightest are not going to go into teaching. \nWhat in the world do we think we are doing? That is my first point.\n  My second point is, if we are going to do the testing right, the \nNational Association of State Boards of Education said it could cost, \nstarting out, as much as $7 billion, and we have, Mr. President--and I \nappreciate your attention; thank you for your graciousness--we have \nfrom the President's proposal $320 million. That is an unfunded \nmandate. Any good conservative, much less flaming liberal, should vote \nagainst this on that basis alone, unless you have that investment in \npaying for these tests.\n  I will have a triggering amendment. Right now we are spending 30 \npercent of what it would take to do title I. I am going to have an \namendment that says until we fully fund title I so that the children \nfrom the disadvantaged backgrounds--those are the ones not doing as \nwell. Is anybody surprised? Are you surprised? They do not come to \nkindergarten as ready. They do not have the same breaks. They do not go \nto the schools which have all the facilities. They do not go to the \nschools with the most highly qualified teachers, although I must say, \nsome of the teachers I have seen in the inner city and rural schools \nare saints. As a matter of fact, I hear discussions about \naccountability. Some of the harshest critics in the Senate of these \npublic school teachers could not last 1 hour in the classrooms they \ncondemn.\n  At the very minimum, let's get real. If we are going to have these \ntests, do it the right way. If we are going to have these tests, hold \neverybody accountable. Then also make sure there is another Federal \nmandate that there will be equality of opportunity for every child to \nhave a good education and succeed.\n  Therefore, with my amendment, this cannot be implemented. They cannot \nhave this Federal mandate of testing every year until we first fully \nfund title I. Let's give these children and schools the resources they \nneed.\n  By the way, I am thinking seriously of other triggering amendments. \nAnother one is we cannot do the testing until we fully fund Head Start. \nThe truth is, that is the place to start. Before the Chair came in, I \nsaid right now it is 50 percent of the kids and that is it. In early \nHead Start, it is 3 percent. That is for the 1-year-olds and 2-year-\nolds.\n  I might have another triggering amendment--for sure I will have one \non title I--that says until we fund the IDEA program, we cannot go \nforward with this testing.\n  There are plenty of reasons not to proceed.\n  I don't want to proceed on a piece of legislation that I haven't yet \nseen. The language is technical. Frankly, we could be making a major \nchange in the Federal role in education. I want to see the language. I \ndon't think we should rush through this. This issue is too important. \nIn addition, we should know exactly the agreements on the policy \nquestions.\n  I do not believe we should go forward with this legislation, this \nFederal mandate, to test every child, unless we also have a Federal \nmandate, backed up by resources, that there will be equality of \nopportunity for every child to have a good education and to succeed. We \ncan't do one without the other. I know for a fact this administration \nis not willing to make that investment. I have seen nothing on the \ntable because of the commitment to these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax \ncuts.\n  I am opposed to 42 percent of the benefits going to millionaires; I \nprefer more money into title I, special reading, additional help. I \nprefer more resources into afterschool programs. I prefer more \nresources into prekindergarten, into kids, into opportunities for every \nchild in America. It is not in this bill.\n  Please don't make the mistake of believing that a test guarantees \ngood teachers. It doesn't. A test doesn't rebuild crumbling buildings. \nA test doesn't bring technology to schools. A test doesn't provide the \nresources for children with special needs. A test doesn't provide \nsmaller class size. A test doesn't provide counseling and support of \nservices for children.\n  Where is the commitment to these resources? This is not reform; this \nis a charade; this is a mockery. I am indignant. I am determined to \nover and over and over and over again come to the Senate with \namendments to make my case. I don't mean I take it as a foregone \nconclusion we will move to the bill, but I oppose the bill until I know \nwhat is in it and until I know whether there is an agreement. In fact, \nif I lose on such a vote, I will come to the floor with amendments, \nover and over and over again, to fight for what I truly believe.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, since we are not always in \nagreement, I truly believe it is necessary to realize the goal of \nleaving no child behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Under the previous order, the \nChair recognizes the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Senator Wellstone may have made the greatest \nunderstatement in the Senate, when he said we may not always agree.\n  I have the utmost respect for my friend. It is always a challenge \nfollowing the Senator from Minnesota. He is passionate and articulate. \nI have the utmost respect for his convictions, though I think in this \ninstance he is misguided.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the education bill from the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the Better Education for \nStudents and Teachers Act. I look forward to engaging in what I think \nwill be a healthy and vigorous debate throughout this week and perhaps \nnext week.\n  Certainly Senator Wellstone and I agree that this issue is important. \nI think all colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree this is an \nissue that deserves the time we have reserved on the floor; it deserves \nthe debate that has begun. I am confident we will be able to pass the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and we \nwill pass a bill under the direction of our President, under his \nleadership, that will reform the American educational system and the \nFederal role in public education, and we will turn away from those who \nsimply would endorse the status quo and continue down the path of the \npast.\n  While the legislation before the Senate makes significant reforms, we \nhave been working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make \nseveral needed improvements to the bill that came from the committee. \nIt is essential this legislation not merely rubberstamp the policies \nthe Federal Government has encouraged for many years. During 35 years \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Washington created a lot \nof programs; in fact, one study in the House of Representatives shows \nover 700 Federal education programs. We have a burgeoning education \nbureaucracy. The Federal Government has spent 35 years and over $120 \nbillion on title I funding to increase the achievement of disadvantaged \nstudents, and that was the reason the NAEP was originally authorized. \nThat\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nis why we started a Federal role in education. We wanted to help \ndisadvantaged students. If there is a proper Federal role, it is to \ntarget scarce resources toward the most disadvantaged and to narrow the \nlearning gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged students.\n  After 35 years and the $120 billion on title I funding for \ndisadvantaged students, we have little, if anything, to show for that \ninvestment. Let's recount the facts.\n  First, as a prelude to what I will say, I emphasize there are many \nquality teachers in public schools. There are some incredibly dedicated \nteachers who are doing a tremendous job in public schools. I agree with \none thing Senator Wellstone said. I would not last an hour trying to \nfill their shoes in the difficult job they have. My sister is such a \nperson. I admire her immensely. She will never have her name in any \nheadlines, but, day in and day out for 20 years, she has been in the \nclassroom, teaching and instructing and brightening the lives of young \npeople. She deserves, as thousands of public educators across this \ncountry, our praise.\n  We have made their job more difficult. We have left children behind. \nThat is what we need to remedy. The most recent NAEP reading results \nfor 2000 remain the same--not for 1999, the same as for 1992. The worst \nnews in the scores for 2000 was that higher performing students made \ngains while lower performing students did even worse. In other words, \nwhat we were supposed to try to cure with our Federal prescription for \neducation when we created the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 35 \nyears ago we have only made worse. The situation has only been \nexacerbated. Instead of narrowing that learning gap, we have seen the \nlearning gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged only increase.\n\n  American 12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrial countries in \nmathematics. Only Cyprus and South Africa fare worse than the United \nStates. I say to my colleagues who want to spend more money, let's not \nspend more money unless we bring reform. That is unacceptable. For the \ngreatest nation in the world, the freeest nation in the world, and, \nwithout risk of being contradicted, the Nation that has the best higher \neducation program in the world, to have those statistics for our \nelementary and secondary education system is unacceptable.\n  Since 1983, 10 million American kids reached 12th grade without \nhaving learned to read at the basic level; 20 million seniors could not \ndo basic math; 25 million seniors are illiterate on the subject of \nAmerican history. How long can a free society survive, how long can a \ndemocracy survive, when our young people do not have a basic \nunderstanding of our Nation's roots, our Nation's history?\n  What about the middle school grades? Two-thirds of American eighth \ngraders perform below proficiency level in reading. It is not just the \nhigh schools; it is not just in the middle schools; it is also in our \nelementary schools that our children have been shortchanged by a \nWashington-based, cubicle-oriented system. Over three-quarters of \nfourth grade children in urban high-poverty schools read below basic on \nthe National Assessment of Education Progress, the NAEP test. Those \nkids in particular title I was intended to help the most--the \ndisadvantaged children, those in urban schools, those in high-poverty \nschools--and they are the children who are suffering most under the \ncurrent system. Those statistics are shameful.\n  Two years ago when the Children's Scholarship Foundation, a private \nscholarship fund, offered 40,000 scholarships for tuition, privately \nfunded--they offered 40,000 scholarships across the Nation--1.25 \nmillion applications were received. Even though families were required \nunder this program to make a matching contribution of $1,000 from their \nown pockets, they still had one and a quarter million applicants.\n\n  Talk about a poll. That is perhaps the best poll on the failure of \nthe current system.\n  In many urban districts, the demand for these scholarships was so \nhigh that a staggering 44 percent of eligible parents in Baltimore \napplied for these scholarships and 33 percent of the parents in \nWashington, DC, applied for these scholarships. There are only 40,000; \none and a quarter million applicants. In the most poor communities, \nparents are just not satisfied with their schools.\n  When you look at the past, you look at what the Federal Government \nhas tried, you can only say we have been weighed in the balance and we \nhave been found wanting. We have a golden opportunity to change that \nstory this year. Child-based education is the focus, I believe, of the \npending legislation. We have a bill for consideration that is about \neducating America's children, not keeping a failing and dilapidated \neducation infrastructure on life support. The bill before us pioneers a \nnew direction for the Federal Government's role in education. Is it not \ntime for a new direction?\n  The package that some of my colleagues and I have been working on, \nwhich includes several initiatives such as what we called Straight A's, \nwhat President Bush calls Charter States, will be offered as an \namendment if not negotiated in the talks that are ongoing.\n  Supplemental services for children in failing schools: No, it is not \na full parental choice provision, as the President suggested, but it is \na step toward giving parents with children in failing schools--where \nthe schools have been given an opportunity and have been given \nresources, and the schools will not teach and the schools will not \nchange--to give those parents an opportunity to not sacrifice their \nchildren in that failing school but to have some other option, some \nsupplemental services, some Sylvan Learning Centers, tutorial help, to \nensure that their children are not lost in a failing school system.\n  But I hear from the other side of the aisle that these reforms are \nnot enough; that what is really needed is more money. I suggest that \nwill be the mantra we will hear over and over and over again this week \nin response to the President's leadership and in response to real \neducation reform. We are going to hear over and over again: No, what we \nreally need is more money.\n  Let's talk about that. Even though over $120 billion has been spent \non title I over the past 35 years, even though we have seen no \nmeasurable gain in student achievement over those 35 years, the \nargument is still the real solution is to spend more money. Even though \nthe President in his budget has included an 11-percent increase for \neducation, more than any other Department in the entire Federal \nGovernment, and even though he has suggested tripling funding for \nreading programs in those lower grades, we will still hear over and \nover again: The real issue is not reform. The real issue is we need to \nspend more money.\n  Let's continue to talk about that funding issue. I suggest while more \nmoney is desirable, it is not desirable if we do not yoke it with real \neducation reform. This chart from the National Center for Education \nStatistics reveals what is happening. On NAEP reading scores since \n1971, you can see that while we have more than doubled spending--the \nred line--more than doubled spending on education on a per-pupil \nbasis, over $8,000 per pupil, these lines reveal the real story. It is \nthat 12th grade NAEP reading, since 1971, has remained basically \nstatic; 8th grade NAEP reading--the green line--since 1971 has remained \nstationary; and on the 4th grade NAEP reading, we have essentially a \nflat line as well.\n\n  So while, since 1971, we have more than doubled, in inflation-\nadjusted dollars, what we are spending per pupil, the result has been \nno significant progress.\n  Let's go from reading to the math scores. The NAEP math scores tell \nessentially the same story. Since 1973, spending has increased from \nabout $5,000, $6,000, to over $8,000. We have a considerable increase \nover the years on the per-pupil expenditure. Yet you can see in the \n4th, 8th, and 12th grades, the scores remain, tragically, a flat line.\n  I suggest the evidence is overwhelming that money is simply not the \nanswer. Last year's Rand Corporation State-by-State comparison of test \nscores on annual spending per student on education, scores adjusted for \ndemographics and cost-of-living differences across the States, shows \nthat schools do not thrive on money alone. Texas ranked 24th among the \nStates on yearly spending per student, but they were first in test \nresults on the 1990-1996 NAEP test. Iowa was 21st in spending,\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\nbut they were third in results. On the other hand, Louisiana was 14th \nin spending per student, but they were 47th in results. There is simply \nno persuasive correlation between the amount spent and the academic \nachievement of students.\n  It is time for us to move in a new direction. I say money alone is \nnot the answer to all our problems. I am spending so much time on that \nbecause I know that is what we are going to hear all week long. We must \ntake a balanced, responsible approach to education reform. Funding \nwhere needed is important, but we can already find plenty of examples \nof innovative schools that do not have a wealth of funding. The \nHeritage Foundation published a book entitled ``No Excuses.'' This book \ntells the story of 21 high-performing high-poverty schools. One of \nthose schools is in Portland, AR; the Portland Elementary School. I \nwill give you an idea of where it is located. This, as the Presiding \nOfficer right now well knows, is the Mississippi Delta. On both sides \nof the Mississippi River is, I think, unquestionably the poorest \nregional area on a per-capita-income basis in the entire Nation. More \nso than even Appalachia is the Mississippi Delta. It is a struggling \narea in every way, economically and educationally.\n  This school, the Portland Elementary School, is located right here in \nPortland, AR, in southeast Arkansas. This school is led by a principal \nby the name of Ernest Smith. The Portland Elementary School, located in \nthe Mississippi Delta, has found high academic results. Oftentimes \nthose are not expected in this region of the country. They have found \nthese results by demanding academic achievement from every child in the \nschool. Portland Elementary has only 150 students in prekindergarten \nthrough the 6th grade. Mr. President, 77 percent of the students are \nfrom low-income homes. When Ernest Smith came to Portland 5 years ago, \nhalf of the students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades were \nscoring 2 years or more below grade level. Today 100 percent of the \nstudents in this elementary school are at grade level or above.\n  I want everyone to see this principal. This is Ernest Smith, an \nengaged principal who has transformed this elementary school in the \nMississippi Delta.\n  How did this remarkable turnaround happen? A dedicated principal, a \nschool district willing to try something different, and teachers who \nwere supportive of the approach--not a Federal program telling this \nprincipal what he should do. In fact, it had been his experience that \nthe Federal programs oftentimes got in his way.\n  Ernest Smith is 65 years old. He has been a teacher and a principal \nfor 43 years. This is what he did. He convinced the school to implement \nan instructional model called Direct Instruction, and test scores have \nrisen ever since he did it. Additionally, parents who enrolled their \nchildren in private schools in the area started to call Mr. Smith to \nenroll their children back in the local public school.\n  But Direct Instruction was not the only reason for the improvements \nin the school. Mr. Smith has increased parental involvement in the \nschool, where 50 percent of the parents attend a monthly parents \nmeeting, and 98 percent of the parents attended the parent-teacher \nconferences. In addition, more time during the schoolday was dedicated \nto direct involvement between the students and teachers. Mr. Smith \nrealized when children are at school they should be learning, so \nrecesses and naptimes were shortened or cut out.\n  On their most recent standardized tests from this spring, \nkindergartners scored at the 88th percentile nationally.\n  It is the poorest region of our Nation and the most educationally \nchallenged region of our Nation. However, the 88th percentile for \nkindergarten is not good enough for principal Ernest Smith. His goal is \nthe 100th percentile for every student.\n  You can see in kindergarten, grades 1, 2, and 3--in every grade--in \nthis elementary school, they are exceeding the national average, the \n50th percentile. Once again, his desire is to see 100.\n  Luke Gordy, chairman of the Arkansas Board of Education, said in an \neditorial written in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in reference to \nErnest Smith and Betty McGruder, principal at Whitten Elementary, \n``they have accepted no excuses for raising levels of learning for \nevery child under their care.'' They believe they must learn.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that money alone is not the answer. This \nschool doesn't have a lot of money. They have very little money. They \nare on a very tight budget. Their answer wasn't give us more money, but \ngive us the freedom to make the kinds of reforms in which teachers are \ngoing to be allowed to teach.\n  Having served in the State legislature and worked with local school \nboards, I don't subscribe to the notion that Washington is somehow all-\nknowing and that we policymakers on the Education and Labor Committee \nare somehow omniscient. Washington is not omniscient, and we are not \nperfect in knowing what is going to meet the needs of schools all over \nthis country.\n  This bill that we are debating requires accountability and student \nperformance measures in exchange for flexibility and discretion by \nStates and local schools. That is something the current system just \ndoes not have. The current system is a straightjacket for local \neducators. This system puts these local educators in handcuffs and \nsays: This is the way you must do it--that we must prescribe from \nWashington, DC. Rather than out-of-touch bureaucrats here in Washington \npulling the funding stream, the funding would be allocated under this \nbill directly to States and school districts. Funds would be \nconsolidated so that schools would have to spend less time filling out \ngrant forms, and so they could spend more time teaching.\n  The Presiding Officer directing our deliberations knows as well on \nour committee that we had the Secretary of Education come before us on \nmore than one occasion and repeatedly he reminded Members of the Senate \nthat his background is as a hands-on educator, superintendent, \nprincipal, someone who has been there, and someone who sees it from a \ndifferent perspective than what we too often see coming out of the \nFederal Department of Education. I think that is refreshing. I think \nthat is going to assist us in the path we have before us.\n  I think the facts are so clear and the message is so strong that \nproponents of the status quo realize that change is coming. People are \nrealizing that President Bush's plan makes sense, that it is going to \nbring real change, and that it is going to take us in a new direction. \nI am glad my colleagues have started to embrace the President's \npositions. I only hope these initiatives become stronger, not weaker, \nas we go through the debate in the next couple of weeks.\n  With millions of American students struggling to read, with millions \nof American students struggling to recite basic history facts or \nexhibit basic mathematical skills, one would hope we could collectively \nagree that we must try something different and we must collectively put \nour emphasis on student performance. We can do that by passing the \npending legislation.\n\n  An editorial op-ed piece written by Joel Belz--I don't know Joel \nBelz, but I thought he had a wonderful analogy of what we are facing, \nand those who are going to oppose this bill are setting themselves up \nagainst change. This is the way he put it. He said:\n\n       Advocates of statist education are like the older people in \n     the Soviet empire in the early 1990s.\n\n  This is Joel Belz. I am not impugning anybody's integrity.\n  He said:\n\n       They're vaguely aware their system isn't working--but \n     they've never known anything else. Even worse, statism has \n     dulled their creative powers, as it always does, and they \n     can't imagine anything other than what they've always known. \n     Their only solution is to multiply their efforts. ``Let's do \n     more of the same--much more,'' they proclaim cheerlessly. \n     ``If only we had more money to buy more of what we've already \n     got, maybe it would work.'' But it's like pushing boulders up \n     the long slope of a mountain.\n\n  But the forces that resist real change will repeatedly fall back on: \nWe just need to do more of what we have been doing for the last 35 \nyears, if we will just put more money in--while they defend this \ndeteriorating education bureaucracy and infrastructure that impedes \nreform instead of energizing reform.\n  Flexibility means freedom. Accountability means you have to measure. \nAfter you measure and you discover\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nand determine where the failing schools are, there must be \nconsequences. There must be ultimately more parental choice.\n  It has been said that the last seven words of any dying institution \nare, ``We never did it that way before.'' We will hear that disguised \nin various ways and in various euphemisms. We will hear that this week: \n``We never did it that way before.'' The real solution is, we need more \nmoney. The President agrees. Let's put in more resources. But the \nPresident has rightly put his finger on the problem: Most basically we \nneed reform.\n  Testing: Yes. Testing, because as fallible as it is, it is the best \ntool we have of determining if our children are really learning.\n  Flexibility: Yes. Because, as in welfare, the great reform that is \noccurring in education is happening not in Washington, DC, but in the \nStates--our laboratories all across this country.\n  Parental choice: Ultimately parents are still the first and best \neducators. They need to have the opportunity to ensure that their \nchildren are not shuffled through a system in which their children are \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  I believe that ultimately when this debate is brought before the \nAmerican people, and when it is brought before the Senate, the energy \nand the impetus for real reform that our President has given us will \nresult in the most dramatic and fundamental change in the Federal role \nin education since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was first \npassed and since the Department of Education was created. That is good \nnews for children all across our country who are being left behind.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to give an update to our \ncolleagues about the efforts to resolve some final items in the pending \nElementary and Secondary Education bill negotiations.\n  As my friend from Minnesota pointed out earlier, we don't have the \nfinal product. We have legislation that was reported out of Committee, \nbut at the time of reading of the Committee bill and the report, there \nwere a number of additional areas we were tasked to try to resolve, if \nwe could, in order to be able to fairly represent the best judgment of \nthe President of the United States and the Committee.\n  That has been an ongoing process. Members of our Education Committee, \nas well as other Senators--including Senator Lieberman and Senator \nBayh--indicated a particular interest to our leadership. A number of \nour colleagues, as well as the majority leader's staff will be very \nmuch involved in these negotiations.\n  I was interested in the statements and comments made last Friday \nabout the state of these negotiations by the majority leader, because \nthey really did not reflect what I think has been the ongoing effort \nthat all of us have been making to find common ground in this very \nimportant area of public policy.\n  I must say that I think we have moved in a very significant way in \ntrying to listen to each position and work through some of the \ndifferences.\n  I think in the area of policy conclusions we have made very important \nand substantial progress. It does not reflect all of my priorities. I \nwould have liked to have seen a good deal more investment in smaller \nclass sizes and school construction and modernization. I would like to \nsee firmer language for professional development, and some other areas \nas well. I will speak to those items when the legislation is considered \nby the full Senate.\n\n  But we have made important progress in a number of very important \nareas, particularly in putting the final touches on the accountability \nand Straight A's compromise. We resolved the key issues on bilingual \neducation, on after-school programs, on teacher quality, supplementary \nservices, on report cards, and on testing.\n  The points that my friend, Senator Wellstone, mentioned about \nensuring good quality testing is going to still be a matter that I hope \nwe can address in the Chamber. I think the examples he gave about these \nquick, slick, easy tests that are easily taught do not really test the \ndepth of a child's mind and their ability to really develop his or her \ngrasp of different educational concepts are telling. There are many \ngood tests that are being given. I think the NAEP test that is given in \nmy own State of Massachusetts, is a high-quality test. We've worked \nthrough important language in the assessment area.\n  Senators may need to meet tomorrow though to work through remaining \nitems that have not been resolved at the staff level. But, I still say \nto my colleagues, we have not reached a final agreement on the question \nof funding.\n  As we have heard from a number of our colleagues, I stand with those \nwho believe that having the changes in policy are important, but to \nreally breathe life into changes provided for in this bill, we need to \nhave the adequate funding.\n  I listened to my colleague from Arkansas talk about money, money, \nmoney--that is what others are going to say. The fact is, it isn't just \nus on this side of the aisle who are talking about enhanced resources. \nIn any fair, open examination of the number of children who need the \nservices that we are trying to provide, and who are not receiving those \nservices, if we are going to cover them, it is going to take an \ninvestment. It is as simple as that.\n  We are only reaching a third of the nation's neediest children. We \nsay in our legislation, on page 41, that there must be a timeline for \nensuring that each group of students must meet or exceed the State's \nproficient level of performance on the State assessment--within 10 \nyears from the date of enactment. Ten years is mentioned throughout \nthis piece of legislation--this is the commitment, that we are going to \nhave proficiency for the economically challenged children of this \ncountry who present severe needs in our society. If we are going to \nmeet our responsibility, it is going to take additional resources.\n  I listened to my colleague, Senator Hutchinson, talk about the Sylvan \nLearning Centers services that are offered to students across the \nnation. It costs $38 an hour for those services, and approximately 50 \nhours over the course of a school year in order for a student to show \nimprovement. That adds up to $1,900 a year for extra services to one \nchild. Sylvan guarantees that after 36 hours of learning session, \nchildren go advance one grade level.\n  We know that without adequate funding we're still going to be failing \nto respond to the needs for supplementary services for children.\n  As we begin this debate we need to understand what is really missing \nin the legislation. We are not reaching one-third of the children \neligible for supplemental assistance. This Administration has made a \ncommitment to ensure that all children will be guaranteed at least the \nbenefits of this legislation. If done well and right, that will mean a \nwell-trained teacher in the classroom, a reformed curriculum, tough \naccountability, and the opportunity for parents to understand how well \ntheir children are doing or not doing, and how well that school is \ndoing or not doing.\n\n  We seek strong accountability of schools, of teachers, and of \nchildren. The question is, Are we going to be accountable? Are we going \nto be accountable for ensuring that all the children are going to be \ncovered? I think that is the fundamental issue in terms of funding. \nUnless we are going to do that, we do a real disservice to the children \nin this country.\n  This is not going to be the only education debate we are going to \nhave.\n  We also understand the importance of early intervention programs for \nchildren. I was very disappointed that the President's budget \neliminated the early education program. This is a program that was \nsupported by Senator Stevens, Senator Jeffords, myself, Senator Dodd, \nand Senator Kerry--a strong bipartisan program that gave a great deal \nof flexibility. It includes part of our effort to try to make sure \nchildren are going to be ready to learn when they enter school. As all \nthe various studies, including the Carnegie Commission reports, \ndemonstrate that early intervention add immeasurably to children's \ninterest in learning, their ability to learn, and in the development of \ntheir interpersonal skills.\n  If we say we are going to benefit from the knowledge that we have \ndiscovered over recent years, we ought to be supporting early \nintervention for children,\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nand in many instances, for parents. Many times, particularly in the \nareas of reading, parents also have difficulty reading. Some of the \nmost successful reading programs involve parents as well as the \nchildren.\n  We are also going to come back to the debate on the funding of the \nHead Start Program. We are still in some States, only serving 40 to 43 \npercent of eligible children. In some major urban centers in our \ncountry approximately 25 percent of the children that are eligible to \ngo to Head Start, are able to find the slots to do so.\n  The Head Start Program has been examined, and it has been shown that \nthe benefits from it in the early education years, add immeasurably to \nthe child's development during the period of their education, and can \neven last through middle school and high school, if done and well \nsupported.\n\n  Many of us are disheartened, from recent studies on child care, which \nshow a high level of turnover that is taking place in Head Start \nPrograms. Some children are exposed to two or three teachers over the \ncourse of one year. This means confusion to the children and a lost \nopportunity.\n  Early intervention is key for enhanced academic achievement for the \nchildren, and in many respects are as important as many of the issues \nwe are going to be dealing with in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation act.\n  I am strongly committed to a strong partnership between the Federal \nGovernment, the State, and the local community. Parents want the best \nfor their children and they will take it wherever they can find it. We \nhave the opportunity and the responsibility to provide these resources. \nThat is what the Federal role is today. It may be expanded in the \nfuture, but today it is targeted to the neediest children.\n  The prime responsibility for education funding still remains with the \nState and local community. If there has been a failure--and there has \nbeen--in trying to bring substandard schools up to the point where they \nare going to be benefitting children, the blame lies with the States \nand local communities, as well as with the efforts the Federal \ngovernment has made in the past. We are spending about $400 billion a \nyear, and with $8.6 billion dedicated to title I. This works out to \napproximately 2 cents in terms of interventions directly with the \nneediest children.\n  Our elementary schools are much different than they were 10 or 15 \nyears ago. We are bringing children who have special needs into our \npublic schools and attempting to mainstream them. They take the test \nalong with everybody else in the class. Schools are also dealing with a \nlarge population of students who do not speak English as a first \nlanguage, which creates an increasing complexity in terms of having \nwell-trained teachers. I recently went to the Revere High School, just \noutside of Boston, where there are 43 different languages being spoken \nby students.\n  These challenges are compounded by increased divisions of families, \nthe explosion of substance abuse, and the growth of violence in \nsociety--all falling primarily on the same children and then we wonder \nwhy these students are not getting all A's and B's in school. Then the \nfinger is pointed at the Federal Government saying, they have failed us \non this--that is a simplistic explanation and observation about what \nhas been happening to elementary and secondary schools across the \nnation.\n  We have been attempting to do the best we can, through strong \naccountability measures to give the parents the information and then \nultimately empower them at the time, if a school has been failing, to \nmake some choices and decisions on what they find to be in the best \ninterests of their children. We are going to strengthen the \nsupplementary services for children so that those children who have \nbeen found in need as a result of the tests are going to get the \nsupplementary services.\n  Unless we provide the resources, we are only, according to the best \njudgment, now providing the additional services for probably 15 to 18 \npercent of the children in need. We are going to make sure that schools \nare held accountable. We are going to insist on a strong professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers.\n  I was recently in a school just outside of Quincy, Massachusetts, \nwhere they implemented professional development programs. They had a \n100 percent turnout of teachers for this program. They say the thirst \nand interest of teachers in being able to have that professional \ndevelopment is replicated all across this country.\n\n  We ought to make these opportunities available for teachers, \nespecially in the inner cities that do not have the kind of \nprofessional training, but in many instances, have dedicated teachers \nwho are pouring their life into trying to serve children in need.\n  We are so easy to condemn these teachers where in most circumstances, \nthey would be able to leave, and perhaps with less tension and danger, \nif they went into a different situation.\n  There are no easy answers. And to those who suggest that this \nlegislation is going to answer our problems, we ought to take a very \nhealthy sense of pause as we begin.\n  I will just say a final word about the investments in education. I \ncan remember not long ago talking with Mary Robinson, President of \nIreland, asking her about some of the things that gave her the greatest \nsatisfaction as the President of Ireland. She told me a couple of years \nago that she had just gone to the 10 best schools in Ireland. I asked \nwhere they were. She said they were in the poorest areas of Ireland.\n  I said: How so? That would not be the situation you would necessarily \nfind here in the United States.\n  She said: We have virtual uniformity in terms of funding of the \nschools in Ireland.\n  Of course, that is not the case here. You find out that in most urban \nareas, they are spending about a third of what they spend in the more \naffluent communities. That happens to be a reality. That makes a great \ndeal of difference in terms of both the physical structures, resources, \ntraining, and the programs and the atmosphere and the curriculum the \nchildren have.\n  She continued and said: The best teachers in Ireland go to these \nunderserved areas because they find it the most challenging and because \nthey find the children are the hungriest because they know that the key \nto getting out of many of these areas is an education. And most \npowerfully, the parents understand that. So they are engaged and \ninvolved.\n  They have had extraordinary results. That doesn't surprise me. If \nchildren had the opportunity and knew they were getting something that \nreally was as good or the best, they would try to excel and succeed. If \nthey knew they could get support services, they would make all of the \nadditional efforts to try to be the kind of students their parents \nwould be proud of. That is the lesson of history. That happens \nthroughout the whole world. Why we don't think that will happen here is \na great misunderstanding.\n  To do it, you have to do it right. Many of us on this side see that \nwe are developing a formulation in terms of this legislation that will \nhave both accountability, flexibility, and responsibility. It will have \nsomething that can make a significant and important difference in doing \nit right. Funding is going to be the key to whether those services are \ngoing to be there or not.\n  I will mention the contrast in funding between this side of the aisle \nand the Administration. We have, on all of the ESEA programs for fiscal \nyear 2001, $3.6 billion, a 24-percent increase. This year, the \nAdministration offered a 3.5 percent increase, as compared to a 24-\npercent annual increase last year. In fiscal year 2001, the budget \nincrease for the entire Department of Education, was $6.5 billion, as \ncompared to the Administrations proposed budget increase of $2.5 \nbillion, 5.9 percent.\n  Money isn't everything, but it is a clear indication of a nation's \npriorities.\n  We have had this debate where we have said that our No. 1 priority is \ngoing to be the tax reduction. That is our No. 1 priority. The \nPresident has said this is a top priority. Well, the point is, if it is \na top priority and the first priority is a tax break, somewhere out \nthere they have to meet. They ought to be reflected in the additional \nkind of resources to be able to fund these programs in a way that will \nmake a difference for the children.\n  The reason I haven't lost some hope of having some assurances from \nthe President is that I look at what happened with school funding in \nTexas. Between 1994 and 2000, funding went from\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n$16.9 billion to $27.5 billion, which is a 57-percent increase. We saw \na corresponding enhancement in the children's achievement levels in \nTexas.\n  I hear the arguments from the other side that money isn't everything. \nThis President saw the importance of investing in children and \ninvesting in the quality of teachers and others, and it has really made \nthe difference.\n  So we will soon have the chance to debate these issues in greater \ndetail. I hope that prior to that time we have a last best judgment \nfrom the President that will give assurances we are going to have the \nfunding to enhance this change. I hope to include at least another \nthird of the children in the area of title I. Then we can give an \nassurance to the American people that during this Presidential term he \nwill fight for the complete funding for the title I program.\n  I think that would be an enormously powerful message. I daresay I \nthink he could be assured of every vote for that full funding from this \nside of the aisle. I welcome the opportunity to join that. That would \nreally give light to what we believe the children in this country need \nand deserve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for just a moment about \nthe issue of education. We are turning now to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization. This is critically important \nlegislation.\n  The one thing I think it is important for us to say at the start of \nthis debate is that education has worked in this country for a long \ntime. There are some areas in which education has failed American \nchildren, but generally speaking, you cannot say that.\n  We live in a country that is blessed with opportunities that most \ncountries have never had. In my judgment, that has happened because we \nhave had a public education system--since before the independence of \nour country--that said: We are going to allow all young children to be \nwhatever their God-given talent can allow them to be. That is called \nuniversal education. Every child coming into this country's school \nsystem is allowed to be whatever his or her God-given talent allows. \nThat has really provided remarkable dividends for our country.\n  Think of where we have been and what we have done. It is quite a \nremarkable record. We survived a civil war. We survived a depression. \nWe beat back the oppression of Naziism. In terms of technology, think \nof what we have done as a country. Both the spirit of Americans and our \neducation combined have allowed us to split the atom. We have mapped \nthe human genome. We have done so many things. We have spliced genes. \nWe have invented plastics, the silicone chip, radar. We built airplanes \nand learned to fly them. We built rockets and flew to the Moon. We have \ncured small pox. We have cured polio.\n  When you think of what we have done in our country--we have created \ntelephones and television and the computers--it is quite remarkable.\n  One could ask the question, it seems to me, how did all of that \nhappen in our country? Why didn't all that happen somewhere in downtown \nTegucigalpa? It happened in our country because we have made a lot of \nthe right choices for a long period of time in this country. We have an \neducation system in this country that has produced remarkable thinkers, \nthat has allowed the genius of every young child in this country to \nbecome what it can become.\n  Now we are poised in the first year of this new millennium to do even \ngreater things. We come here debating education and trying to respond \nto the challenge of dealing with school systems that are failing \nbecause there are some that are not making the progress they should. \nBut I think it is very important to point out that there are many \nschool systems that are succeeding well beyond anyone's expectations.\n  There are a lot of ways to succeed. Some say, if you make the right \ninvestments, you can have good schools that are well repaired, \nclassrooms that are of sufficient size, and enough quality teachers. \nYou can make this education system work well in every part of this \ncountry.\n  There used to be a custom of building little red schoolhouses. When \neveryone thinks of schoolhouses, they think of a picture of the little \nred schoolhouse. I am told that the little red schoolhouse originated \nin the Northeastern States, and it originated for a particular reason. \nSchoolhouses originated as red because red paint was cheaper than any \nother color. So schoolhouses were painted red, I suppose, because the \npeople at that time wanted to save money on those schools.\n  There are ways to save money on schools, to be sure. But it is not \nnecessarily in the best interests of children if you save money by \nwithdrawing the opportunity for a good, full, and balanced education.\n\n  My hope is that when we talk about this piece of legislation, we can \nemphasize the positive in areas where we agree--and there are plenty of \nthem. President Bush has made a proposal that has, in my judgment, a \nlot of good things in it. He has also presented a proposal that is \ndeficient and leaves out a lot of important things.\n  So what we ought to do is start with this premise: No. 1, much of our \neducation system in this country is working, and working well. Some \nschools are failing. Reading achievement is up. The National Assessment \nof Educational Progress shows that during the last decade, reading \nachievement has significantly improved in all grades tested.\n  Is our reading achievement sufficient? Should it be better? Yes, it \nought to be better. But testing shows we are on the right track. \nMathematics and science achievement is up. Students are better prepared \nfor college.\n  In the 1990s, the scores on both the SAT and the ACT have climbed \nsteadily. Students are taking tougher courses. Between 1992 and 1997, \nthe number of high school students taking advanced placement courses in \nall subjects increased by two-thirds.\n  Some will come to this debate--perhaps tomorrow morning--and say: We \nhave this education recession. Woe is us. Our schools are failing. All \nacross America, our schools are failing.\n  I think that is a disservice to our teachers and our schools. The \nfact is, we have a lot of wonderful teachers in the classroom. They are \nwho we leave our children with every day, all day. I have been in many \nclassrooms, and I think in almost every circumstance I have left that \nclassroom with great admiration for those teachers who are committed, \nimpassioned, and want to do a good job for those students.\n  But I have been in classrooms where teachers could not do a very good \njob because they had 35 children in the classroom--one teacher trying \nto keep track of 35 children and trying to provide some kind of \nindividual educational opportunity. It is impossible with 35 children. \nWe know it. You have to reduce class size to be more effective in \neducating children.\n  I have been in classrooms where the students' desks are an inch apart \nand where the building is 95 years old and was long ago condemned, \nwhere children can't have access to computers or the Internet because \nthey do not have the capability of wiring those classrooms, and where \nyou have 150 students and one water fountain and two bathrooms.\n  I have been in those schools. We know that is not an optimum way to \nteach children. So we ought to provide some assistance for the \nrenovation of crumbling schools, for the renovation of those schools \nthat are in disrepair.\n  Over half a century ago, those brave soldiers who fought and won the \nSecond World War came back to this country and they fell in love. They \ngot married and had children. They built schools all across this \nNation. Those schools are now 50 and 60 years old. Those schools are in \ndisrepair in many cases and need to be modernized. We need to do \nsomething to help make sure we remedy that.\n  Education is not some mysterious machine in which we pull some levers \nand turn some dials and we get it just right. Education has the element \nof three things, in my judgment, to work well: One, you have to have a \nteacher who knows how to teach; two, you have to have a student who \nreally wants to learn; and, three, you have to have a parent involved \nin that student's education. If you do not have all three, it just does \nnot work in almost all cases.\n\n  We need to do things to try to encourage the retention of good \nteachers and the development of new teachers. Some States are woefully \ninadequate when it comes to compensating teachers, and it is a shame. \nTeachers spend\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nall day with our children. I have children in sixth grade and eighth \ngrade classes today. My children go to public schools, but I want them \nto go to good schools. Their public schools are good schools. They have \nwonderful, committed teachers. I want that to be the case in every part \nof our country.\n  One of the specific interests I have in the bill that we are going to \nbe debating is the issuance of school report cards. I am joining a \nnumber of my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats --to work on a \nschool report card that will go to parents, so that parents know which \nschools are failing and which are succeeding.\n  The fact is, we all get report cards on our kids. We know how our \nkids are doing in math, in science, civics. We know that because they \ngo to school, they come back home, and then they get a report card \nevery 6 weeks to 9 weeks. And that report card says: Here is how your \nson or daughter did in mathematics. And it is an A, B, C, D or, God \nforbid, an F, but it is an assessment of how that child is doing.\n  There is no similar uniform requirement for American parents or \ntaxpayers to get a grade on how well their school is doing.\n  How is my school doing versus a school in the next county or another \nschool in the same city, or how are the schools doing in my State \nversus school systems in another State. Don't we deserve the \nopportunity to see how well we are doing? Shouldn't we have an \nassessment of how well the schools are doing? How about a report card \nfor schools? Some States have report cards, but their contents are \nwildly diverse. There is no consistency at all, and there is no \ncapability for parents to get a good measurement.\n  School report cards ought to include graduation and retention rates. \nThat has something to do with evaluating whether schools are serving \nour kids well. Qualifications of teachers, average class size, school \nsafety, parental involvement, those are some of the pieces of \ninformation we can give parents and taxpayers to provide them an \nunderstanding of what we are getting from this school system of ours. \nAre we getting what we want from the school system? Are children \ngetting what they need from the school system?\n  Our rural schools face some unique challenges that we need to help \nthem address. Many of my colleagues come from areas where the need to \nreduce class size is crucial because there are so many children coming \ninto the school system they can't handle them, but many rural schools \nhave the opposite problem. Last week, I mentioned that my hometown is \nclosing its high school. My hometown high school is closing. They had \nthe last high school prom on April 7.\n  When I graduated many years ago, I was in a high school class of \nnine. Now, of course, there are not enough students in those four \ngrades in that high school to continue the school. Those kids will be \ngoing to neighboring towns to high school. They held their last prom \nand will hold those memories for many years, but the Regent High School \nwill no longer exist.\n\n  In rural counties, the issue is: how do you pay for a school in which \nyou have nine students in a grade or in some cases two or three \nstudents in a grade. That is a separate issue, one we should be \nconcerned about as well.\n  There are many challenges. But in this debate, unlike some others, \neveryone will come to the floor wanting the same thing. We share \nexactly the same goal. We want to do well by our children and to have \nthe finest school system in the world. Some will say: You can't throw \nmoney at it. I agree with that. But we can't expect to do what we want \nfor our children without being willing to fund some of the needs as \nwell. That is the other side of the coin.\n  Some will say: The way to solve this issue is just to provide \nvouchers and let parents take their children to private schools if they \nwant to do that. Of course, those who say that went to a school that \ntaught arithmetic that was different than my arithmetic. The numbers \njust don't add up. If you give someone a $1,500 voucher and that is \nall, can a student show up at a private school and be welcomed with \nopen arms. Does the private school say: Welcome, we can provide a \nreally good education for $1,500. That just does not happen. Private \nschools are much more expensive than that. If we are truly going to \ndecide to leave no child behind, how can we possibly suggest that the \nsolution to a bad school is to take the few kids out of that school who \nare given a voucher and leave all the rest of the kids behind. That is \nnot ``leave no child behind.'' That is just leaving whole schools \nbehind.\n  We can do a lot better than that. The country expects us to do better \nthan that.\n  Some will search for simple answers when, in fact, the answers are \nnot always very simple. This requires our attention.\n  It is time to address this issue. It is time for us to debate, offer \namendments, and reach a consensus in the Senate about what direction we \nwant the country to go with respect to the education of our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the dedicated \nservice of my good friend and committed public servant, Chief Robert E. \nLangston, upon his retirement from the U.S. Park Police Force. After 35 \nyears on the force, including the last 10 years as chief, Robert \nLangston stepped down earlier this month a day prior to his 60th \nbirthday, the mandatory retirement age for all Park Police officers. He \nleaves behind an impressive legacy of dedication, integrity, \ncommitment, and success as the leader of one of the oldest law \nenforcement agencies in the country.\n  Robert Langston was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and joined \nthe Park Police shortly after he graduated from Florida State \nUniversity at the young age of 24 years old. Through hard work and \ndedication he gradually ascended to the impressive rank of U.S. Park \nPolice Chief.\n  As chief, he oversaw the policing of the national park grounds in \nWashington, New York, and San Francisco. He worked tirelessly and \nsacrificed much in order to ensure the safety of the thousands who used \nor visited these grounds, and the agency flourished under his \nleadership. Chief Langston consistently went above the call of duty to \nmake sure all Americans, and anyone visiting our Nation from abroad, \nwould be safe while on the national park grounds.\n  He is to be commended for his exemplary service to the U.S. Park \nPolice Department, and to this fine Nation. The force is stronger \nbecause of Chief Langston's dedicated leadership, and he can take great \npride in all that he accomplished during his noteworthy tenure. Chief \nLangston has made countless contributions to the U.S. Park Police \nDepartment during his distinguished career. He has been a friend, \nteacher, and a model of excellence to the many fine men and women who \nhad the honor to serve alongside Chief Langston. Bob Langston is a \ngreat man and a truly great American. He was an asset to the U.S. Park \nPolice, and I am certain that though his presence will be missed, his \ninfluence will continue for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4034-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4034-S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BRINGING SOUTH DAKOTA'S STRENGTH TO THE WORLD'S CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues a \nsummary of the key findings from our recent official congressional \ndelegation trip to North Africa, Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. Those \nfindings are outlined below, and they relate to opportunities\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\nfor trade and investment in North Africa as well as prospects for \nrapprochement between Turkey and Greece and the admirable efforts of \nour troops to bring peace and stability to Kosovo. I have already \nshared these findings with the Secretaries of Defense and State and am \nglad to do so now with our colleagues in Congress. We had a number of \nsubstantive discussions on this trip that I believe will contribute to \nU.S. policy in these two important regions of the world.\n  I am proud of, and grateful to, all the American personnel with whom \nwe worked. They facilitated the educational value of the trip and are \ntrue ambassadors for their country abroad.\n  I especially want to call the Senate's attention to the South \nDakotans I visited on this trip. On a daily basis, South Dakotans are \nimproving the lives of people struggling with drought in southern \nMorocco and picking up the pieces after ethnic conflict in Kosovo. I am \nimpressed by the way individual South Dakotans are helping people \nthroughout the world get another chance at a better life.\n  In 1999 and 2000, Morocco suffered its most severe drought in a \ndecade. Drought in Morocco, where 20 percent of the GDP is accounted \nfor by agriculture, and roughly half the population is employed in \nagriculture, extracts a steep human toll.\n  In that environment, experienced farmers, who have lived through and \nconquered the challenges of drought, can be the key to saving a crop, \nnot to mention lives. Imagine the good fortune for the Moroccan \ncommunity just outside of Essaouira when they were assigned two Peace \nCorps volunteers from Brookings, South Dakota, with several decades of \nexperience in farming. Just a few years ago, after raising their \nchildren and putting them through school, Frances and Harris Davis sold \ntheir family farm in Elkton, SD and joined the Peace Corps. They \njoined, in the words of Fran Harris, to give back some of the blessings \nthey had received in their years as farmers in Elkton.\n  For more than two years, family by family, the Davises have been \nimproving the lives of countless Moroccans. They have helped Moroccans \nwith land and water management in the midst of a crippling drought. \nBecause tools are scarce in their region, they have become a resource \nto cash-strapped farmers throughout southeastern Morocco. And using the \nexperience they gained making their own farm vehicles work, they have \neven been mechanics for numerous vehicles, including the water truck in \na thirsty town.\n  Not only are the people they have helped much better off. The United \nStates, because of the goodwill that Fran and Harris have generated, is \nalso better off.\n  And the same is true of the three South Dakotans, and their families, \nI met at Incirlik Air Base in Adana, Turkey. These individuals are key \nmembers of U.S. Operation Northern Watch, ONW, an operation that has \nbeen successful in protecting Turkey's Kurdish minority for much of the \nlast decade.\n  Col. Maurice H. Forsythe, born in Brookings and a graduate of South \nDakota State University, was deployed to Incirlik with his wife Tamara \nand their son Riley. Colonel Forsythe was Combined Forces Air Component \nCommander for Operation Northern Watch, coordinating all flight \nactivity out of Incirlik. Notwithstanding an Iraqi bounty of $14,000 \nfor any Iraqi who downs a ONW aircraft, the U.S., Great Britain, Turkey \ncoalition has not yet lost an aircraft, a tribute to Col. Forsythe's \nleadership and hard work.\n  Captain Pat Castle, of Sioux Falls, was deployed to Incirlik last \nyear. While Captain Castle fulfills his duty with the Air Force, he and \nhis wife Angie are also raising their 1-year-old daughter Paige on the \nbase at Incirlik. Senior Airman Krissy Sayles of Lead, SD, was also \ndeployed to Incilik late last year from Shaw AFB in South Carolina. \nKrissy Sayles provides logistical support to the U.S. and British \npersonnel and airplanes that are enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq and \nhas provided the same service in assignments throughout the Middle \nEast. Compounding her sacrifice, her husband, also in the Air Force, \nremains in the U.S. while Senior Airman Sayles works halfway around the \nworld in Turkey.\n  Paul E. Poletes, also of Sioux Falls, is a diplomat in the U.S. \nForeign Service stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Paul Poletes \nis responsible for making sure that U.S. personnel in Athens have the \ninfrastructure they need to advance U.S. interests in Greece and the \nEuropean Union. Paul and his wife were recently assigned to Bangladesh, \nwhere he will work to advance the interests of the United States as \nwell as help Bangladeshis, one of the world's poorest countries.\n  Our delegation also visited Camp Able Sentry in Skopje, Macedonia to \nmeet with the U.S. and NATO personnel who have done so much to \nstabilize Kosovo. U.S. Army Sergeant Jonnie D. Larsen, a 1989 graduate \nof Menno High School, was deployed to Kosovo with his battalion from \nBaumholder, Germany. U.S. Army Platoon Sergeant Michael Mewherter, from \nBowdle, SD and a 1987 graduate of Clear Lake High School, was also \ndeployed to Kosovo from Fort Bragg, NC.\n  Among the many compliments for the hard work of Americans serving in \nKosovo we heard on our trip, two stand out. The first was from KFOR \nCommander, Italian General Cabigiosu, who said the U.S. component was \nthe glue that kept NATO's KFOR together. And the second is from the \nchildren of Kosovo, who admire Sergeant Larsen, Staff Sergeant \nMewherter and the rest of the American servicemen and women as the \nforce that returned their stability and their future.\n  We ask our servicemen and women like Jonnie Larsen and Michael \nMewherter to do a lot. Time and again, including this time, when both \nthese young men were deployed to Kosovo for several months without \ntheir families, they respond.\n  Americans from each and every state are having a positive impact on \nthe lives of people the world over. I was fortunate to see how these \nseven individuals from South Dakota have done such a fine job. Their \nefforts make me proud, America stronger and the world better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the key findings from our \nrecent official congressional delegation trip to North Africa, Turkey, \nGreece and Macedonia be inserted in the Record at the close of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n   Codel Daschle to Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Portugal, \n                          February 16-25, 2001\n\n       From February 16 to February 25, Senate Democratic Leader \n     Tom Daschle, SD, led a Senate delegation on an official visit \n     to Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Portugal. The \n     delegation also included Sen. Harry Reid, NV, Sen. Tom \n     Harkin, IA, Sen. Kent Conrad, ND, Sen. Byron Dorgan, ND, and \n     Sen. Barbara Boxer, CA. This trip report summarizes the \n     findings of that trip.\n       Summary of key findings:\n       The U.S.-North Africa economic partnership initiative, \n     commonly referred to as the Eisenstat Initiative, is valuable \n     effort to advance American trade and investment in a growing \n     market. With 80 million people and a combined GDP of $137 \n     billion, there are good opportunities for U.S. companies to \n     invest and trade in the countries of North Africa, and U.S. \n     firms are beginning to reap the benefits of this initiative. \n     U.S. firms are expanding in the energy, aircraft and telecom \n     sectors in Morocco alone.\n       The U.S. should give consideration to other creative ideas \n     in order to boost American involvement in North Africa \n     markets, including debt for equity swaps. In any case, \n     aggressive promotion of U.S. exporters and investors is a \n     necessary counter to the traditional ties--and aggressive \n     subsidies, of European influence in North Africa.\n       The American and British personnel that operate in Iraqi \n     air space to enforce the no fly zone and to monitor Iraqi \n     compliance with relevant United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions do so at great risk.\n       The delegation is concerned that there is not an \n     appreciation within Washington--in the Administration and in \n     the Congress, for the extreme risk that American personnel \n     undertake daily.\n       The bombing in southern Iraq above the 33rd parallel on \n     February 16 was a justifiable response to increased Iraqi \n     efforts to target U.S. and British planes, but the delegation \n     expresses its strong regret that the Bush Administration did \n     not consult, or even notify, Congress of the planned \n     bombings. Given the strong international criticism of the \n     containment of Iraq--which the delegation encountered during \n     its trip--it behooves the Bush Administration to consult more \n     closely with Congress so as to ensure domestic consensus on \n     this critical issue.\n       The delegation is concerned that, two weeks after the \n     initial disagreement that gave rise to the economic crisis in \n     Turkey, there is as yet no plan to get Turkey's economy back \n     on track. The underlying strength of the Turkish economy as \n     well as the perseverance of the Turkish people will be \n     tremendous assets in developing that plan.\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\n       In Greece, the government is taking important steps toward \n     confronting the threat of terrorism in that country. \n     Cooperation with international forces is increasing, but \n     ultimately results in the fight against terrorism will be the \n     key to easing U.S. concern about terrorism in Greece.\n       The delegation was impressed with, and proud of, the clear \n     and positive impact of U.S. personnel in Kosovo. U.S. \n     personnel make up a relatively small portion of the overall \n     KFOR force, representing less than 15 percent of the total \n     force and the trend of U.S. portion of the force is due to \n     continue decreasing (the U.S. component will represent just \n     13 percent of the total force by 2001).\n       The U.S. and NATO leadership believe that the U.S. should \n     maintain a presence in Kosovo for the foreseeable future. The \n     U.S. leadership feared that a pull out of American forces \n     would not only risk the successes to date in the Balkans, but \n     that it would be a major blow to the NATO alliance.\n       The U.S. personnel involved in KFOR, from the general \n     officers to the enlisted, also strongly touted the training \n     benefits of this deployment, calling it the best possible \n     training U.S. personnel can get. The U.S. leadership \n     maintained that morale among U.S. forces in Kosovo is ``sky \n     high'' and reported that re-enlistment rates among Army \n     personnel in Kosovo is higher than anywhere else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4036-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  Today, I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred July 4, \n2000 in Grant Town, WV. Arthur ``J.R.'' Carl Warren Jr., 26, an openly \ngay African American man, was brutally murdered. Warren, whose body was \nfound on the edge of his hometown, was allegedly killed by two 17-year-\nold boys. Known to call Warren names considered racial epithets and \nanti-gay slurs, the boys allegedly beat him and repeatedly kicked him \nwith steel-toed boots. They threw him in a car and drove across town, \nignoring his pleas to be taken home, which they passed on the way to \nthe gravel pullout where they savagely kicked him and then ultimately \nkilled him by driving back and forth over him. Neither current federal \nlaw nor West Virginia's hate crimes law include sexual orientation.\n  Mr. President, I believe that government's first duty is to defend \nits citizens--to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. \nThe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that \ncan become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4036-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL GUARD COUNTERDRUG MISSION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I rise to commend the counterdrug \nefforts of the National Guard. The National Guard performs vital work \nto assist law enforcement with interdiction/eradication operations, \nincluding the manufacture, sale, use and importation, and demand \nreduction for drugs throughout our country.\n  Every day the National Guard has approximately 3,600 personnel on \nduty performing counterdrug work. The National Guard supports the \nPresident's counterdrug priorities, with special emphasis along the \nSouthwest Border and designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \n(HIDTAs). In addition, the Governor of each State can assign the \nNational Guard to unique local issues. Skills the National Guard brings \ninclude personnel, specialized vehicles and military equipment, \nlogistical support, thermal imaging, intelligence analysis, \ntranslation, searching cargo containers at ports of entry, and \nlistening/observation posts. Federal agencies typically supported \ninclude the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI), the Customs Service, and the Border Patrol, while \nState and local agencies include highway patrols, country sheriffs, and \nlocal police departments.\n  The Department of Defense is prohibited by U.S. Code Title 10, under \nthe Posse Comitatus Act, from military personnel enforcing State and \nlocal laws. The National Guard, under its United States Code Title 32 \nstatus, does not have this prohibition, although National Guard \nregulations do not allow direct involvement in law enforcement, such as \narrest, apprehension, search and seizure. Since 1988, the Governor of \neach State submits a plan each year to the Department of Defense \noutlining the proposed use of the National Guard in support of \ncounterdrug efforts. Currently, about 50 percent of the requests are \nable to be funded.\n  The National Guard also has an active demand reduction mission geared \nto helping youth avoid starting to use illegal drugs.

GREEN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to speak today to \nacknowledge a lawyer, from my home State of Michigan, who has dedicated \nhis life to serving the citizens of Detroit, Saul A. Green. On May 2nd \nof this year, hundreds of people will gather to pay tribute to Saul A. \nGreen for his service as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nMichigan.\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\n  Saul Green has dedicated his life, both professionally and \npersonally, to the service of his community. Since graduating from the \nUniversity of Michigan law school in 1972, Saul has been a lawyer \ndedicated to serving the public interest. He began his career in the \nlaw as an Assistant United States Attorney. However, he quickly became \nchief counsel for the Detroit Field Office of the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. He served in this capacity from 1976 \nuntil 1989 when he was asked to serve as the Wayne County Corporation \nCounsel.\n  It was while serving as corporation counsel that President Clinton \nnominated Saul to be the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nMichigan. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on May 6, 1994. \nThe position of U.S. Attorney is not an easy one for it requires that \none enforce and interpret the laws of our great Nation. Difficult as \nthis position may be, for nearly 7 years Saul capably and honorably \nserved as U.S. Attorney.\n  In addition to these activities, Saul Green is a leader in his church \nand with numerous community projects. He has worked on several Weed and \nSeed projects in the Eastern District of Michigan, sponsored an \nExplorer Scouts Troop and worked with a Drug Education Youth Camp. On \naccount of his leadership with these projects, he received the Damon J. \nKeith Community Spirit Award. Saul is also a life member of the NAACP.\n  Saul has been an active alumnus of his alma mater, the University of \nMichigan. In addition to serving on the university's board of \ndirectors, he currently is the vice president of the U of M alumni \nassociation. His devotion to the maize and blue was acknowledged in \n1994 when the University of Michigan awarded him the Leonard F. Sain \nEsteemed Alumni Award.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Saul A. Green \nfor his career of public service, particularly the commitment to \njustice and law enforcement he embodied while serving as U.S. Attorney \nfor the Eastern District of Michigan for nearly 7 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4037-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING FABIAN CHAVEZ, JR.\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, recently during the 45th Session \nof the New Mexico State Senate, Fabian Chavez, Jr., was honored for his \nmany accomplishments. This recognition coincided with the 40th \nanniversary of the founding of the University of New Mexico's School of \nMedicine and the establishment of an Endowed Chair for Population \nHealth Research at the school, in his honor.\n  Fabian Chavez should be commended for his many years of service. He \nserved for 10 years in the New Mexico legislature, including 2 years in \nthe house of representatives and 8 years in the State senate, elected \nto the position of senate majority floor leader during his tenure. \nDuring these years in the New Mexico State legislature, he fought to \nreform the Justice of Peace System and Liquor Control Laws. In 1961, he \nbegan appropriations to start the University of New Mexico's School of \nMedicine. His many accomplishments are far too many to list \nindividually, but are visible on a daily basis.\n  Because of his dedication, his fellow colleagues continue to look to \nFabian for advice, counsel, and guidance, usually receiving immediate \nresponse without any hesitation.\n  He has continued his devotion by serving as the State Insurance \nSuperintendent, the Assistant U.S. Secretary of Commerce, the State \nDepartment of Development Director and the State Tourism Director. He \nis happiest when he is pursuing a goal in the name of justice, in \nparticular in his role on the board of directors of the Public \nEmployees Retirement Association.\n  Fabian Chavez is not only a great Public Servant, but a friend to the \npeople of New Mexico. I commend Fabian for his hard work and have the \nprivilege of joining with the New Mexico State Legislature in \ncongratulating Fabian on this special occasion.\n  I ask that the Congratulations Resolution passed by the New Mexico \nLegislature be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Fabian Chavez, Jr., has devoted his adult life to \n     Public Service, serving in the New Mexico Legislature for Ten \n     Years, including Two Years in the House of Representatives \n     and Eight Years in the New Mexico State Senate; and\n       Whereas, ``Fabian,'' as he is simply known to everyone who \n     has had the pleasure of meeting him, also served as the State \n     Insurance Superintendent, the Assistant United States \n     Secretary of Commerce, the State Department of Development \n     Director and the State Tourism Director; and\n       Whereas, Fabian is happiest when he is bucking the System \n     to pursue a goal in the Name of Justice, a characteristic \n     that he displays to this day in his Role on the Board of \n     Directors of the Public Employees Retirement Association; and\n       Whereas, Fabian distinguishes himself at virtually \n     everything he does, as evidenced by everything from the Five \n     Battle Stars he earned during his Career in the Army and his \n     Election by his colleagues to the position of Senate Majority \n     Floor Leader; and\n       Whereas, Fabian's Legislative Accomplishments, which are \n     too many to list, are highlighted by his reform of the \n     Justice of the Peace System and Liquor Control Laws, his work \n     on Anti-Discrimination Laws and an Appropriation in 1961 to \n     begin the University of New Mexico School of Medicine; and\n       Whereas, on this, the Fortieth Anniversary of the Founding \n     of the School of Medicine, Fabian Chavez, Jr., is being \n     Honored with an Endowed Chair for Population Health Research \n     at the School; and\n       Whereas, the Members of the Senate of the State of New \n     Mexico, who are still privileged to receive Advice, Counsel \n     and Guidance from Fabian, almost all of it Unsolicited, \n     continue to consider Fabian as not just a Friend, but also as \n     a Trusted Colleague in Public Service; and\n       Whereas, the Senate takes Great Pride in being able to be \n     Associated with Fabian Chavez, Jr.: Now, therefore, be it \n     Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Mexico, That \n     Fabian Chavez, Jr., be Thanked for all his work on behalf of \n     the Residents of the State of New Mexico and that he be \n     Congratulated for the Latest Recognition he has \n     received.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4037-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4037-S4038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RETIREMENT OF BILL GEORGE AS CEO OF MEDTRONIC CORPORATION\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to praise Bill \nGeorge, a constituent who is a valued member of the Minnesota community \nand a good friend, on the occasion of his retirement as CEO of \nMedtronic Corporation.\n  The first comment I should make is that there is something very \nunique about Bill George and that uniqueness has translated into the \nway he has led Medtronic.\n  Medtronic is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, \nproviding lifelong solutions for people with chronic disease. Its \npreeminence is due in large part to the leadership of Bill George, its \nCEO since 1991. During his tenure, Bill George has transformed \nMedtronic into a company that employs 25,000 people in 120 countries, \nand has scientific, manufacturing, education, and sales facilities \nworldwide.\n  The company has extended its core technological competencies so that \nthey now make pacemakers and a whole host of devices for patients \nfacing cardiac arrest and heart failure. The company also makes devices \nfor patients dealing with spacticity associated with cerebral palsy, \ncancer and cancer pain, neurological disorders like Parkinsons, and \nwomen's health conditions like incontinence. Bill George's philosophy \nof excellence has led the company to seek those opportunities where it \ncan excel. The products it has produced and the relief it has brought \nto patients testify to the success of Bill's philosophy.\n  I am told that every three seconds, somewhere in the world, a \nMedtronic product is used to save or enhance someone's life.\n  Bill George doesn't just think about his company and its future. He \nhas a vision for the health care system in this country and has worked \nto align the company's goals with that vision. His vision of holistic, \npatient-centered care that is enabled by the technological leaps we are \nmaking today is reflected in the planning he has done for the future. \nBill instituted Vision 2010 to focus Medtronic on the nexus of the \nrapid developments happening in medical technology, computer \ntechnology, drug therapy and gene therapy in order to develop even \nbetter, more advanced treatments for chronic diseases in the next 10 \nyears.\n  During Bill's tenure, Medtronic has encouraged innovation by \nlaunching a ``Science and Technology Are Rewarding'' program, with $3 \nmillion in grants. Under Bill George's leadership, the Medtronic \nFoundation has reached out to patient groups in unprecedented ways, \ngiving $12 million in grants to non-profit organizations in communities \nworldwide last year. I want to\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nsingle out the Patient Summit that the Medtronic Foundation sponsored \nin Washington, D.C. last year. I had the honor of speaking at that \nmeeting, whose purpose was to encourage a dialogue between patients, \npolicymakers, and advocacy groups about the role patients can play in \ndirecting their own health care.\n  As a fellow Minnesotan, I've watched Bill's personal efforts in the \ncommunity with much admiration. His service as chair of the board of \nthe United Way of Minneapolis and vice chair of the board of the \nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, as well as his work on the boards of the \nAmerican Red Cross and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace \nshow Bill's dedication and breadth of interests.\n  Bill's lifestyle, his mission, and his vision are all reflected in \nthe recognition Medtronic regularly receives. Fortune Magazine \ndesignated Medtronic as one of the ``Best Companies to Work for in \nAmerica''. Industry Week's ranked it as one of the ``Best Managed \nCompanies.'' Money magazine chose Medtronic as one of the ``Best \nInvestments in 2000 and Beyond.'' Business Ethics recognized the \ncompany for its demonstrated leadership in ethics and social \nresponsibility with its ``General Excellence in Ethics'' award.\n  In his 10 years as CEO, Bill George has helped to expand Medtronic to \nan even higher plane as an organization that is dynamic, creative, and \npassionate about its mission of restoring people to full life and \nhealth.\n  As the Senior Senator from Minnesota, I thank him for his dedication \nto his work, for his service to his community--and I don't mean just \nMinneapolis or Minnesota, but the whole international community in \nwhich he is engaged, and for his friendship. I wish him well as he \ncontinues his active life which not only will include chairing \nMedtronic's board and involvement in community service, but also \nwriting and teaching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4038-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEVIN GRAY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

These high school students competed on \nthe State level for the opportunity to represent New Hampshire at the \nnational competition, and were among more than 1,200 students from 49 \nStates and the District of Columbia to participate.\n  The distinguished members of the team representing New Hampshire are: \nCatilin Allen, Jeremy Berger, Aaron Costa-Ganis, Mike Danner, Tiffany \nFariole, Chris Lawler, Jason Lewis, Sean Parenti, Keith Parker, Todd \nRounsaville, Sarah Rush, Dawn Staiti and Irene Direnko.\n  All 13 New Hampshire students were tested on the Constitution and \nBill of Rights before simulated congressional committees to demonstrate \ntheir knowledge of constitutional principles and their relevance to \ncontemporary issues. The competition in Washington consisted of 2 days \nof hearings; and 10 finalists, with the highest scores, competing for \nthe title of national winner on Capitol Hill in a congressional hearing \nroom.\n  David Alcox, a teacher at Milford High School and District \nCoordinator, also deserves special recognition for helping these \nstudents prepare for the intense constitutional testing. Kirsten Hale, \nthe State coordinator, also contributed a significant amount of time \nand effort to help the students reach the national finals. As a former \nteacher myself, I applaud all of them on their commitment to enriching \nthe lives of these students.\n  The ``We the People . . .

We are proud to have them representing New \nHampshire, and wish them luck as they prepare to be America's leader in \nthe 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4038-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GENE AND JIM BURDICK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Gene and Jim Burdick of Redfield, SD. The Burdick \nbrothers are being honored this week as the South Dakota Small Business \nPersons of the Year.\n  Gene and Jim understand what many business owners have learned. \nOwning a business requires some talents, some know how, and a lot of \nhard work and perseverance. Like many small business owners, their \nenterprise is a family effort for the brothers and their wives, Lucy \nand Deborah. I congratulate the families and the employees of this \ncompany on their years of achievement.\n  In 1984, the brothers embarked on a business partnership and founded \nBurdick Brothers, Inc. They built a business constructing trailers and \ncustom equipment for area farmers, businesses, and individuals. Through \nthe years, they cultivated a reputation as a company dedicated to \ninnovation and customer service.\n  In 1987, the company purchased its first building. Three years later, \ntheir successes were adding up and Burdicks were adding to the size of \ntheir building. In 1998, they moved into a second building with 12,000 \nsquare feet. This new facility allowed for additional equipment and \nspace that the company quickly utilized on a bridge project helping the \ncommunity of Redfield rebuild a needed facility following disastrous \nflooding in the region.\n  Burdick Brothers, Inc. has been a valued member of the Redfield \ncommunity for over 15 years. It is truly a South Dakota success story. \nI know that all those who contributed to the company's many \nachievements take great pride in the personal and collective \naccomplishments celebrated and recognized through this honor.\n  It is with great appreciation that I join with the community, the \nemployees, the customers, and the many people who interact with the \ncompany, to congratulate Burdick brothers on their years of service and \nsuccess.

It is given annually by the President of the \nUnited States to the service academy with the best\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nrecord in the three-team competition between Army, Navy and Air Force. \nI am proud to say this is the fourth year in a row the Air Force \nAcademy has captured the trophy and they have won 10 of the last 12 \nseasons.\n  The most important aspect of the 2000 Air Force Academy Football Team \nis each athlete on this team is a student first, and an athlete second. \nThey play the game of football not to become an NFL star one day, but \nbecause they love the game of football.\n  Their leader is a modest southern gentleman named Fisher DeBerry \nwhose life is driven not by football, but by his Christian faith and \nhis family. In his 17 seasons as head football coach at the Air Force \nAcademy he has guided his teams to an overall record of 135-72-1. He \nhas won more football games than any other coach in service academy \nhistory and has taken the ``fighting falcons'' to an amazing 11 bowl \ngames. In 1996, he served as president of the prestigious American \nFootball Coaches Association.\n  The 2000 Air Force Academy football team demonstrated that hard work \ncan overcome any obstacle. Despite being picked to finish in the lower \nhalf of their conference, they finished with an overall record of 9-3 \nand won a thrilling victory over Fresno State in the 2000 Silicon Bowl. \nTheir perseverance is an inspiration to all us.\n  I commend the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, General John \nDallager and the Director of Athletics, Colonel Randy Spetman, along \nwith all the coaches and players of the 2000 Air Force Academy football \nteam for a job well done.

The seeds of \nhis commitment and service were planted in childhood by his father and \nhis uncle, Ernest and William Heen, respectively, two patriarchs of \nsocial reform in plantation-era Hawaii. It was the Heens, along with \nJohnny Wilson and David Trask, Sr. Who formed the core of the early \nDemocratic Party in Hawaii.\n  Walter Heen's career as an elected official, state judge and U.S. \ndistrict court judge includes remarkable accomplishments and \nhistorically significant achievements. Elected to the Territorial House \nof Representatives in 1958, the year before Statehood, Judge Heen \nserved in the Hawaii legislature as a Representative until 1964 and was \nelected to the State Senate in 1966.\n  The ``Democratic Revolution of 1954'' was more than a headline or a \nslogan, is accurately conveyed the significant legislative agenda the \nnew majority was committed to enact to affect fundamental changes to \nimprove the social and economic character of the islands. Land reform, \nanti-trust, ``Green Belt'' land use, collective bargaining, and \nworkers' compensation were to become the battle zones that would change \nthe face of politics, legislation and the administration of justice \nacross Hawaii. Walter Heen was on the front lines of those struggles. \nHis cause, together with those whom he served, was to level the playing \nfield of social and economic opportunities for all, regardless of race, \nclass or religion.\n  Walter Heen served as a member of the Honolulu City Council from 1969 \nto 1972, including his selection as Council Chair in 1969-70. He left \nelective office in 1972 accepting an appointment to the State District \nCourt, and then State Circuit Court in 1974-78.\n  Judge Heen's star continued to rise with his appointment as U.S. \nAttorney, District of Hawaii for 1978-80, and as U.S. District Court \nJudge, District of Hawaii in 1981. He retired from a distinguished \njudicial career in 1994 after 12 years as Associate Judge of the State \nIntermediate Court of Appeals. During that period, Heen authored \nseveral opinions on important Hawaiian issues and had occasion to sit \nand add his voice to the deliberation of the State Supreme Court.\n  Always an active contributor to community affairs, Walter Heen was a \nfounding member of the renaissance Democratic Party revolution \nbeginning in 1950. It was a significant political movement that focused \non changing the traditional unequal and unfair distribution of \nopportunities available to Hawaii's minority communities. Judge Heen \ncarried this passion for leveling the playing field throughout his \ncareer of public service. More recently, Heen added his hand to \nexposing improper management and unethical practices at the Bishop \nEstate, a charitable trust charged with the responsibility of providing \nchildren of Hawaiian ancestry with educational opportunities and \nachievement. While controversial, his joint authorship of the milestone \npiece entitled ``Broken Trust'', successfully led to court ordered \nreviews of trust operations, and the ultimate improvement and \naccountability of the charitable trust.\n  Judge Heen's volunteer activities are broad and diverse, spreading \nacross Hawaii's community concerns. As early as 1962, Walter was \nsingled out as the Honolulu Junior Chamber of Commerce ``Outstanding \nYoung Man of the Year.'' Virtually at the same time, he was Chair of \nthe State Bar Association Ethics Committee 1961-63, President of the \nUniversity of Hawaii Alumni Association, and President of the Honolulu \nHawaiian Civic Club. As a member of its Founding Board of Directors, \nHeen launched the Big Brothers of Hawaii program that has made an \nenormous contribution to supporting and mentoring thousands of youth in \nHawaii.\n  Upon his retirement from the bench, Walter Heen has continued his \npublic service. He served as a Director of the Native Hawaiian Bar \nAssociation, Advisor to the Native Hawaiian Advisory Council, co-\ncounsel for Hawaiian water rights in the Waiahole Ditch dispute, member \nof the Public Access Shoreline Study Group, 1997-1998, and member of \nthe Governor's Economic Revitalization Task Force. Currently, Heen is \nthe acting Executive Director of the Office of Mauna Kea Management, \nlending a ``community voice'' and oversight to the maintenance and \ndevelopment of the University of Hawaii's astronomical facilities at \nMauna Kea's summit.\n  In 1996, Walter Heen was tapped to serve as the Chairman of the \nHawaii Democratic Party. It was a turbulent time for a political party \nthat has dominated Hawaii's political scene for more than 50 years. \nHeen led us forward in a hotly contested gubernatorial election in 1998 \nand then a\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nhost of targeted races in our State Legislature's lower house in 2000. \nResources were scarce, and some would say that so were our passions and \ndrive. Walter Heen has done a fine job under trying circumstances. He \nwas a team player and a leader. He was the point, and the man in the \nbackground.\n  I believe the greatest legacy Walter Heen leaves Hawaii's Democratic \nParty is a growing, committed group of young Democrats, impatient and \nanxious to make improvements and changes, to make Hawaii the best place \nto raise a family, excel in a career, and enjoy the most beautiful \nenvironment and lifestyle in the world. He has worked diligently to \nestablish and empower a new army of passionate young people to carry \nthe Democratic torch forward.\n  Judge Walter Heen, and his family leaders before him, have played a \npivotal role in helping to shape the Hawaii of today. It is leaders \nlike Heen who have helped to chart a collective course for Hawaii's \nfuture, one that has allowed our island to take full advantage of high \ntechnology, while not forsaking our spirit of aloha.\n  I rise today to commend my dear friend, Walter Meheula Heen, for his \nlifetime of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4040-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SUSAN MEIDINGER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the many \ncontributions and services of Susan Meidinger of Aberdeen, SD. Susan is \nbeing honored this week as South Dakota's Small Business Advocate of \nthe Year, an honor for which she is very deserving.\n  Susan is a valuable asset to her community. She is a member of the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the South Dakota \nSociety of CPAs and the Northeast Chapter of CPAs.\n  While raising three children, she took on the challenge of starting \nher own accounting firm. Through her commitment and dedication to her \nclients, the firm flourished. Susan measures her achievements not \nnecessarily in the success of her business, but moreover, by the \nmeasure of how she can help her fellow businesses and clients achieve \ntheir own personal successes. It is not surprising, therefore, that her \nservices are sought after.\n  Despite the demands of balancing the work of raising a family and \nowning a business, Susan is an active participant in her community. By \nregularly putting her skills and talents to work on behalf of local \norganizations, she strengthens local establishments and helps to \npromote growth and opportunity in the area.\n  Susan's work with the Small Business Development Center is an \nexcellent example of why she is being honored for her work on behalf of \nSmall Businesses. By volunteering her time and expertise, she helps \nentrepreneurs to achieve their aspirations and avoid cumbersome \npitfalls or missteps in their accounting practices. She offers advice, \ncounseling, and mentorship that enhances opportunities for business \ngrowth and job creation which has had a positive impact on many \nfamilies.\n  It is with great appreciation that I join with the community, the \nbusinesses, the customers, and those who know Susan Meidinger, to \ncongratulate Susan for being honored as a Small Business Advocate of \nthe Year. I wish Susan enduring good fortune and prosperity in the \ncontinued pursuit of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4040-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT O. ANDERSON\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Institute of the North \nrecently held a ceremony to honor Robert O. Anderson and his lifetime \nof achievements. I, too, would like to add my appreciation for his many \ncontributions to our Nation. Robert O. has earned renown as a petroleum \nexecutive, an environmentalist, a diplomat, a rancher, and a community \nleader. He began his career in the oil industry shortly after he \ngraduated from the University of Chicago in 1939. In 1941, he and his \nfamily moved to my home State of New Mexico after he acquired an \ninterest in a small oil refinery in Artesia. Within six months, he had \nmore than doubled the production of the refinery. Though his innovation \nand experimentation was greeted with skepticism by many within the \nindustry, Robert O. persevered and soon moved on to larger refineries, \neventually becoming Chairman and CEO of Arco, the Atlantic-Richfield \nCompany, all the while bringing robust economic development and \nhundreds of jobs to New Mexico.\n  At Arco, Robert O. was instrumental in bringing Alaska into the \ntwentieth century. In fact, Alaska's history is closely intertwined \nwith Arco and with Robert O. Anderson. Under his leadership, Arco \ndiscovered one of Alaska's greatest natural resources: the Prudhoe Bay \noil field. As Arco developed the Prudhoe Bay, Robert O. surprised the \nenvironmental community by working with them to ensure that the \npipeline was completed in an environmentally responsible manner. \nThroughout his career, Robert O. Anderson has brought economic \nprosperity to Alaska, while respecting and preserving its natural \ntreasures.\n  In fact, the United States owes Robert O. Anderson a special debt of \ngratitude in our current era of energy crises. The U.S. depends heavily \non the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which provides 25 percent of our domestic \noil supply. When Prudhoe Bay was first discovered, skeptics claimed \nthat the U.S. could do without its oil supply. They also claimed that \nthe local wildlife would be irreparably harmed. And now, three decades \nlater, the Prudhoe Bay area provides us with over 1.4 million barrels \nof oil a day. And virtually every study has concluded that not one of \nthe local species of wildlife has declined. Rather, every single \nspecies has thrived. Imagine the position the U.S. would be in if \nRobert O. had listened to these skeptics. Everyone agrees that we are \ntoo dependent on foreign sources of energy, but imagine how dependent \nwe would be if it were not for Robert O. Anderson.\n  In addition to oil, Robert O. Anderson's other business interests \nhave included cattle ranching, mining and milling, and general \nmanufacturing. He has served on the board of directors of the National \nPetroleum Council since 1951 and has received numerous honors and \ntitles recognizing his extensive charitable and community work. He has \nalso served on the Board of Regents of the New Mexico Institute of \nMining and Technology and currently serves on the National Advisory \nBoard of the University of New Mexico Anderson Schools of Management, \ntwo fine institutions in my home state. Robert O. Anderson also founded \nthe International Institute for Environmental Development to further \nhis lifelong passion of preserving and protecting the environment.\n  Once again I thank Robert O. Anderson for his years of service to our \nState of New Mexico and to our Nation. He has a true American story. \nHis hard work and determination have produced a proud legacy of \naccomplishments and public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4040-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4040-S4041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE POSTAL EMPLOYEES OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PERFORMANCE CLUSTER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the Postal Employees of the New Hampshire Performance Cluster, a \ngroup of dedicated public servants who have been recognized for \nexemplary performance of service duties. On April 3rd of this year, The \nPostal Employees of the New Hampshire Performance Cluster were \nrecognized with the Postal Service's highest award, the Chief Operating \nOfficer Award for overall excellence in the area of customer \nsatisfaction.\n  I was proud to have attended the awards ceremony in New Hampshire \nlast weekend, and was inspired by the dedication and commitment of the \naward recipients.\n  New Hampshire Postal Employees have been honored along with four \nother districts in the nation receiving the Order of the Yellow Jersey \nAward for Excellence in customer service. This prestigious award is \nbased on the percentage of residential customers who rated the postal \nservice employees as excellent in four areas: overall performance, \ncourteous and friendly clerks, consistency of mail delivery and \naccuracy of mail delivery.\n  The Postal Employees of the New Hampshire Performance Cluster have \nprovided dedicated service to the citizens of our state.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the Electoral \n     College; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 651\n\n       Whereas, the remarkable events of the presidential election \n     of 2000 summon all Virginians, of whatever political party or \n     persuasion, to a renewed reflection on the principles of \n     republican government and its ability to extend political \n     liberty to a diverse and complex society; and\n       Whereas, the United States consists of one democratic \n     people whose passion for political liberty is best preserved \n     through republican and federal forms of government--including \n     the election of the President; and\n       Whereas, the democratic interest is exercised through the \n     ballot and the federal structure of our government is \n     represented by the Electoral College; and\n       Whereas, the genius of the Electoral College was admirably \n     defined by Virginia's James Madison in the Federalist, number \n     39:\n       ``The executive power will be derived from a very compound \n     source. The immediate election of the President is to be made \n     by the States in their political characters. The votes \n     allotted to them are in a compound ratio, which considers \n     them partly as distinct and coequal societies, partly as \n     unequal members of the same society.''; and\n       Whereas, the dynamics of the Electoral College reflect the \n     diversity of the nation and the healthy tension between the \n     less populous vast regions of the United States and the urban \n     centers embracing denser concentrations of its populations; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Electoral College and the federal structure of \n     government ensure a balance of power among the states and \n     between the states and the federal government; and\n       Whereas, this complex and finely balanced structure serves \n     to protect the nation's republican form of government and \n     permits its citizens to enjoy an unequalled degree of \n     democratic liberty; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the General Assembly of Virginia express its commitment \n     to the principles represented by the Electoral College, for \n     its embodiment of the well-balanced framework of this \n     nation's state and federal governments, and for its role in \n     assuring the presentation of the liberty enjoyed by all \n     citizens; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation, in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this \n     matter; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk transmit copies of this \n     resolution to the legislatures of the other states that they \n     may be informed of this action by the General Assembly and \n     requested to adopt a similar resolve; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for \n     circulation to the teachers of history and government in the\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\n     Commonwealth's schools so that Virginia's students may be \n     acquainted with the principles of this nation's republican \n     and federal form of government and the role of this \n     Commonwealth's leaders in the framing of the Electoral \n     College and this nation's well-designed system of ordered \n     liberty.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-30.

Warner and Senator Charles S. Robb, signed \n     letters of support for this legislation in 2000; and\n       Whereas, the bill now before the 107th Congress modernizes \n     the Railroad Retirement System for its 748,000 beneficiaries \n     nationwide, including over 21,500 in Virginia; and\n       Whereas, railroad management, labor and retiree \n     organizations have agreed to support this legislation; and\n       Whereas, this legislation provides tax relief to freight \n     railroads, Amtrak and commuter lines; and\n       Whereas, this legislation provides benefit improvements for \n     surviving spouses of rail workers who currently suffer deep \n     cuts in income when the rail retiree dies; and\n       Whereas, no outside contributions from taxpayers are needed \n     to implement the changes called for in this legislation; and\n       Whereas, all changes will be paid for from within the \n     railroad industry, including a full share by active \n     employees; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, That the Congress of \n     the United States be urged to support the Railroad Retirement \n     and Survivors' Improvement Act in the 107th Congress; and be \n     it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution for presentation to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     and the members of the Virginia Congressional Delegation in \n     order that they may be apprised of the sense of the Virginia \n     House of Delegates in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-31. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to sports wagering; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Assembly Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Illegal gambling on college sports has been \n     identified as a serious national problem, particularly \n     illegal gambling by college students and other underage \n     persons; and\n       Whereas, According to the National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association, there are student bookmakers on virtually every \n     college campus in the United States; and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada, pursuant to an express \n     provision of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection \n     Act enacted by Congress in 1992, has licensed and regulated a \n     sports wagering industry and has enacted controls that serve \n     to assist its sports books in maintaining honest operations; \n     and\n       Whereas, The sports books in this state have demonstrated \n     their effectiveness in providing a defense against illegal \n     gambling on college sports through the identification of \n     suspicious wagering activities and the discovery of point-\n     shaving schemes in college sports; and\n       Whereas, Without the vigilance of the sports books in this \n     state and their notification of law enforcement authorities, \n     certain point-shaving scandals in college sports might not \n     have been uncovered and certainly would not have been \n     discovered so quickly; and\n       Whereas, The sports books in this state operate under the \n     strictest regulatory controls in the United States, including \n     the most demanding reporting requirements for transactions \n     and suspicious activities and computerized bookmaking systems \n     that document every wager received, every win paid out, the \n     results of each sporting event and every change in odds; and\n       Whereas, Legal wagers with the sports books regulated by \n     this state, which amount to approximately $2.5 billion each \n     year, are dwarfed by the amount of illegal sports wagers in \n     this country, which are estimated by some sources to exceed \n     $350 billion each year; and\n       Whereas, There have been no reports of student bookmakers \n     on any college campus in this state contributing to the flood \n     of illegal sports wagers; and\n       Whereas, There have been efforts in Congress that seek to \n     take away from the State of Nevada the constitutionally \n     derived authority recognized by the Professional and Amateur \n     Sports Protection Act with respect to wagering on college \n     sports conducted within the State of Nevada; and\n       Whereas, The repeal of that exemption would have an adverse \n     effect on the economy of this state and the jobs of a number \n     of its residents, would deprive this country of a vital \n     defense against illegal sports wagering and would lead to an \n     increase in illegal sports wagering; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress to \n     refrain from enacting any measure that would repeal the \n     ability of the State of Nevada to license and regulate sports \n     wagering in its current form, thereby inflicting damage upon \n     both the State of Nevada and the national fight against \n     illegal gambling; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress \n     to enact the National Collegiate and Amateur Athletic \n     Protection Act of 2001, sponsored by United States Senators \n     John Ensign and Harry Reid and United States Representatives \n     James Gibbons and Shelley Berkley and others, thereby \n     enhancing the ability of the nation to identify and address \n     illegal wagering on college sports; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-32. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Mississippi relative to the \n     Federal Unified Gift and Estate Tax; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Unified Gift and Estate Tax generates \n     a minimal amount of federal revenue, especially considering \n     the high cost of collection and compliance and, in fact, has \n     been shown to decrease those federal revenues from what they \n     might otherwise have been; and\n       Whereas, this ``Death Tax'' has been identified as \n     destructive to job opportunity and expansion, especially to \n     family farmers; and\n       Whereas, this ``Death Tax'' causes severe hardship to \n     growing family businesses and family farming operations, \n     often to the point of partial or complete forced liquidation, \n     thereby depriving state and local governments of an important \n     ongoing source of revenue; and\n       Whereas, critical state and local leadership assets are \n     unnecessarily destroyed and forever lost to the future \n     detriment of the community through relocation or liquidation; \n     and\n       Whereas, local and state schools, churches and numerous \n     other charitable activities would greatly benefit from the \n     increased employment and continued family business \n     leadership: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Mississippi, That we \n     do hereby request that the Congress of the United States \n     repeal the Federal Unified Gift and Estate tax effective \n     immediately; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit \n     certified copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the President of the United States \n     Senate, to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States \n     and to each member of the Mississippi delegation of the \n     United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-33. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Kansas relative to Gulf War \n     illness; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 1824\n\n       Whereas, Nearly 700,000 members of the United States armed \n     forces, including 7,500 Kansans, deployed to the Persian Gulf \n     region during 1990 and 1991 to participate in Operation \n     Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait; \n     and\n       Whereas, These Gulf War veterans have been, and continue to \n     be, afflicted by an abnormally high rate of unexplained \n     health problems. To date federal research efforts have not \n     identified the prevalence, patterns, causes or treatments for \n     illnesses suffered by Gulf War veterans. Yet thousands of our \n     veterans continue to suffer from a variety of chronic \n     symptoms, and\n       Whereas, The Kansas Persian Gulf War Veterans Health \n     Initiative, a project of the Kansas Commission on Veterans \n     Affairs, primarily through the efforts of Dr. Lea Steele, has \n     completed a scientific study of 2,000 Kansas Gulf War \n     veterans with the results being published in the American \n     Journal of Epidemiology. The findings of this study indicate \n     that: Kansas Gulf War veterans have significantly more health \n     problems than veterans who served in other areas and that \n     these conditions may have been caused by multiple factors; \n     and\n       Whereas, While it has been established that Gulf War \n     veterans suffer from an abnormally high rate of unexplained \n     health problems, the cause or causes of these varied \n     conditions have not been determined, and the system for \n     providing care and treatment of these veterans has been \n     inadequate or nonresponsive to the conditions presented; and\n       Whereas, Gulf War illness has had a severe negative impact \n     on the physical and emotional well-being of Gulf War \n     veterans, and has affected their ability to work, yet \n     adequate compensation for these conditions has not been \n     received by these veterans; and\n       Whereas, Service connected illnesses have not been \n     addressed adequately for veterans of past wars and conflicts: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of Kansas: That we \n     memorialize the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to provide funding for Gulf War illness research\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\n     independent of that administered by the United States \n     Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs: and to establish \n     a process of independent review of federal policies and \n     programs associated with Gulf War illness research, benefits, \n     and health care; and\n       Be it further resolved: That we urge further assistance to \n     veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness, whether by the \n     Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs or \n     another designated organization, to provide badly needed \n     health care, vocational assistance and disability \n     compensation; and that there be public service announcements \n     informing veterans across the nation of the findings of this \n     research and informing the veterans of the programs that are \n     available to help them; and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Secretary of the Senate be directed to \n     provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President \n     of the United States, the Vice-President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, and to each member of the Kansas \n     Congressional delegation; to the Governor of the State of \n     Kansas, the Secretary of Health and Environment, the \n     Secretary of Human Resources, and the Chairman of the Kansas \n     Commission on Veterans Affairs; and to the National and State \n     Commanders of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars and the Disabled American Veterans, National Retired \n     Officers Association, National Retired Enlisted Association \n     and the National Order of the Purple Heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4044-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCONNELL, from the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration:\n       Report to accompany S.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall business employers certain credits against income tax, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001, that I \nbelieve will add some needed POP to our economy and that must be an \nintegral component of any strategy to extend our historic economic \ngrowth.\n  The primary goal of the Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act \nis to protect, stimulate and expand economic growth. Government's role \nis not to create jobs but to help create the environment in which the \nprivate sector will create jobs. This legislation helps to create the \nright context for private sector growth by providing incentives for \ninvestment in training, technology, and small entrepreneurial firms. \nThese investments are critical to economic growth and the creation of \njobs and wealth.\n  The Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001 is a tax \npackage with a purpose. And that purpose is, above all else, to \nstimulate private sector economic growth, to raise the tide that lifts \nthe lot of all Americans. In the spirit of the ``New Economy,'' where \nthe fundamentals of our economy have changed through entrepreneurship \nand innovation, this package includes business tax incentives that will \nspur the real drivers of growth: innovation, investment, a skilled \nworkforce, and productivity.\n  The first component of this bill is a 30 percent tax credit for \ncompanies that invest in remedial education for their employees. Many \ncompanies today recognize that a skilled workforce is critical to \nsuccess and they are eager to invest continuously in their employees. \nHowever, too often those companies seeking to upgrade worker skills are \nhaving to first make sizeable investments to simply make up for the \nskill deficits produced by the K-12 education system. For example, in \nmy home state of Connecticut, I am aware of one small manufacturer with \n25 employees that will train 20 of them in English as a Second Language \nat a cost of up to $15,000. That is a significant investment and \ncommitment by that company. Because too many workers did not learn the \nbasic math, reading, and language skills in school, companies have to \nfix these deficiencies first, before they can train their workers on \nmore advanced skills. This credit will help to offset those \ninvestments.\n  The bill's second component is a Small Business Digital Divide Tax \nCredit. It would create a 10 percent tax credit for small businesses, \nthose with fewer than 100 employees, to encourage investment in \ninformation technology, for example servers, network hardware, initial \nbroadband hookup, PCs, and e-Business software. This credit is critical \nfor two reasons. First, because there is truly a small business digital \ndivide in this country. Small firms are lagging in the productivity \ngrowth that has driven the economic boom of the late 90s. While small \nbusinesses account for 40 percent of our economy and 60 percent of the \nnew jobs, less than one-third of them are wired to the Internet today. \nThose that are wired have grown 46 percent faster than their \ncounterparts who are unplugged. A recent study by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, NAM, shows that those small manufacturers \nsurveyed averaged only about 2 percent of their sales over internet and \nless than 1 percent were in the advanced stages of e-commerce. Without \nexpanding productivity improvements to small businesses, we cannot hope \nto sustain the\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\neconomic growth of the last several years.\n  The second reason this credit is so important, is that it provides an \nimmediate stimulus to our slowing economy. We know today that there has \nbeen a sharp downturn in technology-related capital spending that has \nhelped power our economic growth. For example, Cisco Systems, whose \nproducts provide the foundation for our digital environment, estimates \nthat its sales for the current quarter would be about 30 percent lower \nthan the previous quarter and that they would fall again next quarter. \nBy some projections, PC sales in this country this year will slow \ndramatically to virtually zero growth. In order to spur near term \ninvestment and provide an economic stimulus, this credit would be \navailable immediately after enactment and through the end of 2002.\n  This bill's third component recognizes that entrepreneurship drives \ngrowth and that small, emerging companies need capital investment to \ninnovate, create jobs, and create wealth. According to the National \nCommission on Entrepreneurship, a small subset of entrepreneurial firms \nthat comprise only 5-15 percent of all U.S. businesses created about \ntwo-thirds of new jobs between 1993-96. Although venture capital is \ncritical to the transition from a fledgling company to a growth \ncompany, only a small share of it is associated with small and new \nfirms. In addition, we are currently experiencing a venture capital \nslow down that makes it even more difficult for small and new firms to \nattract capital. According to the National Venture Capital Association \n(NCVA), investment in the fourth quarter of last year slowed by more \nthan 30 percent from the previous quarter.\n  For these reasons, the bill creates a zero capital gains rate for \nnew, direct, long term investments by individuals and corporations in \nthe stock of small businesses, those emerging, entrepreneurial \ncompanies that are core to our economic growth. Specifically, this \nlegislation excludes from capital gains taxes 100 percent of new, long-\nterm investments in these capital-intensive small businesses. It also \nchanges the eligibility definition of a small business from $50 million \nin capitalization to $300 million while reducing the holding period for \ninvestments from 5 to 3 years. In addition, it also eliminates \nincentive stock options from the calculation of the Alternative Minimum \nTax to help high tech employers recruit and retain the skilled \nprofessionals that are critical to competitiveness in a knowledge \neconomy.\n  Finally, the bill's fourth component reduces the tax depreciation \nperiod for semiconductor manufacturing equipment from five years to \nthree years, which more closely reflects the actual life of the \nequipment. I believe this component is essential because we know that \nadvances in semiconductor technology improve productivity throughout \nthe economy. The pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry is \namong the fastest of any U.S. or global industry. Following Moore's \nLaw, the semiconductor industry has been quadrupling the number of \ntransistors on a chip every three years and studies show that chip \nmanufacturing equipment quickly becomes obsolete as these new \ngenerations of chips are introduced. Semiconductor companies spend a \ngreater percentage of their sales on R and capital equipment than any \nother industry. Last year, the U.S. semiconductor industry spent 18 \npercent of its sales on capital investment and 14 percent on R More \nthan 30 percent of this sector's revenue are invested in the future and \nbuilding the New Economy. To promote economic strength, we can no \nlonger afford to penalize the semiconductor manufacturing equipment \nindustry with tax law that requires a five year cost recovery.\n  Ten years from now we will be judged by the economic policy decisions \nwe make today. People will ask, did we fully understand the awesome \nchanges taking place in our economy and in our society? Did we give our \nindustry and workers the environment and the tools they need to seize \nthe opportunities an innovation economy offers? I believe that a true \nProsperity Agenda is within our grasp. Never before has America been in \na stronger position--economically, socially, or politically--to shape \nour future. But it will take strong and focused leadership. I am \nconfident that if we in the public sector in Washington work in \npartnership with the private sector throughout our country, we can \ntruly say of America's future that the best is yet to come. I believe \nthat the Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001 is an \nimportant step toward that future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 799. A bill to prohibit the use of racial and other discriminatory \nprofiling in connection with searches and detentions of individuals by \nthe United States Customs Service personnel, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Reasonable \nSearch Standards Act. This Act prohibits racial or other discriminatory \nprofiling by Customs Service personnel. I am please that Senator \nVoinovich is an original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation.\n  Last year, I released a study, conducted by GAO at my request, of the \nU.S. Customs Service's procedures for conducting inspections of airport \npassengers. The need for this study grew out of an investigative report \nby Renee Ferguson of WMAQ-TV in Chicago and several complaints from \nAfrican-American women in my home state of Illinois who were strip-\nsearched at O'Hare Airport for suspicion of carrying drugs. No drugs \nwere found and the women felt that they had been singled out for these \nhighly intrusive searches because of their race. These women, \napproximately 100 of them, have filed a class action law suit in \nChicago.\n  The purpose of the GAO study was to review Customs' policies and \nprocedures for conducting personal searches of airport passengers and \nto determine the internal controls in place to ensure that airline \npassengers are not inappropriately targeted or subjected to personal \nsearches. Approximately 140 million passengers entered the United \nStates on international flights during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. \nBecause there is no data available on the gender, race and citizenship \nof this traveling population, GAO was not able to determine whether \nspecific groups of passengers are disproportionately selected to be \nsearched. However, once passengers are selected for searches, GAO was \nable to evaluate the likelihood that people with various race and \ngender characteristics would be subjected to searches that are more \npersonally intrusive, such as strip-searches and x-rays, rather than \nsimply being frisked or patted down.\n  The GAO study revealed some very troubling patterns in the searches \nconducted by U.S. Customs Service inspectors. GAO found disturbing \ndisparities in the likelihood that passengers from certain population \ngroups, having been selected for some form of search, would be \nsubjected to the more intrusive searches, including strip-searches and \nx-ray searches. Moreover, that increased likelihood of being \nintrusively searched did not always correspond to an increased \nlikelihood of actual carrying contraband.\n  Because of the intrusive nature of strip-searches and x-ray searches, \nit is important that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias \nin forcing passengers to undergo these searches. GAO found that \nAfrican-American women were much more likely to be strip-searched than \nmost other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not \njustified by the rate at which these women were found to be carrying \ncontraband.\n  Certain other groups also experienced a greater likelihood of being \nstrip-searched relative to their likelihood of being found carrying \ncontraband. Specifically, African-American women were nearly 3 times as \nlikely as African-American men to be strip-searched, even though they \nwere only half as likely to be found carrying contraband. Hispanic-\nAmerican and Asian-American women were also nearly 3 times as likely as \nHispanic-American and Asian-American men to be strip-searched, even \nthough they were 20 percent less likely to be found carrying \ncontraband. In addition, African-American women were 73 percent more \nlikely than White-American women to be strip-searched in 1998 and \nnearly 3 times as likely to be strip-searched in\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\n1997, despite only a 42 percent higher likelihood of being found \ncarrying contraband. Moreover, among non-citizens, White men and women \nwere more likely to be strip-searched than Black and Hispanic men and \nwomen, despite lower rates of being found carrying contraband.\n  As with strip-searches, x-rays are personally intrusive and it is of \nparticular concern that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory \nbias in requiring x-ray searches of passengers suspected of carrying \ncontraband. GAO found that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans \nwere much more likely to be x-rayed than other passengers. This \ndisproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these \npassengers were found to be carrying contraband. Specifically, GAO \nfound that African-American women were nearly 9 times as likely as \nWhite-American women to be x-rayed even though they were half as likely \nto be carrying contraband. African-American men were nearly 9 times as \nlikely as White-American men to be x-rayed, even though they were no \nmore likely than White-American men to be carrying contraband. \nMoreover, Hispanic-American women and men were nearly 4 times as likely \nas White-American women and men to be x-rayed, even though they were \nonly a little more than half as likely to be carrying contraband. And \namong non-citizens, Black women and men were more than 4 times as \nlikely as White women and men to be x-rayed, even though Black women \nwere only half as likely and Black men were no more likely to be found \ncarrying contraband.\n  For these reasons, we are reintroducing the Reasonable Search \nStandards Act. This bill is a direct response to the concerns raised by \nthe GAO report. The bill prohibits Customs Service personnel from \nselecting passengers for searches based in whole or in part on the \npassenger's actual or perceived race, religion, gender, national \norigin, or sexual orientation. To ensure that a sound reason exists for \nselecting someone to be searched, the bill requires Customs Service \npersonnel to document the reasons for searching a passenger before the \npassenger is searched. The only exception to this requirement is when \nthe Customs official suspects that the passenger is carrying a weapon.\n  The bill also requires all Customs Service personnel to undergo \nperiodic training on the procedures for searching passengers, with a \nparticular emphasis on the prohibition of profiling. The training shall \ninclude a review of the reasons given for searches, the results of the \nsearches and the effectiveness of the criteria used by Customs to \nselect passengers for searches. Finally, the bill calls for an annual \nstudy and report on detentions and searches of individuals by Customs \nService personnel. The report shall include the number of searches \nconducted by Customs Service personnel, the race and gender of \ntravelers subjected to the searches, the type of searches conducted--\nincluding pat down searches and intrusive non-routine searches--and the \nresults of these searches.\n  Since the release of the GAO report, the Customs Service has assured \nme that improvements have been made to ``. . . better gather and \nanalyze data, and to improve search procedures and results.'' These \nchanges, along with better training of Customs Service personnel, will \nnot only prevent unfair profiling practices, but will actually improve \nthe effectiveness of operations at Customs. I commend former \nCommissioner Kelly for his quick response to the concerns raised by the \nGAO study and for implementing changes to the Customs Service's \npersonal search policies.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that such \nprogress continues, and is reported to Congress on a periodic basis. \nThe Reasonable Search Standards Act will make the task at Customs \neasier by ensuring that a key federal service--one where profiling \npractices have already been demonstrated--remains focused on improving \nits personal search procedures and eliminating any practices that bear \neven the slightest resemblance to racial profiling.\n  President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have both said that \nending racial profiling will be a high priority for this \nAdministration. We applaud their commitment to this important issue. We \nhave written a letter to President Bush, co-signed by Representatives \nLewis and Houghton, to commend the President's attention to racial \nprofiling, and to urge him to support the Reasonable Search Standards \nAct. Similar letters have been sent to Attorney General Ashcroft and to \nTreasury Secretary O'Neill. This is not a black, or brown, or white \nissue. It is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Racial profiling \nis an affront to all Americans. Allowing it to continue would diminish \ndemocracy for all Americans.\n  Martin Luther King had a dream that the United States would become a \nnation where children would not be judged by the color of their skin \nbut by the content of their character. We still have a long road to \ntravel to make Dr. King's dream a full reality for all people. The \nReasonable Search Standards Act is one step along that road. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to President Bush be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2001.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We are writing to commend you and \n     Attorney General Ashcroft for the priority your \n     administration has given to the issue of racial profiling, \n     and to seek your assistance regarding ongoing efforts to \n     address this issue in the U.S. Customs Service. The insidious \n     practice of racial profiling undermines public confidence in \n     law enforcement and damages the credibility of police forces \n     around the country, even though the vast majority of police \n     are carrying out their duties responsibly and professionally. \n     Most importantly, racial profiling creates an atmosphere of \n     distrust and alienation that isolates broad segments of the \n     American population.\n       As you know, this issue affects federal, as well as state \n     and local law enforcement activities. In fact, a GAO study of \n     profiling practices of airline passengers concluded that the \n     U.S. Customs Service was intrusively searching African-\n     American women and other minorities for contraband at much \n     higher rates than they searched other segments of the \n     population. Ironically, the women being targeted were \n     statistically less likely than other passengers to be found \n     carrying contraband.\n       Commissioner Kelly quickly responded to the concerns raised \n     by the GAO study by implementing significant changes to the \n     Customs Service's personal search policies and data \n     collection activities. The Customs Service is to be commended \n     for its responsiveness that, we hope, will eventually \n     eliminate the practice or appearance of discrimination. Your \n     continued attention to this issue will insure that the rapid \n     pace of progress that the Customs Service has already made on \n     the issue of racial profiling will continue unabated. To that \n     end, we ask, first, that you quickly nominate someone who \n     shares your commitment to the issue of racial profiling to \n     the position of Commissioner of Customs.\n       We also introduced Customs search legislation to \n     specifically address the issue by codifying some of the \n     changes already made by the Customs Service, and adding a \n     modest reporting requirement. The legislation would prohibit \n     the use of race, gender or other inappropriate criteria as \n     the basis for Customs Service selection of people for \n     searches or detention, and require Customs to improve its \n     record-keeping and analysis, institute periodic training, and \n     report annually to Congress. There is every indication that \n     these types of measures will help the Customs Service make \n     more effective use of its resources, and avoid unwarranted \n     searches.\n       We are reintroducing these companion bills to address \n     profiling in the Customs Service and hope that you will work \n     with Congress to insure their passage as part of your effort \n     to bring an end to the inexcusable practice of racial \n     profiling.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard J. Durbin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     George V. Voinovich,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John Lewis,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Amo Houghton,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 800. A bill to provide for post conviction DNA testing, to \nestablish a competent counsel grant program, and other purpose; to the \nCommittee on Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Criminal \nJustice Integrity and Innocence Protection Act of 2001.\n  It is my hope that this bill will jump-start the process of ensuring \nthat every innocent prisoner in this nation has access to DNA testing \nthat could set\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nthem free, and that every criminal defendant has access to truly \ncompetent counsel.\n  This is not the first bill to be introduced on this issue.\n  My good friend from Vermont and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, has twice introduced his Innocence Protection \nAct, with an impressive and bipartisan group of supporters behind the \nbill. I commend him for his work on this issue, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him to see a bill pass.\n  But I have had some concerns with certain provisions of the Leahy \nbill, concerns that make it impossible for me to support the bill as \ncurrently drafted.\n  Also last year, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, addressed the DNA issue in a bill of his own. However, that bill \ndid not include provisions on competent counsel, something that I very \nstrongly feel should be included.\n  So the real aim of my effort is to start moving this process forward. \nIt has been well over a year since these bills were first discussed, \nand no real action has taken place. There are differences of opinion on \nhow to move forward on this issue, and I fully understand how committed \neach side is to their position.\n  But I believe that these differences of opinion will continue to \nprevent the Senate from considering this issue for the foreseeable \nfuture, unless something is done to break the stalemate.\n  In the hopes of doing just that, breaking the stalemate, last year, I \ninvited both Senator hatch and Senator Leahy together, to try to \nresolve the differences between their two approaches. We had a \nconstructive meeting, and some progress was made.\n  Since that time, each of us has gone back and forth with suggestions \nand criticisms of various ideas, and our staffs have been working \ndiligently on trying to craft a solution to the impasse.\n  Nevertheless, time continues to run without action.\n  So today, I am introducing what I believe is a good compromise on \nthis issue, a piece of legislation, based on our discussions, that I \nhope will spur debate, and provide a major step forward on this issue.\n  Essentially, the legislation I am introducing today does two things.\n  First, the bill provides a procedure by which prisoners who might be \nable to prove their innocence with the use of new DNA technology can do \nso.\n  The bill contains safeguards, of course, so that frivolous requests \nwill be minimized.\n  For instance, prisoners have to demonstrate that biological evidence \ndoes exist that could possibly prove them innocent, and they must show \nthat DNA testing was unavailable to them at the time of trial.\n  But overall, the bill will allow for the testing of inmates where \nevidence could lead to their exoneration.\n  If DNA testing proves innocence, the judge can release the prisoner \nimmediately or, if there are other crimes of which the defendant may \nhave been guilty, the judge can determine the best way to proceed in \nthe case.\n  Second, the bill also addresses the issue of competent counsel, \nthrough the establishment of independent, national standards for legal \nrepresentation in capital cases.\n  Specifically, this legislation directs the State Justice Institute to \nstudy this issue and to develop standards for competent counsel in \ncapital cases.\n  The bill then authorizes grants to states that agree to adopt those \nstandards.\n  The State Justice Institute has long served as a neutral facilitator \nbetween the state and federal judicial systems, and the bill would \nallow them to work with judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys \nalike to develop a model system for standards in these cases.\n  The combination of these two parts of the bill, competent counsel \nstandards and DNA testing, will serve as powerful tools in restoring \nthe public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system.\n  I support the death penalty, and I have for a long time. And I have \nspent much of my public career trying to ensure that guilty people face \nthe consequences of their actions.\n  But we must protect the innocent from a system of justice that can \nmake mistakes. That is what this bill is all about, and that is why I \nhope we can move quickly to debate this issue fairly, with all opinions \non the table, and move forward towards passage of a reasoned, strong \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Hatch, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 801. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe limitation on the use of foreign tax credits under the alternative \nminimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am joining with four of my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee, Senators Conrad, Murkowski, Hatch \nand Breaux, to introduce a bill that will eliminate an aspect of our \ntax laws that is fundamentally unfair to taxpayers with income from \nforeign sources.\n  Under our system of taxation, United States citizens and domestic \ncorporations are subject to tax on income they earn from sources \noutside the United States. In all likelihood, foreign-source income \nwill also be subject to tax by the country where it was earned. Absent \nan Internal Revenue Code measure providing for other treatment, the \nsame income could be taxed twice, by two different countries. The tax \ncode does have a provision to address this problem of double taxation: \nthe foreign tax credit. This credit allows taxpayers to offset \notherwise payable U.S. taxes with foreign taxes paid on the same \nforeign-source income. Like the other provisions governing \ninternational taxation, the details of the foreign tax credit are \ncomplex. The basic principle underlying the credit, however, is simple: \nrelief from double taxation.\n  The alternative minimum tax, AMT, requires taxpayers to compute their \ntaxes twice, once under the ``regular'' method, and once using the AMT \ncalculation. As a rule, taxpayers pay the larger of these two \ncomputations. When taxpayers become subject to the AMT, th protection \nagainst double taxation is undermined. In the ``regular'' tax \ncomputation, foreign tax credits protect against double taxation. This \nprotection is only partial under AMT rules, however, where the \nallowable foreign tax credit is limited to 90 percent of a taxpayer's \nAMT liability. This limitation means that income subject to foreign tax \nis also subject to U.S. tax.\n  There is no sound policy reason for denying relief from double \ntaxation under the AMT. When first enacted, the AMT was designed to \nensure that taxpayers claiming various tax ``preferences'' allowed by \nthe Internal Revenue Code should pay a minimum amount of tax. The \nforeign tax credit is not a ``preference'' serving an incentive for a \nparticular activity or behavior. Rather, it merely reflects the \nfundamental principle that income should not be subject to multiple \ntaxation. The 90 percent limitation was enacted as part of the 1986 tax \nreform bill, solely for the purpose of raising revenue. The bill that \nwe're introducing today will eliminate the AMT's 90 percent limitation \non foreign tax credits. Elimination of this limitation will mean that \ntaxpayers subject to the AMT will get the same protection against \ndouble taxation allowed to taxpayers subject to the regular tax.\n  Repeal of the limit on foreign tax credits is not a revolutionary \nidea. In fact, Congress repealed the limitation in the Taxpayer Refund \nand Relief Act of 1999, which was subsequently vetoed. Legislation \nsimilar to the bill I'm introducing today has also been introduced in \nthe House of Representatives. At this point in time, it is questionable \nwhether the AMT still serves a valid purpose. In fact, in a study \nreleased last week, the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that both \nthe corporate and individual AMT should be repealed. In any event, the \nAMT's treatment of foreign tax credits serves no valid purpose. The 90 \npercent limitation on foreign tax credits is probably the most unfair \naspect of the corporate AMT. Even those unwilling to support wholesale \nAMT repeal should support elimination of this most unfair aspect of the \nAMT. In the age of globalization, the AMT limitation on foreign tax \ncredits can put U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage with \ntheir foreign rivals. The time has come to repeal this unfair tax \nprovision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\n  S. 802. A bill to assist low income taxpayers in preparing and filing \ntheir tax returns and to protect taxpayers from unscrupulous refund \nanticipation loan providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Low Income \nTaxpayer Protection Act of 2001. This legislation, if enacted, will \nassist low and moderate income taxpayers with the annual task of \npreparing their tax returns and give them some protection from \nexploitive refund anticipation loans. RALs are high interest loans \noffered to taxpayers who are entitled to a refund. Recently, an article \nran in the Albuquerque Journal about taxpayer abuses that were \nparticularly acute near the Navajo Reservation in Gallup, New Mexico. \nWhile many taxpayers benefit from these loans, many more are hurt by \noutrageously high interest rates and fees. Worse, many taxpayers get \ncaught with outstanding loans that they can't pay off because a mistake \nwas made on their tax return resulting in a smaller than anticipated \nrefund. Many of these loans, when annualized, have interest rates over \n200 percent.\n  The majority of these loan recipients are low to moderate income \ntaxpayers, many of whom receive an earned income tax credit. The EITC \nhas become one of the most effective tools for fighting poverty and \nbenefitting working families, and so it is essential that every dollar \nof this credit goes to the taxpayer.\n  Congress is not without fault. We have made the EITC so complicated \nthat many taxpayers feel they have to pay to have someone prepare their \nreturn. According to the New Mexico Advocates for Children and \nFamilies, 83 percent of the low income population in Gallup used a paid \npreparer. Many of these taxpayers won't have the money to pay for this \nservice unless they are loaned the money up front, hence a \nproliferation of refund anticipation loans. Although this bill does not \ninclude simplification of the EITC, I am going to work with my \ncolleagues to be sure that any tax bill that is passed through this \nbody has made the EITC easier to calculate.\n  To help low and moderate income taxpayers, my bill requires all those \ninvolved with RALs to register with the IRS. Treasury will then be \nrequired to determine what is a fair amount of interest and fees to be \ncharged based on the benefit to the taxpayer and the risk to the \nlender. It will also expand the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program \nby directly giving them funding to operate. VITA clinics are one of the \nfew places low income taxpayers can go to get assistance on their tax \nreturns. We need to expand this program. My bill also directs the IRS \nto focus its electronic filing services on the taxpayer. I am afraid \nthat our desire to meet Congressional mandates for increasing \nelectronic filing rates may have caused the IRS to forget why we are \nadvancing electronic filing, to benefit the taxpayer.\n  Finally, this legislation will create several mobile electronic tax \nfiling centers, at least one of which must be located near a Native \nAmerican reservation or pueblo. Currently, many low income taxpayers do \nnot have the ability to file electronically unless they go to a \ncommercial electronic filer where there is a fee to file. This trial \nprogram would allow these taxpayers to enjoy the benefits of electronic \nfiling, such as a shorter turn around time for a refund, without having \nto find the money to pay for it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to expand this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, tomorrow President Bush will make a speech \non the subject of national missile defense. I want to comment briefly \nabout that.\n  A national missile defense sounds perfectly plausible to a good many \npeople. In fact, we have colleagues in this Chamber who believe very \nstrongly that we ought to begin deploying a national missile defense \nimmediately, despite the fact, of course, that we don't have a national \nmissile defense that works. The last time we did a test of the system \nwas last summer. In that test, we sent up a missile with a target \nwarhead. We knew what the target was, we knew where it was going to be, \nand we knew when it was going to be there. Despite that, we could not \nhit it with our interceptor.\n  These are very simple, rudimentary tests, and we have not been able \nto demonstrate through those tests that we have a national missile \ndefense system that works.\n  Some say: Well, but shouldn't we have a national missile defense \nsystem in the event that someone launches missiles at this country?\n  What they need to understand is that the national missile defense \nprogram that is being discussed by the administration, and that was \ndiscussed by past administrations, is not a national missile defense \nprogram that would safeguard this country against, for example, a \nnuclear missile attack by Russia or China. No. It is in fact a system \nthat is very narrow, which, if it worked, would provide a kind of \ncatcher's mitt against an attack by a rogue nation of one or two or \nthree or four missiles.\n  A rogue nation or a terrorist leader getting access to an ICBM, as \nimprobable as that might be, and wanting to launch that ICBM would \nconfront an American national missile defense program that would be \nable to go up and catch that missile as it came in and explode it. That \nis the theory. It has never been an approach that has been advertised \nto protect us against a more robust attack by just one submarine \nlaunching missiles from all of its tubes coming from Russia. It would \nnot defend us against that.\n\n  So people should understand what is being talked about here. Despite \nthe fact that we don't have a system that works, we have people saying \nwe ought to deploy it immediately. Deploy what? What kind of a system? \nThe last test failed. Ought not we have a system that is demonstrated \nto have worked before we talk about deploying it?\n  Second, there are other problems. In order to deploy a national \nmissile defense program--some call it Star Wars, and others have other \nnames for it--in order to deploy that with the time of deployment that \nis envisioned, we would have to violate the ABM Treaty.\n  That ABM Treaty has been the centerpiece of our arms reduction \nefforts. Our arms reduction efforts with the old Soviet Union and now \nRussia have been quite successful. We have far fewer nuclear weapons \nthan we used to--far too many, but far fewer than we used to have, and \nfewer delivery vehicles as well.\n  The centerpiece of those reductions in nuclear arms has been the ABM \nTreaty. Some say this treaty is obsolete, let's get rid of it. If we do \nthat, we will have, in my judgment, dealt a significant blow to the \nfuture of arms reductions.\n  If we get rid of the ABM Treaty, as President Bush suggests and as \nsome of my colleagues suggest, in my judgment, we will retreat back to \na situation where Russia and China and other countries will build more \noffensive weapons even as we try to build this limited national missile \ndefense system.\n  In addition to the issue of the ABM Treaty and the violation of that \ntreaty by building a national missile defense system, we also are \nencountering vigorous opposition from virtually all of our allies who \nare very concerned that if we build a new national missile defense \nprogram it will ignite a new arms race, especially with Russia and with \nthe Chinese. That is a very real and valid concern.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues and President Bush to try to \ndevelop a balanced view of all of this and understand that there are \nconsequences to all of it. We have a range of threats. Yes, let's deal \nwith that range of threats. I happen to support research and \ndevelopment for our national missile defense system. I do not support \ndeployment of a system we have not yet demonstrated to be workable. The \nthreat it is supposed to counter is one of the least likely threats \nthis country faces.\n  By far the most likely threat we face is for a terrorist or a rogue \nnation to get ahold of a suitcase-size nuclear bomb and put it in the \ntrunk of an old rusty Desoto car and park it on a dock somewhere in New \nYork or Chicago. That is by far a much more likely scenario of a \nterrorist act. Or instead of a suitcase bomb, perhaps someone will use \na deadly vial of chemical or biological agents that can kill millions \nof people. That is a much more likely scenario--a much more likely \nweapon of mass destruction to be used by a rogue nation or a terrorist \nstate.\n  We ought to deal with all of those issues. We ought to be concerned \nabout all of them.\n  As a country that is as free and open as this country, we need to be \nvery concerned about terrorism and about rogue nations. But we also \nneed to be concerned about continuing the effort to reduce the number \nof nuclear weapons. I mentioned that we have done some of that. I would \nlike to ask, by consent, to be able to show a couple of pieces that \nresulted from the efforts in the Senate.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program is the program that most people probably won't \nrecognize. It is a program to spend money funding certain activities \nthat reduce the threat to this country. One of those activities is to \ncut up Russian bombers.\n  This piece in my hand is from a wing strut on a Backfire bomber. This \nbomber used to fly around carrying nuclear weapons that would have \nthreatened this country. But now this is not a wing strut on a Russian \nbomber, it is a piece of metal that is in my desk here in the Senate. \nDo you know how I got this wing strut? No, we didn't shoot this bomber \ndown. The wing was sawed off this bomber as a result of arms control \nreductions--arms reductions that were negotiated between the United \nStates and the old Soviet Union, and which are continuing to be carried \non by us and the Russians. We saw the wings off bombers, we dismantle \nnuclear submarines, and we take missiles out of their silos, separate \nthem from their warheads. That way we reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons on their side and our side. It has happened, and it has worked. \nIt is the reason I am able to hold up a piece of a Russian bomber that \nwe didn't shoot down, but we paid money to destroy it.\n  This is ground-up copper from a Russian submarine. We didn't sink \nthat submarine. It was dismantled under terms of an arms control \nagreement with the Russians.\n  Does it make sense for us to continue agreements by which we reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons on both sides? You bet it does. Does it \nmake sense for us to say to the Russians: Look, the treaties under \nwhich we have reduced nuclear weapons are now no longer very important \nto us. We are going to violate the ABM Treaty. It doesn't matter what \nyou think of it, we are going to produce a national missile defense \nsystem that has not yet been demonstrated to work--at the risk of \nbacking away from the ABM Treaty, and having both Russia and China \nbuild more offensive weapons? That does not seem like much of a bargain \nto me.\n  I hope, as President Bush discusses these issues tomorrow, he will \nunderstand that the Nunn-Lugar Program and the arms control agreements \nthat we have had with Russia and the old Soviet Union have worked to \nreduce the number of nuclear weapons. His appreciation for those facts \nwould be a step in the right direction, in my judgment.\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/30/senate-section/article/S4051-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4051-S4052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.
