Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2944, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2944) making appropriations for the government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against the revenues of said District for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 5, 2001, at page H8914.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 10 minutes debate on the conference report with the time to \nbe equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to present this conference committee \nreport on behalf of myself and my most able ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Ohio. We have worked closely together over the last several \nmonths. We are proud to present a conference report that truly is a \nbipartisan, bicameral compromise on the District of Columbia, which is \na very important center, a very important capital, a very important \nsymbol for our Nation, home to almost 500,000 people who live here, but \na center where millions of people work and where even more millions \nvisit and, in some ways, call home because it is the Capital of our \nNation.\n  I am pleased to present this conference committee report. I will \nbriefly highlight a couple of the most significant provisions of this \nconference agreement.\n  The first is that this bill reflects for the first time in 5 years a \nbudget that is no longer under the control of the control board. That \ncontrol board did an excellent job under tremendous leadership, and I \ncommend them for their great work over these 5 years, working with us \nin Congress and with the Mayor and the city council to reshape and \nreform the District's finances, which for the time are in pretty good \nshape. There are no deficits at this present moment. But as my \ncolleagues know, there are some challenges ahead and the trends would \ncause us to be very alert on that score.\n  This is the first budget we are presenting with the control board \nbehind us. I urge the authorizing committees of both Houses to quickly \nreconvene next year to pass legislation that will create a more sound \ntransitional framework for the postcontrol period. I pledge this \nmorning my full and complete support towards that effort, and this \nconference committee report somewhat lays a foundation for that effort. \nI look forward to working to that good conclusion.\n\n  In addition, I am very proud that this bill has as one of its \nhallmarks a reform of the child welfare system. Senator DeWine will \nprobably give more detail about this matter because he has been one of \nthe leading sponsors of this legislation and this effort. I know he \nwill go into greater detail.\n  Suffice it to say, the District's foster care system and child \nwelfare system was broken. It was in shambles. It was a disgrace; it \nwas a national tragedy. We all have challenges in our respective States \nin this regard, and no State is perfect. Many States have a long way to \ngo. But the District's system had unraveled.\n  This bill gives the courts the reorganizational mandate that is \nnecessary and the financial support and resources, as well as some new \ntough guidelines and standards that, hopefully, will protect children, \nsave their lives, restore dignity to families, and promote adoption \nwhen necessary to give children the families they need to grow up to be \nwhole, complete, and full adults.\n  In addition, this bill works with the Mayor to ensure public safety \nof the District and to respond to whatever emergencies might occur. \nSeptember 11 has given us all the push we needed to make sure we are \ninvesting correctly in public safety. This bill is a beginning--not an \nend but a beginning--towards that end.\n  It is the intention of the ranking member and myself to make sure the \nemergency response plan that is ultimately crafted for the District not \nonly works for Washington, DC, but it works for the residents of \nMaryland and Virginia. We have to work together as a unified region \nwhen it comes to protecting the lives and property of the millions of \npeople who live here in the event we are attacked again. And this \nregion, unfortunately, is going to be a target because of this \nmagnificent building in which we stand.\n  Finally, this bill improves public education, and that is going to be \none of the focal points of my tenure as chair of this committee. I \nbelieve it is all about economic development, hope, and jobs.\n  The mayor has indicated this is going to be a strong thrust of his. \nThis bill lays down some foundations for public education, for charter \nschools, for early childhood and early reading programs. So I submit \nthis report. I thank our colleagues on the House side. I thank \nCongresswoman Norton for her tremendous effort.\n  I thank the staff: Chuck Kieffer, Kate Eltrich Kathleen Strottman, \nKevin Avery; and Mary Dietrich and Stan Skocki of Senator DeWine's \nstaff. Again, I am pleased to present this conference for a vote this \nmorning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Landrieu for the \ngreat work she has done. I say to her and Members of the Senate, it has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with her on this bill. I think the bill we \nhave in front of us is a good bill.\n  Let me call my colleagues' attention to an article that was in this \nmorning's Washington Post, ``Deficiencies Found in D.C. Child \nServices.'' The story starts off:\n\n       Nearly 80 percent of the District's child abuse complaints \n     were not investigated within 30 days and close to two-thirds \n     of foster homes housing city children were unlicensed this \n     year, a recent study shows.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Among the reports' findings, 30 percent of the children \n     under District care were not visited by social workers during \n     their first 8 weeks in foster care. Thirty-seven percent of \n     child neglect complaints were not investigated within 30 days \n     after they came into the city's hotline. Abuse and neglect \n     cases are required to be investigated within a 30-day period.\n\n  The story goes on. This is nothing new. These stories have been \nrunning for years in the District of Columbia and the Washington Post.\n  This Congress has looked at this mess. It is a national tragedy. As \nSenator Landrieu has pointed out, no child welfare system is perfect. \nEach one of us representing our respective States has seen problems in \nour home States, but what we see in the District of Columbia is an \nabsolute scandal.\n  Why do I bring this up this morning? I bring it up for my colleagues \nwho will be coming to the Chamber in a moment to vote. This may not be \na perfect bill, there may be parts of this bill some of my colleagues \ndo not like, but it is a bill that fundamentally changes the child \nwelfare system in the District of Columbia. To me, that is the most \nimportant aspect by far of this bill. We will have, I hope, within the \nnext week to 10 days, the authorizing bill that will fundamentally \nreform the child welfare system in the District of Columbia by creating \na brand new family court structure.\n\n  The bill we have in front of us today funds that. It funds the \nreforms. We cannot have these reforms unless we have the money. So what \nMembers will be voting on today, in a moment, is whether or not they \nwant to make fundamental reforms in a system in the District of \nColumbia that everyone in this room and everyone in the District of \nColumbia knows is an outright scandal. That really is what the vote is \nall about.\n  So to my colleagues who have had a little problem with this bill and \nsome of the controversial provisions of it, let me say this: A ``yes'' \nvote on this bill will fundamentally change the direction of what we \nare doing in the District. It will not be the end of our\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\nwork, but it certainly is a major step forward.\n  Let me also point out several other items that are in this bill that \nI think are very significant. The bill also includes funds for the D.C. \nSafe Kids Coalition; the District's Green Door Program, which provides \nopportunities for people with severe and persistent mental illnesses; a \nprogram that has been called to my attention by Senator Domenici, Teach \nfor America, D.C.; as well as the District's Failure Free Reading \nProgram. There is also significant money in this bill for the \nChildren's Hospital in the District of Columbia.\n  So it is a forward looking bill. It is a bill for children of the \nDistrict of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, less than a month ago, I stood before my \ncolleagues to address an extremely important public health concern, one \nthat is essentially a life or death issue here in the District of \nColumbia.\n  AIDS rates in our Nation's capital are the highest in the country. \nNationwide, more than one third of AIDS cases are related to drug use, \nand substance use by a parent has led to over half of the AIDS cases \namong children. Statistics are more dramatic among women, where 3 out \nof 4 women diagnosed with AIDS became infected through their own use or \na partner's use of contaminated needles.\n  Exhaustive scientific review has found needle exchange programs to be \nan effective way to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS. The American \nMedical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American \nAssociation of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association \nendorse these programs. Yet in spite of the overwhelming support from \npublic health experts, we here in Congress have prevented the District \nof Columbia from using its own local funds to finance these lifesaving \nprograms since 1999. These programs currently operate in many of our \nhome States and communities, often with the help of State and local tax \nreceipts. Almost 95 percent of these programs refer clients to \nsubstance abuse treatment programs.\n  I was pleased that the District of Columbia appropriations bill \npassed by the Senate on November 7 eliminated this unnecessary \nprohibition and acknowledged the strong support these programs enjoy \namong both law enforcement officials and the public health community.\n  The conference report we are considering today does not include this \ncrucial step forward. Instead, it maintains the irresponsible status \nquo, which prevents the District from using its own locally generated \nrevenue to finance needle exchange programs. This conference report \nignores Surgeon General David Satcher, who stated that ``there is \nconclusive scientific evidence that syringe exchange programs, as part \nof a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy, are an effective public \nhealth intervention that reduces transmission of HIV and does not \nencourage the illegal use of drugs.'' This conference report disregards \nthe Institute of Medicine, which identified access to sterile syringes \nas one of four unrealized opportunities in HIV prevention.\n  I have chosen to vote against this conference report because I am not \nwilling to disregard countless medical experts who have acknowledged \ntime and time again that needle exchange programs are an effective tool \nto halt the spread of HIV and AIDS, including the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Nurses Association, the American Association \nof Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association. I am not willing \nto ignore the tragic effect that this restriction has on children who \ncontract HIV because one of their parents used contaminated needles. It \nis my sincere hope that next year we can stop politicizing this issue \nand recognize that the District of Columbia, just like all of our home \nStates and districts, deserves to have all possible resources at its \ndisposal to combat this devastating public health crisis.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. The question \nis on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

My friend from Hawaii was a \nyoung medical student and was immediately called into action to help \ngive first aid.\n  As a young medical student, Senator Inouye gave first aid and \nassistance to a great many people.\n  Then he went through a period of time, which must have been very \nexcruciating, when he saw other citizens of the United States of his \nracial background being taken to camps and various other places because \nof their Japanese heritage.\n  Subsequently, he joined the Army, proceeded to be trained, and went \nto war in Italy. As a matter of fact, he was in Italy on one side of \nthe mountain, and our former colleague, Senator Dole, with the 10th \nDivision was on the other side of the mountain. Senator Inouye's unit \nwas the most highly decorated unit in World War II, totally made up of \nJapanese Hawaiians, the 442nd. The 442nd has a distinguished place in \nhistory. And the person who has one of the greatest places in history \nis my long-time friend, Senator Inouye, who is now a Congressional \nMedal of Honor winner. He had to wait many years before he got that \naward, having been passed over at the time because of his heritage.\n  I was privileged, as many others were, to be there when that wrong \nwas righted and he was recognized for his distinguished service to our \ncountry for the events that led up to his being injured and, strangely \nenough, being in the same hospital with Bob Dole as they both came off \nthe battlefield wounded.\n  But I have had a distinguished opportunity here to be a friend of \nthis distinguished man.\n  I never had the privilege--I am getting a little personal--of living \nwith my own brothers, but I have lived and traveled with Dan Inouye \nthroughout the world now for 33 years. I know of no man that I would \nput in higher esteem than Senator Daniel Inouye.\n  I ask the Senate to recognize him now, and then perhaps he would like \nto make some comments.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, as always, my dear friend from Alaska is \noverly generous. I shall always cherish his friendship, and this moment \nwill never be forgotten.\n  Madam President, 60 years ago our Nation was suddenly attacked by a \nforce of planes. It devastated a part of America. We lost about 2,400 \nof our gallant sons. It was a moment of great tragedy, great sadness, \nbut it was also a moment of great glory because, almost instantly, our \nNation got together. Our Nation was never that united. Even during the \nwar of the Revolution we were not that united. In the Civil War we were \ndivided.\n  But on this day, 60 years ago, America became one. And it was obvious \nthat, notwithstanding the odds against us, we were going to be \nvictorious. And we were.\n  Today, we are debating a matter that happened on September 11. And I \nknow that, though we may have used some harsh rhetoric, we will stand \nunited, as we always have, and we will come forth with a measure that \nwill be American in nature, one of which all of us can be proud.\n  Today, there are two of my colleagues here who wish they could be at \nhome, also. I wish I could be in Pearl Harbor at this moment. But two \nof my friends from Louisiana--Senator Landrieu and Senator Breaux--\nwanted to be there to participate in the opening of the great museum \ncommemorating the Pacific war. I know they join me, however, in saying \nthat duty comes first.\n  And, Ted, we appreciate the recognition you have given to December 7. \nI think this is a day of which all America can be proud.\n  Thank you very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n\n A Period of Silence in Recognition of the Sacrifice of Those Who Died \n                            at Pearl Harbor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nstand in silence for a period of 2 minutes in recognition of the \nsacrifice of those who died at Pearl Harbor.\n  There being no objection, the Senate observed a period of silence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, as we look upon our life in the Senate, \nit is, indeed, a privilege for those of us to serve with our \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii. I, too, am a member of the \ngeneration of World War II, having joined the Navy in January of 1945.\n  My modest service to country pales in comparison to that of our \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii, as it does in comparison to that \nof our colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Helms, and Senator Cochran. I think we in \nthis Chamber are the last of the few of that generation.\n  I had hoped today and had scheduled to join the President of the \nUnited States aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise in Norfolk, VA, together \nwith my junior colleague, Senator Allen. We, as our colleague from \nHawaii, will be at our duty stations here in the Senate today.\n  But I never let this day pass without my own recollections of that \nperiod as a very young man at age 17, as I say, entering the Navy and \nwhat the military did for me to enable me to achieve my goals in life. \nThe GI bill was the greatest investment this Nation ever made in that \ngeneration, and I was a beneficiary of that.\n  Together with other colleagues, in my 23 years here in the Senate, on \nthe Armed Services Committee, we, as a team, have tried to do our very \nbest for the men and women of this generation who are proudly serving \nin uniforms of our country and who eventually either will select the \nmilitary as a career or return to civilian life and avail themselves of \nthe educational and other benefits they earned through their service.\n  Just 10 days ago, the chairman of the Committee of Armed Services, \nSenator Levin, and myself had the privilege of visiting our troops in \nUzbekistan during the Thanksgiving period. We overflew Afghanistan, \nPakistan, and Oman. I awakened this morning listening to people trying \nto compare the generation of World War II with those in uniform today. \nAnd Mr. Ambrose, the noted author, said he felt this generation, in \nevery respect, equals the generation of World War II. I made that very \nsame statement on the floor of the Senate right after September 11. \nHaving seen them on this trip, I assure America that this generation \nnow in uniform is every bit and perhaps even more courageous than those \nwho served in World War II--more courageous because of the complexity \nof the enemies today and the unknown threats we face in comparison to \nthe clarity of the enemy that faced us in the period of 1941 and for \nsome 4 years thereafter.\n  So it is a privilege for me to serve with our dear friend from \nHawaii. How dearly we respect him, and how gracious he is to all of us. \nSometimes, in moments of tension around here, when you are seeking a \nlittle neutral ground for a little assistance, I go over to that desk \nand get the reassurance of my friend from Hawaii.\n  But, again, my career is very modest in comparison to that of Senator \nInouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Thurmond, Senator Hollings, Senator \nHelms, and Senator Cochran. I thank my colleague for our friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order would be the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute as in morning business just to acknowledge the remarks of \nSenator Inouye and Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I want to say, on behalf of the senior \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, and myself, how grateful we are for \ntheir remarks and the help our distinguished colleague from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, and our distinguished colleague from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, have provided to us. They have both been so instrumental in \nhelping support the development of this museum in New Orleans, LA.\n  I say to both Senators who were going to have the opportunity to be \nthere this morning, and to see their great work firsthand, this museum, \nthis dedication, has exceeded all expectations.\n  We are a city and a town used to hosting thousands of visitors. This \nmuseum, the World War II Museum, and now the opening of Pacific Rim \nTheater have exceeded all expectations. Today as we speak, Stephen \nAmbrose and a long list of distinguished dignitaries are there. With \nthe support of these two Senators and our entire Congress, we have had \ncontributed $5 million toward the development of this museum and the \ncreation of the Institute of the American Spirit. It is not just our \nweapons, our tanks, our airplanes, and our assets, it is the American \nspirit that protects and leads this world for liberty and justice. \nThese two Senators know that. They have contributed mightily. I thank \nthem on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the sun rises over Pearl Harbor this \nmorning, solemn ceremonies at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial and the \nNational Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific will commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Prayers, reflections and \ntribute will be offered to honor the service and sacrifice of the men \nand women who fought and died in the defense of our country. For many \nof us in Hawaii, the events of December 7 are a graphic memory, a \npersonal experience never to be forgotten.\n  As a student, I watched in the attack on Pearl Harbor at 8 a.m., \nSunday, December 7, 1941, from the roof of my dormitory at the \nKamehameha School for Boys on Kapalama Heights in Honolulu. We had just \nreturned from breakfast at the dining hall, and were slowly preparing \nfor Sunday services. In stunned silence, we saw the flash of bombs and \nthick black smoke rising above Pearl Harbor.\n  We saw the planes dive from the south, drop their torpedoes, and the \nresulting explosion on the battleship Arizona, which later tilted and \nsank at her mooring. The airstrip at Hickam was marked with potholes, \nbomb craters, and damaged aircraft. Smoke, both white and black, moved \nto blanket the area.\n  A spent anti-aircraft shell landed and exploded near our dormitory. A \nsquad of zeros flew over us from Pearl Harbor to attack the Kaneohe \nNaval Air Station. By that time excited radio messages were reporting \nthe bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n  It was a calamity that forever changed the course and life of our \ncountry and Hawaii. As America prepared for war, men and boys in \nHawaii, as elsewhere in our Nation, rushed to enlist. Japanese American \nsoldiers, fighting with the 442nd Infantry and 100th Battalion, became \nthe most decorated units in the war, while at the same time our \ngovernment interned and relocated their families and confiscated their \nhomes.\n  The sacrifices made by ordinary men and women who rallied in defense \nof freedom, liberty, and the great promise of our democracy represents \nthe greatest heroism and patriotism in service of our country. It also \nreminds us and future generations of Americans that patriotism is not a \nmatter of race and religion, but personal courage and conviction.\n  As we realized on December 7, and as the events of September 11th \npainfully reminded us, the freedom and prosperity we enjoy carries a \ndear price. Our sacred duty is to ensure its preservation for future \ngenerations.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, we Americans have relied on the \npower of our ideals, our faith in God, and prayer to guide us through \nthe challenges we faced, and we rely on that same power today as we \nseek peace and justice.\n  Today, I am honored to join my colleagues in prayer and remembrance \nfor those courageous men and women who died in Pearl Harbor. I also \njoin my colleagues in honoring my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nHawaii [Mr. Inouye]. His duties and responsibilities in the Senate have \nkept him from today's observances in Hawaii. For over 50 years, Senator \nInouye has served our Nation and our beloved State in the U.S. Army--\nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Territorial Legislature, \nthe House, and Senate. I am proud to serve alongside him and privileged \nto call him friend.\n  I also want to thank the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, who \nis also a decorated and distinguished veteran of the Second World War \nand a true American patriot, for his leadership in remembering those \nkilled at Pearl Harbor and honoring the service of those men and women \nwho served our Nation in the Second World War and those men and women \nwho are defending freedom around the world today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss what an important \nday today is in the history of our country and also to mention a \npersonal, special time for a Member of our Senate on Pearl Harbor Day. \nAnd that is Senator Dan Inouye.\n  Dan Inouye was 17 years old, living in Hawaii, on the day that Pearl \nHarbor was attacked. He was one of the first Americans to go forward to \ntry to help with the casualties that occurred that day.\n  But Dan Inouye has said on several occasions that he looked up into \nthe sky and he knew that the people who were bombing his country were \npeople who looked like him. And he said he knew that his world had \nchanged forever from that day.\n  Dan Inouye, at the age of 18, was a freshman in premedical studies at \nthe University of Hawaii but dropped out to enlist in 1943 in the U.S. \nArmy.\n  Danny Inouye was not just another enlistee in the U.S. Army. He was \none of the great heroes of World War II. He spent two of the bloodiest \nweeks of the war in France rescuing a Texas battalion that had been \nsurrounded by German forces. This was known as ``the lost battalion'' \nand is listed in the U.S. Army annals as one of the most significant \nmilitary battles of the century.\n  He won the Bronze Star, but that was not the end. He went to Italy \nand became involved in the war in Italy and was trying to assault a \nheavily defended hill in the closing months of the war. Lieutenant \nInouye was hit in his abdomen by a bullet which came out his back, \nbarely missing his spine. He continued to lead the platoon and advanced \nalone against a machinegun nest which had his men pinned down. He \ntossed two hand grenades with devastating effect before his right arm \nwas shattered by a German rifle grenade at close range.\n  Lieutenant Inouye, who threw his last grenade with his left hand, was \nattacked then by a submachinegun and was finally knocked down the hill \nby a bullet in the leg.\n  For this he received the Distinguished Service Cross which later, \nthank God, was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. So he is one of the very \nfew Members who has served in the Senate who has received the \ndistinguished Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  He has never missed an anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\n  He is missing it today because, once again, duty has called, and \nDanny Inouye answered the call of his duty to pass the Defense \nappropriations bill for those in the field today.\n  I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to this great patriot of our \nNation, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 60 years ago I was serving as a Circuit \nJudge for the State of South Carolina. It was an early Sunday afternoon \nwhen news reports began to stream in about the attack against the \nUnited States that took place at Pearl Harbor, HI. As I listened to \nnews reports about the attack on our Pacific Fleet, I knew instantly, \nthat the world we lived in was irreversibly changed.\n  All across this great Nation, Americans reacted to the unprovoked \nattack on the United States with anger, and I shared those sentiments. \nWe became galvanized as a Nation. Americans from all corners of the \ncountry rose to the call of duty. Long lines extended from every \nmilitary recruiting office as men and women prepared to take up the \nchallenge to the security of the United States and the American way of\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\nlife. It was my privilege to join those who immediately volunteered to \nserve. I am proud of the service that I rendered as an Officer in the \nUnited States Army which included serving in the United States, Europe \nand the Pacific.\n  The attack on Pearl Harbor was the beginning of America's direct \nmilitary participation in World War II. For nearly 4 additional years, \nthe Allied Powers fought the forces of fascism and tyranny around the \nglobe. With the passage of time, and understanding the great strength \nof our armed forces, it may be difficult to remember the challenge our \nmilitary faced despite our resolve and resources. We faced formidable \nand determined foes, but ultimately they were no match for the courage \nand bravery of our Allied Forces.\n  On September 11 of this year, we again witnessed an attack on \nAmerican soil. As Chairman Emeritus of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am honored to be in a position to support our President \nand our brave men and women in uniform in the cause to rid the world of \ninternational terrorism. The terrorists who committed this act of \ncowardice thought they could destroy the American spirit, but as \nexperience taught me 60 years ago, this will only make us stronger as a \nNation. Furthermore, I see the same spirit of unity and determination \nthat I saw then. They were wrong then, they were wrong now and we will \nprevail.\n  Today we honor the memory of those who fought for freedom in that \ngreat conflict 60 years ago. As a veteran, I have a special \nappreciation for the service and sacrifice of those men and women who \nfought so hard to protect and preserve American ideals and freedoms. We \nrecognize that Americans are again in harm's way, fighting to protect \nour freedom and our way of life. My appreciation extends to all those \nwho continue to answer the call of our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me quickly join everyone else in \ncongratulating our colleague from Hawaii who has always been very kind \nto me and to my wife and family. I appreciate it very much.\n  We have reached an impasse here. It is clear that we need something \nto sort of break the logjam. It seems to me the logical thing to do is \nto try to demonstrate the direction in which we are not going to go, so \nhopefully we can change direction and find bipartisanship in passing \nthis bill.\n  Everybody knows we have to have a Defense appropriations bill. Often \nin trying to get on the right road, it is an important step to get off \nthe wrong road. When you are going in the wrong direction, it is \nimportant to stop so that you might go in the right direction. In order \nto try to break this logjam, it is my purpose to make a point of order \nagainst the committee substitute.\n  Let me make a parliamentary inquiry. Are we on the Defense \nappropriations bill now and that substitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill has not yet been laid down.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield to the Democrat floor leader for the purpose of \nlaying the bill down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, that will be fine, if the Senator from \nDelaware addresses the Senate for up to 2 minutes, with the Senator \nfrom Texas having the floor as soon as he completes his statement as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Inouye has been a good friend \nand mentor to this new Senator, as has a Senator I call ``Mr. \nSecretary,'' the former Secretary of the Navy, Senator Warner from \nVirginia, who also has been a good counselor and advisor to me. When \nthese two Senators stood and entered the armed services six decades ago \nalmost, they raised their arms and took an oath to defend our \nConstitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. They \nparticipated in a war that brought us in the 20th century to become the \ngreat Nation we are today.\n  Sixty years ago today, Pearl Harbor was bombed. Two hundred fourteen \nyears ago today, the Constitution which they took an oath to defend was \nfirst ratified by any State in the United States of America. Two \nhundred fourteen years ago today, in a place called the Golden Fleece \nTavern in Dover, DE, about 30 delegates who had been there for 3 days \ndebating what steps to take decided that Delaware should be the first \nState to ratify our Constitution and provide the foundation which has \nenabled our Nation to survive World War I and World War II, the Korean \nwar, the Vietnam war, the war against communism, to win the battle \nagainst the Great Depression.\n  We are fighting another war on terrorism around the world and here in \nthis country and other places. That Constitution, which provides us \nwith our three branches of Government--the legislative branch, of which \nwe are one-half, the executive branch, and the judicial branch--the \nmost enduring of any constitution in the world, which provides the \nfoundation for the longest living democracy in the history of the \nworld, was first ratified today 214 years ago.\n  Any country that can survive two world wars and a civil war and the \nGreat Depression, vanquish the Communists, we can certainly handle the \nterrorists, and we can handle the issues that divide us here today. I \nam confident we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his \nthoughtful remarks and for his service to the Nation in the U.S. Navy, \nwhen I happened to have been Secretary of the Navy.

Madam President, the motion to waive the point of order is \nbefore the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the time for debating \nthat\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\nmotion to waive the point of order be divided 50/50; that is, Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd each control 30 minutes. Additionally, I have \na request for time from Senator Boxer, and I ask unanimous consent that \nshe be given 5 minutes in addition to the 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did I understand there will be 1 hour equally divided on \nthe debate?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is right.\n  Madam President, I state, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, that I asked for 5 additional minutes for \nSenator Boxer. In fairness, we should give 5 additional minutes to the \nother side. So that would be an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, as the request is worded, time on quorum \ncalls, et cetera, would not be counted because the word is ``debate''; \nam I correct?\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, my inquiry was made because I want to be \nsure we have 1 hour on the debate. It is going to take us a few minutes \nto get some chairs, and I do not want that time coming out of the \ndebate. So there is no ulterior or devious motive behind my having \nasked that question.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator Reid and my colleagues \nfor giving me this 5 minutes in support of Senator Byrd's motion.\n  We are living through a very difficult time in our history. This \nparticular campaign we are in is unlike any other we have faced. There \nare people in our own country and perhaps in as many as 80 countries \nwho are dedicated to harming our people. As has been noted, we have had \nmore casualties in this campaign on the homefront, in the homeland, \nthan we have actually had in the theater of war.\n  We have a crisis to which we must respond. With his wisdom gained in \nalmost 50 years in the Congress, Senator Byrd is leading us in a \ndirection we should all follow. I am deeply distressed that the other \nside of the aisle does not seem to want to follow Senator Byrd's \nleadership.\n  I have been in the Congress for 20 years, Senator Byrd for 49 years. \nThe President of the United States has served in office, all told, 7 \nyears as a Governor and a year as President. Our President has said it \nis important to be humble. I call on him to be humble and to listen to \nthe words of a man who understands what the role of the Congress should \nbe in this time of terror, Senator Robert Byrd.\n  We are facing threats that we have never faced before. There is not \nany debate in this body on that. We are facing the threat of smallpox. \nAnyone who has seen the presentation called ``Dark Winter,'' anyone who \nhas spoken to physicians, knows this is a disease that will kill one \nout of three people it strikes. This is a weapon of a terrorist. Will \nit ever strike? We pray to God, no. Could it strike? Yes. In what form? \nWill it be someone spraying this deadly disease at a mall? Or will it \nbe a number of people getting on a plane with the disease? We don't \nknow. Maybe it will never happen. And we pray it will never happen. But \nwe know we only have 15 million doses of the vaccine. We are very \nhopeful it can be diluted to provide up to 77 million doses. But the \nfact is, we need to move quickly.\n  I know our Secretary of Health and Human Services is moving to \nprocure those vaccines. But we also need to buy antibiotics in case we \nget more anthrax cases. We need to find cures for diseases such as \nsmallpox, Ebola virus. I have met with companies in California and \nother places that are working diligently to find cures for smallpox, \nfor Ebola viruses, and other deadly viruses. We need the funding for \nthat. Senator Byrd has done that.\n  We all worked hard on an aviation security bill and the President \nsigned that bill, but there is much more to be done. Just listen to \nNorman Mineta. He will tell you. We have to have more of the machines \nthat check for bombs in cargo holds. The FAA has not even ordered more \nmachines. I have talked to the companies. They can produce 50 a month, \nand Envision, one of the companies, has not gotten a phone call. There \nis not the money. We need more air marshals. We are getting some; we \ndon't have near enough. We need the funding for that.\n  I speak because on this one there is a hole in my heart. We lost 39 \nCalifornians. Every hijacked plane was heading for California. Those \nlong-haul flights need air marshals. These flights had the heavy fuel \nloads and the light passenger loads. Those were the targets of the \nterrorists.\n  We need more security at our nuclear plant facilities. We must have \nmore security there. That costs money. You don't do that on the cheap. \nIn California, we have two plants at San Onofre located at Camp \nPendleton, two at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo. They need the \nNational Guard. They need permanent protection. We know about dirty \nbombs and what they can do--if they get their hands on that plutonium. \nWe need to guard against that happening. Senator Byrd does that.\n  Our own Homeland Security Director has talked about all of these \nissues. Yet we seem to have a partisan battle where there should be no \nroom for partisanship. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, what are they against? The money for food safety? The money to \nfight bioterrorism? The money to give to our law enforcement throughout \nthe land, working so hard, 12 and 14 hours a day, to ease their pain? \nTo put more people on the ground? Are they against firefighter \nprograms? Border security? Airport security? Nuclear plant security? \nHow about U.S. ports, those vulnerabilities? We know what could happen \nif we do not protect our infrastructure.\n\n  It is pretty simple to me. Senator Byrd has stepped out. There can be \nno one who has reached more across the aisle than Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens, that is for sure. We saw it a couple of minutes ago. \nSo I say to my colleagues, let's be bipartisan.\n  I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let's be bipartisan when it comes to defending the \nhomeland, just as we are so bipartisan when it comes to supporting our \nPresident in this fight abroad.\n  My mother used to say, in the old days: Penny wise and pound foolish. \nIt is something we always heard from our moms. You make these \ninvestments now.\n  Last point. The President does not have to spend the money. The way \nSenator Byrd has structured it, it is entirely up to him. Why would he \nnot want to have that insurance in his pocket so if we had another \nattack we would not have to immediately be clamoring for another \nsession of Congress? Let's do the right thing and follow the leadership \nof Senator Byrd today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the Senator from California completed her statement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will take 3 minutes off our side's time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the time just be given to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota rather than invade Senator Byrd's time. We are happy to \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator without any limitation on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Alaska for his graciousness \nwith\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\nrespect to the time. Once again, he has demonstrated why he is one of \nthe most respected Members of this body. He is truly a gentleman.\n  Madam President, the question before us is whether or not the \nadditional funds to strengthen homeland defense and to rebuild what has \nbeen destroyed in New York should be approved. The basic question is \nwhether or not it goes over what is provided for in the budget. There \nis no question it is over and above what is in the budget. That is \nbecause America was subjected to a sneak attack on September 11.\n  Terrorists attacked this country and that has required a response. It \nhas necessitated increases in spending for national defense. It \nrequires us to build up our defenses against bioterrorism. It requires \nus to strengthen the security at our airports, at our harbors, at our \nnuclear facilities. All of that costs money.\n  Of course, it was not in the original budget agreement. These are \nfunds over and above what was anticipated because no one could have \nanticipated in April a terrorist sneak attack against the United \nStates. I am chairman of the Budget Committee. I have argued all \nthroughout the budget process, all throughout the tax process, for us \nto respect the integrity of the trust funds of the United States. They \nare in danger. They were in jeopardy before the attack on September 11. \nOur first priority has to be the defense of this Nation. I think each \nand every Member of this Chamber understands that is the first \nobligation of each and every Member of this body and of the other body.\n\n  The basic argument on the Republican side is we should wait: We \nprobably are going to have to have these additional expenditures, but \nwe should wait until next year. Their argument is this adds to the \ndeficit.\n  I think we should look at what else is being proposed, what else is \nbeing considered in this Chamber to evaluate the merits of their \nargument. The fact is, the Republican stimulus plan that is also being \nconsidered simultaneously with the legislation before us now adds $146 \nbillion more to deficits than the Democratic stimulus plan. The \nDemocratic plan in 2002, with all that has happened--the attacks on \nthis country, the additional spending, the economic downturn--will have \na $32 billion deficit in 2002. The Republican plan will generate a \ndeficit in this fiscal year of $47 billion. In fact, we could \naccommodate the entire additional spending to protect this Nation and \nto rebuild New York and not have more of a deficit than the Republican \nplan for fiscal year 2002.\n  For 2003, the Democratic plan has a deficit of $3 billion. The \nRepublican plan has a deficit of $66 billion. That is 22 times as much \nof a deficit for the year 2003 than it is in the Democratic plan.\n  For 2004, the Democratic plan emerges from deficit with a $45 billion \nprojected surplus, while the Republican plan is still in deficit by $23 \nbillion.\n  Over the first 3 years of this budget plan, the Republican overall \nbudget blueprint will create $136 billion of additional deficits, of \nadditional debt. The Democratic plan will actually have $10 billion of \nsurplus. So there is a total difference between the two plans--the \nRepublican stimulus plan over the Democratic stimulus plan--of $146 \nbillion of budget deficits and of additional debt.\n  What Democrats are saying is we ought to accommodate the $15 billion \nthat Senator Byrd has identified that is critical to strengthening our \nhomeland defense and to keeping the promise to rebuild New York. We can \ndo that. We can do that and still have $130 billion less of a deficit \nthan the Republican budget plan.\n  To the extent this is an argument over deficits, there is no argument \nbecause the Democratic plan has far less in deficits--more than $130 \nbillion less--than the Republican plan.\n  We ought to thank and commend the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd, and the Defense Appropriations Committee \nchairman, Senator Inouye, for coming forward with a plan that is \nresponsible to defend America and to keep the promise to rebuild New \nYork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let us pause for a moment, back away, and determine \nif we might be able to see the forest and later see the trees.\n  Remember, Senators, that in this package I have offered, and which \nwas adopted in the Appropriations Committee, I sought to do three \nthings:\n  No. 1, to give the President every penny he asked for for defense. He \nrequested $21 billion. And there is not a penny cut away.\n  We have added $7.5 billion for New York, et al, and $7.5 billion for \nhomeland defense.\n  We have a package that gives to the President $21 billion for \ndefense. It provides that New York City and other areas that were \nattacked on September 11 would get the $20 billion that the President \npromised and to which we committed ourselves. On top of that, there is \n$7.5 billion for homeland defense.\n  I didn't go to New York. I didn't go up there and promise that. But I \nsaw, and I heard, with my heart and mind responding. We believe we \nought to stand by our promises to New York, New Jersey, et al.\n  Some have argued that approval of $15 billion for homeland defense \nand for New York disaster relief will result in pumping up spending for \nyears to come. That is not my intent. In fact, I have included a \nprovision in this bill directing OMB and the Congressional Budget \nOffice to exclude the $15 billion from baseline calculations of future \nspending. This $15 billion supplemental is intended to respond to the \nurgent needs and vulnerabilities that have been created by the \nterrorist attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks. It is not a \npermanent increase in spending. It should not be a permanent increase \nin spending.\n  Having laid that to rest, let me read just a few excerpts from news \nstories. Let us talk about the homeland defense. Defense of the \nhomeland is important and in the final analysis even more so than \ndefense overseas.\n  The opposition that has raised this point of order is saying we can \nwait for defense of the homeland, we have to take care of our men and \nwomen oversees.\n  I am for doing everything within our power to defend the men and \nwomen whom we send overseas. As a matter of fact, I was the Senator who \nstepped forth several years ago during the war in Vietnam when my own \nparty and my own majority leader at that time were opposed to attacking \nthe Vietcong enclaves in Cambodia. I took the position that we had men \nin Cambodia and we ought to attack those enclaves. I took the position \nthat we had a duty to do whatever was necessary and that the President \nof the United States, Mr. Nixon, had a duty to do whatever was \nnecessary to protect the men and the women he sends overseas into \nbattle--whatever is necessary. He had a right to do that. He had a duty \nto do it. My own party on that occasion took issue with that idea. They \nwere opposed to bombing the enclaves in Cambodia, which were attacking \nour military men in South Vietnam.\n  So don't look at me and pretend I am a Senator who is battling for \npolitical reasons. I was not then. I am not now. This amendment is to \nprotect the people here at home--relatives of those men and women who \nare overseas, children of those men and women who are overseas, mothers \nand fathers and sisters and brothers of those men and women who are \noverseas.\n\n  Ask the men and women overseas: How would you vote today? Would you \nvote for homeland security? Would you vote to advance the cause, to \ngive homeland security a jump-start, to protect your people back home \nin the USA? And the people back home are not only the relatives of \nthose men and women who are in Afghanistan; there are also military men \nand women here in this country, still. And they, too, might be subject \nto injury, to disease,\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\nto death as a result of terrorist acts over here. How blind can we be?\n  So there is a division line here saying: Oh, we must do everything \npossible for our men and women overseas--and we are doing that; we are \nnot cutting one penny out of defense abroad--but as to homeland \ndefense, the Administration says let's wait, let's wait until we \nanalyze and wait until we get further reports and wait until our \ndepartment heads can come forward with proposals. Wait, they say.\n  Here is a story in The New York Times today in which [Mr.] Ridge \nPromises Security Funds ``For States in Next Budget.'' When will that \nbe? I will read just a bit:\n\n       A day after the nation's governors asked Congress for an \n     immediate $3 billion to fight terrorism, Tom Ridge, director \n     of homeland security, promised that President Bush's budget \n     proposal next year would include ``substantial down \n     payments'' to the states for security.\n       Mr. Ridge spoke as questions of how much domestic security \n     should cost after Sept. 11 have proliferated on Capitol Hill \n     and as states, facing recession and budget shortfalls, are \n     grappling with how to pay for new responsibilities to help \n     guard borders, bridges, dams and nuclear power plants. . . .\n       On Wednesday, the National Governors Association released a \n     preliminary survey of domestic security costs, estimating \n     that they would run the states $4 billion in the first year.\n\n  So here we are: The States of the Nation are grappling with serious \nproblems involving their own budgets. They have budget shortfalls. They \nare crying out for help. And yet here we have the Director of Homeland \nSecurity saying: Wait--Wait.\n  We do not have time to wait. We do not have that luxury. A vote \nagainst my waiver of the point of order sends the message that it is \nmore important to win a political battle than it is to win the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  Why will they not vote for this package? This package, as it was \nwritten originally, had an emergency designation which would say to the \nPresident: Here is the money. You do not have to spend it. You can \nspend it or not spend it, depending upon the circumstances at the time.\n  Well, the Senate has already stricken from that package the emergency \ndesignation. Now we are at the stage where we are going to vote to \nwaive the point of order. Those who vote against the waiver send the \nmessage that it is more important to win a political battle than it is \nto win the war against terrorism. That is what a vote against the \nwaiver means.\n  The President has said he will veto this bill if it has more money \nthan he requested. Is the Senate going to be blind to the fact--and I \nhave had Senators say to me: Well, why do we press ahead when the \nPresident has said he will veto? The answer is: If we back away every \ntime a President threatens a veto, then the Chief Executive of this \nNation will reign supreme. He will become an emperor. No matter what \nhis political party, he will become an emperor, he will be king.\n\n  What would the Framers think of that? How would the Framers look upon \nthis Senate that cringes when a President says he will veto? I think \nthey would be dumbfounded to see that the time has come when the \nlegislative branch will flinch, will cringe when a President issues a \nveto threat. Certainly the majority of the people in this broad land of \nours feel that the time is at hand when we need to jump-start homeland \ndefense so that aid will immediately flow to the people at the local \nlevel: The policemen, the firemen, the paramedics, the people in the \nhospitals, the people in the labs, the people in the emergency rooms in \nthe hospitals.\n  This is the time. If something happens tomorrow, tonight, next week, \nor the week after, the people at the local level need to know that \ntheir paramedics, their firemen, their policemen are going to have \nmonetary assistance. The Governors will know that. The mayors will know \nthat. Will our pleas fall upon deaf ears? Unfortunately, politics \nreigns supreme in this Capitol. Once again, the people will lose.\n  An entire Defense bill, representing months of work by Senator \nStevens, Senator Inouye, and others, is going to fall. Why? Because of \npolitical petulance. Ah, the Chief Executive, our people here say, must \nwin. He has said he will veto. What is one man's judgment against the \njudgment of the majority of the people? It is obvious that the \nterrorists can strike. We know that. Anthrax taught us that.\n  I think this is an extremely unwise course to take in time of war. \nThis is a war. Oh, Administration leaders say, we should not challenge \nthe President. I say that this is not a challenge to anybody, except to \nthe consciences of all of us who are sent here by the people of the \nUnited States. Will we let political blinders get in the way of what we \nknow is right.\n  We all know it is right to provide protections to the people against \nthe sinister, deadly attacks on our own shores. And we have seen them \nalready. The people are crying out for help. Our military needs to know \nthat games are not being played with defense. Can we not lift our eyes \nfrom Budget Act points of order long enough to do what our country \nneeds us to do. Apparently not. So, keep your political blinders on. \nAll that matters is winning for the President. Winning! That is all \nthat matters.\n  I wish that, just once, the thick fog of cynicism--and it is so thick \nthat you can cut it with a knife--could be lifted from this town. I \nwish, just once, we could listen to our hearts--pay no attention to \npolitics, just listen to our hearts and clear our minds of fog and \npolitical partisanship. Let our hearts and clear, rational minds, not \nthe hotheads--not the hotheads of political gamesmanship--guide our \nactions. In this game of political cloak and dagger, the only ones \nbeing stabbed in the back are the American people.\n  Now, each of us is going to have to stand before the American people \nand answer questions. If this point of order prevails, we break our \npromise to the people to protect them. We break the promise to the \npeople of New York City to help them with this tragedy. We continue the \ndecades of partisan political squabbling that so often occupy us in \nthis self-consumed, cynical, myopic town.\n\n  When I came to the legislative branch, we had two major political \nparties. In the year that I came here to the legislative branch, the \nRepublicans were in control. Joe Martin of Massachusetts, Republican, \nwas the Speaker of the House of Representatives. John Tabor of New York \nwas the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse. Yes, those men were politicians, but first of all they were \npatriots.\n  And how about those men at Valley Forge? How about those men who \nwrote the Constitution, how would they feel? How would those Framers \nfeel? What would they think if they could hear the arguments, the \npitiful, weak arguments that are being advanced against this package? \nHow would they feel if they could read in the press of our day what is \nbeing said by those who oppose this package? Wouldn't they say: Let's \nwork together? Wouldn't they say: We, the Framers, wrote ``we the \npeople, in order to form a more perfect union.'' How would the Framers \nfeel about that? We are not forming a more perfect union here in this \nSenate. No, we are using a point of order that requires 60 votes to \novercome. We are going to vote the party line and turn our backs and \ngive the back of our hands to the American people.\n  We can't be proud of ourselves. Oh, we win the political battle: oh, \nyes, we will uphold the hands of our President when he carries out his \nveto threat.\n  Mr. President, I want to help the President. I want to help him keep \nhis promises to New York. I want to help him keep his promises to the \npeople of this country regarding homeland defense. We all know he made \nsuch promises. So it will be a political victory for the \nAdministration. But where does that leave us? Where does that leave the \npeople of the nation? They are going to have to wait. A supplemental \nwill not be coming along for a while, and it won't be adopted for a \nwhile. I don't know how long. But we are going to say to the people: \nYou wait.\n  Oh, yes, on fast track the President got on the White House phones, I \nam told, and called Members of the other body and said: Please, support \nyour administration; we need fast track.\n  But, Mr. President, on Homeland defense, the Administration says, \nwait, wait, wait.\n  It seems to me to be a rather arrogant attitude on the part of the \nadministration. They say: Wait, we will tell you, the Congress, how \nmuch we need. We will let you know when we have\n\n[[Page S12590]]\n\ndone these analyses and after the departments have all gotten together \nand we have all come to a decision as to what we need, then we will \ntell you how much we need.\n  That is an arrogant attitude, Mr. President, in my opinion. What we \nare saying is, we want to help you, but we think the danger is there. \nWe think we ought to act now. We ought not wait. That is what we are \nsaying.\n  I hope all Senators will hear me. Hear me, Senators. Listen to what I \nam going to say. Under the Budget Act, legislation cutting taxes or \nincreasing mandatory spending is supposed to be paid for because of the \ntax cut bill signed this summer. We are currently facing a 4-percent \ncut in Medicare spending in January. Hear me, Senators! I wish my voice \ncould ring across the land, that the people could hear me, if they \ncould have time to contact their Senators. Let me say it again: Because \nof the tax cut bill signed this summer, we are currently facing a 4-\npercent cut in Medicare spending in January.\n  A 4-percent cut in Medicare would result in $8.5 billion in cuts for \nhospitals, physicians, home health agencies, skilled nursing \nfacilities, and managed care plans. This isn't going to be easy. This \nis not going to be easy. You can wrap the robes of political \npartisanship around yourselves, but you won't keep out the chilly winds \nthat are going to blow right in your face.\n\n  A 4-percent cut in Medicare would result in $8.5 billion in cuts for \nhospitals, physicians, home health agencies, skilled nursing \nfacilities, and managed care plans.\n  Such cuts may force health care providers to cut staff, threaten to \ncut the quality of care to our elderly who receive health care through \nMedicare, or force them to discontinue to see Medicare patients.\n  My proposal includes a provision to block--get this now, my proposal \nthat is in this bill which is about to be brought down--my proposal \nincludes a provision to block these Medicare cuts. So it is not going \nto be easy to explain to those people out there who are your \nconstituents that it is more important to cast a political vote here \nthan it is to cast a vote for the people back home.\n  Wait until those Medicare cuts face you, the Senators who will vote \nagainst this waiver. You will be hiding behind a sixty-vote point of \norder. I am not denying any Senator's right to make points of order. \nThis is a 60-vote point of order. So we can hide behind that. Or can \nwe? Think about it. There will be a few people, in this country at \nleast, you will meet on the campaign trail who will have heard what you \nare about to do.\n  Any Member who votes against the motion to waive this 60-vote point \nof order is voting to allow the massive $8.5 billion cut in Medicare to \ngo into effect in January. Explain that one to your constituents. \nExplain that one to your conscience. I don't propose to be anybody's \nkeeper of conscience, but it would certainly be on mine if I voted that \nway.\n  There is no person of any party to whom I would give precedence for \nparty reasons or preference in any way, over the obvious needs of the \nAmerican people to be protected from terrorist attacks, and the needs \nof the people to be able to have their hospitals, their physicians, \ntheir home health agencies, their skilled nursing facilities and \nmanaged care plans not be jeopardized by this point of order.\n\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I again thank my friend. And we hear that \nterm used so loosely in this body and on Capitol Hill, ``my friend.'' \nHe is my friend, this man. I admire him. There is something behind the \npolitical facade of this man. He is a man. He is a man, and here is a \nman in Danny Inouye. I thank him as we soon will come to a close, I \nassume. I may need some more time. The distinguished Senator from \nAlaska yesterday gave me as much time as I asked for, and I will be \nrequesting that time again.\n  I believe the Senator from Massachusetts wanted me to yield to him at \nthis point. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five minutes, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I only have something near 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 15 minutes of our time.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator yields me 15 minutes, and I thank \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today is Pearl Harbor Day. Just a short \ntime ago, we had an enormously moving moment in the Senate. We do not \nhave many emotional moments in this institution; certainly few as \nimportant and emotional as we had earlier today when our good friend, \nthe Senator from Alaska, paid tribute to our beloved friend, genuine \npatriot, and hero, Senator Inouye, for his service in World War II.\n  Americans are thinking about today December 7, a day when America was \ncaught unprepared in World War II. We came together as a nation, and we \nwere victorious, with a great deal of courage and a great deal of \nbravery, but also a great deal of suffering, certainly, at Pearl \nHarbor.\n  We are also mindful of what happened on September 11 when we saw the \nfailure of our intelligence system and the failure of our security \nsystems at our airports--two massive failures. We saw Americans suffer \nloss of life, and families who have lost loved ones are feeling it more \nnow than ever at the holiday season. I am sure everyone in this body \nhas talked in their States with those families who have lost loved \nones. This all because we were unprepared to deal with the terrorist \nattacks: during World War II on December 7 and again this year on \nSeptember 11.\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from West Virginia says: \nEnough is enough. We are facing a new world, a new time. This Defense \nappropriations bill says we will give all the support our service men \nand women need who are fighting overseas in Afghanistan and across the \nworld preserving peace and preserving our liberties. We are prepared to \ndo that.\n  But we have been exposed in recent times to another kind of threat \nand danger. That threat and danger, even though it cost the lives of \nonly 5 Americans, has touched those families. But more importantly, it \nhas put a sense of concern and perhaps even anxiety in the hearts and \nsouls of all Americans in every part of the Nation. It is the threat of \nthe unknown, and that is the dangers of bioterrorism. This is a real \nproblem in a real time.\n\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia is in response to \nthat challenge. It is the first opportunity to do something. His \nproposal is a modest program compared to what the experts have \nrecommended. It is a proposal that ought to be supported now.\n  Yesterday we heard from former Governor Ridge saying next year the \nadministration is going to propose hundreds of millions of dollars, \nperhaps even billions of dollars, for homeland security to help the \nPublic Health Service, to build the laboratories, support the \npersonnel, support the hospitals, develop the communications systems, \ndo what is necessary in early detection, containment, and treatment of \nbioterrorism. Why are we waiting for next year when the danger is here \ntoday--Friday--when we will have a chance to vote on this measure?\n  The sad fact is that every day we delay is another day's head start \nfor the terrorists. While we debate, they plan. While we defer, they \nprepare. Even now the terrorists may be preparing fresh batches of \nanthrax for wider and more deadly attacks.\n  We cannot wait until next year to fulfill our constitutional duty to \nprotect the American people from this threat. Every day we delay means \nthat States cannot buy the equipment necessary to upgrade their \nlaboratories; they cannot buy the computers and fax machines to \ncommunicate the information crucial to identifying and containing an \nattack; they cannot hire the personnel they need to do the work. It \nmeans another day in which hospitals cannot purchase the reserve stocks \nof antibiotics; cannot add emergency room capacity; and cannot improve \ntheir ability to treat infected patients.\n  This is the issue. The Byrd amendment responds to this in a \nresponsible way, in a way that is consistent with\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\nall those who know the nature of this threat. We know there is a \npotential danger of Ebola. We have no possible cure for Ebola. Why are \nwe waiting to get our best scientists and researchers into the \nlaboratories to work on this issue?\n  That is what the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia is all \nabout. It is responsible, it is responsive, it is thoughtful, and it is \nan essential step forward in protecting American families across this \ncountry. This amendment deserves the support of all the Members.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership in this \narea, as in so many other areas.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The junior Senator from Louisiana wishes to have some time, \nI understand. How much time does she desire?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I have come to the Chamber to support the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and to associate myself with the remarks that he has \nmade and the Senator from Massachusetts has made. This is a very \ncritical time and a very critical consideration.\n  I was given a most magnificent book yesterday--it is appropriate that \nI would have this book in the Senate Chamber today--which says, as the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii beautifully called to \nour attention this morning, December 7, that 60 years ago our Nation \nbecame one.\n  On September 11, our Nation became one again. I wish the camera could \npick up the opening of this Time Life book that is on the stands today \nas we speak: A firefighter from New York and Mayor Giuliani, one of the \ngreat leaders of this tragedy. The book details in some of the most \ngraphic, horrific pictures of the Twin Towers that no longer exist, the \ndevastation of that day, New York, the great symbol of economic freedom \nand justice in the world.\n  The television cameras cannot grasp the significance of the \ndevastation, but in these still pictures in this book, one can see the \nslight wing of the plane as it comes to hit the World Trade Tower, and \nthen again the next picture of this plane coming from this direction, \nplanned this way, 20 minutes later, so the world could catch the \nterrorists destroy the symbols of power and might of capitalism in the \nworld because they do not like it, because it lifts millions of people \nout of poverty and gives hope where there is despair. They do not like \nwhat it stands for so they destroyed it.\n  Look at these flames. There is the body of one man burned beyond \nrecognition. He chose to jump rather than be burned alive. There is \nanother man crawling out of the window desperately hoping to reach the \nbottom from the 83rd floor which, of course, was not going to happen.\n  I do not know how quickly we forget--all of Manhattan up in smoke; \none of the greatest cities not just in America but in the world in \nsmoke, in flames. We think this is not going to happen again? It very \nwell can.\n  In addition, not only is this an attack and a threat against our \nwell-being, but it is an attack against our economy. Senator Byrd \nbrings to us a responsible proposal to not only help make us more \nsecure at home but create jobs in the spending and investments of these \nfunds.\n  Today in the newspaper, anthrax was found again in the Fed's mail, \nanthrax found in the Federal Reserve Board of the Washington, DC, \nheadquarters. This is what the Senator's amendment is trying to fund. I \nknow there are disagreements about some of the details.\n  In conclusion, I hope we do not forget Pearl Harbor, I hope we do not \nforget September 11, and I hope we come together to find some kind of \nway to say, yes, it is important to fund the war in Afghanistan. But it \nis as important to contribute to the security of our buildings, our \nenergy, our health care system at home.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his great work and am \nproud to support his efforts in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, when the terrible terrorist attacks \noccurred on September 11, the Congress immediately started to work on \nmeeting the needs of the people affected directly. On September 18, the \nPresident had signed the bill we passed providing the authority to \nspend $40 billion. That $40 billion was to deal with providing Federal, \nState, and local preparedness for mitigating and responding to attacks; \nproviding support to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or \ninternational terrorism; providing increased transportation security; \nrepairing public facilities and transportation systems damaged by the \nattacks; and supporting national security.\n  It provided that those funds could be transferred to any Federal \nGovernment activity to meet the purposes of the act: $10 billion \navailable to the President immediately, another $10 billion available \nto the President 15 days after the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget has submitted to the House and Senate Committees on \nAppropriations a proposed allocation and plan for use of the funds for \nthat department or agency, and $20 billion may be obligated only when \nenacted in a subsequent emergency appropriations bill.\n  That is this bill that is before us now. The House has passed it and \nthe amendment that is the subject of the point of order is before the \nSenate. It is for the $20 billion, but it is also for an additional $15 \nbillion beyond that.\n  I call attention to the Senate the fact the act that was signed by \nthe President has these clauses in it:\n\n       That not less than one-half of the $40 billion shall be for \n     disaster recovery activities and assistance related to the \n     terrorist acts in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania on \n     September 11.\n\n  That is from the whole $40 billion.\n\n       Provided further, that the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall provide quarterly reports to the \n     Committees on Appropriations on the use of these funds, \n     beginning not later than January 2, 2002.\n\n  That is when the first quarterly report is available. And here is the \nkey phrase:\n\n       Provided further, that the President shall submit to the \n     Congress as soon as practicable detailed requests to meet any \n     further funding requirements for the purposes specified in \n     this act.\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       Provided further, that the President shall submit to the \n     Congress as soon as practicable detailed requests to meet any \n     further funding requirements for the purposes specified in \n     this act.\n\n  I take no joy in being part of the process to bring down the \nsubstitute that has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. As \na matter of fact, as I said before, I spent hours working on some of \nthe details in this bill. I do not think it is politically motivated at \nall. It is a sincere desire to make funds available, but in many ways \nthose funds are beyond the basic act and that is why they were \ndesignated an emergency $15 billion beyond the act, but they are for \nfurther funding requirements for the purposes specified in the act.\n  The President has taken the position he should be allowed to follow \nthis law, he should be allowed to present detailed requests for the \nfurther funding requirements to meet the changed conditions of the \ncountry, in effect, following the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n  I originally started in the same position the Senator from West \nVirginia is in now. As the chairman of the committee, he had the duty \nto think through these things. I started out in the same position he \nhad, but the further I thought about it and dealt with the President's \nrequest, the more I realized it was rationally based and it was what \nthe Congress intended when\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\nwe passed the original law that provided the $40 billion.\n  We said the President shall submit. It was a law that demanded the \nPresident submit to the Congress as soon as practicable detailed \nrequests to meet any further requirements for purposes specified in \nthis act.\n  By bringing down this substitute, what we do is allow the President \nto proceed under the law we have already enacted. He will present to us \nfurther requests to meet the needs of the Nation as detailed by him \nsometime after the first of the year and after that first report that \nis going to be filed on January 2 of next year to tell us how this \nmoney he had control over, the first $20 billion, was spent.\n  We do not know that yet. We have estimates on how it might be spent, \nbut we do not know how it has been spent. We will know in quarterly \nreports starting January 2, and the law presumes we are going to get \nanother report every quarter on how that money was spent. That is good \nmanagement.\n  While I regret supporting the position taken by the Senator from \nTexas as he has made the point of order against the substitute of the \nSenator from West Virginia, I think we will be back reviewing the \nPresident's detailed request early next year, and I expect that many of \nthe requests the Senator from West Virginia has made will be honored by \nthe Congress and by the President at that time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 14 minutes. The \nSenator from West Virginia has 5 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. The yeas and nays will be ordered at the expiration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were ordered on the motion.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska. How much \ntime do I have now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we come to the conclusion of this \ndebate, I draw to the Members' attention what those on the front lines \nof this battle have been saying about the need to dramatically increase \nour bioterrorism preparedness. It is important. They are the ones who \nhave to deal with this challenge if we have a bioterrorist attack. They \nare the ones whose lives will be at risk. They are the ones who will \ndetect and identify the threat. They are the ones who have to deal with \nit.\n  From the Association of the Public Health Laboratory: ``Through the \nevents of the past few months we have learned just how critical our \npublic health laboratories are to the public health system and to the \nnation's well-being,'' said the president, Mary Gilchrist, the \npresident of the Public Health Laboratory. ``While State and local lab \nhave been effective so far, they are stretched. To respond adequately \nto future threats we must update our labs, staffing and technology and \nsecurity.''\n  The Byrd proposal would add the resources necessary to make us \neffective in dealing with this crisis.\n  From the National Association of County and City Health Officials--\nthey are the first ones to detect this challenge: ``[the association] \nbelieves that every community deserves the protection of a fully \nprepared public health system.''\n  That is one of the great assets of the Byrd proposal. It will cover \nthe whole country, not just some areas. The Byrd proposal provides the \n``resources needed to build the local public health infrastructure that \nthe country lacks.'' We urge the ``Congress to recognize the great \nurgency and magnitude of this task'' and support the Byrd proposal.\n  This is the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists: ``A \nnumber of the State organizations, including the Association of \nTerritorial Health Officials, and the National Governors Association, \nhave written to the President requesting'' the funds that are included \nin the Byrd amendment.\n\n  Members could say those organizations want it because they have a \nparticular interest. The fact is, they have the responsibility. They \nknow what is needed.\n  We have statements from the American Medical Association supporting \nthe need for increased bioterrorism preparedness:\n\n       We strongly support [this initiative] that would improve \n     the public health, the hospital communications, the \n     laboratory, emergency respond preparedness focusing at the \n     State and local levels.\n\n  American Academy of Family Physicians, the family physicians who will \ndeal with this crisis:\n\n       By bolstering the role [in this instance] of CDC, in \n     improving both the Federal and laboratory capacity and \n     surveillance systems, the legislation provides the tools for \n     early warning and quick response. And by enhancing the \n     nation's stockpile of vaccines and by supporting the FDA's \n     food inspection systems, the legislation builds a strong \n     bioterrorism prevention.\n\n  Finally, the Association of American Universities:\n\n       As you well know, this research [involving hazardous \n     pathogens and toxic agents] is a crucial component of an \n     effort to protect the public from terrorism and disease, \n     through the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and cures.\n\n  This amendment moves us down the road. These are all the front line \norganizations. They are the ones that know what the need is. Each and \nevery one of them rise in total and complete and wholehearted support \nfor increasing the nation's ability to respond to bioterrorism.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, to the credit of the administration and the \nCongress, a scant 3 days after the assault on New York, a $40 billion \nemergency supplemental spending package was approved. My colleague, Mr. \nStevens, has called attention to that. At that time we could not fathom \nthe anthrax-laced letters that were to disrupt the U.S. mail, cause the \nHart Senate Office Building to close, taint letters up and down the \neast coast, and cause death and illness to postal workers and several \nother citizens who simply were unfortunate enough to open their mail.\n  At that point we did not know the extent of bin Laden's terror \nnetwork in the United States and in 59 other countries. In the early \ndays after the tragedy, we did not fully understand what the impacts \nwould be on our Federal law enforcement entity. We were only just \nbeginning to come to grips with the holes in our border security, the \ninadequacies of our customs inspection procedure, the potential for \nmisuse of our largely unprotected nuclear facilities, food supplies, \nwater supplies, and networks of communications and transportation. We \nhad not fully come to grips with our deficit of small pox vaccines or \nthe stretched-thin capacity of the CDC and local public health \nfacilities and hospitals. We had no idea of the loss of life and \nfinancial devastation that had actually occurred in New York. We knew \nthere was a deep hole in Lower Manhattan; that deep hole is still there \ntoday.\n  It was early at that time and we acted quickly, as we should have and \ndid, but we did not have the full picture. Since that time we have \nlearned much. We have learned that there are hundreds of \nvulnerabilities here at home. We have learned that bin Laden has \nthousands of faces in terrorist cells throughout the world and here at \nhome. At a time when we are engaged in a war in Afghanistan, at a time \nwhen we are hunting bin Laden and his ilk worldwide, at a time when the \nadministration has warned that any nation that harbors or funds \nterrorists might be subject to a military response from the United \nStates, at a time when tensions in the Middle East are at powderkeg \nlevels, I do not believe that a cut in the proposal for Homeland \ndefense is wise or prudent.\n  We are in uncharted waters in stormy seas with a potential hurricane \nof violence just across the horizon. We know not what may be required \nof the brave men and women who wear the uniform of this great Nation \nabroad nor on how many fronts, including the homefront, simultaneously.\n  We may need every dollar of defense and more before it is over, but \ndefense is defense, whether it is defense in Afghanistan or defense in \nNew York or California or Alabama or Georgia or West Virginia. Airwars \nare effective, up to a point. They are also expensive. We\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\nmust not shortchange our national defense--at home or aboard.\n  Throughout our short history, Americans have always been able to pull \nout of such nosedives through a rallying of our spirit, the American \nspirit. Positive leadership--positive leadership by our Government, \npositive leadership that is not blinded by political party interests--\nis needed. American determination has taken on challenge after \nchallenge and turned history our way, time after time, because we all \ncame together.\n  Consider the Herculean task of building the Panama Canal; President \nKennedy's call to put a man on the Moon, the Presidents' call to end \nthe long twilight struggle of the Cold War; the phenomenal progress \nagainst cancer and other dread diseases. Americans are at their best \nwhen we actively take on a problem and marshal our energies, unblinded \nby political partisanship toward a goal.\n  But what is missing this time is bipartisanship in Washington. We \ntalk a lot about it; we don't practice it. The people are united. As \nusual, they know what is important. But we do not seem to be able to \npull together in this town, even in this time when the people of the \nUnited States are united. We are facing such a challenge now. Our \npeople have responded bravely. We are aggressively pursuing terrorists \nand a government that sanctions terrorists in Afghanistan. But there is \na need to do more here at home. The Nation needs to actively engage in \na coordinated campaign to protect our people from the scourge of \nterrorist attacks on all possible homefronts.\n  We have been sent a horrifying message from the skies above New York \nand Washington, DC. In the evil content of tainted mail, we have seen \nthis horrifying message. Up and down the east coast of this Nation, we \nhave seen it.\n  To call these unbelievable acts a wake-up call is an understatement \nin the extreme. We have been roused from our sleep by a tornado of \nviolence. We dare not risk an anemic response. To be tepid now is to be \nfoolish. To be timid now is to tempt fate. The first responsibility of \nany government is to ensure the safety of the people. And tangential to \nthat responsibility is to assure their peace of mind.\n\n  We cannot now afford the luxury of complacency. We dare not slip into \na sense of false confidence. Every possible effort must be brought to \nbear to thwart this new and different kind of enemy, and we have not \nyet done enough.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to say what I am about to say without giving an \nappearance that I am saying it with rancor or that I am attempting to \nlecture my colleagues. I am often charged in the press with \n``lecturing'' my colleagues.\n  I think of that great man in Roman history whose name was Helvidius \nPriscus. He was a Roman Senator.\n  The Emperor at that time was the Emperor Vespasian. He and Helvidius \nPriscus, the Senator, were very much at odds over a given issue, and \nthe Roman Senate was about to decide this issue. The Emperor saw \nHelvidius Priscus as Priscus was about to enter the Senate. The Emperor \nstopped Helvidius Priscus and said: Don't go in to the Senate today.\n  Helvidius Priscus--ah, there was a man of courage. There was a man \nwho saw his duty first, a man who saw his duty to the people, his duty \nunder the Roman Constitution. And he saw through the cynical fog and \nkept his eyes on his duty. And he said: O Emperor, you have the power \nto make a Senator and to unmake a Senator. But as long as I am a \nSenator--and you appointed me--it is my duty to go into the Senate.\n  Vespasian said: All right, but don't answer any questions.\n  Helvidius said: If I am not asked any questions, I will keep quiet. \nBut if I am asked a question, I must answer it.\n  Vespasian said: Then, if you answer it, you will die.\n  Helvidius Priscus responded: O Emperor, it is in your power to do \nwhat you will. It is my duty to say and do where my conscience leads \nme. If I am asked a question, I will answer it.\n  The question was asked. Helvidius Priscus answered the question--not \nin accordance with the Emperor's will. Helvidius did his duty. \nVespasian kept his promise that he would execute Helvidius. And \nHelvidius Priscus died because he stood with his own conscience where \nduty lay, rather than with an emperor's demand with which he strongly \ndisagreed.\n  I say that today so that the record for all time will be reminded of \na Roman Senator who did his duty as his own conscience directed him, \nrather than obey a ruler's command--even though the ruler had appointed \nhim to the high office of Senator.\n  Thank God we in this country of ours are not appointed as Senators by \nany President. When I was majority leader of the Senate and the \nPresident of the United States was Jimmy Carter, I said: I am the \nPresident's friend, but I am not the President's man. I am the Senate's \nman.\n  I don't hold myself to be a great paragon of anything. But I do \nbelieve in a Senator's constitutional oath. I am not appointed by any \nPresident, whether it is Mr. Carter, whether it is Mr. Clinton. I will \nbe courteous, I will try to be fair with any President, but no \nPresident will tell me, as a Senator, how to vote.\n  Now, that ought to be the attitude of every Senator. I have seen \nother Senators here, on both sides of the aisle, who have stood by that \nduty. But I have seen a change in this body. Where are our heroes? \nWhere are our Senators of today, Mr. President? Having been a Member of \nthis Senate, now, 43 years, about to enter my 44th year in the Senate, \nmy 50th year in the Congress, and in my own 85th year, I must say that \nit troubles me, more than anything else, to look about me and see men \nand women who are elected by the people of their respective States, to \ncome here and to represent the people, who would bow the knee before \nany President of any party.\n  We have no king in this country. To those who say, ``Well, he has \nthreatened a veto, why should we push on?'' that is as much as to say \nthat any time a President says he will veto a measure, we as Senators \nshould not press forward with what we believe is right, we should not \ndo what we think is right, instead, we must listen to that threat of \nveto and do what the President tells us to do. That makes an emperor of \na man who is not an emperor.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have great respect for every Senator. I \nhave tremendous respect for Mr. Gramm, the Senator from Texas who made \nthe point of order. I have the highest respect for Ted Stevens on that \nside of the aisle. I have said that many times.\n  I don't indulge any rancor at all in my heart, nor should any Senator \ntoward any other Senator. But I must say that I am troubled greatly \nwhen we have come to the point in this Republic of ours when men and \nwomen who are elected and who swear an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution while standing at that desk with their hand on the Holy \nBible, let their political partisanship cloud their vision. The \nPresident didn't elect me. I don't say that out of disrespect for him. \nHe didn't elect me. The people of West Virginia elected me. They \nelected me to use my best judgment on great national issues. They did \nnot elect me to say whatever the President wants me to say, or to allow \nany President to tell me how to vote.\n  It hurts me in my heart to think that men and women fail to see where \ntheir duty lies under the Constitution.\n  I beg all Senators' forgiveness, but after being here 49 years this \nyear, I cannot help but say that that troubles me.\n\n     When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,\n     And the world makes you King for a day,\n     Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,\n     And see what that guy has to say.\n\n     For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife,\n     Who judgement upon you must pass.\n     The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life\n     Is the guy staring back from the glass.\n\n     He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,\n     For he's with you clear up to the end,\n     And you've passed your most dangerous, most difficult test\n     If the man in the glass is your friend.\n\n     You may be like Jack Horner, and ``chisel'' a plum,\n\n[[Page S12594]]\n\n     And think you're a wonderful guy,\n     But the man in the glass says you're only a bum\n     If you can't look him straight in the eye.\n\n     You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,\n     And get pats on the back as you pass,\n     But your final reward will be heartaches and tears\n     If you've cheated the man in the glass.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through you to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia that I can remember the first press \nconference we did on homeland security. I stood proudly by you on that \nday, and we have worked on this. He has worked on it 110 percent more \nthan I. But I want the Senator to know that I am going to go home \ntonight, tomorrow, or whenever we finish this legislation, and I will \nbe able to look in that glass because I know I did the right thing by \nstanding next to the Senator from West Virginia on this legislation.\n  It is the right thing to do. It is the important thing to do. I have \nbeen around a few years. I have seen it whittled away, and they are \ngoing to try to take this from you. The reason I feel so badly about it \nis I don't think the country is going to be as safe for my family and \nthe people of the State of Nevada if this amendment is taken down. It \nis a good piece of legislation.\n  I wish to publicly express my appreciation to my friend from West \nVirginia for allowing me to stand by him on this legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question occurs \non the motion to waive section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 357 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the President repeat for the benefit \nof all of us, those of us who couldn't very well hear what was being \nsaid, would the Chair repeat what he just said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute exceeds the allocation to the \nsubcommittee in violation of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \nAct. The point of order is sustained. The amendment falls.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has spoken on the point of order. \nI ask the leadership--and I will yield to the Senator from Nevada \nwithout losing my right to the floor--if we could have a period of time \nduring which Senators may speak, perhaps as in morning business--\nmisstating the true purpose of morning business, but that is understood \nby all--so that I could meet off the floor with my own leadership, \nhopefully for a brief time, after which I would hope that I could meet \nwith my own leadership, Senators Daschle and Reid, together with my \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and with the \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, in other \nwords, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Stevens, and that in the meantime, Senators \ncan continue speaking or whatever the leadership would like to be \ndoing. I would say that we would need probably an hour and a half, \nmaybe a little longer, to consider the matter as it faces us now. I \nwonder if the leadership wishes to respond to that.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, I wonder if it would \nbe appropriate that we proceed now, if the Senator will agree, to a \nperiod for morning business for 1 hour, and then we will come back and \nrevisit the situation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. I reserve the right to object. We have been on \nthis bill now for a long period of time. There are a lot of us who want \nto talk about the bill, a lot of us who have a lot of amendments. It is \ntime to move forward with the process.\n  I object to going into morning business. I am glad to have discussion \nof the legislation. I intend to speak on it at some length, and I \nintend to propose an amendment or amendments and begin their \nconsideration. Those of us who strongly object to this legislation and \nthe porkbarrel spending--it is the most egregious I have ever seen--\nshould very soon have the right to begin amending to restore some kind \nof sanity and fiscal discipline to this process. So I object to going \ninto morning business.\n  I will seek recognition both for addressing this legislation and for \namendments. I hope there are other colleagues of mine on both sides of \nthe aisle who share this concern.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, who has the floor, the Senator from Nevada \nor the Senator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator from West Virginia has \nreserved his right to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to no man when it comes to putting \nthe defense of this Nation ahead of all other things. I have no problem \nwith the Senate proceeding--I expected it to at some point--with the \nDefense bill. I expected Senators to have an opportunity to offer their \namendments. But I also think at the moment, this matter that we have \nthought so much about, worked hard to develop some approach; namely, \nhomeland defense--we are at a point where we think this is the matter \nthat is most important before the Senate.\n  I did not hold up this Defense appropriations bill to this point. The \nHouse did that, but I have the right--I can hold the floor also. I want \nto reach a sensible, commonsense conclusion to this, and I am willing \nto sit down with our counterparts and do so. I make no threats. The \nSenator is not impressed by threats. Neither am I. I am not wanting to \nhold up the bill ad infinitum, but it only came to us a few days ago. \nOur committee has responded magnificently.\n  The Senator can say what he wishes and do what he wishes, but there \nare others in here who are just as firm in our patriotism for this \ncountry as is the Senator from Arizona. If he wants to talk about pork, \nwe will talk about pork at an appropriate time. I hear that theme song \nover and over and over, and I see items in the newspapers that are not \naccurate when they talk about pork. They are not accurate today, but \nthis is no time to go into that. There is something more important.\n  If the Senator wants to object, he can object. If he thinks that will \ngain time, let him see.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded for the purpose of talking about Pearl \nHarbor Day.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the call of the roll.\n\n[[Page S12595]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the next \n60 minutes no amendments be in order to the bill; that Senator Cleland \nnow be recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes, followed by Senator \nMcCain for 45 minutes, followed by Senator Wellstone for 10 minutes, \nand at the end of that time the majority leader or his designee be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes at the end of that \nto make this a 65-minute request.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am happy to add the additional 5 minutes for Mrs. \nHutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cleland pertaining to the introduction of S. 1785 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sorry to say that whether or not we \nresolve our differences over spending that exceeds limits set by the \nBudget Act, the Department of Defense appropriations bill will still \nfail to meet its most important obligation. In provisions too numerous \nto mention, this bill time and time again chooses to fund porkbarrel \nprojects with little, if any, relationship to national defense at a \ntime of scarce resources, budget deficits, and underfunded urgent \ndefense priorities.\n  America is at war, a war that has united Americans behind a common \ngoal of defeating international terrorism. Our service men and women \nare once again separated from their families, risking their lives, \nworking extraordinarily long hours under the most difficult conditions, \nto accomplish the ambitious but necessary tasks their country has set \nfor them.\n  The weapons we have given them, for all their impressive effects, are \nin many cases neither in quantity nor quality the best our Government \ncan provide.\n  For instance, stockpiles of the precision guided munitions that we \nhave relied on so heavily to bring air power to bear so effectively on \ndifficult, often moving targets, with the least collateral damage \npossible, are dangerously depleted after only nine weeks of war in \nAfghanistan. This is just one area of critical importance to our \nsuccess in this war that underscores just how carefully we should be \nallocating scarce resources to our national defense.\n  Yet despite the realities of war and the responsibilities they impose \non Congress as much as the President, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has not seen fit to change in any degree its usual blatant \nuse of defense dollars for projects that may or may not serve some \nworthy purpose, but that certainly impair our national defense by \ndepriving legitimate defense needs of adequate funding.\n  Even in the middle of a war, a war of monumental consequences and \nwith no end in sight, the Appropriations Committee, still is intent on \nusing the Department of Defense as an agency for dispensing corporate \nwelfare. It is a terrible shame and derogation of duty that in a time \nof maximum emergency, the Senate would persist in spending money \nrequested and authorized only for our Armed Forces to satisfy the needs \nor the desires of interests that are unrelated to defense and even, in \ntruth, uninterested in the needs of our military.\n  In this bill, we find a sweet deal for the Boeing Company that I'm \nsure is the envy of corporate lobbyists from one end of K Street to the \nother. Attached is a legislative provision to the fiscal year 2002 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill that would require the Air \nForce to lease one hundred 767 aircraft for use as tankers for $20 \nmillion apiece each year for the next 10 years.\n  The cost to taxpayers? More than $2 billion per year, with a total \nprice tag of $30 billion over 10 years. This leasing plan is five times \nmore expensive to the taxpayer than an outright purchase, and it \nrepresents more than 20 percent of the Air Force's annual cost of its \ntop 60 priorities. But the most amazing fact is that this program is \nnot actually among the Air Force's top 60 priorities nor do new tankers \nappear in the 6-year defense procurement plan for the Service!\n  That's right, when the Air Force told Congress in clear terms what \nits top priorities were tankers and medical lift capability aircraft \nweren't included as critical programs. In fact, within its top 30 \nprograms, the Air Force has asked for several essential items that \nwould directly support our current war effort: wartime munitions, jet \nfighter engine replacement parts, combat support vehicles, bomber and \nfighter upgrades and self protection equipment, and combat search and \nrescue helicopters for downed pilots.\n  This leasing program also will require $1.2 billion in military \nconstruction funding to build new hangars, since existing hangars are \ntoo small for the new 767 aircraft. The taxpayers also will be on the \nhook for another $30 million per aircraft on the front end to convert \nthese aircraft from commercial configurations to military; and at the \nend of the lease, the taxpayers will have to foot the bill for $30 \nmillion more, to convert the aircraft back--pushing the total cost of \nthe Boeing sweetheart deal to $30 billion over the ten-year lease. That \nis a waste that borders on gross negligence.\n  But this is just another example of Congress's political meddling and \nhow outside special interest groups have obstructed the military's \nability to channel resources where they are most needed. I will repeat \nwhat I've said many, many times before--the military needs less money \nspent on pork and more spent to redress the serious problems caused by \na decade of declining defense budgets.\n  This bill includes many more examples where congressional \nappropriators show that they have no sense of priority when it comes to \nspending the taxpayers' money. The insatiable appetite in Congress for \nwasteful spending grows more and more as the total amount of pork added \nto appropriations bills this year--an amount totaling nearly $14 \nbillion. And although we are 68 days into the new fiscal year, we still \nhave four appropriations bills left to complete before we adjourn.\n  This defense appropriations bill also includes provisions to mandate \ndomestic source restrictions; these ``Buy America'' provisions directly \nharm the United States and our allies. ``Buy America'' protectionist \nprocurement policies, enacted by Congress to protect pork barrel \nprojects in each Member's State or district, hurt military readiness, \npersonnel funding, modernization of military equipment, and cost the \ntaxpayer $5.5 billion annually. In many instances, we are driving the \nmilitary to buy higher-priced, inferior products when we do not allow \nforeign competition. ``Buy America'' restrictions undermine DoD ability \nto procure the best systems at the least cost and impede greater \ninteroperability and armaments cooperation with our allies. ``They are \nnot only less cost-effective, they also constitute bad policy, \nparticularly at a time when our allies' support in the war on terrorism \nis so important.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and his predecessor, Bill Cohen, oppose this \nprotectionist and costly appropriations' policy. However, the \nappropriations' staff ignores this expert advice when preparing the \nlegislative draft of the appropriations bill each year. In the defense \nappropriations bill are several examples of ``Buy America'' pork--\nprohibitions on procuring anchor and mooring chain components for Navy \nwarships; main propulsion diesel engines and propellers for a new class \nof Navy dry-stores and ammunition supply ships; and, other naval \nauxiliary equipment, including pumps for all shipboard services, \npropulsion system components such as engines, reduction gears, and \npropellers, shipboard cranes and spreaders for shipboard cranes.\n  If it was not for the great cost to our military and the taxpayer, \ndrafting ``Buy America'' provisions must be a somewhat amusing project \nfor staff and the Members of the Appropriations\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\nCommittee. An example of this language follows:\n\n       None of the funds in this Act may be available for the \n     purchase by the Department of Defense (and its departments \n     and agencies) of welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain 4 \n     inches in diameter and under, unless the anchor and mooring \n     chair are manufactured in the United States from components \n     which are substantially manufactured in the United States: \n     Provided, That for the purpose of this section manufactured \n     will include cutting, heat treating, quality control, testing \n     of chain and welding (including the forging and shot blasting \n     process): Provided further, That for the purpose of this \n     section substantially all of the components of anchor and \n     mooring chain shall be considered to be produced or \n     manufactured in the United States if the aggregate cost of \n     the components produced or manufactured in the United States \n     exceeds the aggregate cost of the components produced or \n     manufactured outside the United States.\n\nThat has to be entertaining to some government classes around America.\n  Also buried in the smoke and mirrors of the appropriations markup is \nwhat appears to be a small provision that has large implications on our \nwarfighting ability in Afghanistan and around the world. Without debate \nor advice and counsel from the Committee on Armed Services, the \nappropriators changed the policy on military construction which would \nprohibit previous authority given to the President of the United \nStates, the Secretary of Defense, and the Service Secretaries to shift \nmilitary construction money within the MILCON account to more critical \nmilitary construction projects in time of war or national \nemergency. The reason for this seemingly small change is to protect \nadded pork in the form of military construction projects in key States, \nespecially if such projects have historically been added by those \nMembers who sit on the Military Construction Appropriations \nSubcommittee at the expense of projects the Commander in Chief believes \nare most needed to support our military overseas.\n\n  In the usual fashion, legislative riders that probably would not make \nit through the normal legislative process are tacked onto this must-\npass appropriations bill. For example, a provision was added to this \nbill to enact legislation to federally recognize native Hawaiians, \nsimilar to the status afforded to American Indians and Alaskan Natives.\n  I have no objection to the substance of this legislation on its face. \nI do object that not a hearing has been held--no consideration, no \ndebate--on an issue that could obligate the Government of the United \nStates to billions and billions of dollars in funding, but also \nsignificant obligations as far as land, water, and other vitally needed \nnational resources are concerned.\n  How in the world do you justify, on a Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill, a change in policy, a far-reaching change in policy \nregarding our treatment of native Hawaiians?\n  In fact, no one would even know what we are passing into law because \nonly vague references are included. Only careful observers would \nrecognize what these three lines in this appropriations bill actually \nstand for in a 24-page bill. Does the Appropriations Committee have any \nrespect for the authorizing committees in the Senate?\n  This bill also clearly tramples on the jurisdiction of the Commerce \nCommittee by making unauthorized appropriations out of the airport and \nairways trust fund, particularly for the Airport Improvement Program. \nThere are hundreds of millions of dollars in spending out of the trust \nfund, perhaps as much as $715 million, that are not explicitly \nauthorized. Furthermore, $306.5 million of the civil aviation spending \nin this bill was not requested by the President. Of the money that was \nrequested, the President did not ask that it be taken out of the \naviation trust fund.\n  Finally, the trust fund is supposed to be devoted to the \ninfrastructure needs of the national aviation system, but this bill \nuses the trust fund essential air service, which may be a worthy \nprogram but is not eligible for these moneys.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate approved the Department of \nTransportation appropriations bill. That bill was an egregious \noverreach by the appropriators. In redirecting the programmatic \nexpenditures and directives developed under the law by the authorizing \ncommittee, there were more than $4.1 billion in earmarked projects in \nthat bill and a statement of managers redirecting funding that should \nhave gone to the States but instead was used as a slush fund by the \nappropriators to earmark their home State projects.\n  Here we are, only a few days later, and we are once again facing \nanother appropriations bill that continues the unacceptable \noverreaching by the appropriators with respect to authorized \ntransportation programs. For example, under division B, chapter 10, the \nbill provides $100 million for Amtrak for ``emergency expenses to \nrespond to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, for necessary \nexpenses of capital improvement.''\n  This funding is not authorized, nor has it been requested by the \nadministration. The Senate-Commerce-Committee-reported S. 1550, the \nRail Security Act of 2001, would authorize funding for Amtrak safety \nand security needs, primarily tunnel improvements in New York, \nMaryland, and DC. Under S. 1550, however, the funding would only be \nreleased to Amtrak after Amtrak submits a plan to the Secretary of \nTransportation for addressing safety and security that is then approved \nby the Secretary. The accompanying DOD report language states that the \nfunding provided for Amtrak:\n\n     . . . will be used solely to enhance the safety and security \n     of the aging Amtrak-owned rail tunnels under the East and \n     Hudson Rivers.\n\n  However, neither the bill nor the report provides any Federal \noversight by the Department of Transportation of the additional \ntaxpayer dollars that would be provided to Amtrak.\n  Additionally, the bill provides for $110 million, $10 million of \nwhich was requested by the administration in ``miscellaneous \nappropriations'' to the Federal Highway Administration.\n  By the way, I want to remind my colleagues, this is a Defense \nAppropriations Committee bill--to the Federal Highway Administration. \nThe accompanying report directs that $100 million of these funds be \nused for construction of ferries and ferry facilities in New York to \ncover for the loss of the PATH transit services between New York and \nNew Jersey that have not been requested by the administration.\n  Not only did the administration not request the funding, it is not \neven clear if the ferry services being sought are the right solution. \nThe goal should be to rebuild the PATH system, not replace it with a \nless efficient ferry service. While ferry service may be required, it \nmay be a relatively short-term need and is one that can and is being \naddressed with current assets. Further, the bill provides $100 million \nfor Federal transit administration capital investment grants that were \nnot requested by the administration. The accompanying report then \nearmarks the entire amount for use by transit authorities most impacted \nby the September 11 terrorist attack.\n  Under division C, the DOD appropriations bill provides $12 million \nfor shipbuilding loan guarantees under title XI of the Merchant Marine \nAct of 1936. This is by far the most egregious use of a national \nemergency designation as an excuse for porkbarrel spending that I have \never seen.\n  The Maritime Administration is today preparing to make one of the \nlargest single default payments in the history of the Shipbuilding Loan \nGuarantee Program, due to the bankruptcy filing of the American Classic \nVoyages Company on its loans. MARAD has asked the Treasury for $250 \nmillion to pay off loans which have been called under American \nClassic's guarantees.\n  Further, the Department of Transportation Inspector General is \ninvestigating the loan guarantee program as a result of American \nClassic's default, the default of the SEAREX program earlier this year \nand problems with several other title XI loan guarantee projects that \nare having difficulties at this time.\n  Specifically, the inspector general is looking into the title XI \nprocedures for submitting reviewing, approving, and monitoring title XI \nloan guarantees, and whether merit procedures were adequately effected \nand implemented in order to protect the interests of the United States. \nWhy would we now have an additional $12 million for new loan guarantees \nwhen there are obviously problems with the program, I might add, for a \nprogram the administration has recommended not to fund at all.\n  While a report accompanying the bill recommends new funding to be \nused to\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\ncover the loans for port security infrastructure and equipment, that is \nnot allowed under current law. The funding will go into an account that \nis designated solely for shipbuilding loan guarantees. I note the bill \nprovides $11 million in appropriations to the Maritime Administration \nfor general port security improvements. While I fully support the need \nfor increased security at our Nation's seaports, and I am a cosponsor \nof legislation that would create a new program to provide port security \nfunding, I cannot support funding for a program in a manner that is not \nallowed under the law while we are in a period of deficit spending.\n  The President has repeatedly said that he will come back to Congress \nin the spring with a request for additional funding as needed, and if \nlegislation to change the law with respect to port security funding is \nsuccessful, the funding could be provided at that time. But for now, \nproviding $12 million for shipbuilding loan guarantees at a time when \nthe program's current and future operations are under review would be a \nserious breach of our responsibilities to the American taxpayer.\n  Under division E, the so-called technical corrections division, the \nappropriators do what they do best, redirect current laws developed by \nthe authorizers. Amazingly, the appropriators are already seeking to \n``correct'' the Transportation appropriations bill approved by the \nSenate earlier this week, and it hasn't even been signed into law.\n  For example, under Section 109, the appropriators take an additional \n$29.5 million from the State's funding that was to be distributed \naccording to the Transportation Equity Act, TEA-21, the multiyear \nhighway funding legislation of 1998, and to be effective through 2002, \nand transfer that $29.5 million to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Project to \nrestore the project's funding that will be reduced as a result of the \nenactment of the Transportation appropriations bill. This provision \nwould now bring the total loss for the State allocation to over $450 \nmillion.\n  The Department of Transportation appropriations bill already has \nreduced the State's funding by $423 million, but this bill will ensure \nthe Wilson Bridge Project is held harmless with respect to the \nappropriators' earlier funding redirectives.\n  Section 111 also amends TEA-21 just as it did so many times in the \nTransportation appropriations bill and, in this case, adds additional \ndirectives for the benefit of Alaska. Specifically, Section 111 would \namend the list of high priority project designations by adding to item \n1497, which states, ``construct new access route to Ship Creek access \nin Anchorage'' and words ``construct capital improvements to intermodal \nmarine freight and passenger facilities and access thereto.''\n  Under section 112 it would amend the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill which, as I just mentioned, hasn't even been signed \ninto law. First, it would add yet another earmark in the Transportation \nCommunity System Preservation Program, a program the appropriators \nfunded at more than 10 times the authorized level, and earmarked every \ncent, and directed $300,000 for the US-61 Woodville widening project in \nMississippi. It then directs $5 million of the Interstate Maintenance \nProgram for the City of Trenton/Port Quendall, WA, Project.\n  Haven't these States had enough earmarks already?\n  I note the bill would direct that $3,170,000 of the funding provided \nfor the Research and Special Programs Administration be used for \nresearch in special programs, and $226,000 of funds provided for the \npipeline safety program shall remain available until September 30, \n2004.\n  Since when do we appropriate money beyond the fiscal calendar year?\n  The $273 million for the Coast Guard in the $20 billion supplemental \nis a plus-up of $70 million over the $203 million requested by the \nAdministration. The Administration's request would fund the personnel \ncosts for reserve personnel brought on active duty, purchase small \nboats for port security, and prevent several cutters and aircraft from \nbeing decommissioned. The additional $70 million not requested by the \nadministration would fund $50 million for entitlements authorized by \nthe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), but not provided in the \nTransportation appropriations act and $20 million for additional \ndomestic port security teams.\n  The $12 million for the Coast Guard in the Byrd homeland defense \nsupplemental would provide additional funding not requested by the \nAdministration for the Coast Guard to provide enhanced port security \noperations and conduct port vulnerability assessments. The Department \nof Transportation currently has a Maritime Direct Action Group that is \nstudying port security requirements. The administration plans to base \nfuture port security funding requests on this group's recommendations.\n  This legislation includes language that recommends $8.25 million for \nemergency grants to assist public broadcasters in restoring \nbroadcasting facilities that were destroyed in the collapse of the \nWorld Trade Center. This provision allows public broadcasters to \nreceive 100 percent of the total amount for cost recovery of their \nfacilities. Other public broadcasters seeking funding for the \nconstruction of similar facilities will only receive 75 percent of the \ntotal amount, as set forth in section 392(b) of the Communications Act \nof 1934. This provision is inconsistent with the act and is selectively \nunfair to those who are seeking similar funding.\n  I look forward to the day when my appearance on the Senate floor for \nthis purpose are no longer necessary. There is over $2.2 billion in \nunrequested defense programs in the defense appropriations bill and \nanother $2 billion for additional supplemental appropriations not \ndirectly related to defense that have been added by the chairman of the \ncommittee. Consider what that $4.2 billion when added to the savings \ngained through additional base closings and more cost-effective \nbusiness practices could be used for. The problems of our armed forces, \nwhether in terms of force structure or modernization, could be more \nassuredly addressed and our warfighting ability greatly enhanced. The \npublic expects more of us.\n  But for now, unfortunately, they must witness us, blind to our \nresponsibilities in war, going about our business as usual.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of Appropriations Committee \nearmarks be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n           FY 2002 Defense

Mr. President, a lot of these I don't understand. A lot \nof them no one understands, and yet the money is disbursed.\n  I am a little bit embarrassed to note there are two additional \nunrequested porkbarrel projects at Camp McCain in Mississippi: Camp \nMcCain Simulator Center, trainer upgrades; and the Camp McCain Training \nSite, roads.\n  I also am happy to see Camp McCain functioning with efficiency in \ndefending our Nation. But I am curious why they couldn't have requested \nthis funding.\n  Several at least warrant inquiry:\n  Rock Island Bridge Repairs; Memorial Tunnel, Consequence Management; \nPacific Server Consolidation, $10 million; Wind Energy Fund; $500,000, \nElmendorf Air Force Base transportation infrastructure; Clara Barton \nCenter, $1.5 million; Multimedia Classroom, $850,000; Distance \nLearning, $30 million; Bangor International Airport repairs--I don't \nbelieve Bangor International Airport is a military base--that is $10 \nmillion; oil debris detection and burn-off system, $5 million; Aluminum \nMesh Tank Liner, $7.1 million.\n  All of these may be worthwhile projects. The Department of Defense \ndid not find them worthwhile enough to request them.\n  National Guard Distance Learning Courseware, $8 million; Smart \nTruck--that has always been one of my favorites--$4 million.\n  The old brown tree snake is in here; Spine Research, $20.5 million; \nHeat Actuator Coolers, $2 million; Starstreak whatever that is--$16 \nmillion; 3-D Printing Metalworking Project, $3 million.\n  None of these that I mention was requested nor given any \nconsideration in the authorizing process.\n  Auto Research Center, $3 million; Bug to Bug Identification and CM--\nBug to Bug--that is only $3 million; Hawaii Federal health care \nnetwork, $18 million; Brown Tree Snakes, $1 million; Coastal Cancer \nControl, $5 million; Pacific Island Health Care Referral Program, $5 \nmillion.\n  There are many, and for some of them we still haven't been able to \nfigure out exactly what they mean.\n  One of them is the Gwitchyaa Zhee Corporation lands; leasing of the \nBoeing 767s. Enactment of S. 746 means more money for the 2002 Winter \nOlympics in Salt Lake City, UT.\n  Then there are huge amounts of money for Commerce, and others, \nincluding, as I mentioned, $29 million for the Woodrow Wilson project; \n$22 million for the Pipeline Safety Program; U.S. 61 Woodville widening \nproject; Interstate Maintenance Program for the City of Trenton-Port \nQuendall, WA.\n  It is quite remarkable.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to be sure I have it straight about this Boeing \naircraft thing. Am I to understand that there is a provision in the \nbill that would have us lease 100 Boeing aircraft, paying $11 billion \nper year for the lease, and the Air Force did not ask for these \naircraft? Is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is right; only he may have left out another \naspect of it. We have to spend an additional $1.2 billion in military \nconstruction to build new hangars for these aircraft because existing \nhangars for our existing fleet, which does need upgrading--and they \nhave requested repair and upgrading of our existing fleet--is also an \nadditional cost.\n  I would like to mention to my friend from Texas that once the 10 \nyears is over, Boeing gets the aircraft back.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I know the Senator is a very senior member of the Armed \nServices Committee. Is there any evidence anywhere that the Air Force \nsaid it wanted these planes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have looked at the Air Force's 6-year program top \npriorities and their top 60 priorities. These are not in their top 60 \npriorities, nor in the 6-year defense procurement plan for the Air \nForce.\n  I would like to remind my friend that not long ago a major decision \nwas\n\n[[Page S12600]]\n\nmade in a competition between Lockheed Martin and Boeing for the \nprocurement of a new fighter aircraft. Lockheed Martin won that \ncompetition.\n  Also, as the Senator from Texas knows, there have been many \ncancellations for orders from Boeing for new airliners because of the \neconomy.\n  If it is the judgment of the Senator from Texas and the majority of \nthis body and the administration that Boeing Aircraft --which, by the \nway, has facilities in 40 States throughout America--needs to be bailed \nout, then I say OK. Maybe we could write them a check for $10 billion. \nMaybe it is a matter of national security. But to do it this way and \ntake 20 percent of the entire budget for new projects from the Air \nForce is remarkable.\n  I know the Senator doesn't agree with me, but this is living, \nbreathing testimony for the need for campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me pose another question, if I may. The Air Force \ndoesn't want these planes. We are going to spend $10 billion plus \nanother $1 billion to build hangars, and then we are going to give the \nplanes back. Does the $10 billion sound to you like an inflated price \nto lease these airplanes for 10 years?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, according to the people we talk to, it is actually \nabout $10 billion more. I want to point out there is a provision in \nthis bill that does not allow competition. In other words, if Airbus \nwanted to offer to lease their airplanes to the U.S. Air Force, they \nwould be prohibited from doing so. So not only is it earmarked for at \nleast $20 billion, we could purchase these aircraft outright for \napproximately one-third of the cost of what we are going to incur \nthrough this cockamamie leasing program.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And we have them for only 10 years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Where does the price come from? Do you have any idea where \nthe price came from?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no idea. But I also point out to the Senator from \nTexas, these tankers have long lives--20, 30, 40 years--because we \ncontinuously maintain them and upgrade them. So after 10 years, Boeing \nwould get these airplanes back. And it is really remarkable, it costs \ntaxpayers $2 billion a year for a total pricetag of $20 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me ask a question. Maybe there is a shortage of tanker \ncapacity now with the war in Afghanistan. Can we get these planes \nimmediately? Do you know how long it is before the first one would be \ndelivered?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding it would take 6 years to acquire \nthese 100 aircraft.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So we don't get anything for 6 years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sure we could get a few of them right away. I have \nto tell the Senator from Texas, I do not think I have ever seen \nanything quite like this before. When we are talking about $20 billion, \nthat, even in these days, is not chump change.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, I just want to say to the Senator from Arizona, I am \nsure it pains many people to hear the Senator from Arizona go through \nand list all the things in all these appropriations bills that nobody \nrequested that are being funded, but I think it gives some insight into \nhow big the level of waste is in this process and how out of control \nspending is. I thank the Senator for bringing it to light.\n  I would also say that about this Boeing proposal I do not think I \nhave ever seen a proposal that makes less sense economically--and it is \na big statement to say as Senator McCain and I have been here together \nfor 22 years. Lease something for 10 years, and pay a higher price than \nyou could buy it for, with no negotiation of price--I guess Boeing and \nwhoever wrote this amendment came up with a price--and no competition.\n  The Air Force does not want the plane, and we do not get a plane for \n6 years under the procurement proposal. I am not aware there has ever \nbeen a worse proposal in the 22 years we have served together. If so, I \nhave never seen it. I mean, that is a big statement.\n  Some people may think that is an overstatement--and maybe we are \nprone toward it--but I do not think, in the 22 years I have been here, \nI have ever seen anything to equal this Boeing lease agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nprioritized list submitted by the Air Force.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Remaining\n           Priority

McCAIN. If you look at No. 1 through No. 59 on the list of \npriority items, there is no request for Boeing 767s. I agree with the \nSenator from Texas, I have never seen anything quite like it. You would \nthink that just the size of this leasing--the $20 billion deal, plus \nthe $1.5 billion for the construction of the hangars, et cetera, not to \nmention the cost of reengineering the airplanes, which the taxpayers \nwill pay for, and the deengineering of the airplanes--you would have \nthought at least there would have been a hearing--a hearing, some kind \nof a hearing in the Armed Services Committee when you are talking about \nthis kind of an amount of money. But instead, we had to thumb through \nthe appropriations bill, and all of a sudden it came upon us.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield for a \nquick comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I just say to the Senator, in the time I have served with my \ncolleague from Arizona, he has never flagged in his effort to save \ntaxpayer money, and he looks for the kind of pork projects that he has \nidentified over the years in all of the different bills. The bill \nbefore us happens to relate to defense.\n  I am sure it does not give any pleasure to my colleague from Arizona, \nanymore than it does any of the rest of us, to be talking about these \nthings with regard to the Defense Department while there is a war on.\n  But I recall comments yesterday from the Secretary of Defense who was \nbriefing us on the war effort, and in a great fit of patriotism, one of \nmy colleagues said to him: So, Mr. Secretary, we want you to know we \nare all for you. We are for the troops. What else can we do to help \nyou?\n  His immediate response was: Well, we could start with base closures \nand stop funding things that I have not asked for and start funding \nthings I have requested. That is what you could really do to help.\n  And the pretty universal reaction among our colleagues was: Well, \nother than that, what could we do to help you?\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\n  So my point, Mr. President, is to compliment my colleague from \nArizona. He has been fighting this battle for a long time. It does not \ngive us any pleasure to point these things out, but it is critical, if \nwe are really serious about supporting the troops we put in harm's way, \nthat we try to focus on the priorities we need the most and not fill \nthe bill up with special projects for people who have special status in \nthe Congress.\n  So I compliment my colleague for the work he is doing. I hope later \nwe will have an opportunity to offer amendments to deal with some of \nthis.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Arizona, who has been steadfast.\n  But I would ask for the consideration of my colleague from Texas and \nmy colleague from Arizona, and all others who are concerned about this. \nPerhaps it might not be a bad idea if we proposed a substitute, that we \nsheared all of the pork off it and proposed a substitute that was just \nthe fundamental requests of the administration and all those projects \nthat have gone through the normal authorizing and appropriations \nprocess. I think that would be a very interesting vote.\n  I say to my colleagues that maybe we ought to try that, since none of \nthese other things seem to be working--maybe just the bill that \ncontains the requested and authorized and within the budgetary \nrestrictions of the budget process.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me be sure I understand. You are saying you have all \nthese programs in here that nobody ever asked for: these planes the Air \nForce does not want, paying more to lease them than we could buy them \nand what you are proposing----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may interrupt, billions of dollars that have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with defense.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The proposal you are talking about is to take all those \nout and then ask the military, if they had a chance to spend the money, \nwhat would they spend it for?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, it seems to me you could do that by striking all of \nthese add-ons and basically asking the Defense Department to submit a \nlist, and then give Congress the ability to say yes or no; and if we \nsaid yes, you would release the money. I think that might be an \ninteresting way to go about it. I commend that to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Texas to \ndelay for just a moment so we might seek a unanimous-consent agreement?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I am just wondering if we can have in place an agreement that the \nSenator from Texas would speak, and then the Senator from Minnesota \nwould proceed, and then I would like to have the chance to respond to \nthe remarks of the Senators from Arizona and Texas with respect to this \nlease agreement, because there is another side of this story that has \nnot been told that I think would be important for our colleagues to \nhear.\n  I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nWashington, that I be granted 10 minutes for myself, 10 minutes for the \nSenator from Washington, and that the Senator from Iowa--you would like \nhow much time? Five minutes. I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from Minnesota, I be recognized for \n10 minutes, the Senator from Washington be recognized for 10 minutes, \nand the Senator from Iowa be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nWellstone has 10 minutes under the order previously entered to speak. I \nwould ask that he be given that right as soon as the Senator from Texas \ncompletes her remarks.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is part of our request.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say, just so the Members here have some idea \nwhat is going on, we are going to be in a parliamentary situation, as \nsoon as this morning business talk is completed, to begin the offering \nof amendments.\n  There are a number of people who have expressed a desire to offer \namendments. Just to get this started someplace, the Senator from \nMinnesota would be recognized to offer his amendment following the \nstatement of the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but \nI would like to clarify, we have now added 25 minutes beyond the \noriginal unanimous consent. And my question, before this unanimous \nconsent goes forward, is, Would we be encroaching on the ability to get \ndirectly to the bill so that we can start the amendment process by \nadding this many extra minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to the Senator from Texas, the answer is yes. The \nSenator from Arizona has made a number of statements to which somebody \nhas to respond. Whether they do it now or at some later time, they will \nbe responded to. I thought this would be an appropriate time to get \ninto this. As soon as it is completed, we will get into the amendment \nprocess. There are other Senators--not too many--who have expressed a \ndesire to offer amendments. The first would be the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would just ask if we could assure that if we have \nthe capability to go directly to the bill, that that take precedence, \nand then all of us have the ability to speak in some shortened way to \nassure we can get onto the bill and start this amendment process. It \nwould seem that we would have plenty of time to be able to debate once \nwe are on the bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is, if the Senator would allow us to have this \nconsent agreement entered, I think it would expedite things a great \ndeal. We could get to the substance of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the consent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I don't understand the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Arizona, the Senator from Texas \nwill speak for 5 minutes; the Senator from North Dakota, 10 minutes; \nthe Senator from Washington, 10 minutes; the Senator from Iowa, 5 \nminutes. That would be following the Senator from Minnesota, who \nalready has 10 minutes. Then he would offer his amendment when the \nmorning business time is completed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Further reserving the right to object, does the Senator \nthen plan on voting on that amendment?\n  Mr. REID. We can do that. Whatever Senators Daschle and Lott decide. \nWe could either vote on that or someone else could offer an amendment \nand vote in a stacked fashion. Whatever the leadership decides.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, might I inquire what that \namendment is seeking to amend?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know. Do you mean what part of the bill?\n  Mr. KYL. We have the House bill before us at this point.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Arizona, what we thought would \nexpedite matters also, Senators Inouye and Stevens and Byrd are working \non a substitute. We have an agreement here that we put in so people \nwill just offer amendments. At such time as that substitute is entered, \nthey would apply. If somebody objects to that, we will just wait around \nuntil the substitute is done. We thought we could save time by doing \nthat.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would object. It seems to me we could talk \nabout the amendment. It is then a mere formality, once we know what it \nis we are amending, to simply lay down the amendments.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Arizona, we don't need permission \nto offer amendments. We can offer them. It doesn't take unanimous \nconsent to offer amendments.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I understand. What I am objecting to here is \nan order in which there would be a specific amendment that would be \npreferred to any others at the time there is a substitute offered.\n\n[[Page S12602]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that. Whoever gets the floor can offer an \namendment. If the Senator would rather play jump ball, that is fine. \nThe only part of the unanimous consent agreement I delete is the fact \nthat Senator Wellstone would be the first to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is now recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are \nbeginning to get down to the serious business of passing the Defense \nappropriations bill. I hope we will be able to do that, perhaps next \nweek. I don't know what the timetable will be. I don't want to stop the \namendment process because there are legitimate differences.\n  The bottom line is, the Defense appropriations bill must be passed, \nand it must be passed in a form that the President can sign it.\n  The President has shown the leadership. He has told the Senate what \nhis parameters are. He has made his budget submission to Congress so we \nknow what the President's priorities are. And further, he has said he \nis going to keep the agreement that he made with the Democratic leaders \nin the House and Senate about the upper limit of that bill. I think it \nis incumbent on us to work within that framework to pass a bill that \nthe President can sign.\n  This is a bill that will add $26 billion more to defense spending \nthan we passed last year. Today we are operating on last year's budget \nbecause the fiscal year ran out on October 1. So we are operating under \na smaller budget in a time of great need in our military. It is our \nresponsibility to pass a bill after our legitimate differences have \nbeen ironed out so our military will have the added $26 billion to \nfight this war. That is the bottom line.\n  I appreciate the differences. They are legitimate. But it is time for \nus to get onto the bill, discuss those differences, and have a game \nplan for when the bill can be finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurray of Washington, Senator Grassley of Iowa, and myself be permitted \nto go in front of Senator Wellstone. He himself has proposed this, so I \nknow it is OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to answer some of the charges \nmade by the Senator from Arizona with respect to this lease agreement \nbetween the Air Force and Boeing to acquire 100 Boeing 767s to replace \n100 of the aging KC-135 tanker aircraft for the U.S. Air Force.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas have suggested \nthat this is a matter of the appropriators requiring the Air Force to \nacquire planes that are not a priority for the U.S. Air Force. That is \nwrong. That is not even close to being right.\n  I know something about this, not because I am an appropriator, I am \nnot. I know something about it because, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, we saw in the appropriations bill a proposed lease agreement \nthat we did not regard as a true lease. So I became involved in this \neffort and learned a good deal about what is being discussed.\n  First, the Air Force is not required to lease planes from Boeing or \nanyone else. The statement of the Senator from Arizona that the Air \nForce is being required to lease planes from Boeing or anywhere else is \nsimply not true.\n  I direct my colleagues to the language that is before us:\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force may, from funds provided in \n     this act or any future appropriations act, establish a \n     multiyear pilot program for leasing general purpose aircraft \n     for tanker purposes.\n\n  That is what this is about. This is no requirement. This is an \nauthorization so that if the head of the Air Force determines it is in \nthe national interest to do so, they can acquire planes through the \nleasing process.\n  As I became involved in this matter, General Jumper, who is the head \nof the U.S. Air Force, called me personally on three occasions to say \nhow urgently needed these planes are.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas have suggested \nthe Air Force does not want these planes. The head of the Air Force, \nGeneral Jumper, called me on three occasions saying these planes are \ndesperately needed and asked me not to stop the acquisition through \nlease of these aircraft. General Jumper made this case to me.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not yield at this point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I did not think so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me complete my remarks and then I will be happy to \nyield to the Senator from Arizona. I say to the Senator from Arizona, I \nhope he will stay and listen because the Senator from Arizona provided \na good deal----\n  Mr. McCAIN. You do not want to answer a question and have a dialog. \nYou will not do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator, this is on my time. The Senator \nprovided a good deal of misinformation to our colleagues. It is \nunfortunate he does not want to hear the other side of the story.\n  General Jumper, who is the head of the Air Force, said to me the Air \nForce currently has 500 KC-135 tanker aircraft. The average age is 43 \nyears; 100 of the 500 planes are in the depot for repair at any one \ntime. Some have been in the depot for repair as long as 600 days.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas said this is not \na priority for the Air Force. I do not think they are right when the \nhead of the Air Force calls me and says it is an absolute priority. \nThey are talking about past history. They are talking about before the \nattack on this country that occurred on September 11.\n\n  General Jumper said to me: Senator, the attack has changed \neverything. We now have to fly air cover over 26 American cities. We \nare providing the air bridge for half a world away to Afghanistan. \nThese planes are being flown at an OPTEMPO that requires us to replace \nthem sooner than was anticipated.\n  This is the head of the Air Force, and the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Texas say it is not an Air Force priority? They better \ncall the Air Force and ask them what their priorities are, and they \nbetter talk about the priorities that exist now, not the priorities \nthat existed before this country was attacked.\n  The lease agreement that was proposed between the Air Force and \nBoeing did not meet our test for lease agreement. That is why I became \ninvolved. It is the only reason I know anything about this. As a \nresult, I convened a meeting on November 1 with the Air Force, the head \nof the Congressional Budget Office, the top management of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and the \nSenators from Washington to hear from OMB and CBO on their objections \nto this agreement. CBO and OMB said they would score this lease \nagreement not as a lease but as a purchase costing $22 billion. We then \nworked with the Congressional Budget Office to structure a true lease \nagreement.\n  The Senator from Arizona says to our colleagues this would cost five \ntimes as much as a direct acquisition. That is absolute sheer nonsense. \nThe fact is, to acquire these planes would cost $22 billion. To lease \nthe planes costs $20 billion. In the math that I learned in North \nDakota, $20 billion is less than $22 billion. Where the Senator from \nArizona ever came up with the wild claim that this costs five times as \nmuch as an acquisition is beyond me because it is absolutely not \naccurate.\n  When we come out on the floor, it seems to me we have some obligation \nto report accurately to our colleagues. I do not hold it against \nanybody to come out here and offer an amendment on any matter, but \nthere is some obligation to be accurate in reporting to our colleagues.\n  The only reason I got involved in this is because we saw a lease \nagreement that was truly not, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice and Office of Management and Budget, a lease. That is the reason \nI have learned what I have learned. But for the Senator from Arizona to \ncome out here and assert the Air Force does not want these planes is \nnot true. For him to assert that it is not a priority is not true. It \nmay have been the case before the war occurred, but it is not the case \nnow.\n\n[[Page S12603]]\n\n  The simple fact is, the head of the Air Force himself has called me \ndirectly on three occasions to talk about this specific issue and to \nask me not to block the acquisition of these planes, which I was \nprepared to do until they entered into what is, in fact, a lease \nagreement, a lease agreement that costs less than acquiring these \nplanes directly.\n  As I have indicated, the head of the Air Force said to me, these \nplanes are urgently needed in the national security interest of the \nUnited States of America. That is what General Jumper said to me on \nrepeated occasions. I hope when we vote on this matter, we vote based \non facts.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is my understanding I have 10 minutes under the time \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas be \nallowed 3 minutes, and the Senator from Washington be allowed 2 minutes \nfollowing my remarks, before the Senator from Iowa, on the same topic \nwe are now discussing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. What does the Chair mean without objection? The Chair \ndid not ask if there was any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Washington restate the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas \nhave 3 minutes, and the Senator from Washington 2 minutes, before the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I hope it is after because I informed the Senator from \nKansas I wanted to be out of here by 2:30 p.m.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. She only had 10 minutes to begin with.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am sorry. If it is out of the 10 minutes of the \nSenator from Washington, that is OK.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Kansas have 3 \nminutes, and the Senator from Washington State have 2 minutes on the \ntopic of the 767s.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the Budget Committee chair, for his strong remarks \nfollowing the comments from the Senator from Arizona on the lease \nprovisions of the 767s that are in the Defense bill before us.\n  I am extremely concerned for our country, for our military and, of \ncourse, for my own home State. In my home State, we have Fairchild Air \nForce Base which is home to the 92nd Air Refueling Wing. There are \napproximately 60 air refueling tankers that are based at that base \noutside of Spokane, WA.\n  I have been to Fairchild. I have visited personally with the \nfamilies. I know the difficult missions these crews handle for each one \nof us every day, and I have the utmost respect for what they do.\n  I should also mention, in September some of these crews and these \ntankers were deployed in our military effort. So when the Air Force \ntells me, and they have told us, and tells Congress, and they have told \nCongress, that replacing the old KC-135 tankers is critical, I know it \nis important and my constituents know it is important. My State is home \nto Boeing, which would build the tanker replacements.\n  My friend from Arizona suggests the Senate should reject this \nproposal simply because it would benefit the manufacturer of the \nplanes. Well, that argument ignores the facts. These tankers are the \noldest planes in our fleet. They cost a fortune to maintain and they \nare often down for repairs. Since September 11, we rely on them more \nthan before. We are going to have to replace these aging tankers \nanyway, and if we do it now, we will save at least $5.9 billion in \nmaintenance and upgrades on these antiquated tankers. This is something \nthe Air Force has been concerned about for years.\n  It is clear we need to take immediate action to upgrade our \noverburdened tanker fleet, but do not take my word for it. Listen to \nwhat the Secretary of the Air Force, James Roche, wrote to me: The KC-\n135 fleet is the backbone of our Nation's global reach, but with an \naverage age of over 41 years, coupled with the increasing expense \nrequired to maintain them, it is readily apparent we must start \nreplacing these critical assets.\n  He ends: I strongly endorse beginning to upgrade this critical \nwarfighting capability with the new Boeing 767 tanker aircraft.\n  That is from the Air Force Secretary, James Roche.\n  Will this help the people of my State? Absolutely. Because of the \nlayoffs at Boeing since September 11 and the slowdown of our economy, \nmy State now has the highest unemployment of any State in this Nation. \nThe people I represent are hurting, and I am going to do everything I \ncan to help them.\n  This is not just about my State. Every State involved in aircraft \nproduction will benefit. Even the home State of my friend from Arizona \nwould stand to gain if this program moves forward. It is in our \nnational interest to keep our only commercial aircraft manufacturer \nhealthy in tough times, to keep that capacity, and to keep that skill \nset.\n  The Air Force has identified this as a critical need. Our ability to \nproject force, to protect our shores, and to pursue terrorists in \nAfghanistan and around the world depends on our fighter aircraft and \nbombers being able to stay in the air for long periods of time, and \nthat is only possible through in-flight refueling.\n  Right now in the Afghanistan campaign, we rely on air refueling \ntankers known as KC-135s. In fact, since September 11, our use of these \ntankers is up significantly. We rely on these tankers to refuel our \nfighters over Afghanistan. We rely on them to refuel our B-2 and B-52 \nbombers on long-range missions. We rely on them to refuel the planes \nthat view our troops in the region. Right now, in the skies over this \nCapitol Building and cities across America, we are relying on them to \nrefuel the planes that are flying combat air patrols for homeland \nsecurity.\n  There are very real problems with our existing fleet of tankers. They \nare old. The KC-135s were first delivered in 1957. On average, they are \n41 years old, and we are paying for it. They have been around longer \nthan most of the people who are flying them. These tankers are too \nexpensive to maintain. A 41-year-old aircraft runs on parts that are \nnot commercially available. Corrosion is a significant problem. In \nfact, KC-135s spend 400 days in major depot maintenance every 5 years.\n  This is an essential program. We will save $5.9 billion in upgrade \nand maintenance costs. By moving forward with this program, we can save \n$5.9 billion. These numbers come not from me but from the U.S. Air \nForce.\n  This is a longstanding need, and it is made even more urgent by 9-11. \nI want to be clear. This is a serious need that was identified by the \nU.S. Air Force long before September 11. It is not a new idea, but \ngiven the ongoing war and the new challenges we face with homeland \nsecurity, it is clear we need to speed up the procurement process \nbecause relying on these planes is what we are doing after September \n11. We have worked hard for these provisions.\n  I commend the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii, who \nare managing this bill, who have worked long and hard hours to come \ntogether with an agreement on the critical replacement of these KC-135s \nwith the new tankers. I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Domenici, the \nchair, and ranking member of our Budget Committee, who have worked long \nand hard also. I recognize my colleague from Washington, Senator \nCantwell, who, too, has spent many hours sitting in Senators' offices \nexplaining to them the need both from the Air Force and from our home \nState.\n\n  This is a critical program. It is the right way to do it. We have \nworked out a consensus among everyone who moves this program forward \nand, most importantly, it is for the men and women who serve us in the \nAir Force.\n  When I go home when this session is over, and I go to one of our Air \nForce bases in my home State of Washington, I want to be able to look \nin the eyes of those young men and women we are sending a continent \naway to defend and protect all of us and say we have done\n\n[[Page S12604]]\n\neverything we can to make sure they are safe when they are in the air. \nThat is what this provision does.\n  When the Senator from Arizona offers his amendment, I hope my \ncolleagues remember the men and women who are serving this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to give a status report on the \nnegotiations of the economic stimulus. I report to the Senate as the \nlone Republican Senate negotiator.\n  Yesterday's Roll Call quotes numerous Democratic Senators as saying \nSenate Democrats won't agree to any stimulus deal unless the package \nhas the support of two-thirds of the Democratic caucus. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Roll Call December 6, 2001]\n\n     Democrats Set Stimulus Hurdle; Senators Require Supermajority\n\n                             (By Paul Kane)\n\n       Setting a high threshold for negotiating an economic-\n     stimulus package, Senate Democrats have decided they will not \n     accept any deal unless roughly two-thirds of their caucus \n     agrees to support the final product.\n       Before agreeing to begin bipartisan, bicameral negotiations \n     on a final stimulus plan, Majority Leader Thomas Daschle \n     (S.D.) told his caucus last week that Democratic Senators in \n     the House-Senate conference would not agree to a stimulus \n     deal if there was significant opposition from within \n     Democratic ranks.\n       ``They're not going to agree to anything unless a \n     significant majority of the caucus agrees with it,'' said \n     Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Budget Committee \n     and a Finance Committee member. ``It's got to be a \n     significant majority, two-thirds of the caucus.''\n       Other Democratic Senators confirmed that the high bar for a \n     stimulus deal was set around a two-thirds majority, although \n     some said Daschle left wiggle room in case he feels the deal \n     is good and he doesn't have precisely that much support.\n       ``I don't think it's a hard-and-fast number,'' said Sen. \n     John Breaux (D-La.), a senior Finance member.\n       Breaux said he remained hopeful that a deal could be \n     reached that would gain enough Democratic support for a final \n     package, but added, ``It's going to be tough.''\n       Asked about the threshold for reaching a deal, Sen. Jim \n     Jeffords (I-Vt.) said, ``It's a high one.''\n       Negotiations continued yesterday among six key lawmakers \n     trying to hammer out a stimulus deal: Senate Finance Chairman \n     Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va) and \n     Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member on Finance; House \n     Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.); House \n     Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas); and Rep. Charlie Rangel \n     (D-N.Y.), ranking member on Ways and Means.\n       Although some progress was reported on those talks, Senate \n     Republicans worried that the Democrats were setting an \n     impossible bar for reaching a deal and openly questioned \n     whether Baucus' caucus colleagues trust the Montana Senator, \n     who helped Grassley write a $1.3 trillion tax cut last \n     spring.\n       ``I would hope we would not put [in place] this artificial \n     threshold that is almost impossible to achieve,'' said Sen. \n     Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), a key moderate on Finance. ``Why do \n     that? To set up failure? I hope not.''\n       Snowe said the narrow margin in the Senate gave neither \n     side the right to predetermine how many votes would come from \n     their caucus, but rather mandated that negotiators shoot for \n     a deal that cobbles together 51 votes, or 60 if needed to \n     break a filibuster. ``That is the essential marker here,'' \n     she said.\n       An aide to Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     indirectly suggested that Daschle and Democrats simply don't \n     trust Baucus. ``Senator Lott has said this before and he'll \n     say it again: He has every confidence in Senator Grassley's \n     ability to negotiate a real economic security package on \n     behalf of Senate Republicans,'' said Ron Bonjean, Lott's \n     spokesman.\n       Baucus drew the ire of many Democrats when he and Grassley \n     co-wrote the Senate tax package, most of which became law. On \n     final passage, the bill was supported by just 12 Democrats. \n     In the process, Baucus received numerous tongue lashings from \n     colleagues at Democratic caucus meetings, including one \n     exchange in which Daschle told Baucus he did not have ``the \n     authority'' to negotiate a deal with Grassley.\n       Conrad acknowledged that requiring a caucus supermajority \n     for the stimulus deal was ``unusual'', but said the \n     circumstances in this negotiation--not the party's faith in \n     Baucus--necessitated setting the high threshold. Conrad \n     recalled Senate Democrats setting similar bars for approval \n     of year-end budget deals in the early 1990s, including the \n     1990 compromise struck with the first Bush administration.\n       ``We've not had an ending to a session quite like this \n     one,'' Conrad said, noting that the Sept. 11 attacks, anthrax \n     letters and a worsening recession have contributed to leaving \n     Congress months behind in finishing up its business. ``It's \n     important that the caucus be behind any deal. We're not going \n     to sign up to anything unless a substantial majority agree.''\n       Conrad noted that it was both Daschle and Baucus who made \n     the pledge to the caucus that a two-thirds majority would be \n     required for a deal--a promise made at a caucus meeting held \n     last Thursday to discuss the stimulus negotiations.\n       Jeffords, who caucuses with Democrats, said the feeling was \n     that the stimulus plan was so crucial that everyone agreed a \n     wide consensus was needed, not that the Senators needed any \n     check on Baucus. ``Max is doing a good job. I haven't heard \n     anybody complaining.''\n       Aides to Baucus agreed that the caucus is unified in this \n     approach, noting that his plan to expand unemployment and \n     health care benefits and reduce some business taxes had \n     unanimous support in the body.\n       ``We're hopeful that the package we negotiate is one that \n     reflects the solid core principles we've been talking about \n     since the beginning of this debate,'' said Michael Siegel, \n     Baucus' spokesman.\n       Other Democrats contended that the bigger problem with \n     negotiations is trying to forge a compromise with the House \n     Republican plan, which is primarily titled toward business \n     taxes. Digging in for a fight, Senate Democrats from both \n     wings of the caucus said they would rather kill the stimulus \n     plan than give away too large a corporate tax break.\n       ``The better alternative may be no bill at all,'' said Sen. \n     Robert Torricelli (N.J.), one of the 12 Democrats to support \n     the tax-cut bill in the spring. ``I would rather see that \n     money stay in the treasury.''\n       ``I would rather see no stimulus than that,'' said Sen. \n     Dick Durbin (Ill.), an assistant floor leader to Daschle.\n       Durbin said it was increasingly doubtful that a stimulus \n     plan would pass, considering there are just two weeks left \n     before the Christmas break. He noted it took a week to lay \n     the ground rules for the conference and determine who would \n     take part.\n       ``Do the math. We took a week to set the table and say who \n     would sit where,'' he said.\n       Not a negotiator himself, Daschle has set up a system to \n     monitor the talks, including Breaux, a key moderate, in \n     postconference meetings in his office with Baucus, \n     Rockefeller and possibly Rangel.\n       Before substantive talks began this week, Rockefeller \n     signaled that he intended to take a very hard line on the \n     package. ``I'm not much of a compromiser,'' he said.\n       But Baucus believes that moves by Thomas this week to offer \n     unemployment extensions were a sign of compromises to come, \n     Siegel said. ``It's clear that we're making progress.''\n       The entire Democratic caucus, however, will be the final \n     jury on that outcome. ``It was a commitment people wanted to \n     hear,'' Torricelli said of the two-thirds majority decision.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As a preliminary comment, I want everyone to know \nsomething loud and clear. We are all here to do the peoples' business. \nMy Republican caucus is here to do the peoples' business. We are in an \nextraordinary time. Our Nation is at war. Our Commander in Chief, \nPresident Bush, is occupied with the war effort. Our responsibilities \nto the people that sent us here are always high, but, extraordinarily \nhigh in this time of war. This is not a time to play political games \nwith the people's business. In my view, we have a high duty to deliver \na legislative product to the President on economic stimulus and aid to \ndislocated workers. I have committed all of my energy to get to the \ngoal line on a package. I believe my chairman, Senator Baucus, also \nsincerely wants a stimulus package that the President can sign. When \nyou look at the record, however, I am doubtful the Senate Democratic \nleadership really wants a package.\n  The President took the lead by proposing economic stimulus measures \nand a package of aid to dislocated workers. Chairman Greenspan gave us \na green light on this effort about 2 months ago. The House passed a \nbill that the Senate Democrats, with some justification, viewed as \npartisan. The Senate Democratic leadership then responded with its own \npartisan bill, shut out all Republicans, and rammed it through the \nFinance Committee on a party-line vote. That partisan stimulus package \ndead-ended here on the Senate floor. We were stuck on in a partisan rut \nfor awhile.\n  After much negotiation, the House and Senate leadership on both sides \nagreed to an extraordinary procedure. It is what I would call a ``quasi \nconference.'' This agreement contemplates a conference agreement even \nthough the Senate did not pass a bill on the subject matter. This \nagreement was a major concession by the House to Senator Daschle's \ninsistence that Democrats have only one negotiation. Keep\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\nin mind Senator Daschle insisted on one negotiation with a partisan \nproduct that has not passed the Senate because it was designed to be \npartisan. Republicans accommodated the Senate Democratic leadership. \nAfter that agreement was reached, I felt some optimism. It seemed that \nall sides realized it is our job to get this legislative product to the \nPresident. My optimism was a bit premature.\n  Now, there has been a lot of speculation about whether the Senate \nDemocratic leadership really wants a stimulus deal. Some say that, \ninspired by Democratic interest groups and strategists, the Senate \nDemocratic leadership has concluded that it is better to have an issue. \nThe speculation is that, armed with polling data, the Senate Democratic \nleadership has decided on a strategy of covertly killing a stimulus \npackage, while maintaining a public profile of support. If the economy \ndoesn't recover, better to save the issue to use against the President \nand the other side for the fall 2002 elections. If the economy does \nrecover, from a political standpoint, what is lost. Better to wait and \nsee, the speculation runs, than to give any more tax relief at this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, such a strategy, if it is the case, is particularly \ndisappointing in wartime. It is a cynical strategy. If true, it short \nchanges American workers and struggling business for an anticipated \npolitical shot. It makes economy recovery and aid to dislocated workers \nsecondary to a partisan political objective. I ask, is that how we \nought to be operating in wartime? Though I have heard and read this \nspeculation, I had hoped that it was not true.\n  So, let's say I was a bit shocked when I read the Roll Call article \nyesterday. After reading the article, I concluded Democratic leaders \nare traveling back in time. They are regressing, not progressing. They \nare regressing to earlier contentions that the stimulus package had to \nbe a Democratic product or nothing at all. I thought we had moved past \nthat and on to negotiations to build a bipartisan stimulus package.\n  Instead, it appears the Democratic leaders don't want any real \ncompromise. First, they have engineered a nearly impossible threshold. \nSecond, they are conducting what appear to be required consultations \nbetween the Democratic negotiators and the rest of the Democratic \ncaucus. If they are trying to prevent a stimulus deal, this is the way \nto do it.\n  It is important to remember the Senate is split nearly down the \nmiddle. There are 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and one Independent. \nYet the litmus test set up by the Democratic leadership ignores the \nSenate's makeup. By its terms, this litmus test is designed to limit \nany agreement to a Democrats-only deal. Because it ignores the reality \nof an evenly split Senate, this litmus test guarantees failure. If the \nDemocratic leaders really mean what they say, that they want a stimulus \nbill, I ask them to remove the partisan litmus test.\n  Any litmus test ought to go to the substance of the package.\n  Let's get back to the substance. We're not that far apart. Let's not \nhold the stimulus package and the aid to dislocated workers hostage to \nan arbitrary and destructive test like the two-thirds rule. I have been \nflexible on Republican priorities. It is time for the Democratic \nleadership to show some flexibility on Democratic priorities. The first \nsign of flexibility will be to remove a barrier, the two-thirds rule, \nthat guarantees failure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me ask first, I thought I was granted 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I actually thought it was 4; I was not quite sure. If it \nis 3, then my 3 minutes would be protected, as I understand it. If the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona would like to precede me, I am \nperfectly happy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized. I had time \nremaining on the time previously granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I listened with interest to the \ncomments, and I am sure there will be future comments, but these are \nthe following facts on the airplane. One, on the acquisition of the \n767, there is no formal request for it. Two, I had a conversation with \nthe Secretary of Defense yesterday. He did not know about this. There \nhas been no request from the administration, a formal request. Of \ncourse the Air Force would like it. We are talking about numbers. We \ncan argue about how much it costs, but at the end of 10 years the \nplanes go back to Boeing. At the end of 10 years, the planes go back to \nBoeing.\n  How in the world can you justify such a thing? The average age of the \ntankers is 42 years. I am sure these tankers would be eligible for at \nleast 20 or 30 years of service.\n  Have some competition. Why isn't anyone else allowed to bid on this \nairplane? It is solely a bailout for the Boeing aircraft company. It is \nnot in President Bush's defense request for the fiscal year. September \n11 did not rearrange the priorities so it is a top 60 priorities. Of \ncourse, the Air Force will accept a gift. I am sure they would be glad \nto have it. They have other priorities they stated in testimony before \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  I cannot understand why at least there shouldn't be a hearing on a \n$20 billion acquisition, which at the end of 10 years, after the \nreengineering and the $1.2 billion for a hangar, gives it all back to \nthe Boeing aircraft company when we should keep tankers, and have been \nkeeping them, for as long as 20 or 30 years. Remarkable.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from Alaska. I will address the three \nissues of concern raised by the Senator from Arizona.\n  First, with regard to the fact that the Secretary of Defense, \naccording to the Senator from Arizona, knows absolutely nothing about \nit, it seems to me when the Secretary of the Air Force and General \nJumper have been paying personal calls not only to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota but to me, as well, and I have a letter here from the \nSecretary of the Air Force that says: ``I appreciate your interest in \njump-starting the replacement program for our venerable KC-135 tanker \nfleet. These critical aircraft,'' and he goes into the fact this is \nabsolutely essential to the expeditionary force of the United States, \nespecially in Kosovo and Afghanistan--he says: I strongly endorse \nbeginning to upgrade this critical war-fighting capability with new \nBoeing 767 aircraft; I very much appreciate your support; your interest \nand support are crucial; he indicates this whole effort is absolutely \ncrucial--I cannot imagine that the Secretary of the Air Force, both he \nand General Jumper would be taking action and recommending this in an \nopen letter to Congress without the knowledge of the Secretary of \nDefense. If that is the case, we have a real communication problem.\n  I would like to say that in terms of the cost, the estimate by the \nAir Force, they save $3 billion. As to leasing or buying, we don't have \nmoney to buy them now, but we sure have the mission. That is like \ntelling everybody in America: I am sorry, you can't lease a car.\n  At the end of the 10 years, I am aware that Boeing could take back \nthe airplanes, and I am aware of the fact that then the Air Force or \nthe Department of Defense could actually purchase this aircraft at a \nmuch lesser price.\n  Why will the Air Force say that the cost savings will be $3 billion? \nLook at maintenance. Look at the depot maintenance today. Fifteen \npercent of our flights are tied up in depot maintenance. If Boeing does \nthis, then that is cut to something like 30 days every 8 years. So we \nare saving money there.\n  In regard to competition with reference to Airbus and Boeing, I don't \nknow where Airbus would do the maintenance. Boeing has a tremendous \nrecord with over 2,000 aircraft now serving nationwide.\n  If we want to preserve the expeditionary capability that we must have \nin this new asymmetrical war in this new era in which we are fighting, \nit seems to me this represents a cost saving. It also represents \nsomething the Air Force wants, and it represents a way we can really \nupgrade their aircraft.\n  I do not know how much time I have, but I think I made my point.\n\n[[Page S12606]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Kansas indicated he has a letter from \nthe Secretary of the Air Force specifically requesting these planes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Norman Dicks,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Dicks: I appreciate your interest in jump-starting \n     the replacement program for our venerable KC-135 tanker \n     fleet. These critical aircraft, which are the backbone of our \n     nation's Global Reach capability, have an average age of over \n     41 years and are becoming more and more expensive to \n     maintain. Due to the effects of age, these aircraft are \n     spending over 300 days on average in depot maintenance, which \n     affects our ability to respond to the many global demands on \n     our force.\n       I strongly endorse beginning to upgrade this critical \n     warfighting capability with new Boeing 767 aircraft. If \n     Congress provides the needed supporting language, we could \n     initiate this program through an operating lease with an \n     option to purchase the aircraft in the future. This leasing \n     approach will allow more rapid retirement and replacement of \n     the KC-135Es. However, if the Congress determines this \n     approach is not advisable, completing the upgrade through the \n     purchase of new 767 airframes beginning in FY 02 will be in \n     the best interest of the Air Force. To implement this \n     transition, we intend to work with the USD(AT) and the OSD \n     Comptroller to amend the FY 03 budget currently being vetted \n     through the Department.\n       From the warfighter's perspective, this initiative could \n     provide the opportunity to expand our tanker vision from air \n     refueling and limited airlift to include other key mission \n     areas. We intend to consider elements of command and control, \n     as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n     (ISR) for the KC-X--in other words, a smart tanker. This \n     initiative will further enhance our efforts to expedite \n     development and fielding of a Joint Stars Radar Technology \n     Improvement Program on a 767 multi-mission command and \n     control aircraft platform which we are hopeful the Congress \n     will also expedite in the FY 02 Appropriations Act.\n       I very much appreciate your support in the FY 02 \n     Appropriations Act as we work to upgrade our overburdened \n     tanker and ISR fleets. Your interest and support are crucial \n     as we move forward with this critical recapitalization \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      James Roche.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Arizona asserts that we are forcing \nthese planes on the Air Force. Was the Senator from Kansas ever \ncontacted by General Jumper or the Air Force and asked to support \nproviding these planes to the Air Force?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is absolutely correct. I had that conversation with \nthe Air Force. As a matter of fact, the people who really initiated \nthis discussion with me were actually members of the Air Force.\n  The Senator from Arizona has asked me to point out that this letter I \nam reading from the Secretary addressed to Congressman Norman Dicks did \nnot represent a formal request. But in the meetings with the Air Force \nand in writing to individual Members of Congress, which Mr. Dicks \nprovided the members of the Armed Services Committee in the House, I \nthink it speaks very clearly that the Air Force does want this program \nand does want the leasing program to start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Kansas has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I, too, rise with my colleague, the \nSenator from Washington, who has done an outstanding job on the \nAppropriations Committee to steer this issue through the process which \nis both sound policy and very important for the State of Washington.\n  I also thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Inouye, and the \nranking member for understanding the complexity of this problem.\n  What is at hand is a bipartisan effort where the committee has \nrecognized the glaring Achilles' heel in our Nation's military \npreparedness. They developed a creative solution. We currently have an \nair fleet that is older than most of the pilots who fly them. With 546 \nair tankers in the fleet, the average age is 36 years, and the oldest \nplane is over 45. These planes were initially designed to have a 25-\nyear lifespan. They are showing extreme wear and tear.\n  My colleague from Kansas entered into the Record a letter that shows \nthe military, while being open and flexible, thought this idea was a \nsound way to provide tankers. Obviously, the amount of wear and tear on \nthe aging tanker fleet is causing a lot of problems and increased \nmaintenance costs. Indeed, the Air Force is projecting a 42-percent \nincrease--over $3 billion--in the next 30 years for maintenance in this \narea.\n  Compounding the problem is the decreased availability in a time of \nincreased demand. We are also not just facing issues overseas, as \nmentioned by my colleague from Washington, but also a new mission on \nthe homeland front in our Nation's security--defending our Nation's \nairspace. That requires the use of these crucial tankers. Without \neffective tanker force, our air superiority is wrecked.\n  This is a creative solution at a time when the need is great. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this great bipartisan and common effort.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is there any time left in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the time of the Senator from Minnesota, \nand 2 minutes 54 seconds for the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say again on this issue that the Air \nForce has not made a formal request for this aircraft, No. 1. I am sure \nthey would love to have it. It is not a bad deal.\n  The most important point is, the Senator from North Dakota has some \nnumbers which make it less expensive to lease than to buy. I accept the \nnumbers from the Senator from North Dakota, although I still disagree. \nThere is a huge difference. You buy the airplanes, and you have them \nforever. There is no 10-year lease.\n  What would happen after 10 years? We would have to renew the lease or \nwe would have to buy new airplanes. We are talking about a 10-year \nlease at practically the same amount of money it would take to buy \nthem. That to me is absolute insanity.\n  The U.S. Air Force has 60 priorities which they submit to Congress \nevery year. September 11 couldn't have changed that priority list very \nmuch, since it will be 2004 or 2005 before the first one of those \naircraft is delivered.\n  This is a bailout for Boeing Aircraft--nothing more, nothing less. \nAnd there should at least be some competition. There should be a fair \nscrutiny of this issue. There should be hearings in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee when we are talking about $20 billion or $30 billion \nof the taxpayer moneys to be spent.\n  That is really the reason and the compelling argument why this system \nhas to be repaired, which is so broken that at the 11th hour we put $20 \nbillion or $30 billion worth of the taxpayers' money on an aircraft \nwith a major policy decision, without a single hearing and without a \nsingle input from the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which I am \nproud to serve.\n  This is the wrong thing to do. And, clearly, we are going to spend \n$20 billion-plus over a 10-year period and 10 years from now have \nnothing to show for it. We could buy the airplanes. The average age for \nthese tankers, regrettably, is 42 years. We could have them for another \n30 years if we bought them.\n  Instead, we are going to lease them for 10 years at practically the \nsame price it would cost to buy them with no competition, no hearings, \nno scrutiny--no nothing but a request from the Secretary of the Air \nForce, to Norman Dicks.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of my friend from Minnesota, I \nyield his 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the fact \nthat a substitute has not been offered, that if any amendment is agreed \nto prior to the consideration of the substitute amendment, it be in \norder for these amendments to be inserted in the appropriate place in \nthe substitute amendment upon its completion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, am I \ncorrect that would mean that Members could offer amendments to, say, \nany\n\n[[Page S12607]]\n\nportion of the Defense bill as reported by the committee?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not object. I wish I could find a way, though, to \nnow start putting some time limit on these amendments.\n  Mr. REID. If we could get this entered, I think the process would \nbegin quickly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know of no parliamentary way right now that we can \nimpose a time limit. I would like a time limit, if we are going to \nfinish these amendments tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I will work with the Senator from Alaska to see what we can \naccomplish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I don't understand.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to read the unanimous consent request. \nThis has been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous consent, \nnotwithstanding the fact that a substitute amendment has not been \noffered, if any amendment is agreed to prior to the consideration of \nthe substitute amendment, it be in order for these amendments to be \ninserted in the appropriate place in the substitute amendment upon its \ncompletion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I might ask the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \ndoes this mean amendments will be offered at this time with votes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. This is an effort, while the staff is working on the \nsubstitute, for people who have had longstanding desires to offer \namendments; they would be able to do so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Nevada anticipate the amendments \nand bill will be voted on today?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat if a person wants to strike, say, a provision--say the tanker \nprovision from section A of the substitute--that amendment could be \noffered now, debated now, and voted on now. When the substitute is \nfiled, it would be so amended; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. REID. To my understanding, the Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2325\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Wellstone, Gregg, Dayton, Durbin, Leahy, Biden, Carper, and \nReid of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Wellstone, for \n     himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2325.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To treat certain National Guard duty as military service \n       under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. 8135. Section 101(1) of the Soldiers' and Sailors' \n     Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. App. 511(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``and all'' and inserting ``all''; and\n       (B) by inserting before the period the following: ``, and \n     all members of the National Guard on duty described in the \n     following sentence''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence, by inserting before the period \n     the following: ``, and, in the case of a member of the \n     National Guard, shall include training or other duty \n     authorized by section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, \n     at the request of the President, for or in support of an \n     operation during a war or national emergency declared by the \n     President or Congress''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the whip for offering the amendment.\n  Let me say to colleagues, I want to move forward. I am in your \ncompany. We have worked hard on this amendment. I think we have a lot \nof strong bipartisan support. I think it is definitely, as they say, \nthe right thing to do. I thank all of my sponsors: my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Dayton, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Biden, Senator Leahy, and Senator Carper. And I believe \nthere will be others.\n  This amendment amends the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to \nexpand the protections of that act to National Guard personnel who are \ntoday protecting our Nation's airports and other vulnerable public \nfacilities. Specifically, this amendment would provide civic relief to \nNational Guard personnel mobilized by State Governors at the request of \nthe President, in support of Operation Noble Eagle and potential future \noperations.\n  This amendment has the support of the Military Coalition, which is a \nconsortium of 33 nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans \norganizations, representing more than 5.5 million current and former \nmembers of the seven uniformed services, plus their families and \nsurvivors, as well as the support of the Minnesota National Guard.\n  The operative language here is, we are trying to provide this civic \nrelief and protection for the Guard who are called out at the request \nof the President--this is the key language of the amendment, \ncolleagues--for and in support of an operation during a war or national \nemergency declared by the President or the Congress.\n  This Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, which I think was \npassed in 1940, is important legislation which helps provide help to \npeople who have taken on financial burdens without knowing they would \nbe called up to serve in the military.\n  Today those people are men and women in our National Guard. They are \ncalled up to protect our Nation's airports--you see them out there--\nnuclear facilities, and a good number of them are going to be going to \nthe northern border to protect us at the border.\n  Men and women of the National Guard serve the Nation and our States \nas a unique organization among all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. \nThe Guard is America's community-based defense force located in more \nthan 2,700 cities and towns throughout the Nation. Some 60 of these \nunits are in my home State, Senator Dayton's home State, Minnesota.\n  Let me talk about what is at issue. When our men and women serve our \ncountry, they may have built up financial obligations of one kind or \nanother--such as a mortgage on their homes, debts related to buying \ncars, charge account debts from buying things with credit, you name it. \nWhat the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civic Relief Act does--and what this \nwould do as applied to our Guard--is not wipe out any of these debts or \nfinancial obligations by people who are faced with being called up on \nactive duty, but it does give them certain protections.\n  This is one of them. First of all, on the consumer debt--which is now \n6 percent that goes to all other men and women who are now in the \nservice protecting our country--there is a 6-percent ceiling that is \ncharged.\n  Second, this is important because these members of the Guard, they \nare like us; they bought things on credit, and they have had the jobs \nthat allowed them to pay off their debt, but now what has happened is \nthey are out there at our airports or nuclear facilities--soon they \nwill be on the northern border patrol--and they have taken pay cuts to \nprotect our public facilities. But they do not have the same amount of \nincome now, and they cannot necessarily cashflow, certainly, exorbitant \ninterest rates. This just gives them the civic protection.\n\n  In other words, if they have been called out to duty by the \nPresident--and the President has called the Guard out to duty, but he \nhas done it through the Governors--this just says, when the President \nsays: ``We need the Guard, it is a national emergency, we are at war,'' \nand the Guard is called up through the Governors, they get the same \nprotection that goes to any other Guard members or any other members of \nour Armed Forces who are out there protecting us.\n  Also, they will get protection from being evicted from their homes. \nAnd they will get protection from being foreclosed on. They will get \nprotection against the cancellation of life insurance.\n  The problem is, unfortunately, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil \nRelief Act right now only applies to National Guard personnel mobilized \ndirectly by the President of the United States, and\n\n[[Page S12608]]\n\nit does not protect those men and women who are mobilized by our \nGovernors at the request of the President, as is the case with many of \nthe Guard right now.\n  This distinction, colleagues, is inequitable. Those mobilized by a \nGovernor at the request of the President face the same financial \nproblems as those mobilized by the President directly. It is only right \nthat they receive the same protections.\n  The Minneapolis Star Tribune, on Sunday, November 25, had a long \nstory on the financial impact on Minnesota Guard members; but this \napplies to Guard members in every one of our States. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Star Tribune article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Nov. 25, 2001]\n\n                          (By Sarah McKenzie)\n\n       Washington, DC.--When National Guard Cpl. Paul Dellwo was \n     called up to patrol the Minneapolis-St. Paul International \n     Airport, he traded in his police officer salary for a smaller \n     $1,600 monthly paycheck.\n       Dellwo, 30, said he's committed to his post, but now he's \n     earning about $1,000 less each month than he did as an \n     officer with a Twin Cities area police force that does not \n     continue paying those called to active duty.\n       ``Within the next month or so it will be become extremely \n     tight,'' said Dellwo, who has credit card, tuition and \n     mortgage payments to make.\n       He's got plenty of company. Capt. Charles Kemper, who \n     oversees the Guard at the Twin Cities airport, said some \n     Guard members are ``so financially strapped'' that he has \n     considered taking a half-dozen of them off of active duty.\n       On behalf of members of his unit, Kemper sought grants from \n     the Red Cross. He also has called banks and lenders to urge \n     them to defer payment deadlines or reduce interest rates \n     until the soldiers have completed their deployments. About a \n     third of them have agreed to do so, Kemper said.\n       The issue has captured the attention of Minnesota Sens. \n     Paul Wellstone and Mark Dayton, who are promoting a bill that \n     would provide financial protection for Guard members who are \n     activated.\n       Among other things, the law would prohibit lenders from \n     charging more than 6 percent interest on existing loans, and \n     it would make it illegal to evict Guard members from rental \n     or mortgaged property. Any civil action pending against the \n     soldiers, such as divorces, custody disputes or foreclosure, \n     would be delayed until the end of the deployment, under the \n     bill.\n       Members of the Guard ``are left without protection against \n     financial ruin,'' said Wellstone, who plans to meet with \n     Guard members Monday at the Twin Cities airport to talk about \n     their economic troubles.\n       Minnesota's senators are not the only members of Congress \n     who are interested in the issue. In the House, Rep. Gil \n     Gutknecht, R-Minn., has written letters to the House \n     Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services committees urging \n     legislators to extend the same benefits.\n\n\n                          exemption questioned\n\n       The legislation takes issue with a current federal law, \n     known as the Sailors' and Soldiers' Relief Act. National \n     Guard members are covered under the law only if they are \n     activated by the president. But those protecting the nation's \n     airports were called up by governors, after President Bush \n     made the request in late September.\n       The exemption troubles many of the 176 Guard members \n     patrolling the state's airports, even though some are faring \n     well or better now than they did with their civilian jobs.\n       ``There's a wide spectrum,'' Kemper said.\n       Kemper said his employer, Guidant Corp., a medical devices \n     company in Arden Hills, has agreed to pay the difference in \n     his salaries. As captain, he makes about $4,200 a month in \n     base pay, but as an engineer at Guidant he makes more than \n     $5,200 a month, he said.\n       Others are trying to figure out how to get by with less.\n       As an Internet sales manager working on commission for an \n     automotive company, Craig Ford pulled in as much as $15,000 \n     during a good month.\n       Now, Ford, 29, of the West St. Paul Guard unit, earns \n     $2,600 a month as a specialist with the Army National Guard.\n       The gap in pay is wide for Ford, who is married and has two \n     children, 5-month-old Mira and 2-year-old Dawson. But he said \n     he recognized there could be financial hardships when he \n     volunteered for the Guard on Sept. 29.\n       ``I wouldn't have signed up if my family couldn't have \n     handled it,'' he said.\n\n\n                           salary differences\n\n       Plymouth-based Employers Association Inc., which provides \n     management services to more than 1,700 businesses in the \n     state, recently conducted a survey showing most Minnesota \n     employers have policies to not pay Guard reservists called \n     into active duty.\n       But bigger companies were more apt to pay the difference \n     between the company's and the Guard's salaries. Of the 300 \n     companies surveyed that have more than 500 employees, about \n     half reported paying the difference. Of the smaller \n     companies, about 30 percent reported paying the difference.\n       ``Most employers want to do the right thing, but it's \n     tougher for the smaller employers,'' said Christine Rhiel, a \n     human resources generalist with the Employers Association.\n       Maj. Gary Olson, a Minnesota National Guard spokesman, said \n     it would be unreasonable to expect all employers to pay the \n     difference. The Guard members know they'll probably face \n     financial hardships when called on for duty, but they should \n     be provided some relief, he said.\n       ``When these individuals are called . . . they should not \n     be economically destroyed. There should be at least some \n     protection for credit and interest payments provided to those \n     individuals,'' Olson said.\n       The pay for the Guard starts at $1,300 a month for a \n     private with little experience and increases based on rank \n     and years of service, Olson said. Those activated in October \n     will be deployed at least through March, he said.\n       ``It's very tough,'' said Platoon Sgt. Jason Hosch, 25, of \n     the West St. Paul Guard unit, who is stationed at the Twin \n     Cities airport. ``How do these soldiers adapt to not being \n     able to pay their mortgage payments?''\n       Hosch, who is single, said he's faring well with a $36,000 \n     yearly salary, but he sympathizes with older Guard members \n     who have more bills to pay and children to care for.\n       In addition to his base salary, Dellwo receives some \n     housing assistance toward his $1,000 monthly mortgage \n     payment. He said he stands to save $200 to $300 a month on \n     his mortgage payment if he's covered under the Sailors' and \n     Soldiers' Relief Act.\n       Despite the hardship, Dellwo said he's committed to his \n     mission.\n       ``I started this deployment, and I'm going to finish this \n     deployment,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Schumer as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I would like to briefly summarize a \ncouple stories of those who are in the Guard:\n  Cpl. Paul Dellwo is a local police officer. As he was patrolling MPS \nAirport, he was making $1,600 a month. As a police officer, he was \nmaking approximately $2,600 a month. On this $1,600 a month he still \nhas to make the same credit card, tuition and mortgage payments. At the \nend of November he thought he had only a month or two before his \nfinances really became tight.\n  Craig Ford works as an internet sales manager who works on commission \nfor an automotive company. He said that during a good month he could \nearn $15,000. Now, as a specialist with the guard, he earns $2,600 a \nmonth. Ford is married and has two children, a 5-month-old and a 2-\nyear-old.\n  Mr. Ford speaks for all the troops that I met when he said he \nunderstood there would be financial hardships when he volunterred--he \nis more than willing to put up with the hardships but he would sure \nappreciate a little help. I heard this time and time again when I met \nwith the Guard on Nov. 26: Specialist Justin Johnson--a salesman at \nBest Buy Company--estimates that he is losing about a third of his \nincome during his deployment. Craig Forbes, a car salesman, estimates \nthat he is losing half his monthly income during his deployment at the \nairport. And Major Gary Olson, Public Affairs Officer for the MN \nNational Guard, told me that several others have had to be relieved of \ntheir deployment due to financial hardship. He also said several people \nhave come in wanting to serve but realized they simply could not do it \nand provide for their families adequately. All these Guardsmen made the \nsame point--look, I love my country and I'm pleased to serve but can we \nget a little financial protection?\n  I could go on. This is the point. Many of these Guard members are \nfrom working families. If they are lucky enough to be working for some \nof the larger companies, those companies say: Serve your country. It is \na national emergency. They pay full salary. But many work for \nbusinesses that cannot afford to, so they are losing $700, $800, $900, \n$1,000 a month.\n  It is just not right. Again, it is the same emergency. The President \nhas said so. He has called up the Guard, but we did it through our \nGovernors. This just fixes this problem and makes sure they get the \nsame civic relief. That is all this says.\n  It is a protection from them being foreclosed on, not for debts they \nbuild up now while serving our country for an emergency, but whatever \ndebts they had built up before. So it is some relief\n\n[[Page S12609]]\n\nfrom being foreclosed on or from being evicted or protection from a \nlife insurance policy being canceled.\n  These young people work very hard in their civilian lives. Some of \nthem work in retail where their commissions during the holiday season \nare the difference between their family having a good year and their \nfamily just getting by. But now they are not working for commissions--\nthey are not dealing with customers in a busy electronics store--they \nare toting an M16 and standing guard.\n  Some of the Guard work construction and, in Minnesota, you work \nconstruction until there is too much snow or it is too cold. This year \nit hasn't snowed much and it has been unseasonably warm. But instead of \nbuilding houses, making good wages, these men and women are in the \nairports--protecting us while we travel during the holiday season.\n  These stories are but a few trees in a large forest. Just about every \nsoldier or airmen I spoke to, from enlisted rank to officer, told the \nsame story. They are proud to wear their uniform. They are proud of \ntheir service to their country, but they worried about their families. \nThey are worried that the financial blow they are taking now will take \nyears to work off. They are worried that they are not providing the way \nthey should for their children. None of them asked for anything. But \nevery one of them told me that they sure would appreciate whatever help \nwe could offer.\n  The Minnesota Guard did a survey and showed it to me when I last \nvisited. It showed that most Members of the Guard are losing between \n$700 and $1000 a month. This is real money to retail sales people, to \nconstruction workers, to auto mechanics and to police officers. This is \nreal money that cannot be made up easily.\n  Today over 15,000 National Guard are serving in a full-time status \nnationwide--some of them six to seven days per week. They have been \nmobilized to protect everything from airports to the Golden Gate \nBridge. Some are involved in clean-up efforts at the World Trade Center \nand Pentagon. And we must be aware that National Guard units may be \nasked to do more in the coming months. This important change to the \nSSCRA will provide them the civil relief they rightly deserve. \nAddressing these issues now will ease the burden placed upon these \npatriots and their families now and in the future. These young people \nare not asking for much. Extending these protections is an important \nway to say that we value their service and that will not forget them or \ntheir families commitment to the United States.\n  Let me give you the genesis of this amendment. This is why I thank \nall of my colleagues, some of whom are on the floor. I know Senator \nBiden wants just 2 minutes, and then Senator Dayton wants to speak. He \nhas been working with me all the way, and Senator Gregg, and others.\n  I just say this: The genesis of this amendment is that I have been \ngoing out to airports--I am sure many of you have had the same \nexperience--and I just thank people. I was doing that for a while, I \nsay to my colleague from Delaware, and finally one of the Guard members \nsaid: Thank you, Paul, but if you really want to help us, this is the \nproblem for us. We are on guard duty. This is a national emergency. We \nare at wartime. It is national security. We are out here--by the way, \nthey are going to be at our airport until the end of March, at least--\nyet we do not have the same protection. The President called us up, but \nthrough the Governors, and we do not have the same protection this way \nthat other members have. Please give us this civic relief.\n  It would help us. I hope there will be 100 votes for this. I have \nworked my heart out on this amendment because I just think it is \nimportant we help people. I hope this will have unanimous support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. The Senator from Minnesota \nis the major player in this effort. The Senator from Delaware is not.\n  This is, in a sense, a real Minnesota tradition of progressive \npolitics. The two guys who jumped out on this first and responded \nimmediately were the two Senators from Minnesota. I have experienced \nthe same exact thing in the State of Delaware as I go around and see \nthe guardsmen.\n  One of the reasons the distinction was made in the past between \nwhether a President called up the Guard or a Governor called up the \nGuard was the nature of the incident for which the Guard had to be \ncalled up in those circumstances. When the President called up the \nGuard, it was usually--not always--relating to a national defense \nissue. When Governors called up the Guard, it was for hurricanes and \nfloods and very worthy and worthwhile and important things to our \nconstituents.\n  Let's make it real clear: This is not a hurricane. This is not a \nflood. This is not a natural disaster. This is an unnatural disaster \ncalled a war. The reason my guardsmen in Delaware were called up and \nall of our guardsmen are called up now is for a war. This is a war.\n  Here we are on December 7, 60 years after Pearl Harbor, and where are \nwe? We are once again faced with what we were faced with then. This is \nthe first time since then American soil has been struck. What is the \nmost likely place where the next terrible tragedy will occur if our \nenemies have their way? In America. The reason the Guard is on the \nborder, at the airports, and throughout our communities is as if there \nwere a foreign army marching on us. That is what this is about. \nThe Soldiers' and Sailors Act was designed to take that into effect.\n\n  I compliment both my colleagues. I am flattered they let me be one of \nthe cosponsors. They deserve a great deal of credit for calling this to \nour attention. I will be surprised if they don't get 100 votes. I \ncompliment them for their foresight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am very proud to rise in support of the \namendment of my distinguished colleague, Senator Wellstone. I salute my \ngood friend and colleague who has been in the forefront of these issues \non behalf of the men and women of the National Guard not only in \nMinnesota but across the country, and our military personnel. Senator \nWellstone deserves the full credit for his leadership in initiating \nthis important amendment.\n  It grew out of visits and conversations which he and I have had \ntogether and which he and I have had separately with the National Guard \nmen and women who are patrolling the major Minnesota airport in the \nMinneapolis-St. Paul area. It is extraordinary to see them hour after \nhour, early in the day, late at night, standing there protecting all \nthe rest of us, their fellow citizens, and assuring our safety as we \nfly our Nation's skies.\n  As Senator Wellstone has pointed out, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden, this is an unusual circumstance. It \noccurred because the President, very properly, wanted to respect the \ndoctrine of posse comitatus and, therefore, since the Guard men and \nwomen were engaged in a patrolling function at our domestic airports, \nhe asked the Governors to call them out rather than doing so directly \nhimself.\n  As a result, as the Senator from Minnesota has said, they suffer \nthese additional financial perils. These men and women are not just \nserving our country during these critical months, they are doing so at \nserious financial consequence to themselves and their families. For \nmost of these National Guard men and women, the salary they receive for \ntheir Guard duty is but a fraction of what they are receiving in their \ncivilian employment. Yet this amendment doesn't address that inequity, \nand they are not asking right now for us to do so.\n  All they are asking, and what this amendment does in a very important \nway, thanks to the leadership of Senator Wellstone, is give them \nequality or parity with their associates who are called up under other \ncircumstances. It prevents these additional financial penalties from \nbeing imposed upon them and their families during this service and at \nno additional cost to the American taxpayer. It is for those reasons \nthat, joining with my colleague Senator Wellstone, I can't imagine why \nanybody would want to oppose this amendment.\n  With that, I thank the others who have made this a bipartisan \namendment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have two colleagues on the floor, one \nof\n\n[[Page S12610]]\n\nwhom is Senator Gregg, a cosponsor of the amendment. I thank my \ncolleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gregg from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Wellstone's \namendment, of which I am an original cosponsor. Senator Wellstone has \nidentified a problem which just cries out to be examined and answered. \nNational Guard personnel are really extraordinary people who serve us \nas citizen soldiers. They give up their daily lives, they put \ntremendous stress on their families to serve us, and it's truly \ninappropriate that they should not be treated with the deference and \nthe fair treatment that they would get if they were called up under a \ndifferent circumstance\n  What Senator Wellstone is doing here is correcting what was an \nobvious loophole in the understanding of how the Soldiers' and Sailors' \nCivil Relief Act of 1940 would work and is applying that Act to our \nNational Guard men and women who are called up as a result of a \nnational emergency declared by the President but who happen to be \ncalled up by Governors, and so it is an extremely appropriate action. \nIt's certainly something that should be done at this time and should be \ndone quickly so that those folks who are guarding our airport, our \nborders, and may well be in harm's way, but are certainly giving up \ntheir private lives in order to make our lives safer through their \npublic service should receive fair treatment from our Government.\n  During World War I, the Congress passed a law to help people who were \ncalled to serve in the military, people who had debts or financial \nobligations such as home mortgages, car loans, and bank loans. A \nsimilar law is in effect today, ``The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil \nRelief Act of 1940, as amended.'' Although not included in the title of \nthe law, the safeguards of the law also apply to personnel in the Air \nForce, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Provisions of the law protect a \nservice member, who is called-up to serve in the military, from being \nevicted from rental property or from mortgaged property, protect \nagainst cancellation of life insurance, and protect against lose of \nhome because of overdue taxes, if the service member's ability to make \npayments is materially affected by military service. Further provisions \nof the law require that interest of no more than 6 percent a year can \nbe charged by a lender on a debt which a person on active duty in \nmilitary service incurred before he or she went on active duty.\n  The law does not cancel out the debt or financial obligations of \nthose called up for active duty. What it does do is give them certain \nspecial rights and legal protections. The purpose of granting the \nspecial rights and protections, as stated in the law, is to help people \nwho have been called up for active duty ``to devote their entire energy \nto the defense needs of the Nation.''\n  In the normal case of a National Guard call-up by the President, \nmembers of the National Guard get this civil relief. But in the case of \na National Guard call-up by a Governor, at the request of the \nPresident, members of the National Guard do not get this civil relief. \nThe members of our National Guard now protecting our airports therefore \ndo not get this relief, because the President thought it best to have \nthe Governors call-up the Guard.\n  New Hampshire National Guard personnel are today assisting in \nproviding protection at airports in New Hampshire, at the Manchester \nAirport, the Lebanon Airport, and the Pease International Tradeport \nAirport. The New Hampshire National Guard has a long and rich history. \nColonial New Hampshire Governor John Cutt organized the New Hampshire \nmilitia in 1680. This militia served in all of the Colonial Wars. New \nHampshire troops included Roger's Rangers, famed for their guerrilla \ntactics, and forerunners of today's U.S. Army Rangers, presently \nserving in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. In December 1774, a \ngroup of patriots under the command of Captain Thomas Pickering, of \nPortsmouth, attacked and captured Fort William and Mary at Newcastle, \nNH. The ``shot heard round the world'' was not fired at Lexington, MA, \nuntil the following April. During the Civil War, New Hampshire \nfurnished 17 infantry regiments, 1 cavalry regiment, 1 heavy artillery \nregiment, and 1 light artillery battery to the Union cause. The 5th New \nHampshire Volunteers, led by Colonel Edward E. Cross, suffered the \nhighest casualties of any Northern infantry regiment, having fought \nvaliantly at Seven Pines, Malvern Hill, Antietam, Fredericksburg, \nChancellorsville, and Gettysburg. And now other equally patriotic \nmembers of the New Hampshire Guard have been called up by the Governor, \nat the request of President Bush, to help protect airports, as part of \nour country's war on terrorism.\n\n  I assume members of the National Guards of my fellow Senators' States \nhave also been called up by their respective Governors for airport \nprotection duties. So this is not just a New Hampshire issue or a \nMinnesota issue. This is your issue also. When National Guard troops \nare called to active duty, whether by the President or by a Governor at \nthe request of the President in response to war or national emergency \ndeclared by the Congress, they must essentially put their personal \nlives on hold.\n  The intent of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act is to \nprovide financial security and peace of mind to the men and women of \nour country who are unexpectedly called to serve their Nation in times \nof crisis. The law certainly should not be allowed to favor those \ncalled up by the President and exclude those called up by State \nGovernors, at the request of the President. The National Guard \npersonnel now helping to keep our airports safe deserve the same \nprotections extended to National Guard troops fighting for our Nation \nall over the world.\n  This amendment will allow the men and women who our Governors have \ncalled on, at the request of the President for an operation during a \nwar or national emergency declared by the President or Congress, to \nfocus on their task at hand without worrying about previous financial \nobligations. Fellow Senators, I ask you to support this amendment to \ncorrect a serious inequity involving National Guard men and women of \nour various States, including most likely your own States, who have \nbeen called to active duty for critical domestic operations such as \nprotecting our Nation's airports.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Wellstone, Gregg, and \nDayton and those who have initiated this effort for giving me an \nopportunity to be cosponsor. I thank them for this amendment and for \ngiving us a chance to express our gratitude to the men and women in the \nNational Guard across America who are serving our country so well. They \nmake extraordinary sacrifices, put their lives on the line and serve \ntheir country.\n  This amendment gives them the recognition and reward they need. We \ncan do more. I believe we will. But this amendment is an excellent \nfirst start to say to these men and women: We know you are serving our \ncountry. You deserve our praise, our prayers, and the recognition and \nhelp of this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nsupport from the Minnesota National Guard and the Military Coalition \nand other documents be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, December 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     33 nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans \n     organizations, representing more than 5.5 million current and \n     former members of the seven uniformed services, plus their \n     families and survivors, would like to bring to your attention \n     a serious inequity for National Guard members who have been \n     called to active duty for Operation Noble Eagle in Title 32 \n     status.\n       National Guard soldiers and airmen called to active duty \n     under Title 32 do not have the protection of the Soldiers and \n     Sailors Civil Relief Act (SSCRA). National Guard and Reserve \n     members called to active duty under Operation Enduring \n     Freedom in Title 10 status do have that protection.\n       The SSCRA was passed by Congress to provide protection for \n     individuals called to active duty in any of the military \n     services. The SSCRA suspends certain civil obligations to\n\n[[Page S12611]]\n\n     enable service members to devote full attention to duty. The \n     SSCRA protects the individual and his family from \n     foreclosures, evictions, and installment contracts for the \n     purchase of real or personal property if the service member's \n     ability to make payments is ``materially affected'' by the \n     military service. The SSCRA entitles a person called to \n     active duty to reinstatement of any health insurance that was \n     in effect on the day before such service commenced, and was \n     terminated during the period of service.

Paul D. Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     St. Paul, MN.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I am writing to request your \n     support for expanding the protections of the Soldiers' and \n     Sailors' Civil Relief Act (SSCRA) to include National Guard \n     personnel serving their country under the authority of Title \n     32 of the United States Code.\n       As you know, the SSCRA provides a spectrum of important \n     protections for men and women called to active federal \n     military service. The SSCRA recognizes the reality that a \n     call to military service can negatively impact one's ability \n     to meet certain civil obligations. Unfortunately, the SSCRA \n     only applies to military duty performed under the authority \n     of Title 10 of the United States Code. It does not protect \n     the soldiers and airmen performing duty under Title 32.\n       This distinction between service under Title 10 and Title \n     32 is inequitable and nonsensical. Service performed under \n     Title 32 is still military service and it is still valuable \n     and important to the national defense. The men and women \n     called away from home to serve their country under Title 32 \n     face the same problems as those called under Title 10. It is \n     only right that they receive the same protections.\n       The recent activations of National Guard personnel to \n     support airport security nationwide illustrate the importance \n     of the military service under Title 32. Your support for \n     expanding the SSCRA to protect persons serving under Title 32 \n     will be an important part of correcting the current inequity.\n\n[[Page S12612]]\n\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. \n     If I can provide any additional information, please contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Eugene R.

Paul David Wellstone,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: The Enlisted Association of the \n     National Guard of the United States (EANGUS) would like to \n     thank you for introducing S. 1680, which would amend the \n     Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA) to \n     include members of the National Guard called to active duty \n     under Title 32.\n       The SSCRA was passed by Congress to provide protection for \n     individuals called to active duty in any of the military \n     services. The SSCRA suspends certain civil obligations to \n     enable service members to devote full attention to duty. The \n     SSCRA protects the individual and his family from \n     foreclosures, evictions, and installment contracts for the \n     purchase of real or personal property if the service member's \n     ability to make payments is ``materially affected'' by the \n     military service. The SSCRA entitles a person called to \n     active duty to reinstatement of any health insurance that was \n     in effect on the day before such service commenced, and was \n     terminated during the period of service. It also protects the \n     service member against termination of private life insurance \n     policies during the term of active service.\n       Currently, the SSCRA only covers members of the National \n     Guard called to active duty under Title 10 (federal active \n     duty). Guardsmen and Reservists called to active service for \n     Operation Enduring Freedom were called under Title 10 and \n     therefore are entitled to all federal benefits including \n     protection under SSCRA; however, the majority of National \n     Guard members called to active service for Operation Noble \n     Eagle are being called up under title 32 and, although they \n     receive some federal benefits, they do not qualify for \n     protection under the SSCRA.\n       EANGUS believes that all members of the National Guard \n     performing active duty service should be entitled to \n     protection under the SSCRA. A National Guardsmen called to \n     active duty status whether Title 10 or Title 32 deserve the \n     same protection from foreclosure or eviction. While they are \n     trying to do their best to insure that our airports are \n     secure, our water supply remains safe, and our nuclear power \n     plants will not be turned into weapons of mass destruction, \n     they should not have to worry about whether or not their \n     families will keep a roof over their heads or that bill \n     collectors will be hounding them for payment because their \n     military pay was processed late (which occurred in New York \n     and Virginia). It is a shame that a member of the National \n     Guard would have to go to their local Red Cross to receive \n     help in paying their mortgages as well as their \n     transportation costs.\n       The Army and Air National Guard are the United State's \n     first line of defense against all enemies foreign or \n     domestic. The men and women of the National Guard have \n     volunteered to serve their country. They serve proudly and \n     willingly. Your support in amending the SSCRA of 1940 to \n     include Title 32 will send a very strong signal of support to \n     our service members who will be going into harms way. It will \n     alleviate some areas of concern to them; they will be less \n     distracted and more secure knowing that their families will \n     be protected while they are protecting us.\n       If I can be of any assistance, please contact me at (703) \n     519-3846.\n       Working for America's Best!\n                                  MSG Michael P. Cline (Ret) ARNG,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I take this opportunity to thank General Andreotti, \nthe leader of our Guard in Minnesota, for his very strong support and \nhis wisdom.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend for introducing this \namendment, which closes a troubling loophole in our military personnel \nsystem.\n  Currently, members of the National Guard called up under Federal \ntitle 32 status are not eligible for the protections of the Soldiers \nand Sailors Civil Relief Act. The act ensures that a servicemember can \nprotect their house, life insurance, and health insurance while on \nactive duty. It ensures a smooth transition back and forth between \nactive service and civilian life, and it essentially underpins the \nentire military personnel system. We cannot defend the country without \nthe National Guard, and we cannot attract qualified people to the Guard \nwithout the relief act.\n  The act has not applied to Guard members called up under title 32 \nstatus because most activations over the past fifty years have been \nunder title 10, active military duty. However, September 11 tipped the \nbalance in the other direction. Title 32 provides more flexibility to \nachieve missions in the United States and guarantees local control. As \na result, thousands of Guard members have been called up across the \ncountry to secure our airports, railroads, bridges, and borders under \nthis status.\n  This amendment extends the relief act to these proud citizen-\nsoldiers. They must have these protections so they can focus on their \nmission. For them, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that the \nsubcommittee is prepared to accept the amendment. It is a fine \namendment, very patriotic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2325) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Helms from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder for a period of 2 minutes regarding the issue of tanker \nreplacements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the question I have, is there any order in \neffect as to who gets the floor when the quorum is called off?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Helms is entitled to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And Senator Brownback seeks recognition.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. For 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, Senator Brownback is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will not be long. I wish to speak \nabout the leasing of 100 aircraft tankers, many of which will be \nremodeled in the State of Kansas. I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the issue he is raising about the lack of review, but \nI also wish to be very specific about what is taking place.\n  The current tanker fleet is 40 years old, some of it 45 years old. \nThat is my age. Some days I feel very old. A lot of these tankers are \nspending a great deal of time in depot. They are spending up to 60 \npercent of their time being repaired. If we do not go through this \nlease arrangement, we are not going to have the tanker fleet to conduct \nour current long-range bombing missions.\n  While I have great respect as to how this has come up--the lack of \nhearings--the fact is we cannot conduct campaigns, such as we are in \nAfghanistan, unless we do something like this.\n  I also think this lease arrangement is going to allow us to do \nsomething we could not do if we were on a straight purchase basis. It \nis something we need to do now.\n  For those reasons, I want to be clear on my support, even though I \nhave great admiration for the Senator from Arizona and the legitimate \nissues he is bringing up. We simply cannot do this any other way. This \nwill get us 100 aircraft that we need to replace some that are 40 to 45 \nyears old. This legislation will get this going now while we have the \noperational capacity to build them. Because of the lack of construction \nthat is taking place at Boeing and the rest of its fleet construction, \nwe are going to be laying people off. Instead of laying them off, we \ncan put them to work.\n\n  It has come up in a questionable fashion. For that I have respect for \nthose who are challenging this provision. Still, these are \nextraordinary times. If we do this, we can get something of value at a \ntime when we can construct the aircraft. And it can be scored such that \nwe can afford to pay for this at this point in time.\n  For all those reasons, I think this is a legitimate and a proper \nthing for us to do. I add my voice to that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous order will be \nobtained, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2336\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I do thank the Chair. Mr. President, there is a little bit \nof manipulation going on, but let me emphasize the President of the \nUnited States is in favor of the underlying amendment, to which a \nsecond-degree amendment proposes to gut the amendment I have just \noffered.\n  If we are going to play this sort of game around here, that is fine. \nI can play it, too, and I have been around a little while, and I know \nhow to do it.\n  The International Criminal Court will be empowered if and when just \n13 more countries ratify the so-called Rome Treaty. Forty-seven have \nratified it as of this past Friday, November 30.\n  It has been a privilege to work with the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Miller, in crafting this amendment to protect American \nsoldiers and officials from illegal prosecutions by that Court. In \naddition to Senator Miller and me, Senator Lott, Senator Warner, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Hatch, Senator Shelby, Senator Frist, and \nSenator Murkowski joined in introducing the American Service Members \nProtection Act on May 9 of this year. The pending amendment is the \nresult of our converting that act into an amendment to the pending \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  As I said at the outset, there are going to be attempts to defeat \nthis pending amendment despite the support of the President of the \nUnited States, despite the support of all manner of organizations, \nincluding veterans and members of the armed services.\n  I feel a bit of resentment. What they are doing is well within the \nrules. We will see how the Senate stacks up on this little bit of play.\n  Without this amendment, the Rome Treaty can expose U.S. soldiers and \ncivilian officials to the risk of prosecutions separate and apart from \nthe laws of the United States of America. Therefore, they could very \nwell be battling international bureaucrats and prosecutors instead of \nterrorists such as those who on September 11 committed mass murder \nagainst thousands of innocent American citizens in New York City and at \nthe Pentagon, not far from here.\n\n  The pending amendment ensures that neither the International Criminal \nCourt nor overzealous prosecutors and judges will ever be able to \nprosecute and persecute American military personnel.\n  At this time, along with the mobilization to fight terrorists, there \nis unanimous support in Congress for giving the President the tools he \nneeds to wage the war against terrorism.\n  Accordingly, the distinguished chairman, Henry Hyde, of the House \nInternational Relations Committee, and I have negotiated with the Bush \nadministration some needed refinements to the American Servicemembers' \nProtection Act that is now pending for consideration by this Senate.\n  This amendment then is a sort of revised version of the original bill \nto give the President flexibility and authority to delegate provisions \nin the legislation that he needs in this time of national emergency to \nprotect our service men and women.\n  I have in hand two letters dated September 25, 2001, and November 8, \n2001, respectively, from Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative \nAffairs Paul V. Kelly indicating that the administration does support \nthe language of the pending amendment.\n  Instead of placing these letters in the Record, I want to read them. \nThe first one, Paul V. Kelly, Assistant Secretary of Legislative \nAffairs of the U.S. Department of State:\n\n       Dear Senator Helms: This letter advises that the \n     administration supports the revised text of the American \n     Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), dated September 10, \n     2001, proposed by you, Mr. Hyde and Mr. DeLay.\n       We commit to support enactment of the revised bill in its \n     current form based upon the agreed changes without further \n     amendment and to oppose alternative legislative proposals.\n       We understand that in the House the ASPA legislation will \n     be attached to the State Department authorization bill or \n     other appropriate legislation.\n\n  The Senate has a responsibility to enact an insurance policy for our \nmen\n\n[[Page S12614]]\n\nand women serving at home and overseas. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nand Secretary of State Powell agree it is essential to protect all of \nthem from a permanent kangaroo court where the United States has no \nveto.\n\n  Precisely, this amendment does the following: It will prohibit U.S. \ncooperation with the court, including use of taxpayer funding or \nsharing of classified information. Two, it will restrict U.S. \ninvolvement in peacekeeping missions unless the United Nations \nspecifically exempts U.S. troops from prosecution by the International \nCriminal Court. Three, it limits U.S. aid to allies unless they also \nsign accords to shield U.S. troops on their soil from being turned over \nto this kangaroo court. And four, it authorizes the President of the \nUnited States to take necessary action to rescue any U.S. soldiers or \nservice people who may be improperly handed over to that court.\n  When former President Clinton signed the Rome Treaty on December 31, \n2000, he stated he would not send the treaty to the Senate for \nratification and recommended that President Bush not transmit it to the \nSenate either, given the remaining flaws in the court. Moreover, I \nunderstand my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, said this about \nthe Rome Treaty on September 26, and I quote the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut:\n\n       If for some reason miraculously the proposal were brought \n     to this Senate chamber this afternoon, and I were asked to \n     vote on it as is, I would vote against it because it is a \n     flawed agreement.\n\n  Many Americans may not realize that the Rome Treaty, so-called, can \napply to Americans even if the Senate has declined to ratify the \ntreaty. This international legal precedent lacks any basis in U.S. law.\n  So I reiterate, the pending amendment will shield Americans from this \ninternational court, and that is why 28 uniformed services and veterans \norganizations representing more than 5\\1/2\\ million active and veteran \nmilitary personnel and their families support the pending amendment.\n  I have a copy of a letter dated November 19 of this year signed by \nthe directors of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and at the Reserve \nOfficers Association and associations representing every one of the \nservices. They favor this amendment. I will take time right now to read \nthis letter into the Record. I started to insert it, but I think it is \nimportant for me to read it.\n\n       Dear Senator Helms: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans' \n     organizations representing more than 5.5 million current and \n     former members of the seven uniformed services, plus their \n     families and survivors, strongly supports the amended version \n     of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the pending Senate amendment.\n\n       The Coalition understands that the administration also \n     supports this legislation.\n\n  I have already covered that. Then the letter continues:\n\n       This bill would seek to protect American servicemembers \n     from criminal prosecution by an International Criminal Court \n     to which the United States is not a party.\n       TMC [that is the military coalition] believes the United \n     States must ensure military personnel (plus Federal officials \n     and employees) are protected when it orders them to \n     participate in operations or other prescribed duties in \n     foreign countries. Any effort to the contrary by internal or \n     external entities should be thwarted. Our Nation cannot \n     continue to dispatch its uniformed and official personnel, \n     who have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States, to international assignments without \n     guaranteeing them their rights under that magnificent \n     document. Sincerely.\n\n  It is signed by the officers of the association.\n  President Bush and his national security team support this amendment. \nThere is a great need to approve this amendment now and not wait until \nsome vague future date next year or even later. Obviously, I support \nand urge support for this amendment to protect these service and \ncivilian leaders from unaccountable kangaroo courts.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank Senator Miller for the great work he has done, and \nI yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice of support to this \namendment by Senator Helms.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished senior Senator from North \nCarolina for his leadership and dedication in crafting this important \nlegislation. I am proud to cosponsor it with him. He has worked hard \nwith the Bush administration to write a bill that meets the President's \napproval, and I commend him for doing so. Senator Helms outlined the \ndetails on what this legislation is intended to do, so I will just make \nsome brief comments on why I believe it is so important.\n  As Senator Helms stated, this legislation is designed to protect \nAmerican troops and officials from the potential of illegitimate and \npoliticized prosecutions under the auspices of an International \nCriminal Court. When just 13 more nations ratify the Rome Treaty, the \nInternational Criminal Court will be empowered, and Americans could be \nsubject to its prosecutorial authority. This could happen even though \nthe United States has not ratified the treaty.\n  We ask a lot of our military. They are at risk right now in \nAfghanistan. They are stretched to the limit, and are engaged in \nmissions around the globe that include peacekeeping and humanitarian \nefforts.\n  In the conduct of these missions, we must provide them the tools to \nsucceed. Exposing our troops to ICC prosecutions is tantamount to not \nadequately equipping them for the mission. Rules of engagement for many \nmilitary missions are complex enough--our military doesn't need to be \nfurther burdened by the specter of the ICC when making critical deadly \nforce decisions.\n  I have heard some of the arguments against this legislation. Some \nthink it demonstrates U.S. arrogance and a unilateralist attitude. \nOthers believe it somehow compromises our commitment to the promotion \nof human rights and the prosecution of war crimes. I appreciate those \nconcerns, but in my opinion, the well-being and protection of our \nmilitary trumps those arguments every time.\n  We should be concerned over world perception in terms of our \ncommitment to addressing war crimes, genocide, and other human rights \nissues. However, I don't believe any reasonable government could accuse \nus of not being the world's leader in all of these areas. The \nsuggestion that the United States is not supportive of human rights \nbecause we refuse to ratify a questionable treaty just doesn't compute.\n  Some would advocate that we should ratify this treaty and try to fix \nits deficiencies after the ICC is created. That is laughable to me. How \nmany of us would sign a contract for anything before negotiating the \ndetails? It makes more sense to have this proposed legislation as an \ninsurance policy and then negotiate, rather than negotiate without it \nand potentially place our people at risk.\n  I remind my distinguished colleagues of the concern we all had when \nthe Chinese held our EP-3 crew for 11 days. And they were only \ndetained--not prosecuted. Now image American service members being \nsubjected an unfair ICC prosecution without U.S. consent. This cold \nhappen to some those brave troops that are eating dust and risking \ntheir lives in Afghanistan to protect America. I would never want to \nlook a family member in the eye and know that I did not do everything \npossible to prevent such a prosecution because of concern over world \nperception, or offending their governments. This legislation seeks to \nprovide that much-deserved protection.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. As \nresponsible lawmakers, we are obligated to provide them this \nlegislative protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, a matter of some interest has \narisen. I received a call from the Secretary of the Army. If I could \nhave 2 minutes, I think colleagues would be interested.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Secretary of the Army just called me. \nYesterday, I put in an amendment to the pending matter before the \nSenate with regard to the desire on behalf of\n\n[[Page S12615]]\n\nthe Congress of the United States to see that Captain Charles ``Chic'' \nBurlingame, the pilot of American Airlines flight 77, be buried in his \nown grave site at Arlington National Cemetery. In recognition of the \ngrowing interest in the Congress, I was assisted on this by so many. My \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Allen, Senator McCain, and Senator \nInouye very graciously put this amendment into the managers' package. \nSenator Stevens and others, Senator Cleland, and the Senator from \nLouisiana are all involved.\n  This matter has now been reviewed by the White House and by the \nSecretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army has indicated to me \nthat he will, under the regulations, exercise his authority to enable \nthis very courageous and distinguished American and Navy veteran to be \nburied in his own grave, and at such time in the future to further have \nhis wife interred with him.\n  I thank all who worked on this. There have been many in the Chamber, \nalong with my colleagues in the House, Frank Wolf, Tom Davis, and \nothers, and also the Secretary of the Army has worked very carefully on \nit. I went over and visited the Secretary of the Army a short time ago, \nhaving been in conference with the two brothers of this individual. It \nis a team effort by the administration and the Congress. The Secretary \nis hopeful that the Congress will enact the legislation filed yesterday \nbecause it would be an important part of the decisionmaking process. I \nindicated to him I believe the Senate would, in due course, act on it. \nI am in contact with colleagues in the House to have a companion \nbill acted on.\n\n  I thank all concerned. We wish the widow and his family and his two \nbrothers who worked so hard on this the very best. So the funeral now \ncan go forward and he will have his own grave site. I thank the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and my colleague for allowing me to \nmake this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut \nallowing me to stand up and speak for a brief moment before he \nresponds. He has an amendment.\n  I say to my friend from Georgia and my friend from North Carolina, \nwhom I respect immensely, this is an idea whose time has not come. Here \nwe are with a 28-page amendment before the Senate that we have not \nread, that is occurring at the very moment, as my friend from Georgia \nsays, when American special forces are eating dust in Afghanistan, at a \ntime when we were relying upon the cooperation of an alliance and a \nNATO and non-NATO forces that have agreed to support us in that \neffort, at a time when we are holding a coalition together, along with \nmany Members who have supported this International Criminal Court, and \nwe are going to try to change their minds about how we should amend the \nlanguage of the Criminal Court to make it a reasonable thing we could \nin fact theoretically be a part of, to come along and tell them: By the \nway, if you already have signed onto this Court, but unless you \ndecide--as one piece of the amendment requires--that unless you agree \nahead of time that you would never under any circumstances abide by \nthis Court as it relates to the transfer of an American person accused \nof a crime, we are in effect dissing you: We ain't going to work with \nyou anymore.\n\n  It seems to me a pretty bad moment to be making that claim at this \ntime. As my friend from Georgia pointed out, we want some options. We \nhave plenty of time between now and the next several months to do what \nwe are supposed to do. This was referred to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It was introduced and referred to the committee by my \ndistinguished colleague, the ranking member, former chairman, Senator \nHelms, when he was chairman. He held no hearings on it this year after \nit was introduced. Since it has been in my committee--some version of \nthis, not the same thing--there has been no request for me to hold \nhearings on this legislation.\n  Here we are on a Friday afternoon about to pass--I hope--a \nsignificant bill, and a 27-page amendment is dropped on our desk that \nis the most far-reaching and consequential extension of an argument \nagainst this Court that I have ever heard. It may make sense. \nTheoretically, it can make sense. But if you are ever going to pick a \nmoment not to do this, it would be at this very moment when we have \njust--I have been a major party to this--literally broken the arms of \nthe Serbs to make sure they send Milosevic to a criminal court. We have \nbroken the legs of everyone we can--figuratively speaking--\ndiplomatically to get Saddam Hussein before a criminal court, an \ninternational court. We have asked them to all step up to the plate and \ntry to bring to trial terrorists and people we are after--the bin \nLadens--whom we don't want to try in this country.\n  It seems to me to come along, and say, but, by the way, if you have \nsigned onto any of this stuff that we don't like, we are not only going \nto see to it that we don't cooperate with you, but we are limiting our \nrelationship with you, as I read this--that is a pretty big deal.\n  I wonder how Mr. Blair is thinking, that at this moment when we are \nputting pressure, or Mr. Schroeder, who risked his entire government \nwith a vote of no confidence--he survived by I think two votes, and I \nwill have the Record correct me if I am wrong about the number of \nvotes--but barely survived in order to commit German forces to fight \nnext to American special forces on the ground--who strongly supports \nthis, and say, by the way, you are our enemy if you signed onto this \nCourt. Give me a break.\n  Let us have regular order, as they say around here. We have plenty of \ntime. I promise you I will hold hearings on this. But don't ask us to \ndigest 27 pages of the most far-reaching application of an objection--\nby the way, in the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill we \nalready passed legislation of the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nbarring cooperation with this Court. It still takes 13 more nations to \nsign on before the Court comes into effect. We have time. Let us do \nthis in an orderly way.\n  I commit to you that at the earliest moment--if you want to pick a \ndate, I will give a date--I will come back during recess and hold \nhearings. Let us get some serious people in here giving serious input. \nJust possibly, you people have missed something. Just possibly, you \nhave inadvertently made a mistake in how broad this is, which may harm \nAmerican troops. I do not know that it does. But I have been around \nhere long enough to know that my mother's expression is a correct one: \nOften the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I have no doubt \nabout the intentions. But I have some concern that you may have paved \nthe road to hell a little bit for the very American personnel we are \ntrying to save.\n\n  I really ask you in a more sober moment, even before we get on to the \ndebate--I don't want to discourage my friend from Connecticut either--\nto sort of stand down here. I promise you I will set hearings. I will \nhold the hearings. I will not attempt in any way to delay reporting out \nlegislation on this subject. Let us do this in the normal legislative \nway.\n  I thank my colleagues. I appreciate their intent. I know there is not \na single Senator who doesn't share this concern. The last thing we want \nis an American tried before a kangaroo court.\n  I respectfully suggest that we are sending some sort of silly signals \nright now to the world. We are asking the world to join us. We are \nasking the world to participate with us. We are asking the world to try \nbad guys who have committed crimes against humanity, and yet we are \nsetting up military tribunals and blanket, broad, broad pieces of \nlegislation such as this that we really haven't had hearings on, \nhaven't thought through, haven't debated, and haven't refined.\n  I do not know that I am against this. Russell Long once said to me \nafter I said to him, ``But, Mr. Chairman, I am not sure about this \npiece of legislation,'' ``Joe, let me tell you something. Around this \nplace, when in doubt, vote no.''\n  I am in doubt. I don't know how you cannot be in doubt. This is 27 \npages long, and we are going to do this in the next 15 minutes. I think \nit is a mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I strongly urge the authors of this \namendment to\n\n[[Page S12616]]\n\nconsider the offer just made by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  The Senator from Delaware pointed out, putting aside for a second \nwhether or not you would disagree with the provisions in this amendment \nof 28 pages, that this is a proposal that has never really been debated \nor considered by committee. Something as far reaching as this is \nsomething this body, regardless of where one may stand ultimately on \nthe question of an international criminal court, needs to be prudent in \nconsidering. None of us in this body ever wants to see our American men \nand women in uniform be placed in jeopardy anywhere. I do not know that \nanyone can tell you with any certainty whether or not that would be the \ncase if this amendment were adopted.\n  Sometimes when we get in the middle of a debate and start arguing \nthese things, emotions get carried away and it gets harder. I would \nlike to pause for a moment. If both sides agreed to wait a bit and \nconsider this issue at a later date, I certainly would withdraw my \namendment. I have a simple amendment which just asks the President to \nreport to the Congress any additional legislative action he would deem \nnecessary for us to deal with this issue that the Senator from North \nCarolina has placed before us. I do not know how my colleagues feel \nabout that. But I urge them to consider debating this later. We can \nthen debate this in a proper fashion rather than do it here this \nafternoon.\n  I will note the absence of a quorum and take a minute to see if there \nis any possibility--does my colleague from Idaho wish to respond?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I cannot speak \nfor Senator Helms. I think all of us understand--whether by the \nlateness of the hour or the length of the amendment--that the ITC, with \n13 remaining nations, does not blink nor cause it to react to any \nextensive hearings that may have been held by the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Action on the part of this Congress and our President to ultimately \nprotect our own citizens and men and women in uniform and the \nprotection of our sovereignty and our constitutional rights is really \nthe question here. None of us should be frightened by a fear that \nsomehow bin Laden or Milosevic would not be appropriately treated.\n  We have now had the Judiciary Committee hold hearings for the last 2 \ndays on a military tribunal. Our President has already spoken as to how \nthey might deal with terrorists once captured.\n  Mr. DODD. If I might reclaim my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What I am saying is, hearings should have been held some \ntime ago. It is a critical issue that the last President put before \nthis body, in essence, by signing the treaty. Yet it has not been done. \nMy guess is, this is a critical debate and the appropriate amendment to \ndeal with it.\n  Mr. DODD. I reclaim my time. I guess the answer is no. We are going \nto have to go through this process, which I regret deeply because I do \nnot believe the Senator from Idaho or the Senator from North Carolina \nor the Senator from Connecticut could say to you, Mr. President, with \nany certainty, what we are about to adopt here is in the best interest \nof our country or our individual men and women in uniform.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment does, as I read it. This \namendment would prohibit the United States from aiding in the \nprosecution of war criminals before the International Criminal Court, \neven if the criminal may have perpetrated crimes against America. We \nare prohibited by this amendment to participate in any prosecution.\n  Second, it would limit U.S. participation in peacekeeping operations \nunless we get an ironclad commitment from the ICC that under no \ncircumstances would U.S. persons be subjected to the jurisdiction of \nthe Court.\n  Furthermore, this amendment would prohibit us from assisting any \ncountry that is party to the ICC. We provide assistance to countries \nall across the globe. Are we really, at this juncture, on a Friday \nafternoon, now going to bar all future assistance to countries that may \nparticipate in the formation of a court?\n  As I said, back in September when this matter was first raised by the \nSenator from North Carolina, if the Treaty of Rome were put before this \nbody, I would not vote for it. This body is not prepared to ratify that \ntreaty. My concern is that if Senator Helms' amendment passes, this \ntreaty may go forward and we will have no say in the process. As my \ncolleagues have pointed out, 13 other nations may sign on to it. If \nthey do, then all of the matters we pass here may be for little or any \ngood at all. In fact, the very concerns that my colleague from Georgia, \nand others, have raised may, in fact, occur as a result of our \nnonparticipation in the drafting of this treaty.\n  I think the United States should remain engaged in trying to fashion \nthis Court in a way that would protect our men and women in uniform. \nThat way at least we maximize the possibility that this Court is going \nto do what we would like it to do.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that today is December 7, and 60 years ago \ntoday Pearl Harbor was attacked, as we all know. We listened to the \neloquent remarks of our colleague from Hawaii earlier today. Four years \nlater, the United States, at our urging, established a criminal court \nin a place called Nuremberg, with the cooperation of our allies, to \nprosecute those who had prosecuted the war. And we did it not just in \nEurope but also in the Pacific with a separate set of trials.\n  In a sense, what this amendment would do is prohibit a future \nNuremberg.\n  I do not think, on this day of all days, considering, if you will, \nthe role that we played in the post-World War II period of trying to \nbuild institutions where the rule of law prevailed, that the Senate, \nthe body charged in the legislative branch with dealing with the \ninternational relations issues of our country, would adopt an amendment \nthat says we are not going to participate in any kind of an \ninternational criminal court.\n  I find it stunning that we can do that. I have offered a second-\ndegree amendment which very simply would say that the Rome statute \nestablishing the International Criminal Court would not enter into \nforce, and that Congress has confidence in President Bush's ability to \nprotect U.S. interests.\n\n  The last thing it calls for is that the President shall report to the \nCongress on any additional legislative actions necessary to advance and \nprotect U.S. interests as it relates to the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n  The Senator from Delaware has already pointed out, that we are trying \nto build transnational support for dealing with terrorism. The \nPresident has told us terrorists and their terrorist cells may exist in \n60 countries. We are going to need a remarkable level of cooperation if \nwe are going to successfully prosecute, capture, and try these \nindividuals.\n  We have already seen some of the difficulties related to the \ncooperation we are seeking to bring terrorists to justice. What is \ngoing to be the reaction of the international community if we adopt \nthis amendment at the very hour we are reaching out our hands saying: \nWill you join with us as we seek to prosecute those who perpetrated the \ncrimes on September 11? When we are telling those countries we are not \ngoing to participate in any peacekeeping operations, we are not going \nto provide any aid to any countries that participate or sign on to this \ntreaty?\n  This is what we should be doing: We should maintain a policy of fully \nsupporting the due process rights of all U.S. citizens before foreign \ntribunals, including the International Criminal Court. We should \ncontinue to participate in negotiations of the Preparatory Commission \nfor the International Criminal Court as an observer. At an assembly of \nstates and parties, that is how you are going to effect the change--by \nbeing at the table, not by walking away from it.\n  This is the United States of America. We are not some Third World \ncountry. We claim to be a leader in the world to do what we can to \nensure the rules of procedure are in evidence and that elements of \ncrime adopted by the International Criminal Court conform to the U.S. \nstandards of due process formally adopted by the assembly.\n  How is that going to occur if we adopt this amendment? We ought to \nseek a definition of the crime of aggression under the Rome statute \nthat\n\n[[Page S12617]]\n\nis consistent with international law and fully respects the right of \nself-defense of the United States and its allies.\n  We ought to be there to ensure that U.S. interests are protected in \nnegotiations over the remaining elements of the International Criminal \nCourt to provide appropriate diplomatic legal assistance to U.S. \ncitizens, especially the U.S. representatives and their dependents who \nface prosecution without full due process in any forum.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. That is the role of a great \nnation. That is the role of the United States. That is what we did in \nthe post-World War II period. We did not back away. We did not take an \n18th or 19th century approach to the world. We engaged the world.\n  In fact, I remember--my colleagues may not know all of the history--\nbut the choice of Nuremberg was not accidental. The choice could have \nbeen elsewhere. But Robert Jackson, who led the U.S. delegation \nprosecutorial team, selected Nuremberg because it was at Nuremberg that \nthe Nazis wrote the laws that gave them the fake justification, if you \nwill, to engage in the butchering that they brought on the world. It \nwas at Nuremberg, Germany, where that happened.\n  So Robert Jackson said: Why don't we go back to that very place and \nshow the world that in civilized societies the rule of law prevails?\n  There were people who argued forcefully that there should have been \nsummary executions of the defendants at Nuremberg. Just execute them. \nThat was the argument. Line them up against a wall and shoot them. \nBelieve me, there were a lot of people who could make a strong claim \nthat should have been the process. Millions of people lost their lives \nat the hands of those butchers.\n  But wiser voices prevailed. They said: No, no. We are not going to \nallow the world to see us act, in a sense, little differently than \nthose who committed the crimes. We are going to provide them with a \ntribunal, an international criminal court. The argument that was raised \nagainst it was not illegitimate. It was ex post facto. We established \nit after the fact, but I think most agree today that the Nuremberg \ntribunal was conducted fairly, that those who were brought before that \ncriminal court were given an opportunity to present their cases, and \nwere tried fairly. Most were convicted, most were executed; some \nactually were exonerated; some got lesser sentences.\n  The point I am making is, today could there be another Nuremberg? \nCould we participate in a Nuremberg? Would we be advocating it? If we \nadopt this amendment, does that put us on the side of the Robert \nJacksons in 1945, or does it put us on the side of retrenching and \npulling back and not engaging?\n  I honestly believe the Rome Treaty is flawed--terribly flawed--but I \nalso believe my country ought not walk away from its responsibilities. \nWe may be about to adopt an amendment, in my view, that takes us in the \nopposite direction.\n  I am terribly disappointed we are even debating this amendment under \nthese circumstances, a 28-page amendment involving all sorts of \nintricate matters that could complicate the role of our government at \nthis very hour, putting us in a position of walking away from \nInternational Criminal Court. That is a dreadful mistake of historic \nproportions.\n  What a tragedy, as we begin the 21st century, that this great Senate, \ngiven those who preceded us, those who fought for a Marshall plan, \nthose who fought for the establishment of the United Nations, those who \nfought for the establishment of the Court at The Hague, those who \nfought to establish rules on human rights, those whose very seats we \nsit in, we would pass an amendment contrary to their legacies. What a \nlegacy for us. We are involved in the greatest challenge that America \nhas faced since the conflict of World War II, and we may be about to \nadopt an amendment that would set back all of the efforts that were \nmade in the post-World War II period. I am ashamed, in a sense, that we \nare about to adopt language which would put our country in that \nposition.\n  At the appropriate time, I will ask my colleagues at least to \nconsider my second-degree amendment which would allow for the President \nand others to report back what we might do and how we might address \nthis issue, how we might affect the assembly that meets to establish \nthe International Criminal Court, and how we can have some positive \neffect on what rules and regulations are going to be established there.\n  That is what I would hope we would do. For those reasons, I urge the \nrejection of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from \nNorth Carolina, and support for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before my colleague from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, let me suggest to him in all sincerity that he has no reason \nto be ashamed, no reason to be ashamed of engaging in this debate, or \nin talking, as he has so proudly, about the legacy of Nuremberg and our \nNation's leadership there. Nuremberg was a unique and terrible case and \nwe addressed that issue as we should, and we did it in a most \nappropriate fashion. On other occasions, our Nation has engaged in \ninternational tribunals for specific purposes. But there is a very real \ndifference today between that which we debate in the ICC and a \nNuremberg example.\n  Nuremberg was a case in point to address the dramatic crisis coming \nout of and during World War II and those who perpetuated those \nhorrendous acts. It was a temporary tribunal. What we debate today is a \npermanent tribunal, one that stays in constant existence, one that has \nan international prosecutor, and one that chooses to operate under a \nset of laws that is constant. Not that we would ever again engage in a \ntribunal to deal with a Milosevic. We have. We will. And we should. Nor \nwould we ever again engage in tribunals that would deal with terrorists \nwho would bring acts against this country or other nations of the \nworld. We have. We will.\n  It is not that we are shucking from international leadership to \nsuggest that we will not adhere to an international perpetuated body \nthat takes away the sovereignty of our citizens and our men and women \nin uniform and our protections under the Constitution; that we should \nwalk away from, that we should be proud to walk away from.\n  That is exactly what the Senator from North Carolina is proposing \nwith his amendment. We have dealt with this issue at length. There is a \ngreat deal more that we should probably talk about, and the time is \nlimited this evening.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut talked about failing to assist \ncountries. That provision was taken out of the bill of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. If it were still in there and if it still qualified \nunder the rules of the Senate, if you go on, it says we could waive \nthat exception, that we could waive that prohibition on a selective \nbasis. Does that sound like a weak Third World nation running from its \ninternational responsibility or does that sound like a world leader \nhaving the right to pick or choose for its citizens under its \nConstitution and not the rule of the United Nations? That is what we \nare talking about. That is fundamentally the issue.\n  We all know the history of this. Even when President Clinton signed \nthis treaty in the final hours of his administration, his own words \nwere:\n\n       Significant flaws exist in this document.\n\n  Therefore, he did not send it to the Senate for ratification because \nhe knew that it had great problems and some of those problems are the \nkinds of problems that the Senator from North Carolina is attempting to \naddress. Rather it is whether or not we are fundamentally committed to \nthe sovereign rule of the domestic law of our country under the U.S. \nConstitution as opposed to global justice under U.N. auspices. I don't \nknow how to put it much clearer than that, for there can only be one \nanswer, my guess is, for the majority of my colleagues. That means the \nUnited States must stand firmly against the concept and the reality of \nan ICC.\n  No matter what we debate here today and no matter what action we \ntake, if 13 more nations ratify this under U.N. rule, this is the law \nof the world, so to speak. Therefore, whether we try to shield our own \nfrom it, it is possible still that a rogue international prosecutor, \nusing the ICC, could bring some\n\n[[Page S12618]]\n\nof our men and women in uniform or any citizen of the United States \nover 18 years of age under its jurisdiction.\n  This also means that trying to fix the treaty's flaws is in itself a \ngreat problem. Instead of mistakenly trying to fix the Rome treaty's \nflaws, the United States must recognize that the ICC is a fundamental \nthreat to American sovereignty and civil liberty and that no deal, nor \nany deal, nor any compromise in that concept and under that reality is \npossible.\n  We will engage internationally. We have and we will constantly do so. \nWe are world leaders and we are proud of that. We also understand the \nawesome responsibility that goes with it. But to suggest that we hand \nthis authority over to the United Nations and to suggest that they \nwould use it in perpetuum, in a constant and uniform manner, we saw one \nof those rogue assemblies occur in Africa recently, and we had to walk \naway from it. We had to denounce it because of its outspoken racist \narguments. It was something of which we could not be a part.\n  Is this to suggest that something similar to this could not happen or \nwould not happen in the future with this kind of a body if we don't \nhave the right to selectively choose to create, for the purpose and the \nintent at the time, an international tribunal that ought to be \nassembled for the purpose of dealing with an unjust act to humanity \naround the world? That is the issue about which we are talking. That is \nexactly the issue that the Senator from North Carolina is attempting to \naddress.\n  Have we addressed this before? Yes. Have I been to the floor before \nto speak about it? Yes. Did we address it? Most clearly, we did. In the \nCommerce, State, and Justice appropriations bill this year, we \nprohibited the use of funds for the ICC or for its preparatory \ncommission. That is the law of the land, as we speak. We passed it. We \nprovided that protection this year in this Senate. It is important that \nwe recognize that we have already made those kinds of observations.\n  It said very clearly: None of these funds appropriated or otherwise \nmade available by this act shall be available for cooperation with or \nassistance or for other support to the International Criminal Court or \npreparatory commission.\n  I don't think we could get much clearer. Use of the State \nDepartment's funds for cooperation with the ICC or the preparatory \ncommission is prohibited. That is clear. It was necessary to do. We \nspoke out as we should have on that issue.\n  Let me talk about one other very important aspect because the Senator \nfrom Connecticut appropriately addressed the circumstances of today and \nhow that all fits.\n  I do not think by our acting this evening in support of the amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina we are, in fact, turning our back on \nthe bad actors of the world, the bin Ladens or the Milosevics or the \nSaddam Husseins. Not at all. We are speaking to the direct opposite. We \nare speaking to the right of an American citizen and the American men \nand women in uniform and their protection under our law.\n  When the time comes--and it may well--to address the problems created \nby the gentlemen I have just mentioned, this country will stand up and \nask the world to stand with it for the purpose of dealing with those \nkinds of international outlaws.\n  As we develop our relationships around the world and the new \ncoalitions that our Secretary of State is trying to form at this moment \nwith Arab nations in search of terrorist groups, the renunciation of \nthis Court has nothing to do with that. Those are case-by-case, nation-\nby-nation relationships.\n  What the rest of the world knows is that we are a nation of law and \nwe protect the right of our citizens under that law within the \nConstitution. To speak out now for that purpose instead of handing it \nover to--or to arguably do so, an international body, I think speaks \nquite the opposite; that somehow we have softened, adjusted, or \nchanged.\n  No, I do not think that is what we ought to be about. More \nimportantly, I think that a loud, clear statement tonight to protect \nour men and women in uniform--and I wish we could go further to say all \nAmericans--is a right and appropriate thing. Our men and our women are \nin the deserts and the sands of Afghanistan as we speak. As the year \nplays out and as we move into the next year and the next in our pursuit \nof international terrorism, they may be somewhere else around the world \nbecause we are a world leader, and we want and hope the world will \nfollow us in our pursuit of international terrorists.\n  If that day comes, beyond the military tribunals that our President \nhas already shaped, that we need an international forum in which to \naddress this issue, that is the day we assemble it, that is the day we \nbring the United Nations and the rest of the world with us. But not \nnow, nor ever, should we arbitrarily give away the right of the \ncitizen, wherever he or she may be around the world, to have the \nprotection under our Constitution and under our law of that \nconstitutional right that a native-born American or a naturalized \nAmerican citizen has. That is the fundamental debate.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I really do not have many \ndifferences. We agree fundamentally on all of those things. I do not \nbelieve it is a negative statement to the world that we stand tall and \ndemonstrate our leadership for our citizens and our people under our \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to address this issue in the context \nof today's events. Two things in particular strike me about this \ndebate, and I want to make it clear at the beginning that I support \nSenator Helms and what he is trying to do to protect the men and women \nin our military whom we put in harm's way to fight for peace and \nsecurity from terrorism in faraway places. Before the war on terrorism \nis concluded, we are likely to find them fighting in farflung reaches \nof the globe against the scourge of terrorism.\n  What we are concerned about is the possibility that they would fall \ninto the hands of an enemy that would put them on trial under trumped-\nup charges, with very little in the way of rights before an \nInternational Criminal Court or under its jurisdiction.\n  Is this an unreasonable fear? I note some of the countries that have \nsigned up to the ICC, some real bastions of civil rights and civil \nliberties: Algeria, Cambodia, Haiti, Iran, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, \nYemen. Those would be great places to be tried in if you were in the \nAmerican military and you had been fighting some tin-horn dictator who \ngot ahold of you and decided to put you on trial.\n  To me the interesting juxtaposition in the debate that has been going \non in this country for the last 2 or 3 weeks--and we witnessed some of \nit yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which many \nliberals in the United States are very concerned about the civil rights \nof terrorists or people who are accused of terrorism and are raising \nall manner of questions about the possibility that military commissions \nestablished by the United States in furtherance of our war against \nterrorism will somehow, possibly, maybe, deny some right to a \nterrorist.\n  That is a matter of great concern to them. They have taken space in \nop-ed pages of newspapers, editorial pages of the newspapers, hours of \nconversation as talking heads on these television programs and, indeed, \neven some questions raised by Members in the Congress about what the \nUnited States proposes to do in establishing military commissions and \nhow that might deprive a terrorist or a person accused of terrorism of \nsome civil rights. Their concern for the rights of these people is \ntouching.\n  I have found it a little bit out of priority or out of sync with \npriorities. It seems the first priority of those of us who are sworn to \nprotect our constituents, our American citizens, ought to be to ensure \ntheir protection. But it was interesting that almost all of the \nquestions from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, both in \nthe hearing with Attorney General Ashcroft and the head of the Criminal \nDivision, Michael Chertoff, were not focused on ways in which we could \ngive the Justice Department or Defense Department greater tools in the \nwar on terrorism to protect Americans. Almost all of the questions were \nfocused\n\n[[Page S12619]]\n\non whether maybe we were going a little too far in the creation of \nmilitary commissions and maybe we ought to be more concerned about the \nrights of the terrorists who were going to be tried in these military \ncommissions. It is an interesting proposition, to be sure.\n  We can have that debate. It would be a lot better to have it when we \nare not at war, but at least some legitimate questions were raised. I \ncertainly take nothing from my colleagues who wanted to get to the \nbottom of what is being done. But I find it ironic on that day, \nyesterday, we can be debating with great concern over the rights of \nterrorists in a military commission, in a trial following some kind of \nmilitary action, and yet seem to be a lot less concerned about the \nplight of American military personnel who might find themselves put on \ntrial in a foreign country under an International Criminal Court \nprocedure.\n\n  The United States is not a party to this, and given the kind of \ncountries that have set it up, I think it will be a long time before we \nwill be a party because they do not have the same kind of concept of \njustice we do, they are not willing to abide by the same kind of rules \nthe United States will create for those we put on trial. Rest assured, \npeople we try will very much get a fair and full trial. It will \nprobably be a lot like the courts martial we provide for our own \nmilitary personnel.\n  What we are concerned about here is not just sovereignty, the right \nof the United States to protect its interests. We are also concerned \nabout two other things. We are concerned about protecting our young men \nand women whom we put in harm's way, in the first instance, to try to \nprotect peace and security for people and do not want to jeopardize \nthis, in the second instance, should they fall into the wrong hands and \nbe put on trial.\n  Also, paradoxically, I am concerned about the ability of the United \nStates to sustain future operations of the kinds that were engaged in \nAfghanistan today and hopefully will be engaged in other places around \nthe globe if there is a concern not that we will suffer casualties. We \nbecome very casualty averse these days. It is a wonderful thing not to \nhave the same kind of casualties we used to in war, and we are getting \nused to that.\n  I hope we would not hesitate to send in troops to fight for security \nfrom terrorism, for peace, for freedom in places we think that is \nimportant because of the threat that should our military personnel fall \ninto the wrong hands they are going to be tried by people we believe \nhave no right trying them, under procedures that would not sustain \nmuster by the United States. That is why we have not signed on to the \nICC.\n  As has been noted before, President Clinton was very concerned about \nthe inability to protect our service people under the ICC jurisdiction.\n  Running away from the world? My colleague from Connecticut and I have \nthe same view of the role of the United States being willing to reach \nout to the oppressed of the world when that also advances the interests \nof the United States, and we have never hesitated from spilling our \nblood and spending our treasure on behalf of others when we have \nbelieved that was the right and moral and just thing to do, and we have \ndone it. We have never shirked our duty.\n  Every one of us in this body supported the resolution to authorize \nthe President to once again send our young men and women into combat, \nif necessary, to protect the rights of people abroad, as well as, \nhopefully providing, for a safer world for Americans at home.\n  We will not shirk from our duties by failing to participate in a \nflawed treaty signed by the likes of Sudan and Iran and Iraq and Haiti \nand Cambodia and countries such as that. That is not my idea of \nstatesmanship, of rushing to join with these groups of people and sign \non to something that, as President Clinton has said, is fatally flawed.\n  No. We exercise leadership by saying: We are not going to play that \ngame. It is fraudulent. You all create these international regimes to \nmake yourselves look good, to make it look like you are for right, \ntruth, and justice. We know you are not, and we are not going to play \nthat game. When you get serious about negotiating the rights and \nprotections that we demand of our men and women in the military when we \nsend them abroad, then we will get serious and talk to you about this. \nUntil then, no. The United States will act in its own interest first \nprotecting its sovereignty and its own citizens.\n  We are not the leader of the world for nothing. We have gotten there \nbecause we have been willing to do this: not to be a follower but to be \na leader. To be a leader sometimes is to say to other nations such as \nthe ones I have read off, we are not going to follow you. We do not \nthink your motives are clear. We think you have it all wrong, and until \nyou are willing to listen to us about what is necessary to protect the \nrights of everyone, not just Americans but certainly Americans \nincluded, we are not going to play your game.\n  I resent the notion that failing to join up with the likes of that \ngroup of countries is somehow abdicating our responsibility. I think \nthe President of the United States has it right. He campaigned on a \ntheme and he has been working on a theme that we are going to do what \nwe believe is in the best interest of the United States, consistent \nwith the interests of other people around the world.\n  The first thing we are going to do is we are going to protect \nourselves from a weapon of mass destruction delivered by a missile from \na rogue nation. Missile defense, if you do not like it, tough. We are \ngoing to protect the American citizens from that kind of a threat.\n  Another thing we are going to do is we are going to reduce the number \nof nuclear warheads in our arsenal, and we do not have to sign a treaty \nwith anybody to do it. If it is in our best interest, we are going to \ndo it.\n\n  President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Bush get together \nand they agree this is a smart thing for both countries to do. I \nsuspect President Putin will end up doing the same thing for the \nbenefit of his country. You do not have to join up in all kinds of \nmultilateral regimes around the world in order to accomplish good \nthings, and sometimes it is not smart to do this. It is better to hold \nback and provide leadership by demonstrating that you are prepared to \ndo it in a different way, and the way some of these countries have \nthought about doing it is not the right way.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina, the \npurpose of which is to protect our military personnel from an improper, \nimperfect system that we all recognize we have to try to improve if we \nare ever going to be a part of it. Until that date comes, to ensure \nthat they are not put in harm's way--and the provisions of this \namendment will make it much more likely, it seems to me. Yes, it will \nget people's attention, and I think it will make it much more likely \nthey will sit down and negotiate responsibly with the United States so \nthat perhaps someday we can have a multilateral regime called an \ninternational criminal court.\n  Until we get to the point where our rights are respected, the country \nthat has provided more rights for more people in the history of the \nworld than any other country, until that date comes, we need to adopt \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, at this point I do not desire to prolong the \nproceedings, but so many strange statements are being made that have no \nrelationship with accuracy that I have to correct some of them.\n  Before I do that, let me say I do not have two better friends in this \nbody than Senator Biden, who is now chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--and I cannot remember who was the former chairman--and the \nfather of Grace, that little sweet thing in Connecticut. That is a \nwonderful picture he sent, and I bear him no ill will, but I wish I was \non their side on this because they are so eloquent and, if I may say \nso, they are so loud.\n  In any case, the statement they made that we have not had any \nhearings in the Foreign Relations Committee, that is strange. On \nWednesday, June 14 of last year, 2000, 3:30 p.m., Dirksen Building, \n419, the Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on the \nInternational Criminal Court protecting American servicemen and \nofficials from the threat of international prosecution. The witnesses \nincluded the Honorable Caspar W. Weinberger,\n\n[[Page S12620]]\n\nformer Secretary of Defense, and chief executive officer of Forbes, \nIncorporated. Then there is a distinguished professor, Dr. Jeremy B. \nRabkin, from the Department of Government, Cornell University, and Ruth \nWedgwood, professor of law at Yale University. That was a good hearing. \nI was there.\n  Then on Tuesday, July 20 of 1999, we had an Ambassador-at-large for \nWar Crimes Issues, the Honorable David A. Scheffer, and this was a \nclosed door hearing so that he could speak candidly and not be put on \nrecord.\n  Then on Thursday, July 23, 1998, in the Dirksen Building, the Foreign \nRelations Committee heard panel 1, the Honorable David Scheffer, \nAmbassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues, and panel 2, the Honorable \nJohn Bolton--most Senators have heard of John--Lee Casey, attorney from \nHunton & Williams, Washington, DC, and Michael P. Scharf, professor of \nlaw, Boston, MA.\n  The point is, the President of the United States wants this \namendment. He does not want a second-degree amendment to it. He wants \nthis amendment. We have worked it out with the President, and I think \nhe is entitled to have some consideration on this without a whole lot \nof gobbledegook that is meaningless and, in some cases, not even close \nto the truth.\n  I do not mind being opposed, but I hope we can lower our voices. I \nhad to turn my hearing aid down because the sound was ringing in my \nears. Can we not address this in a rational sort of way?\n  Frankly, I have my doubts about some of these judges of other \ncountries with which we do business. I will not identify the country \nbecause it is a personal matter, but there is the wife of an ambassador \nto the United States from one of our finest allies whose husband \nkidnapped their two little boys and took them to his home in a foreign \ncountry. You can't even get the courts of that foreign country to do \nanything about it--even giving the wife of this Ambassador to the \nUnited States a hearing.\n\n  This is the kind of thing we run into. I don't want our servicemen \nsubjected to any kind of inhibitions not to their benefit.\n  If anybody with a second-degree amendment can present credentials \nthat they have the support for their second-degree amendment from \nveterans organizations, veterans publications, veterans \nrepresentations, representing 5.5 million servicemen in this country, \nlet the Senators present their credentials and I will be impressed.\n  But, no, they don't agree with me on this International Criminal \nCourt. They have not done anything to move it along in the Foreign \nAffairs Committee despite my exhortations. And I understand that. The \nlegislative process works that way, and I don't get my feelings hurt if \nI don't get my way on things. But I will be here until midnight before \nI submit to the suggestion that this amendment ought not be approved by \nthe Senate.\n  I hope we can move along without so much waste of time, but I would \nhope that any Senator who wants to attack this amendment will tell why \nhe is disagreeing with the President of the United States. I want him \nto present his credentials as to the support from servicemen and \nservice organizations representing 5.5 million people. If they can \npresent the credentials, I will back up and not push the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment. In my view, the International Criminal Court, as established \nunder the Rome statute of 1998, represents a unique opportunity to \nbring justice to the international community and to help in the fight \nagainst future war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity. \nThat is an important mission.\n  The Rome statute is the result of 5 years of negotiations by more \nthan 100 countries. The United States was an active leader in these \nnegotiations. Frankly, after years of support for the process, leading \nto the Court's formation, it is unwise to turn our backs on it now. If \nproperly implemented, the ICC would go a long way toward preventing \ncatastrophes such as those we recently witnessed in Bosnia, East Timor, \nand Rwanda. The ICC is not going to prevent all future human rights \nviolations but it can deter those who would commit genocide, punish \nthose who do, and offer justice instead of revenge and contribute to a \nprocess of peace and reconciliation.\n  Now, there are Senators who have asserted today that the \nInternational Criminal Court is part of the United Nations. It is a \ncommon mistake. For the record, the Court will be independent from the \nUnited Nations and governed and funded by its own assembly of state \nparties. Jurisdiction, judicial decisionmaking, and legal authority \nwill be given only to this independent Court, not to the United \nNations.\n  What is more, some of my colleagues in the Senate have opposed the \nRome statute because they fear that the ICC will expose American \nservice men and women abroad to frivolous prosecution. But American \nnegotiators, led by Ambassador David Scheffer, have achieved remarkable \nprogress during the treaty negotiations to effectively address these \nconcerns. Any prosecution before the ICC would take place only if the \ndomestic judicial system were unwilling or unwilling to make a good-\nfaith inquiry into allegations of war crimes. I cannot emphasize this \npoint strongly enough.\n\n  This amendment would restrict the role of the United States in future \npeacekeeping missions unless the United Nations exempts U.S. troops \nfrom the Court. It would also prohibit U.S. aid and input into the \nCourt and block U.S. aid to allies unless they agree to shield American \ntroops on their soil from ICC prosecution.\n  The timing of this amendment could not be worse. As the world unites \nto combat terrorism, we should be active partners in encouraging an end \nto impunity for human rights violators, not skeptical detractors. We \nneed a place where perpetrators of human rights abuses are held \naccountable. In passing the Helms amendment, I fear we will be sending \na horrible message to the international community. It is as if we \ncannot even be involved in the negotiations, sitting down at the table \nand helping to shape what could be such an important institution.\n  The Court will be established whether we like it or not. The \nauthority of the future Court derives from the 120 votes garnered in \nRome, the signatures subsequently of 137 nations and ratifications of \n47 states. All members of NATO, the European Union and most in Latin \nAmerica have signed or ratified. Recently the United Kingdom and \nSwitzerland became the 42nd and 43rd countries to ratify, and Hungary \nbecame the 47th nation to do so.\n  Given these realities, we should oppose this amendment, hastening \ninstead to assure the Court is a good one, inculcating the American \nvalues of democracy, rules of law, and an end to impunity. The United \nStates should remain engaged while protecting American citizens and \nmilitary people from politicized prosecution by the International \nCriminal Court or by any other foreign tribunal.\n  If America turns its back on the negotiations, and the Helms \namendment would make it impossible for us to be involved in the \nnegotiations, this opportunity to secure international justice will be \nlost. Only through engagement, which this amendment makes impossible, \ncan the United States live up to the truly inescapable promise of \n``never again.''\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the debate this afternoon has covered a \ngood many issues of real importance and concern to the United States \nand to the world. However, I suggest that the preferable approach would \nbe for the United States to participate, to try to make the rules of \nthe International Criminal Court satisfactory to the national interests \nof the United States, and to establish a framework for the rule of law \nin the world.\n  There is no doubt that the United States is going to act in what is \nin the United States' national interests. That is a fundamental rule of \nhow nations behave and should behave. There are real problems which \ncould be posed by an international criminal court and which are now \npresent, for example, in the War Crimes Tribunal on Yugoslavia. It is \nnot well-known that Carla\n\n[[Page S12621]]\n\ndel Ponte, the prosecutor at The Hague, considered a criminal \nprosecution against General Wesley Clark for targeting civilians and \nfor being careless in the targeting of military installations which \nthreaten civilians. That consideration was undertaken by the prosecutor \nat The Hague, the War Crimes Tribunal for Yugoslavia, on the initiation \nof Yugoslavia, backed by Russia.\n  I had an opportunity last January to talk to prosecutor Carla del \nPonte about that and expressed surprise that someone like General \nClark, who was acting on behalf of NATO and carrying out air strikes \nthat were authorized by this body, the Senate, could be subject to that \nkind of a criminal prosecution for what was essentially an action \nauthorized by the United States, authorized by the United Nations, and \nauthorized by NATO. That kind of power in the hands of the prosecutor \nis really extraordinary.\n\n  As is generally known, I have had some experience as prosecuting \nattorney--having been District Attorney for Philadelphia for some 8 \nyears, and having seen the kind of discretionary actions that a \nprosecutor can take when it is a matter of interpreting facts.\n  When we talk about soldiers in the United States who are in harm's \nway being subject to criminal prosecution, that certainly is a problem, \nand a real problem. However, what we need to do, in my opinion, is work \nto structure an international criminal court which makes sense, which \ndoes not subject U.S. soldiers, or General Clark, or perhaps Senators \nwho vote on a resolution to authorize air strikes, to criminal \nprosecution. However, the International Criminal Court, I believe, is \ncoming. If 13 more nations ratify the International Criminal Court \ntreaty, it purports to come into existence.\n  Frankly, I do not think even if it comes into existence it is going \nto be able, as a matter of operational practice, to subject General \nClark, U.S. soldiers, or U.S. personnel to prosecution unless somebody \nhappens to be in a country and is detained somewhere. I think that \nwould be a most extraordinary and unlikely event. However, we do see \nquite a trend in the international rule of law with the court for \nYugoslavia and the court for Rwanda.\n  It is my hope that we can find a way to see it structured so that it \ndoes not inappropriately subject people to criminal prosecution.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Carolina is very detailed. It \nprohibits extradition. I do not know if you need another law that \nprohibits extradition. If the United States does not have an \nextradition treaty with the International Criminal Court, or a body \nwhich represents it, there is no extradition. You have to have a treaty \nfor that which talks about letters of interrogatory, which I do not \nthink is highly significant as an evidence-gathering measure. However, \nthere is a provision here to free members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States and other persons who are detained, and a provision which \nsays, ``The President is authorized to use all means necessary and \nappropriate to bring about the release of any person''--and it has a \ndescription. I do not know that we really want to be in a situation \nwhere the United States is going to go to war with the International \nCriminal Court, which is somewhat reminiscent of the resolution of the \nuse of force, which we passed on the terrorism issue.\n  The International Criminal Court was considered at some length in a \nresolution sponsored by the Senator from Connecticut and myself in the \nearly 1980s, at a time when we were dealing with international drug \ntrafficking, and we were finding it impossible to get Colombia to turn \nover drug traffickers to the United States for prosecution in our \ncourts.\n  It was a matter of national pride that Colombia and other Latin \nAmerican countries were not about to turn their citizens over to the \nUnited States for trial in our courts. However, had there been an \ninternational court, I think that might have been achieved.\n  We had a similar problem in the mid-1980s with terrorists when we \ncould identify the terrorists. At that time, I urged that the United \nStates take forceful action in international law to go and arrest \nterrorists, which we had a right to do as a matter of national self-\ndefense. We had a right to arrest Osama bin Laden before September 11th \nthis year based on the indictments which were obtained for murdering \nAmericans in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993, and for murdering Americans in \nthe embassies in Africa in 1998. We were on notice that Osama bin Laden \nhad threatened America with a worldwide jihad, that he was implicated \nin the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and other acts of terrorism and \nsabotage.\n\n  Thomas Friedman wrote an article which appeared in the newspapers \nabout Osama bin Laden on June 28 that was a facetious memorandum from \nbin Laden to the world about how he had scared the United States out of \nJordan and out of the Mideast; and, about his operatives talking on \ncellular phones. He was well known.\n  We had a right at that time to bring him to trial in U.S. courts. \nPerhaps if there had been an international criminal court, there would \nhave been some unity or some coalition with which we could have acted. \nThere are many desirable uses for an international criminal court. It \nhas been talked about for a long time.\n  The Senator from Connecticut talked at length about the Nuremburg \ntrials, which I will not repeat. When this court arrives with 13 more \nratifications--and I remind the one or two people who might be \nlistening on C-SPAN II--that the United States was formed under an \narrangement where if nine of the colonies ratified the Constitution, it \nwas binding on all. We should not be surprised if you have an \ninstrument establishing a court, which is binding under its terms, if \nit is ratified by a specified number.\n  Again, it is a different situation. You might say that the colonies \nhad sovereignty. However, under the terms of the Framers of the \nConstitution, all 13 would be bound upon nine signatures. National \nsovereignty is a very precious item. I am not about to be one to give \nit up. I am not about to allow Carla del Ponte to indict Wesley Clark \nfor what he did in carrying out the resolution passed by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  However, we have an opportunity to influence what that document will \nbe. I think the Senator from North Carolina serves a very important \npurpose in posing the threats to American national interests. The \nSenator from Arizona, and the Senator from Idaho have spoken about \nthese matters. However, I do not think the answer is prohibiting U.S. \naction, which is what this amendment does.\n  I think the answer is aggressive participation. If Senator Helms and \nSenator Kyl go to these conventions and participate--and Senator Dodd \nand I will stay at home--we can influence what these documents will be. \nI think it will ultimately be in our national interest, and certainly \nin the world's interest, if we had a criminal court so we can try \ninternational drug dealers and international terrorists. It might \nprovide a forum for bringing to justice Osama bin Laden.\n  My hope is that we will be participants to see that it is done right \nas opposed to prohibiting U.S. action to see that it is done right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the Helms amendment \nregarding U.S. policy concerning the establishment of an International \nCriminal Court in the future. The Helms amendment, in my judgement, \ngoes too far. The amendment offered by Senator Helms would authorize \nthe use of military force against a friendly country, the Netherlands, \nwhere the court might exist, in order to remove a foreign citizen from \nprison, even if the country of which that person is a citizen might not \nwant that removal.\n  I supported the alternative amendment offered by Senator Dodd which \nwould have required the President to report to the Congress on any \nadditional legislative actions necessary to advance and protect U.S. \ninterests as it relates to the establishment of an International \nCriminal Court.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nintroduced by my dear colleague, Senator Helms. As my friend has noted \ntoday, I have been an original cosponsor of this legislation since he \nfirst introduced this in 2000. I commend my colleague for his \ncommitment to the policy behind this amendment, for his persistence in \npromoting it, and on his efforts--successful, I am happy to note--to \ncraft a piece of legislation that has the support of the \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S12622]]\n\n  I offer a little bit of background: On July 17, 1998, a United \nNations conference in Rome approved a treaty establishing the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). 120 countries voted in favor of the \ntreaty, seven countries--including the United States and Israel--voted \nagainst the treaty, and 21 abstained. Pursuant to the Rome Treaty, the \ncourt is intended to come into existence when 60 countries ratify the \ntreaty. Forty-seven countries have ratified as of November 30 of this \nyear, leaving 13 nations' ratifications necessary for the treaty to \ncome into force.\n  If established, the International Criminal Court will have the power \nto indict, prosecute, and imprison persons who, anywhere in the world, \nare accused by the Court of ``war crimes,'' ``crimes against \nhumanity,'' and ``genocide.'' The court will have an independent \nprosecutor, answerable to no state or institution for his or her \nactions. Pursuant to the Rome statute, the ICC will be able to claim \njurisdiction to try and imprison American citizens--including U.S. \nmilitary personnel and U.S. Government officials--even if the United \nStates has not signed or ratified the Rome Treaty.\n  Arguing that it was necessary to prevent the exclusion of the U.S. \nfrom future negotiations about how the ICC would operate, President \nClinton signed the Rome Treaty on December 31, 2000, which was the \nclose of the period for signature. Tellingly, he said on December 31 \nthat he would not send the treaty to the Senate for ratification and \nwould recommend that President Bush not transmit it either, given its \nremaining flaws. It is reasonable to question exactly what President \nClinton intended by such a deliberately ambiguous act with such clearly \ndefined consequences for government officials and members of the U.S. \nmilitary who would go overseas under future Commanders-in-Chief.\n  The Senate has gone on record numerous times opposing the ICC. Last \nJune, the American Service Members Protection Act of 2000 was \nintroduced, and I was an original cosponsor. This act, now an amendment \nto this Defense appropriations bill, addresses our fundamental problem \nwith the ICC: It represents, in legislation vetted and approved by the \ncurrent commander-in-chief, that U.S. forces, which serve around the \nworld in numerous peacekeeping and other roles, as well as American \npolitical leaders, must remain immune from prosecutions that could \npolitically driven, prosecutions that could be directed more against \nour foreign policy than any possible violations of international law.\n  This amendment prohibits U.S. cooperation with the court, including \nuse of taxpayer funding or sharing of classified information. It \nrestricts U.S. involvement in peacekeeping missions unless the U.N. \nspecifically exempts U.S. troops from prosecution by the International \nCriminal Court. It limits U.S. aid to allies unless they also sign \naccords to shield U.S. troops on their soil from being turned over to \nthe court, and it authorizes the President to take necessary action to \nrescue any U.S. soldiers who may be improperly handed over to that \nCourt. The policy promoted in this amendment is not anti-U.N., and it \nis certainly not against U.S. involvement in the world. But it is \nimpossible to deny that America has a unique role in the world, and a \nunique form of self-government. Today, it is this country that leads \nthe world in a battle against those who would use terrorism against us \nand our many allies and friends. While we go forth in this war to \ndefend our national security, there is no denying that our victories--\nand we will be victorious--will be shared by those who hate terrorism \nas much as we do.\n  No country has done more than the United States to prevent and punish \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. No country is doing more than \nthe United States to support multilateral peacekeeping efforts. And \nnowhere on earth do people enjoy greater civil liberties and personal \nfreedom than in the United States.\n  The American people will never accept the direct assault on their \ncountry's sovereignty represented by the Rome statute. The statute's \nnotion that Americans may be indicted, seized, tried or imprisoned \npursuant to an agreement which their country has not accepted is an \nunprecedented affront to their national sovereignty and a threat to \ntheir individual freedoms. The Rome statute lacks procedural \nprotections to which all Americans are entitled under the Constitution, \nincluding the right to trial by jury, protection from self-\nincrimination, and the right to confront and cross-examine all \nprosecution witnesses. This amendment, so diligently negotiated with \nthe administration by my friend, Senator Helms, declares to all \nAmericans that you may all rest assured that the Government will always \nbe obliged to protect--and if necessary, to rescue-- American soldiers \nand civilians from criminal prosecutions staged by United Nations \nofficials under procedures which deny them their basic, hard-won \nconstitutional rights.\n  My comment to the world leaders and do-gooding groups who promote the \nICC is simply this: Do you favor American leadership in international \nhumanitarian crises? If so, beware: entry into force of the Rome \nstatute, and establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court, \nwill jeopardize American leadership because politically-driven \nprosecutions are a certainty and American soldiers and public officials \ncan expect to become political pawns. Americans will not tolerate this.\n  As President Clinton's own Rome statute negotiator rightly observed, \nthe notion that Americans are bound by something to which they have not \nconsented is contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty law. \nUnchallenged, the ICC will inhibit the ability of the United States to \nuse its armed forces to meet alliance obligations and participate in \nmultinational operations, including humanitarian interventions, to save \ncivilian lives. The policy of this amendment has been endorsed by a \nbipartisan group of former senior U.S. officials, including Henry \nKissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Brent \nScowcroft, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Casper Weinberger, and James Waals.\n  It has been said that the Rome statute is some kind of ``litmus \ntest'' for American seriousness about war crimes and genocide. No \nparticipant in this debate who is worthy of our attention will make \nsuch an accusation, which is as offensive as it is false.\n  From Pearl Harbor to the Adriatic Sea, American has given its blood \nand treasure to stop mass murderers in conflicts we didn't start. \nToday, America's best are fighting halfway around the world, attacking \nat its core a terrorist infrastructure that reaches to every part of \nthe world. Tomorrow, we don't know yet where our brave service members \nwill be, but we know that the fight for terrorism will not end in \nAfghanistan, and we know that America's finest will be risking their \nlives elsewhere. These brave members of our armed services are giving \nenough for this country, for western civilization. Let us not add to \ntheir concerns the possibility that, as they do their noble duty, they \nneed be concerned about legal threats that do not represent the \nConstitution that they have sworn to protect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina on the International Criminal \nCourt.\n  In addition to being damaging to the cause of international justice, \nthis amendment could not come at a worse time. The administration is \nmoving heaven and earth to maintain a coalition against terrorism and \nhold accountable those responsible for some of the most heinous acts \never committed on American soil. As a Congress, we are working to stay \nunited on foreign policy and support the Administration in this effort. \nOver the past several months, Senators from both sides of the aisle \nhave withheld from offering controversial foreign policy amendments on \ntopics from missile defense to the embargo against Cuba. It is \nunfortunate that the Senator from North Carolina has chosen to offer an \namendment that ignites strong feelings from its supporters and \nopponents, alike.\n  The ICC is a divisive issue between the United States and our closest \nallies. Virtually every member of the European Union and NATO has \nexpressed its strong support for the court. In fact, Great Britain, our \nclosest ally and full partner in the ongoing military effort against \nthe Taliban, ratified the Treaty earlier this fall. Morever, the EU \nrecently sent a letter to Secretary\n\n[[Page S12623]]\n\nPowell opposing ASPA which reads: ``. . . States which support the \ncourt and value their relations with the United States should not have \nto make a choice between the two.''\n  At a time when we should be working to resolve differences with our \nfriends, the Helms amendment does exactly the opposite by inflaming \nthese divisions and forcing the United States to adopt an openly \nhostile stance against the ICC.\n  I want to mention just a few of the specific problems with this \namendment. First, the amendment authorizes the use of force to free \nofficials from not only the United States but also from foreign \ncountries, if they are indicted and held by the court. Let me repeat \nthat: This amendment authorizes the use of military force by the United \nStates, from now until the end of time, to free foreign not only United \nStates citizens, if they are in the court's custody.\n  While these nations are important allies, suppose some members of \ntheir militaries or intelligence services commit heinous crimes that \nfall within the jurisdiction of the court and are being rightfully \ndetained? As a Congress do we want to authorize a military invasion of \nThe Hague, risking the lives of United States military personnel, to \nfree indicted war criminals? The Helms amendment would cut off military \nassistance to a number of nations, including Tajikistan and South \nAfrica.\n\n  What if we wanted to upgrade an aircraft control tower in Tajikistan \nto help land United States planes that are carrying United States \ntroops to Afghanistan? What about providing military assistance to \nSouth Africa to help spearhead a peacekeeping mission in Africa to \nwhich we did not want to commit United States troops?\n  What about providing C-130 spare parts to a Nation that has ratified \nthe ICC treaty, but wants to help airlift humanitarian aid to a region \neffected by famine? In addition, the amendment makes America a \npotential safe haven for war criminals by prohibiting the United States \nfrom turning over indicted war criminals residing on our soil. It would \nalso place restrictions on United States participation in peacekeeping \nmissions.\n  We all want to pass legislation that will enhance the safety and \nsecurity of our military personnel. But, this bill increases tensions \nwith our allies and works against our efforts to maintain a coalition \nagainst terrorism. If anything, this will make our military personnel \nless safe.\n  If the goal of this amendment is to prevent the International \nCriminal Court from getting the necessary ratifications to come into \nexistence, it is almost certain to fail. It would require a head-to-\nhead confrontation with our European allies and over 80 countries \noutside of Europe that have signed, but not yet ratified the treaty, \nand require us to be almost 100 percent successful. More importantly, \nthe United States, to which the whole world looks for leadership on \nhuman rights, should not be engaged in a fruitless effort to undermine \na court that will bring to justice those responsible for committing war \ncrimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity.\n  Instead, we should be actively engaged with the court to ensure that \nit operates in a way that protects the rights of American \nservicemembers and promotes our values and interests.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and that is where this amendment belongs.\n  This is the wrong amendment at the wrong time. I urge my colleagues \nto vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nTexas would want to speak--for what period of time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not sure. I would like to be recognized. I don't \nthink I am going to speak very long. If you want to set a time limit on \nit, I would say 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a time \nlimitation of 60 minutes equally divided between Senators Dodd and \nHelms, or their designees, and that part of the Helms 30 minutes--10 \nminutes--go to the Senator from Texas; that Senator Dodd also have a \ncomplement of time which he would designate; that the two amendments be \nconsidered first-degree amendments, at the conclusion or yielding back \nof the time the Senate vote on or in relation to Senator Dodd's \namendment; that upon the disposition of that amendment, the Senate vote \non or in relation to Senator Helms' amendment, and that no other \namendments be in order to either amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Might I just say to my colleague as well, the majority whip \nsaid 60 minutes. We may not need 60 minutes. I do not know how much \ntime the Senator from North Carolina would like, but I do not imagine \n30 minutes will be necessary on our side. So maybe because of the hour, \nwe may terminate debate a little earlier and yield back time and \nactually vote earlier.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, originally we got 40 minutes, but \nI wanted to make sure you had enough time to respond.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  I know the Senator from Texas wants to be heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator may want to speak first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will take a couple minutes to respond to \njust a couple things, if I could.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his eloquent comments, and my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, who is far more knowledgeable than the \nSenator from Connecticut on these matters generally, and has offered \nsome very wise counsel on how we ought to proceed.\n  I think having this debate helps. I am not suggesting it does not. \nBut I am deeply concerned about proceeding with an amendment of some 28 \npages now. I do not know if anyone can tell you with any certainty what \nit does. I am concerned about what I think it does. It may do more than \nI think it does, which would worry me.\n  I have offered, and will describe shortly, a substitute or \nalternative amendment which we will vote on which lays out a framework \nby which we might approach this issue of the Rome Treaty in a \nconstructive way.\n  I guess it is a matter of choice. If you take the view that under no \ncircumstances should there be an International Criminal Court, you \nshould vote for Senator Helms' amendment. I am not arguing there are \nthose who do not have a point of view that there should be no \nInternational Criminal Court. That is a legitimate point of view.\n  If your view is there probably should be, but it ought to be set up \nin a framework that makes sense, that guarantees the kind of \nprotections that my colleagues have talked about today, that would \nallow for the civilized world to prosecute international thugs, then, \nit seems to me, we bear responsibility to help that along and not \nretard it here by taking the position of adopting language which makes \nit impossible for us to participate in the creation of such an \ninstitution.\n  That is my point. There are details of it where I see us taking a \ngiant step backwards today. At the very moment, we are trying to get \npeople around the globe to understand that our value system, our idea \nof justice, is a good system and that we would like to see those values \nincorporated in an international court. But it is awfully difficult to \nadvance the cause of your own values if you are not in the room to make \nthe case. I do not want to rely on some of the countries that I see on \nthis list that have ratified this treaty to advance that cause.\n  Now some I have great faith in. As I pointed out, 139 countries have \nsigned this. Now I am told some 42 countries have ratified it, every \nmember of the European Union, 18 of the 19 members of NATO.\n  My friend from Arizona cited a couple of countries that I know none \nof us bear much allegiance to in any sense at all. But it is also \nworthwhile to point out to our colleagues that our NATO allies have \nsigned this. They have troops that go into these conflict areas. Are \nthey all wrong? Are they all wrong? I do not think so.\n  Is it all right, this treaty? No. I will repeat again, if that treaty \narrived through that door this afternoon, and we had an up-or-down vote \non it, I\n\n[[Page S12624]]\n\nwould vote against it because I think it is flawed. But I do not think \nit is so flawed that we cannot improve it and make it work for our \ninterests.\n  You cannot play on the international field and walk away from this \nissue. I guess that is the line of distinction I would make.\n  My colleagues know that I have a great sense of pride about my \nfather. My father served as the Executive Trial Counsel at Nuremberg. I \ncannot tell you the times I heard him say: Had there been an \ninternational court in the 1920s and 1930s, just maybe, he said, just \nmaybe--he never directly predicted with absolute certainty--but just \nmaybe Adolf Hitler might have been stopped before he caused the \ndestruction he did in Europe because there was no place to really bring \nthe issue. And so his advance--this crushing of neighboring countries \nand the destruction of human life--went on unabated until the United \nStates and our allies successfully prosecuted the end of World War II.\n  But had there been a place, had there been someplace in the world \nthat we could have brought an Adolf Hitler when he first started, my \nfather always thought, just maybe--just maybe--we might have saved \nmillions of lives.\n  So when my friends today say this court is flawed, and therefore we \nare going to enact legislation now that penalizes those who are trying \nto make it work, I do not understand the logic of that. I really do \nnot.\n  It seems to me, if we are worried about our men and women in uniform, \nthe idea somehow that this institution, this international court, \nflawed as it is, is not going to exist, is terribly naive. And the very \nconcerns that are being expressed about our men and women in uniform \nbecome more real if this court ends up looking like its opponents claim \nit will. There is nothing here that will prohibit that servicemen and \nwomen from being caught in that snare.\n  At home in the United States, existing law prohibits the extradition \nor transfer of U.S. citizens to the International Criminal Court. That \nis already the law of the land. So if you are in the United States, you \ncannot be extradited under existing law.\n  But the idea that somehow because we adopt this amendment--which \ncauses us to step away from all this, walk away from our involvement--\nthat it is going to somehow give greater protection to that private or \ncorporal or sergeant out there in some God-forsaken land defending our \ninterests is naive. In fact, we put that individual at greater risk \nbecause we are not in the room trying to shape what this court looks \nlike.\n  If, in fact, someone does get apprehended, and they end up in a \nkangaroo court, we will be responsible, in a way, because we walked \naway from the responsibility of trying to shape that institution. You \ncannot complain about the makeup of the institution if you do not \nparticipate in the creation of it.\n  We have been offered a chair at that table, and we are walking away. \nAnd when you do, then, it seems to me, you bear some responsibility for \nwhat that institution ultimately adopts, and whether or not it affects \nthe citizens of your country.\n  Stay at the table. Try to change it. At the end, you may not be able \nto. Then it is their fault. But you cannot walk away from the table, \nand then have your people caught, and then say: That is not my \nresponsibility. That is not a legitimate answer to this question.\n  So the Senator from Pennsylvania has offered what appears to be sound \nadvice. That is what our amendment will offer, in a sense.\n  Very briefly, I will read the amendment to my colleagues. There are \ncertain findings in the first section. It is very brief. It says:\n\n       (1) The Rome Statute establishing an International Criminal \n     Court will not enter into force for several years:\n       (2) The Congress has great confidence in President Bush's \n     ability to effectively protect US interests and the interests \n     of American citizens and service members as it relates to the \n     International Criminal Court; and\n       (3) The Congress believes that Slobodan Milosovic, Saddam \n     Hussein or any other individual who commits crimes against \n     humanity should be brought to justice and that the President \n     should have sufficient flexibility to accomplish that goal, \n     including the ability to cooperate with foreign tribunals and \n     other international legal entities that may be established \n     for that purpose on a case by case basis.\n\n  And lastly, it calls for a report:\n\n       The President shall report to the Congress on any \n     additional legislative actions necessary to advance and \n     protect US interests as it relates to the establishment of \n     the International Criminal Court or the prosecution of crimes \n     against humanity.\n\n  That, seems to me, to be a more logical way to proceed than some 28-\npage amendment that has us cutting off aid, not participating in \npeacekeeping, not allowing us to even participate in proceedings when \nU.S. citizens or other people have committed crimes against our own \ncountry. Those are things that at least appear to be the case on the \nface of the amendment as it is offered by my colleague from North \nCarolina.\n\n  Lastly--and then I will yield the floor for a moment--I want to read \na letter from Elie Wiesel. I think all of our colleagues know of Elie \nWiesel, the Nobel laureate, distinguished writer, humanitarian, who was \nhimself a survivor of the Holocaust.\n  When a similar piece of legislation was being considered by the other \nbody, Elie Wiesel wrote the following letter:\n\n       Dear Ben and Sam--\n\n  Chairman and ranking member of the committee in the other body--\n     I too am concerned with the safety of United States \n     servicemen abroad. But I am confident that we will be able to \n     protect them. And so, bringing a war criminal to justice \n     remains urgent.\n       Fifty years ago, the United States led the world in the \n     prosecution of Nazi leaders for the atrocities of World War \n     II. The triumph of Nuremburg was not only that individuals \n     were held accountable for their crimes, but that they were \n     tried in a court of law supported by the community of \n     nations. Before you today in committee is a bill that would \n     erase this legacy of US leadership by ensuring that the US \n     will never again join the community of nations to hold \n     accountable those who commit war crimes and genocide.\n       A vote for this legislation would signal US acceptance of \n     impunity for the world's worst atrocities. For the memory of \n     the victims of the past genocide and war crimes, I urge you \n     to use your positions . . . on the International Relations \n     Committee to see that this legislation is not passed.\n\n  It is signed ``Elie Wiesel.''\n  I will yield the floor at this point and listen to the remainder of \nthe arguments. I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, to consider \nthe proposal we will lay before them which allows us to go on record \nexpressing a concern and a desire to have this Court work better.\n  If you think there ought to be no court whatsoever, that there is no \nlegitimate purpose for an international criminal court, I urge you to \nvote for the Helms amendment. If you think there is an importance in \nthe 21st century for a court to exist and that the United States ought \nto participate in the shaping of that court, I urge Members to support \nthe amendment we will offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if there has been a debate this year that \nis about what our values are, this debate is about what our values are. \nI have to say, I am kind of taken aback that for the last 3 weeks every \ntime I have turned on the radio or television, we have had people \ntalking about how concerned they are about the process whereby the \nPresident would use a system of military justice against brutal \nterrorists and murderers who supported those who seized airplanes and \nattacked the United States of America, killing our women and children \nin our own country.\n  Somehow there is this great wave of supposed constitutional concern \nabout trying brutal murderers who are terrorists in military courts. \nAnd yet when Senator Helms and Senator Miller offer an amendment which \nguarantees that American soldiers abroad, who are defending our \ninterests, defending our freedom, risking and giving their lives, \nserving our country abroad, that they could be subject to being brought \nbefore an international court where no judge is an American, no \nprocedure was established by an American Congress, no constitutional \nguarantees apply, it seems to me this debate is about as clear cut as \nit can be clear cut.\n  We ought to have an international court to try people like Adolf \nHitler. But when I send my son or you send your son or your daughter \ninto the military to serve our country, they should not be subject to \nbeing brought\n\n[[Page S12625]]\n\nbefore an international tribunal. That is the issue, pure and simple. \nIt can't be more basic than that.\n  I would have to say that I would find it absolutely impossible to \njustify to a mother or father in my State who had sent their child to \nAfghanistan to fight and perhaps die for our freedom, if they ended up \nbefore some international court where no judge was an American, \napplying procedures that no American Congress ever applied, and denying \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  There are a lot of debates we can have. One of the things we are \ngoing to have to come to grips with is to what extent these \ninternational tribunals apply to Americans, because we have rights as \nAmericans under our Constitution, and those rights cannot be delegated \nto somebody else, to some other jurisdiction. There is no jurisdiction \non this Earth in a temporal sense that stands above the Constitution of \nthe United States. No international court, no international body, no \ntemporal authority stands above the Constitution of the United States.\n  That is a bigger issue than the issue we are debating here. Senator \nHelms and Senator Miller are not today debating whether Americans in \ngeneral should fall under the jurisdiction of international courts. \nThey are talking about a very select group of people who put on the \nuniform, who raise their right hand and swear to uphold, protect, and \ndefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and \nyet we are debating whether the Constitution defends them. We ask them \nto swear allegiance to the Constitution, put on the uniform, go to \nAfghanistan, and then potentially they could stand naked, in terms of \ntheir rights, before an international tribunal and not have \nconstitutional protections. That is an absurdity.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says in the clearest possible \nterms, so no one could misunderstand: No American serving abroad in the \nuniform of this country can be tried before an international tribunal. \nIf they violate the law, they will be tried under the law and under the \nConstitution, either in an American military court or in an American \ncivil or criminal court. This is not a complicated issue. This is a \nvery clear issue.\n\n  I thank Senator Helms. I thank Senator Miller. This is a decision we \nshould have made a long time ago.\n  The idea that somehow we are going to try to work out these rules, \nsomehow we are going to try to negotiate this--I am not interested in \nnegotiating the constitutional rights of people who are at this moment \nfighting and dying in a foreign country to defend the Constitution. \nTheir constitutional rights are nonnegotiable. There is no tribunal on \nEarth, other than one constituted under the Constitution of the United \nStates, that would have jurisdiction over my son fighting in a foreign \ncountry defending our freedom. That is just simple and straightforward.\n  I think Americans would be astounded that there could be any question \nabout that. The problem is not, is the Court good? Is the Court bad? Is \nthe Court reasonable? Is the Court unreasonable? Are these good men who \nare judges or good women? Are the prosecutors fair? Are the jurors \nobjective? Those are completely irrelevant. No study of how to improve \nthe Court is at all relevant in this debate. The question is \njurisdiction, and they have no jurisdiction over anyone who puts on the \nuniform of this country and swears to uphold, protect, and defend the \nConstitution.\n  If they are defending the Constitution, I want the Constitution to \ndefend them. I don't want them tried under any jurisdiction that is not \nbound by the Constitution.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a second on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield. Could I yield on the Senator's time \nbecause mine is limited?\n  Mr. DODD. Whatever time, we will work it out later.\n  I say to my colleague, we have status of force agreements around the \nworld. I am sure my colleague is aware, who served on the Armed \nServices Committee, that we have status of force agreements. There are \nU.S. servicemen all the time who are tried in local courts in other \ncountries. We are not breaking ground here. We have known about those \ncases. We read about them, tragically, when they occur. We have those \nagreements whenever we place troops in various places--Japan being the \nmost recent example.\n  I don't mind your argument. But to suggest somehow that men and women \nin uniform are never subjected to any jurisdiction of a foreign land \nwhere the courts and the laws may be substantially different than what \nwe have is not the law of the land is absurd.\n  I am not interested in seeing laws adopted here that subject our men \nand women in uniform to foreign laws, but we do that already, it seems \nto me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if I could regain control of my time, I \nthank the Senator for raising this point. Let me make the following \npoint:\n  These circumstances occur when first of all, we have negotiated \nagreements with these countries whereby service personnel stationed on \na friendly basis in these countries will be subject to local law, they \nare defended by American defense attorneys, and they ultimately have \ntheir rights protected through these guarantees.\n  We are not talking about people in Somalia, and we are not talking \nabout Americans in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator read a book, which is being made into a \nmovie, ``Black Hawk Down?''\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I recommend it highly. Because of the situation the \nAmerican special forces were in, they had to kill thousands. They \nkilled thousands as they fought their way out. I would not like to see \nthose Americans before a tribunal composed of Somali Government people.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may conclude--other people want to debate--here is my \npoint. When we sent American troops to serve in Japan and to serve in \nKorea, we negotiated agreements whereby they could be tried for local \noffenses by local authorities. But that is a world apart from when we \nsend marines into Somalia and when we send marines and special forces \ninto Afghanistan.\n  That is the issue about which we are talking. We are talking about \nthe jurisdiction of International Criminal Court set up by a treaty \nthat we have not ratified, and we are talking about American military \npersonnel wearing the uniform of this country. All the amendment by \nSenator Helms and Senator Miller does is say that American service \npersonnel cannot be tried before this Court. No judge is an American, \nno procedure is set by Americans or negotiated by them. We have not \nratified the treaty. It is imperative we adopt this amendment, and I \nhave every confidence we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the point I was trying to make is we \nnegotiated status agreements with these countries to guarantee and \nprotect the rights of men and women in uniform. But in an international \ncriminal court there will be negotiations--and we are walking away--to \nprotect the very issues my colleague from Texas raises.\n  By not participating, of course, without being at the table, we are \nnot there to protect our people.\n  We are making the assumption that with the adoption of this \namendment, this is going to go away. It does not go away. That is the \npoint I was making.\n  Just as we negotiated status arrangements with individual countries \non how our men and women in uniform will be treated so they will not \nlose their rights under local civilian courts, what I am suggesting \nthis afternoon is that we ought to do the very same thing in \nnegotiating at the table over this International Criminal Court.\n  In not being there there is a far greater likelihood our men and \nwomen in uniform are going to be subjected to terrible rules. We have \nto be there, just as we had to negotiate the status agreements of how \nmen and women in uniform are treated in Japan. We have seen cases \nthere, and had we not negotiated agreements, Lord knows what would have \nhappened to them. We did not say to Japan: You are going to take it or \nleave it or we are going to rip the people out of your courts. No. We \nsat down and said: This is how it will work.\n\n  This is not a debate about who worries about men and women in \nuniform.\n\n[[Page S12626]]\n\n It is whether or not we are going to have any kind of an international \ncourt institution in the 21st century. We are asking the world to join \nus in apprehending the Osama bin Ladens. We are building a coalition to \nwork with us and then bring these people to trial.\n  I have not raised this issue today, but my colleagues keep raising \nthe issue that military tribunals is somehow part of this debate. I do \nnot think there is any legal issue at all over whether we can have a \nmilitary tribunal. That is beyond question. There ought to be and can \nbe military tribunals. I can question the wisdom of establishing them \nin every case because I think there ought to be a selective use of it. \nI happen to believe having public trials demonstrating how we operate \nunder the rule of law makes more sense, but I do not question the \nPresident's authority at all to establish a military tribunal, if that \nis what he decides to do. That is not the issue.\n  We are going to be asking countries to extradite people, to bring \nthem here and try them in these tribunals. At this very hour our State \nDepartment is reaching out to get the world to cooperate with us, we \nare walking away from the International Criminal Court. Every member of \nNATO has signed and ratified this agreement; every member of the \nEuropean Union has ratified it, not to mention all of our allies all \nover the globe.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why we are going to adopt a \n28-page amendment which, as I pointed out earlier, makes it so we are \nnot involved in peacekeeping forces, we cut off aid to countries, we \ncannot participate in these courts where even U.S. citizens have been \nattacked.\n  I do not understand why at 5:15 on a Friday night my colleagues want \nto adopt a 28-page amendment when we do not understand, in my view, the \nfull implications of this amendment.\n  Again, I give my colleagues a chance to vote on an alternative which \nasks the President to send a full report to Congress on additional \nlegislative matters we can take to responsibly protect our service men \nand women.\n  By the way, it is not just service men and women who we should be \nprotecting. I have great affection for those who wear the uniform, but \ncitizens who do not work for the Federal Government, do not work for \nthe State Department, who may be traveling, ought to be protected as \nwell. My colleagues today are talking about service men and women, and \nthey deserve a special status, but today U.S. citizens can also be \ncaught up in this. We travel a lot. How many people travel all over the \nglobe every day to expand markets so we can employ people in this \ncountry? It seems to me we are not including them at all. The only \npeople who are included are Government employees. Do not U.S. citizens \nalso deserve some protection in these courts?\n  I had hoped this amendment would be withdrawn. I really hoped it \nwould be, and then we would come back and try to fashion something we \nall can embrace. Instead, there seems to be a desire to divide us on \nthis question.\n  Again I make the point, if my colleagues really believe there ought \nto be no international criminal court, then they ought to support the \namendment of my friend from North Carolina. If my colleagues believe \nthere is a value in this court, they should reject Senator Helms' \namendment and support mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, forgive me for not being able to stand. I \ndo not know where I put an end to mistaken statements in this debate. I \nhave corrected several of them this afternoon. It is a good thing \neverybody involved in this debate are friends. We will be friends when \nwe walk out of here. But such statements have been made that there have \nnot been any hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. There have \nbeen 3 days of hearings.\n  The statement was made that the Bush administration will be \nprohibited from further negotiations of the criminal court and that it \nwill be deleted from the statute books should the Senate ever verify \nthe Rome statute. That is simply not so.\n  I hope for the remainder of this debate we can come pretty close to \nfactual statements and not resort to a situation--I do wish the \nopponents of this amendment will tell how many of our service men and \nwomen support their motion to table the amendment of Senator Miller and \nme.\n  We do not have 5.5 million service people represented by the \norganizations that have contacted us on their behalf, who support us \nand who, therefore, support the other side. If they have 5.5 million \npeople, I wish they would trot them out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, if I could be recognized one more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Senator Hatch is on his way, and he wishes to speak. So I \nwant to spend some of our time waiting for him to let him speak.\n  Mr. DODD. Would the Senator from North Carolina mind if our colleague \nfrom Louisiana spoke on a subject related to a matter before us?\n  Mr. HELMS. I always like to hear the lady.\n  Mr. DODD. How long does the Senator from Louisiana wish to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time do we have on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 12 minutes, \nand the Senator from North Carolina has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I am prepared to yield my time back anyway, so I yield 10 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I ask unanimous \nconsent that she be allowed to speak on a matter unrelated to the \npending matter before this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut \nand my colleague from North Carolina because this truly is a very \nimportant debate, one of the important aspects of the underlying bill. \nBut because I had not been able to speak earlier on the underlying \nbill, and as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I wanted to take \na few moments to talk about some of the important components of the \nDefense appropriations bill we are considering, particularly on this \nvery special day which is commemorating the 60th anniversary of Pearl \nHarbor, and particularly because of the tremendously challenging \ncircumstances we face as a nation.\n  I am aware that in a few minutes we will vote on this particular \namendment. It is really a very important matter we will decide \nconcerning this International Court, but I want to take a moment to \nshare with my colleagues, to remind them, of another historical event, \nand that was in the month of August of 1814.\n  One hundred eighty-six years ago, this Senate and most of the public \nbuildings in Washington were burned to the ground. It was the grimmest \nmoment for our young Nation. We had won our freedom from England and \nnow, during the second war of independence, we experienced in some ways \ncomplete humiliation. Adding to this humiliation, it occurred under the \nPresidency of James Madison, the father of the Constitution and one of \nthe greatest minds the United States had ever produced. An observer of \nthe attack described the scene. He said:\n\n       It was a sight so repugnant to my feelings, so \n     dishonorable, so degrading to the American character and at \n     the same time so awful it almost palsied my faculties.\n\n  That means caused them to tremble.\n  I think everyone knows exactly today, in hindsight of September 11, \nhow President Madison felt. When we watched the World Trade Center, the \ncenter of our economic vitality, destroyed, when we could see from some \nrooftops in Washington and actually from some of the vistas from this \nexact building the fires burning over the Pentagon, I think we can all \nknow exactly how President Madison and this man who gave us this quote \nfelt on that day.\n  Yet we also know, for the second time in our history, this building \nagain was the target of attack. Although it was not hit, it was a \ntarget, and we might have piled horror upon horror to see this exact \nbuilding burn to the ground again.\n  The War of 1812 was divisive. It divided North and South as well as \nthe emerging constituency of the West. Yet when our Capitol was burned, \nthe\n\n[[Page S12627]]\n\nAmerican people knew we could no longer delay and divide. We had to \nunite and prevail. We could spare no resource, ignore no strategy, \nreject no talent in that effort to preserve the American experiment in \ndemocracy.\n  We are engaged in a similar struggle today. We must unite and \nprevail, and we should spare no resource in doing so. That is why I \nhave been a strong advocate for the Byrd amendment, and that is why I \nam a strong proponent of this underlying Defense bill.\n  I know at this exact moment the leaders are engaged in a negotiation \nthat will hopefully help us support a strong Defense bill, one that \nfunds the men and women in uniform and gives them the supplies, \nequipment, technology, research, housing, schools, health care, \nweapons, and ammunition they need to fight a war in Afghanistan and to \nprotect us at home.\n  There are a number of provisions I support in the underlying bill, \nand I also support Senator Byrd's gallant, valiant, courageous, and \nvisionary efforts to add to that underlying bill some resources for our \nhomeland defense and homeland security.\n\n  In the underlying bill, there are a number of provisions which I \nsupport. First and foremost is the support for the cooperative threat \nreduction program. That phrase did not really mean much to anybody \nbefore September 11, ``cooperative threat.'' It was hard for people to \ngrasp what it was exactly, but now that we know and we can see we have \nstill enemies willing to use powerful weapons against us to destroy \nAmericans and our way of life, we understand the cooperative threat \nreduction program, which is a partnership with Russia to contain \nweapons of mass destruction, most certainly should be funded and most \ncertainly supported.\n  Our Capitol, our White House, and our Federal buildings burned in \n1814, and we saw them again targets earlier in September. We know our \nenemies want to gain access to weapons of mass destruction. We know \nthey want them. We know they have tried to get them, and we know that \nthey will try to use them if they gain access to them.\n  So in the underlying bill that has been carefully crafted by Mr. \nInouye, the Senator from Hawaii, and the Senator from Alaska, with the \nsupport of many on the Democrat and Republican side, we provided $357 \nmillion to complement the $300 million in the Department of Energy \nfunding this year. It represents a $49 million increase over last year. \nThat is the good news.\n  The bad news is if we had allowed the Byrd amendment to go forward, \nwe would have had an additional $256 million investments in the \ncooperative threat reduction program, spending more money in an urgent \nfashion, in a transparent and accountable fashion, to make sure we get \nto those weapons of mass destruction before our enemies do.\n  We know it is not just nuclear materials. We know there are chemical \nweapons, there are biological agents and, again, they have said they \nwant them. They have said if they get them, they will use them. We know \nthis building we stand in today is a target of their negative feelings \ntoward our country and all for which it stands.\n  So I am very hopeful that in the negotiations we are not leaving on \nthe table some extra money, so important to the cooperative threat \nreduction and as a testimony to the great work done by Senator Lugar \nfrom Indiana and Senator Nunn, the former Senator from Georgia who did \na magnificent job helping this Senate and this Congress come to grips \nwith the fact that these weapons were out there and that it was not a \nforeign aid program for Russia, it was a protection program for the \ncitizens of the United States of America. I hope that does not fall on \nthe floor in the scraps of the amendments and the debate.\n  A second area I endorse is our continued funding of the national \nmissile defense program. I know this program has its critics, and I \nknow some of its champions claim it can do more than it can, but I will \nsay with continued persistence and with dedication and with careful, \ndeliberate testing, I am convinced that this Nation can develop a \nlimited missile defense system, perhaps land-based or Navy-based, that \ncan protect this Nation in the future against threats from Iran and \nNorth Korea or other such nations that have advanced missile \ntechnology.\n  Again, there is going to be one city in their target, and that target \nis going to be Washington, DC. So as a supporter of national missile \ndefense, I support the $7 billion of investments that we make in this \nbill.\n  I also support the compromise that was deftly crafted and I think \nsmartly crafted to say that the President, in addition to the $7 \nbillion, can have $1.3 billion to add to missile defense if he sees \nfit, but if not, he can also use this money for counterterrorism \nefforts. I urge the President to be careful in his deliberations, to be \ndelicate, to be thoughtful in his deliberations about how to divide \nthat $1.3 billion. It is a lot of money. It can do a lot of good.\n  Also, a great deal of the effort could be wasted. We have to make \nsure we know not only what the possible threats are but what the \nprobable threats are, what the likely threats are, and take our \nprecious treasures and resources that the American people pay in \ntaxes--as wealthy people, middle-class people, and poor people--that \ncontribute to the Treasury of this United States and make sure that \nmoney is spent investing in what will help keep them safe from these \nweapons of mass destruction and these asymmetrical threats that \nterrorists are now using effectively today in the world.\n  This is a good compromise on the underlying bill. I urge the \nPresident to think about the transformation necessary and spend that \nmoney for counterterrorism efforts. There are any number of good ways \nto do that.\n  Finally, we cannot forget our most effective weapon, whether in 1814 \nor 2001 or whether it was as Senator Inouye so beautifully said this \nmorning, 60 years ago when Pearl Harbor was bombed, the American men \nand women who serve this country in uniform. It is not just the \ngenerals; it is not just the sophistication of the weapons; it is not \njust that our technology is so advanced that our private sector can \nrespond more quickly. The real genius of our Nation lies in the spirit, \nin the humanness of the American men and women in uniform, the 18-year-\nolds in the foxholes, the 22-year-old young men and women who serve \nthis country.\n  This bill helps to honor that great American truth by funding an \nincrease in their pay, by providing the health care that we promise, by \nmaking sure that when they are sick there is a veterans hospital for \nthose who have served admirably. We have also started to focus on \nhousing.\n  In conclusion, in the underlying bill we also honor our service men \nand women by supporting them in their housing, their schools, and their \nhospitals. I cannot think of anything I would want my country to do \nmore for me if I had to ship off than to know my country was doing what \nit could to care for my spouse and my children, knowing if my child got \nsick, there was a clinic for them to go to; if my husband was stressed, \nthere was a phone he could pick up with a friendly voice on the other \nend. So if I were in Afghanistan or if I were in India or Somalia, I \ncould fight with all the courage and strength because I knew my \nGovernment was doing its part for my family back home.\n  That is what men and women in uniform want. They don't need essential \nfood. They don't even need a comfortable place to sleep. They want to \nknow their families are secure.\n  That is what this bill does. It was done in a bipartisan way, and I \nam proud to be part of that effort and hope we can do more in the \nfuture.\n  Finally, our country has come a very long way since the dark days of \nAugust 1814. Almost 200 years later we face a similar danger. I am \nproud we are reacting as we did then, with unity and purpose of \ndetermination. I thank the Senators for their strong work on this bill, \nand I look forward to the passage of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I have the list of military organizations \nthat have endorsed the amendment of Senator Miller and myself. I will \nread into the Record the list of those names: the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the Air Force Sergeants Association, \nthe Army Aviation Association of America, the Association of Military \nSurgeons of the United States, the Association of U.S.\n\n[[Page S12628]]\n\nArmy, the National Military Family Association, the CWO & WO \nAssociation of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States, the Fleet Reserve Association, the \nGold Star Wives of America Incorporated, the Jewish War Veterans of the \nUSA, the Marines Corps League, the Marine Corps Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Order \nof Battlefield Commissions, Naval and Enlisted Reserve Association, \nNaval Research Association, the Navy League of the United States, the \nNon Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of America, \nReserve Officers Association, the Veterans' Widows International \nNetwork Incorporated, the Military Chaplain Association of the United \nStates of America, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Retired \nOfficers Association, the United Armed Forces Association, the U.S. \nCoast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, the U.S. Army Warrant \nOfficers Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \nStates, and I feel obliged to mention one more time that the President \nof the United States favors the Helms-Miller amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back my time if my colleague will \nyield back his.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to do it but will take 30 seconds and I will ask \nfor the yeas and nays on my amendment. I will not move to table the \namendment of my friend from North Carolina but give it an up-or-down \nvote. There will be two separate votes. We may want to abbreviate the \nsecond vote. It could move matters along.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the Dodd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2343\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. \n     Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 2343.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To expand aviation capacity in the Chicago area)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Provided \n     further, That before the release of funds under this account \n     for O'Hare International Airport security improvements, the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall, in cooperation with the \n     Federal Aviation Administrator, encourage a locally developed \n     and executed plan between the State of Illinois, the City of \n     Chicago, and affected communities for the purpose of \n     modernizing O'Hare International Airport, including parallel \n     runways oriented in an east-west direction; constructing a \n     south suburban airport near Peotone, Illinois; addressing \n     traffic congestion along the Northwest Corridor, including \n     western airport access; continuing the operation of Merrill \n     C. Meigs Field in Chicago; and increasing commercial air \n     service at Gary-Chicago Airport and Greater Rockford Airport. \n     If such a plan cannot be developed and executed by said \n     parties, the Secretary and the FAA Administrator shall work \n     with Congress to enact a federal solution to address the \n     aviation capacity crisis in the Chicago area while addressing \n     quality of life issues around the affected airports.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Illinois has the \nfloor. Will the Senator from Illinois yield to me?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the two Senators from \nIllinois--the other Senator was in the Chamber--will agree to a time \nlimit prior to a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nGrassley, myself, Senator Harkin, Senator Dorgan, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Burns, Senator Breaux, Senator Reid, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Torricelli, and Senator Johnson. It is an amendment relative to \nan airport in Illinois which is known by every Member of the Senate and \nknown across the Nation: O'Hare International Airport. There is not a \nMember of the Senate gathered this evening who has not had an \nexperience with a delay and a problem at O'Hare. Many of them have\n\n[[Page S12629]]\n\nshared those experiences with me as I have discussed this amendment. \nMany of the Members of the Senate and the people following this debate \nknow that the current situation at the airport at O'Hare literally has \na stranglehold on aviation across America.\n  When there are delays and problems at O'Hare Airport, those problems \naffect cities and airports across America. The reason, of course, is \nthat O'Hare was built in an era when air travel was much different and \nairplanes were much different. Airplanes were smaller, there were fewer \nflights, and the runways at O'Hare were designed to accommodate that \nday in aviation.\n  That day has changed. It has changed dramatically. For 25 years or \nmore, there has been an effort underway in Illinois to change O'Hare \nand modernize it, to finally put in a runway configuration that is \nsafer and more efficient, not just for the benefit of my State and \nregion but for the Nation. Every major airline understands O'Hare's \nimpact on the rest of the Nation.\n  Despite this intention of changing O'Hare and making it more \nefficient, it never happened. Why? Because in Illinois, as in some 14 \nother States, the Governor has a voice in the decision about the future \nof airports. The Governor of Illinois has to give approval or \ndisapproval for these airports. We have been unable, for more than two \ndecades, to get the Governor and the mayor of the city of Chicago, \nwhich has responsibility for O'Hare, to see eye to eye on the future of \nthe airport. So it has come to a grinding halt time after time after \ntime.\n  I am happy to report that has changed. It has changed within the last \nseveral days. The Republican Governor of our State, George Ryan, and \nthe Democratic mayor of the city of Chicago, Richard Daley, reached a \nhistoric agreement 48 hours ago. Finally, for the first time in more \nthan two decades they have come together and agreed, not just on the \nfuture of O'Hare to make it safer, to make it more efficient, but also \non aviation in general for our State.\n  What will happen to Meigs Field, a small but important commuter field \nthat is on the lakeshore of Chicago, the future of an airport for the \nsouthern suburbs of Chicagoland, a growing area, an area with an \nexpanding economy? People said those two men would never be able to \ncome to this agreement but they did, and they did despite a lot of \nopposition.\n  This agreement was not reached in secret or reached in a hurry. It \nstarted with the mayor announcing a comprehensive plan for aviation on \nJune 29. The Governor of the State of Illinois announced his plan on \nOctober 18, after a series of field hearings around the Chicago area, \nand now today they have come together with a mutual agreement. This is \na historic opportunity, not just for Chicago and Illinois but for the \nNation.\n\n  The obvious question is, Why do we come today on this bill at this \ntime to talk about O'Hare International Airport and aviation in \nIllinois? The fact is that both the Governor and the mayor agree, and I \nconcur, that we need to make certain Federal law reflects the fact this \nagreement has been reached, an agreement which we believe will have \nbenefit all across the Nation for many years to come.\n  Who supports this agreement? Major airlines using O'Hare support it, \nand it is important they do because a major part of the expense of \nmodernizing O'Hare will fall on the shoulders of major airlines that \nwill have to float the bonds that fund the terminals that serve the \ngates that serve the people who will use O'Hare in the future.\n  The major airlines have come together. So there is no \nmisunderstanding--and I understand there may be among some Members--\nAmerican Airlines, United Airlines, and Midwest Express have publicly \nstated their support for this agreement, but they are not the only \nones. In addition, we have the support of the air traffic controllers. \nThis is support that is important because these men and women know the \nissue of safety. They believe this will make for a safer airport and \nsafer aviation across America. The Airline Pilots Association, they \nsupport this agreement as well, and AOPA which represents private \naircraft owners and operators have endorsed it publicly as well. We \nhave all the major aviation organizations in support of this plan, and \nfew in opposition.\n  I know it will not be easy for us to see this plan become law. We \nneed to bring together tonight a bipartisan coalition of Members of the \nSenate who agree with Senator Grassley and myself that this \nmodernization of O'Hare is not just important for that airport but for \naviation across America. There are some local issues which I will not \ndwell on because they are of importance to those of us from Illinois \nbut may not be to the rest of the Nation, but thankfully this approach, \nthis plan, is going to address traffic congestion.\n  Traffic congestion around O'Hare is called ``ground zero'' in terms \nof traffic congestion in our State, and when we come to grips with that \nand make a proposal for changes in the traffic around O'Hare, it will \nhave a positive impact on the thousands of people who use that airport \nand who travel near it each and every day.\n  The mayor and the Governor made certain that as part of this plan \nthey would also invest the funds for noise mitigation and noise control \nin the area surrounding the airport. They have made an unprecedented \nand historic commitment to noise mitigation around this airport. That, \nin my mind, is essential. That, in my mind, is essential, so the \nfamilies and businesses and schools that may be affected by this change \nwill have some relief.\n\n  This decision on O'Hare will have a more positive impact on aviation \nthan virtually anything else we can do. I don't overstate the case. \nSeveral months ago Newsweek magazine had a cover story about aviation \nproblems, aviation air traffic problems across America.\n  I commend Senator John McCain of Arizona because he came with the \nSenate Commerce Committee to the city of Chicago for a hearing on this \nissue so we could understand in the Senate exactly what this meant. My \ncolleague, Senator Fitzgerald, has a different view on the airport, and \nhe was at the hearing. We heard from people in the area, not only \nleaders of business, leaders in labor, but people who understood the \nimpact of this airport congestion at O'Hare on our region and on the \nNation.\n  Now we have a chance to do something that can make a significant \ndifference. Common sense dictates we will need to pass in the near \nfuture and this plan envisions a new airport south of Chicago in the \nvicinity of Peotone. There has been an agreement to keep the commuter \nairport open, Meigs Field--that is important, particularly to private \nowners of aircraft--and make the changes at O'Hare that will make it \nmodern and safer.\n  I am glad my colleagues from Iowa are here because I give both of \nthem credit. Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley understand as well as \nI do, and many should, that O'Hare's future is linked directly with the \nfuture of smaller airports, and all around the Midwest, as well. The \nairports of Iowa and downstate Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, \nand Minnesota, all of these airports, depend on a viable airport at \nO'Hare that can receive these flights and transfer passengers to other \ndestinations. They started this process, and I commend them for being \nwith me tonight as we debate this historic agreement. Senator Harkin \nand Senator Grassley brought to the attention of the Nation the need to \nmodernize O'Hare. It is their action as a catalyst in this discussion \nwhich brings the Senate to this agreement, which brings us to this \namendment this evening.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me this evening in passing this \nimportant amendment which sets the stage for the embodiment and \nrecognition of the overall agreement in this bill. This is important \nfor America's economy. It is certainly important for aviation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. Members might wonder, if the Governor of Illinois and \nmayor of Chicago have reached an agreement on expanding O'Hare Airport, \nwhy have the legislation? The legislation is very important because \nthis issue has been hanging around for a long time. We want to make \nsure that somebody coming down the road doesn't change it.\n  O'Hare is a very key national and international hub airport. I am not\n\n[[Page S12630]]\n\nfrom Illinois, but for the people in my State of Iowa, particularly the \nmajor airports of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, from the standpoint of \nthe cost of service and the fact that service is not always certain, \nplus the fact that several smaller airports in Iowa do not have access \nto O'Hare and are very interested in what happens at O'Hare; Iowans are \nvery concerned about O'Hare. It has to do with the traveling public, \nboth tourists as well as business, and it also has something to do, in \nturn, with the economic development of a State such as mine because air \ntransportation is so important to economic development.\n  O'Hare is a key national and international hub airport, especially \nfor Iowa. When O'Hare sneezes, the rest of the country gets the flu. \nModernization of O'Hare is very important to Iowa's economy. It will \nhelp prevent future congestion problems and delays that plague air \ntravelers.\n  It will make air travel more efficient and less frustrating. And it \nwill be easier and more pleasant for air travelers to come to Iowa. \nWithout a doubt, more on-time flights will be a big help for business \ntravel, where time is money.\n  The plan to modernize O'Hare will also make it a safer airport. We're \nall more focused on air safety after September 11. Air travel security \nmeans more than screening passengers and baggage. It means safe take-\noffs and landings. Today, the runway configuration at O'Hare is not as \nsafe as it could be. The new plan will eliminate dangerous cross-\nrunways. There will be more parallel runways. It will also include more \nmodern electronic instrumentation.\n  I appreciate the way the governor and the mayor got together and \nworked out a plan. When I first started pressing for a solution to the \nO'Hare problem last spring, I knew it wouldn't be an easy process for \nanyone. But it's been a very successful process. It won the support of \nthe airline pilots and air traffic controllers. It produced a \ncompromise that everyone can be proud of.\n  Now Congress needs to do its part to ensure the success of this hard \nwork. That means immediate passage of the Durbin-Grassley legislation. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to make this happen--even \nin the short time left--prior to adjournment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I make a general comment. I am not aware \nof the details of the amendment offered by our friend from Illinois. \nHowever, I am not aware this is a transportation bill. I thought we \nwere on the Department of Defense appropriations bill. I don't see why \nthis amendment is on the Department of Defense appropriations bill. It \nmay be a good amendment. My colleague and friend from Iowa spoke on \nbehalf of it. I see my other colleague from Iowa is getting ready to \nspeak. My colleague from Illinois has some reservations about it and is \nopposed to it.\n  I don't know any of the details, to say it should pass or not pass, \nexcept I believe it does not belong on this bill.\n  It is 6:30 on a Friday night. Some Members have responsibilities and \nwant to finish this bill. We want to finish all the appropriation \nbills. Now, if this was relevant, it should have been in the \nTransportation appropriations bill. It should have come out of the \nauthorizing committee, from the Commerce Committee. This is not a \ntransportation bill. This is not an air transportation bill. This is \nnot a bill that came out of the Commerce Committee. This is the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I know there are very strong opinions. I was contacted by my \ncolleague and friend from the House, Congressman Hyde. He strongly \nopposes this particular amendment and opposes it being added to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill.\n  I do not know enough about the legislation. I know it can cost \nbillions and billions of dollars. So I would like it to have not just a \nsignoff on behalf of the Governor and mayor but maybe go through the \nauthorizing committees and the Appropriations Transportation \nSubcommittee rather than having it thrown out late at night on a \nFriday, thinking maybe we can run this through and authorize billions \nof dollars or begin the process to authorize billions on a Department \nof Defense bill.\n  I have the greatest respect in the world for Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens who will be chairman and ranking member on the \nDepartment of Defense bill, but I doubt they know very much about \nChicago O'Hare Airport. Yet to entrust them and make them deal with \nthis issue in conference is a mistake.\n  I urge my colleague and friend from Illinois to withdraw this \namendment, bring it back either as an independent item, as reported out \nof the Commerce Committee, using regular order, or to bring it up in an \nappropriations bill, through the appropriations process, in committee, \non the Transportation bill, not on the Department of Defense bill.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator familiar with the bill before us, H.R. \n3238, page 180, and pages following related to the Department of \nTransportation?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not familiar with the exact paragraph the Senator \nis talking about. I have already heard somebody say this might be a \ngermaneness paragraph. But I am not trying to raise a technical point \nof order. My point is this is not a commerce bill. This is not a \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that we even had a hearing in the \nCommerce Committee in Chicago where representatives of the airport, the \nmayor, the Governor and a number of Members of Congress testified that \nthis is a very big issue in the State of Illinois and in Chicago? But \nit is also a very big issue for those of us who have to go through \nChicago O'Hare Airport on many occasions when we are going west to our \nhomes.\n  I wonder if the Senator knows that there seems to be an agreement now \nbetween the mayor and the Governor. I have no idea what that agreement \nis all about. I don't know the ramifications. I don't have any idea of \nthe cost to the Federal Government. Here we are on a Defense \nappropriations bill. I must say, is the Senator a bit amused that the \nSenator from Illinois refers to the transportation pork that has been \nput in this bill that has nothing to do with defense and there is a \nrationale for putting this on? That is really entertaining. But the \nfact is, I think it may be a good agreement. I really don't know. But \nthe Commerce Committee has the oversight. The committee is called \nCommerce, Science and Transportation. That is the name of the \nauthorizing committee. I wonder if the Senator knows that he could \nprobably argue that they are disregarding every other committee in this \nbill, including the Commerce Committee, on a variety of issues. But \nthis is a big issue.\n  You have the other Senator from the State of Illinois who does not \nagree at this time to consider it. If it were a piece of legislation \nthat affected my State, and I didn't want it to go forth at this \nparticular time, particularly when no one has had a chance to look at \nit, I would certainly try to honor the wishes of my colleague.\n  I am surprised that the Senator from Illinois on the other side of \nthe aisle is trying to shove this thing through without the agreement \nof his colleague from the same State.\n  I know Senator Kyl would never do that to me. He would never do that \nto me.\n  We have never had a hearing on this--we have certainly addressed the \nissue in the Commerce Committee--in fact, even a field hearing. I think \nthe wishes of the other Senator from your own State ought to be \nseriously considered at a time such as this. I know I respect that same \ncourtesy of my colleague from Arizona.\n  I wonder if Senator Nickles is aware that this issue is certainly one \nwhich is not deserving consideration at this time on the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, a couple of comments:\n  I appreciate Senator McCain's comments, the former chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, which deals with transportation. This also will \npotentially cost billions of dollars. We have bills where we wrestle \nevery year or so on how we are going to allocate airport improvement \nfunds. That is not\n\n[[Page S12631]]\n\non the Department of Defense bill. We have bills where we wrestle with \nhow airport construction money is going to be allocated. Some airports \nget a lot, and maybe other airports will get a lot less. Those are \ndecisions we make. That is fine. I am not an expert on that. That is \nnot my committee. But it is also not the committee for the Department \nof Defense.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, I don't think we have to get in a trance, and \nsay I am for this and not for that. I don't think now is the time to \nmake that decision. Let us make that decision when we are considering \nall airports and when O'Hare is debated and we are wrestling with other \ncompeting airports. We will have airport needs, demands, security, and \na lot of challenges for all airports that we will be considering.\n  To make one decision now say: Well, we favor basically greatly \nexpanding Chicago against the will of one of the Senators from \nIllinois, and against the will of many of the Congressmen from \nIllinois, to do that on a Department of Defense bill is a mistake.\n  I may well join my colleague from Illinois in support of this project \nwhen I know more about it. But I don't want to know more about it \ntonight. I want to finish the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. I don't think we should ask Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens to \nbe totally knowledgeable about a multibillion-dollar, multiyear project \nand try to resolve this issue in conference when they really need to be \nworking on the Department of Defense bill.\n  If this is germane, I guess we could probably offer it on the energy \nbill that Senator Murkowski has been working on for a long time. Maybe \nwe should be considering that.\n  When are we going to show some discipline around here so we can \nfinish our work?\n  I urge my colleague to maybe discuss the amendment a little bit \nfurther, and withdraw it, or possibly get a commitment from the \nchairman of the authorizing committee to have a hearing and to report a \nbill out so the Senate can consider it. I may well cosponsor the bill.\n  I just do not think it belongs on this bill tonight. We have done \nthis too many times where we get in the business of: Well, the year is \nrunning late, and I have something that I haven't completed on my \nagenda. I want to put it on even if it doesn't belong on the bill.\n  This does not belong on the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. I urge my colleagues to withdraw the amendment and save all of us \na lot of time. Hopefully, we can consider it when we are better \nprepared to consider aviation issues, do it through the appropriate \ncommittees, give it a fair hearing, give everybody a chance to find out \nwhat the impact would be on all the other airports in the country, and \nmake the appropriate decisions. Maybe it would be a strongly supported \nposition with which we could all be very comfortable.\n  I am not comfortable with making multibillion-dollar decisions on \nairports tonight on a Department of Defense bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wonder if the Senator from \nOklahoma actually has looked at the amendment at the desk by the \nSenator from Illinois. I think he has confused it with a bill that was \nintroduced earlier. This is an appropriations measure. It has been \nchecked with the Parliamentarian. It is an appropriate limitation on \nthe release of funds. This is not a legislative matter; this is an \nappropriations matter under our rules.\n  Since the bill contains appropriations matters for the Department of \nTransportation and the FAA, it is entirely germane to this bill that \nare impacted by the text.\n  Furthermore, if my friend from Oklahoma is worried about chewing up a \nlot of time, I am certain that my friend from Illinois would agree to a \ntime limitation on the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that we have \na 1-hour time limit right now evenly divided on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How about a half hour of time evenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, it is not that the proponents of this side to use \nup a lot of time. I think it is a clear-cut case.\n  My friend from Arizona said we haven't had hearings on it. My friend \nfrom Arizona chaired the hearing in Illinois in Chicago on this very \nsubject in Illinois. There has been a hearing on it.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer. I first started speaking about \nthe congestion at O'Hare and the need for new runways and changing that \nairport in 1991, 10 years ago. A lot of others were talking about it at \nthat time. Senator Durbin has been on this ever since he was in the \nHouse of Representatives. This is not something new. It has been around \na long time.\n  If it is true, as has been said, that transportation is the veins and \narteries of our free enterprise system in America, surely O'Hare is the \nheart pump. When O'Hare backs up, everything backs up. Airports back up \nall over the country. Delivery systems back up all over the country. \nWhat happens at O'Hare affects every community in America.\n  Quite frankly, the situation at O'Hare is getting to be to the point \nwhere if you have one bad weather pattern in Chicago, and you have \nsunshine in the rest of the United States, you might as well have a \nhurricane in every city if it is bad in Chicago. It will back up \neverything all over America.\n  I bet that almost every Senator who flies anywhere has had the \nexperience of sitting on the runway and the weather looks good. The \npilot comes on and says: We can't take off because there is a weather \ndelay in Chicago. And you are waiting to fly to Minneapolis. That is \nwhat happens at O'Hare today and what is happening in our country.\n  At O'Hare, there are plenty of runways. But because they are \ncrisscrossing each other, and because they are too close together, you \ncannot have simultaneous takeoffs and landings at a number of different \nplaces. And, in bad weather, you cannot use both parallel runways if \nyou have adverse weather conditions because they are to close \ntogether. So O'Hare airport needs to be redesigned. They need to have \nparallel runways that are wide enough apart to be operated in poor \nweather; they need to get rid of the crisscross runways that are there \nright now.\n\n  There has been some contention in the past between the city of \nChicago and the State about how to proceed on this. Some of us, led by \nSenator Durbin, have been pushing them to reach an agreement, to get \ntogether. This is a State and a local matter, but even though it is a \nState and local matter, O'Hare affects the entire United States. So we \nhave been asking them to get together and work it out.\n  They did. I commend Mayor Daley of the city of Chicago and Governor \nRyan of the State of Illinois for working together to come up with this \nagreement. Now that we have this agreement, it is time to move ahead \naggressively to make sure it is implemented and that we move ahead \nwithout any further delay.\n  That is what the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois does. \nIt makes sure we move ahead now that we have this agreement between the \nState of Illinois and the city of Chicago.\n  With this agreement, and with the changes that have been agreed to in \nthis agreement at O'Hare, with new parallel runways, weather delays \nwill be reduced, it has been reported, by over 90 percent. The economic \nimpact of less delays at O'Hare on this country will be tremendous. The \neconomic impact if we do not do it will also be tremendous in the \nnegative.\n  At a time when we are looking at getting out of a recession, and \nfurther looking over the horizon for the next 10 years, any delays that \nwe make at O'Hare means we are going to affect the entire economy of \nthis country.\n  That is not an overstatement. That is not just this Senator from Iowa \nsaying it. You can look at report after report after report on the \ntransportation system in America and how it affects our economy; and it \nall comes right back to O'Hare Airport. That is how important it is.\n  This agreement that was reached has been in the making for a long \ntime. It\n\n[[Page S12632]]\n\nwas not something that just happened in one day. This has been ongoing \nliterally for years, and more recently over the last year. But now that \nthis agreement has been reached, why dawdle, why delay it any longer?\n  This amendment is not just a win for Chicago, this is not just a \nChicago thing, and it is not just for Illinois. This is good for South \nDakota, Minnesota, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska--all the Midwest and the \nnation. I can tell you, we have cities in Iowa that need access to \nO'Hare: Sioux city, Mason City, Fort Dodge and Burlington. Our airports \nwith access, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Dubuque need more \nreliable service.\n  The people who live in my State, in order to transit to someplace \nelse, far to often have a very difficult time getting there because \nthey have to go through Chicago.\n  If this change can take place, and we can modify O'Hare as under the \nagreement, this opens up O'Hare for our smaller airports in the Midwest \nto feed into, so people can travel more freely. It opens up these small \ncities for commercial and business travelers so businesses in those \ncommunities can have better access to their markets and their suppliers \nin other parts of the country.\n  This is not just an issue for Chicago and for Illinois and our \nnation. I have not mentioned the international aspects of this. There \nis a huge international transit that comes in and out of Chicago at \nO'Hare. That is also backed up when Chicago has adverse weather, for \nexample. And certainly, a lot of our people in the Midwest travel \noverseas on business, and there are people in other countries coming to \nthe Midwest for business purposes. They get backed up.\n\n  How does that affect us? Well, they may say: Maybe we want to make a \ncontract with a business. Why do it in the Midwest? We cannot get \nafford the possibility of delays because O'Hare is always plugged up.\n  This is an economic necessity. It is vital to the economy of the \nupper Midwest.\n  So when the Senator from Oklahoma says that somehow we can put it off \nand put it off, maybe a lot of his people in Oklahoma do not use \nO'Hare.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. You said I wanted to put it off and put it off. That is \nnot what I said. I said I would urge my colleague to withdraw the \namendment, have it go through the Commerce Committee, bring it up in \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation; go through the \nregular process.\n  I may well support it. I go through Chicago all the time. I am just \nconcerned about us reallocating the airport improvement funds on a \nDepartment of Defense bill. I think that is a mistake.\n  I am not wanting to get into the details of whether or not my \ncolleague from Illinois is right. I may want to support the project at \nsome time, but it just does not belong on this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, everybody makes that \nargument when there is something they do not like. But the fact is, \nthis is germane to this bill. There are provisions in this bill that \ndeal with the FAA and the DOT. And this is vital, I say to my friend \nfrom Oklahoma. So there is no point of order that lies against this. My \nfriend from Oklahoma knows full well that if we wait and try to do this \nthrough Commerce, or through other committees, it is next year and \nbeyond. We cannot wait any longer.\n  When the heart stops beating, the body dies. When O'Hare gets plugged \nup, we all die a little bit in this country--every city, especially in \nthe upper Midwest.\n  So we have this great agreement. I do not know what the problem is. \nThis is something that the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois \nbasically are going to be doing. All we are saying is, we want them to \ncontinue to develop this plan and execute it. That is all we are \nsaying. We want it to move ahead.\n  So I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I did not even want to talk this \nlong. I would be glad to move it along right now. But we do not want to \ndelay it. We want to get it done.\n  The amendment before us simply provides that the Secretary of \nTransportation work with the FAA to make sure this locally developed \nand executed plan in Illinois moves ahead expeditiously.\n  It is in the interest of Chicago, it is in the interest of Illinois, \nit is in the interest of my State of Iowa, the upper Midwest, and this \nNation. We cannot afford to wait any longer. I urge us to move rapidly \non this, adopt it, and move ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me explain why we are here and what \nthis is all about. We have a bill before us that provides emergency \nmoney for security at O'Hare Airport, emergency money for security to \ntry to protect people's lives and their safety. That is what is in this \nbill.\n  What is being done here is that funding to preserve life and safety \nfor people who go through the airport in Chicago is being delayed to \ntry to force the Secretary of Transportation to ratify a deal on the \nChicago airport. That basically is what this amendment is about.\n  This is an amendment that refuses to release money for safety to \nprotect the lives of people who pass through the Chicago airport, to \ntry to inject the Congress into a decision that ought to be made in \nIllinois.\n  Quite frankly, this amendment potentially could delay safety \nimprovements and jeopardize lives at the Chicago airport.\n  This amendment has absolutely nothing to do with this appropriations \nbill. It pirates it. It is true that we have a provision in the bill \nproviding money for safety, but what this amendment does is pirate that \nprovision by saying you can't spend the safety money until the \nSecretary injects himself into this debate going on in Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will in a minute. Let me finish my point. This amendment \nbasically tries to use safety and the life and safety of people who \nlive in Illinois, who live in Iowa, who live in Texas as a bargaining \nchit to play politics with the improvement of an airport plan in \nChicago that has not been approved by people who are making these \ndecisions in Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will in a moment. Let me just complete my point.\n  My point is this. This is piracy. This is piracy against safety in \nnot allowing safety improvements to go forward until the Secretary \ninjects himself into a decision that ought to be made in Illinois. This \nhas nothing to do with the Defense bill. At 7 o'clock on Friday \nevening, when we are trying to finish an appropriations bill, we have \nbefore us a provision that has nothing to do with national defense. It \nis a provision that basically would have us sit as the airport board in \nChicago. And it is opposed by one of the two Senators from Illinois.\n  It also strikes me, understanding rule 28, that this is basically an \neffort to put in place in conference something that would be totally \nagainst the rules of the Senate and that is a totally extraneous \nprovision. By putting this seemingly harmless limitation on spending \nsafety money--if anybody believes limiting people's ability to improve \nsafety at Chicago O'Hare is harmless--what we do is create a vehicle \nwhereby, on the Defense appropriations bill, we could see an approval \nof an airport plan in Chicago. I don't think that is our business. I \ndidn't run to be on the airport board in Chicago; no one else here ran; \ncertainly no one was elected.\n  The Senator wanted me to yield. I am happy to yield. But let me pose \na question. Is it your objective in conference to change this language \nto approve this deal in Chicago? Is that what you are trying to do?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Texas that my objective here is \nto have recognition of the fact that there is an agreement. It is not \nto circumvent any Federal law relative to safety or the environment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What does that have to do with us?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It has to do with us in this respect: Illinois is one of \na few States, 15 out of 50, where the Governor has the final word on an \nairport. Our Governor has given consent to this\n\n[[Page S12633]]\n\nplan to move forward on the airport, and we are memorializing that \nconsent in this agreement.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Texas, who said that the \nlanguage of this amendment somehow--at one point he said--threatens \nsafety and lives and at another point calls it a harmless limitation, \ncould I just refer the Senator from Texas to the part that says: The \nSecretary of Transportation shall ``encourage a locally developed \nplan.'' That is the operative language. That is the only condition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if I could reclaim my time, as I read the \nlanguage in the first sentence, it says: ``Provided further: That \nbefore the release of funds under this account. . . .'' What is the \nmoney under this account? The money under this account is money for \nsafety at Chicago O'Hare Airport. Is that not what it is for? It seems \nto be, it is clear in the bill itself, that is what it is for.\n\n  What we are doing is we are setting up a hurdle that the Secretary of \nTransportation has to meet before the money can be released.\n  The Senator is going to say it is not much of a hurdle. All he has to \ndo is jump into this dispute in Chicago about this airport.\n  I go back to the point, whether people in Illinois have agreed or \nnot, what business is it of ours at 7:03 on a Friday night? I don't see \nthat it is any business of ours.\n  I think when we do these things, when the two Senators from the same \nState don't agree, that we are simply injecting ourselves into a \ndecision-making process that violates the separation of powers.\n  I would like to re-pose my question. Does the Senator intend for this \nlanguage, if adopted, to be in the conference report, or does he intend \nto try to get the conference report changed or ratified or to somehow \ngive a Federal commitment to this agreement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Please do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This airport, O'Hare, and all the other airports in this \nagreement, will be treated no differently than any other airport in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is not my question. I will be happy to yield if the \nSenator wants to answer my question. Does the Senator intend to change \nthis language in conference if it is adopted, or can he assure us that \nif it were adopted, this language would be the language he would prefer \nin the conference report? There is a foul rumor afloat that this simply \nmakes it possible to get around rule 28 and to have the Federal \nGovernment ratify this agreement in this Defense bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I respond?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you would answer my question, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to respond by saying to the Senator that I \nwill attempt in conference to put in place of this language a bill \nwhich was introduced today which memorializes the agreement, provides \nno new obligations or authority, but merely memorializes the agreement \nbetween the Governor and the mayor. It does not compromise safety or \nthe environment. This bill has been introduced.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't you offer the bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill will be offered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why wasn't it offered tonight, if you intend to put in the \nconference report?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As the Senator knows, because he is not only a learned \nprofessor from Texas but because he served in the House, the \nparliamentary procedure necessary is a two-step procedure. The first \nstep is placeholder language. The second step is to offer the \namendment. That is exactly what we are doing.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but let me finish \nmy point. What we have here is an effort to pirate on airport safety \nand an effort to use a limit on the ability to spend money for airport \nsafety to create a vehicle in conference to adopt a bill which has \nnever been considered and certainly has not been adopted by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, a bill that would not have been adopted in \neither House of Congress, and a bill that is not being offered on the \nfloor of the Senate tonight. Why is the bill not being offered? The \nbill is not being offered because it is subject to an objection under \nrule 16 because it is legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  It seems to me that not only is this pirating safety, not only is \nthis an issue that has nothing to do with defense, not only is this not \nthe forum for us to be considering this issue, this is basically a ruse \nto pass a bill which is not germane to this bill, which has never been \nreported by the Commerce Committee, which has never been voted on in \neither House of Congress, and basically do it by getting the camel's \nnose under the tent.\n  We should support our colleague from Illinois who opposes this \namendment. It would be one thing if the two Senators came to the floor \nand said: We want the Congress to help us and we want to be the airport \nboard in Chicago. I think that would be pretty unusual, but if they \nwere both together and wanted to do this, it would be one thing. But I \nthink to bring this kind of legislation pirating safety to the floor of \nthe Senate when the Senators from the same State don't agree and as a \nvehicle to make law something never reported by committee, never \nconsidered in either House of Congress, I think is fundamentally wrong. \nIt ought to be objected to.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us get on with the Defense bill. It is \none thing to be debating defense issues. It is one thing to be trying \nto decide should we rent Boeing aircraft to turn them into tankers. \nThat is a legitimate issue. It is one thing to offer a substitute, \nwhich I understand our two leaders of the committee want to offer. But \nto get into this kind of business at 7:09 on a Friday night I think is \nan abuse of our colleagues, and I urge that we not let this happen.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator from \nTexas----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have been listening, wondering why this issue came up. I first \nlistened to Senator Nickles talking about the procedural matters and \nSenator McCain talking about committee jurisdiction. Then I heard my \nfriend, the Senator from Texas, talk about why is this involved at all \non a Defense appropriations matter.\n  While the process and committee jurisdiction is very interesting, I \nam just wondering why in the heck, regardless of what bill it is on, \nthe Senate is involved in this issue at all.\n  There are concerns, and Senator McCain told me: This is going to \naffect airport funds in Virginia, this, that, and the other.\n  I said: Maybe so, but why are we bringing this up?\n  I remember when I was Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia taking \ngreat exception to the Federal Government coming in and telling us how \nto run Reagan National Airport, telling us how many flights we can have \nout, how many gates, the perimeter rule, and how we should operate in \nour authority that runs Reagan National, as well as Dulles, and how \nthey ought to operate. I know there are some folks who may be on the \nsame side as me who had the Federal Government sticking their nose in \nthe business of the people of Virginia and the Metropolitan Washington \nAirport Authority.\n  I have been reading about arguments over whether O'Hare Airport ought \nto be expanded or not or whether it is desirable to have a third \nairport. I do not know. I am not taking a side one way or the other. If \nthe folks in Chicago and Illinois want three airports, two airports, \nfive airports, or seven airports, to me that is the business of the \npeople of Illinois and those jurisdictions in which those airports \nmight be expanded or located.\n  The Illinois delegation is split on the proposal, which is \ninteresting in itself, but that is not dispositive to me. We might have \nboth Senators from Illinois thinking it is great to usurp the rights \nand prerogatives of the people of Illinois. To me that would be \nsomething politically foolish to do, but nevertheless, maybe some folks \nmay not pay attention to it.\n  This effort is one of expansion and safety of O'Hare, and maybe that \nis a\n\n[[Page S12634]]\n\ngood idea, but the basic issue to me is whether we are going to allow \nFederal preemption of State law that requires apparently State approval \nof airport building or expansion.\n  This is a State law in the State of Illinois. Let them decide it. If \nthat is a foolish law, if it is too harmful for the expansion of \nairports, it is not as if the people in Illinois do not have the right \nto vote to change those laws or those representatives to change those \nlaws if they decided to do so.\n\n  Every civilian commercial airport in our country, it seems to me, is \nowned and operated by a political subdivision of a State or \nmultijurisdictional authority. Those are powers that are properly the \nprerogatives and in the purview of the people in the States.\n  The way I see it, should Senator Durbin's maybe well-intentioned \namendment--maybe it is a good idea to build a third airport. \nRegardless, if this amendment should be adopted, it would actually \nallow the Federal Aviation Administration to usurp the State \ngovernment's authority to decide this airport issue at the State level.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. This is a bad precedent for us to be meddling in these \naffairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Is the Senator \naware of the fact the language involved was prepared by the State of \nIllinois, by the Governor of Illinois, with the mayor of Chicago? It is \nnot a preemption of State authority. Is the Senator aware this is \nlanguage prepared by the State of Illinois?\n  Mr. ALLEN. The point of all this is the people from Illinois can \nfigure this out themselves. Do they really need us to ratify their \nagreements?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Or comment. I say it is not a question of ratification. \nThe agreement has been reached. The question is acknowledging the \nconsent has been given by the State. This language comes from the State \nof Illinois. As former Governor of Virginia, the Senator can understand \nwhen he sent language in, it was clearly with his approval. That is the \ncase here. It is not preemptive.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Having once lived in Deerfield, IL--I was a youngster at \nthe time. We did not have Illinois State Government. But I did hear \nfrom the other Senator, Senator Fitzgerald, that the legislature has \nnot agreed to this language.\n  The point is, in my view, this is not the jurisdiction or the place \nfor us to decide the issues that are rightly in the purview and are the \nprerogative of the people of Illinois and political subdivisions \ntherein. I may agree with the Senator that maybe the best idea is \nexpansion of O'Hare Airport, as opposed to the third airport. Again, \nthat is something that needs to be worked out with the localities and, \nfor that matter, all branches of the State government in Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I will support the efforts to defeat this amendment. I \ndo think the issue of air transportation is important to our Nation, \nobviously, but these decisions are best made by the people in the \nStates, those closest to it. If those laws need amending, let them work \nit out with due process at the State level, and do not bring these \nfights and decisions to the Senate. We are remote people who do not \nknow the details and are trying to make a decision.\n  I think it is best we defer this decision and refer it back to the \njurisdiction and court where it ought to be, and that is in Illinois.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to talk on this issue. I \ncompliment my colleagues from other States--Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia--\nand also the distinguished Senator from Arizona for speaking in favor \nof my position on this issue.\n  The fact is, this is an issue on which there is a sharp difference of \nopinion between Senator Durbin and me. That rarely happens on a State \nproject issue. In fact, more often than not, Senator Durbin and I work \ntogether when it involves a State project. We were just working earlier \ntoday to help save a VA Hospital in the city of Chicago. More often \nthan not, we are certainly united on civil or project-type issues.\n  On this issue, we do have a difference of opinion. I oppose what \nSenator Durbin is hoping to do. His argument pointed out that the \nIllinois delegation is divided. In general, I think Congressman \nLipinski in the House supports Senator Durbin's efforts. Congressman \nHyde and Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., happen to support my side. \nOther Members of the Illinois delegation have not necessarily taken a \nposition. They are not statewide officers and have not had to form an \nopinion necessarily or weigh in on this matter.\n  It is true that the mayor of the city of Chicago, Mayor Daley, as \nwell as the Governor of the State of Illinois, did reach agreement two \nnights ago on an O'Hare expansion plan. I do not support that expansion \nplan, however.\n  Our Governor had long opposed Mayor Daley's efforts to expand O'Hare \nAirport. After getting some other provisions, including the continuance \nof Meigs Field in Chicago, which incidentally, I support, the Governor \ndid decide to support Mayor Daley's efforts to expand O'Hare Airport.\n  The crux of this issue, as I see it--and Senator Durbin has been very \nupfront with me--is the language that we will actually be called to \nvote on in the Senate. It is this language, and it is, as Senator \nDurbin stated, placeholder language. It is innocuous language. It does \nnot do much. The idea is Senator Durbin, who is going to be on the \nconference committee on Defense appropriations, would like to go into \nthe conference committee and then introduce much lengthier language \nthat would, in fact, force the reconstruction of O'Hare Airport, the \ntearing up and rebuilding of O'Hare Airport. The nub, the crux, of \nSenator Durbin's language in that regard is to, indeed, preempt State \nlaw.\n\n  At the outset I will introduce into the Record the legislative \nlanguage that Senator Durbin shared with me. We spoke on the phone \nyesterday. He fully disclosed his plans. He would have placeholder \nlanguage tonight. If he made it to conference, he would like to \nintroduce this language. The Senator cannot tell me if he believes that \nlanguage will be any different but he said this is the language he \nwould like to get in the conference committee report on Defense \nappropriations. With a ruling from the Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto enter this language and have it printed in the Record, because I \nwill later want to walk through this language section by section.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. NECESSITY OF O'HARE RUNWAY REDESIGN AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTH SUBURBAN AIRPORT.\n\n       (a) The Congress hereby declares that redesign and \n     reconstruction of Chicago-O'Hare International Airport in \n     Cook and DuPage Counties, Illinois in accordance with the \n     runway redesign plan, and the development of a south suburban \n     airport in the Chicago metropolitan region, are each required \n     to improve the efficiency of, and relieve congestion in, the \n     national air transportation system.\n       (b) The Federal Aviation Administrator shall implement this \n     Federal policy by facilitating approval, funding, \n     construction and implementation of--\n       (1) the runway redesign plan upon receipt of an application \n     from Chicago for approval of an airport layout plan that \n     includes the runway redesign plan, and\n       (2) the south suburban airport upon receipt of an \n     application from the State or a political subdivision thereof \n     for approval of an airport layout plan for a south suburban \n     airport, subject in each case only to application in due \n     course of Federal laws respecting environmental protection \n     and environmental analysis including, without limitation, the \n     National Environmental Policy Act; and the Administrator's \n     determinations with respect to practicability, safety and, \n     efficiency, and consistency with Federal Aviation \n     Administration design criteria.\n       (c) The State shall not enact or enforce any law respecting \n     aeronautics that interferes with, or has the effect of \n     interfering with, implementation of Federal policy with \n     respect to the runway redesign plan including, without \n     limitation, sections 38.01, 47 and 48 of the Illinois \n     Aeronautics Act.\n       (d) All environmental reviews, analyses, and opinions \n     related to issuance of permits, licenses, or approvals by \n     operation of Federal law relating to the runway redesign plan \n     or the south suburban airport shall be conducted on an \n     expedited basis. Every Federal agency shall complete \n     environmental-related reviews on an expedited and coordinated \n     basis.\n       (e) If the Administrator determines that construction or \n     operation of the runway redesign plan would not conform, \n     within the\n\n[[Page S12635]]\n\n     meaning of section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act, to an \n     applicable implementation plan approved or promulgated under \n     section 110 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall forthwith cause or promulgate a \n     revision of such implementation plan sufficient for the \n     runway redesign plan to satisfy the requirements of section \n     176(c) of the Clean Air Act.\n       (f) The term ``runway redesign plan'' means (i) six \n     parallel runways at O'Hare oriented in the east-west \n     direction with the capability, to the extent determined by \n     the Administrator to be practicable, safe and efficient, for \n     four simultaneous independent instrument aircraft arrivals, \n     and all associated taxiways, navigational facilities, \n     passenger handling facilities and other related facilities, \n     and (ii) the closure of existing runways 14L-32R, 14R-32L and \n     18-36.\n       (g) The term ``south suburban airport'' means a \n     supplemental air carrier airport in the vicinity of Peotone, \n     Illinois.\n\n     SEC. 2. PHASING OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Approval by the Administrator of an airport layout plan \n     that includes the runway redesign plan shall provide that any \n     runway located more than 2500 feet south of existing runway \n     9R-27L shall not begin construction before January 1, 2011.\n\n     SEC. 3. WESTERN PUBLIC ROADWAY ACCESS.\n\n       The Administrator shall not consider, and shall reject as \n     incomplete, an airport layout plan submitted by Chicago that \n     includes the runway redesign plan, unless it includes public \n     roadway access through the western boundary of O'Hare to \n     passenger terminal and parking facilities. Approval of \n     western public road access shall be subject to the condition \n     that its cost of construction will be paid from airport \n     revenues.\n\n     SEC. 4. NOISE MITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Approval by the Administrator of an airport layout plan \n     that includes the runway redesign plan shall require Chicago \n     to offer acoustical treatment of all single-family houses and \n     schools located within the 65 DNL noise contour for each \n     construction phase of the runway redesign plan, subject to \n     Federal Aviation Administration guidelines and specifications \n     of general applicability. The Administrator shall determine \n     that Chicago's plan for acoustical treatment is financially \n     feasible.\n       (b) (1) Approval by the Administrator of an airport layout \n     plan that includes the runway redesign plan shall be subject \n     to the condition that noise impact of aircraft operations at \n     O'Hare in the calendar year immediately following the year in \n     which the first new runway is first used, and in each \n     calendar year thereafter, will be less than the noise impact \n     in calendar year 2000. The Administrator shall make the \n     determination required by this Section.\n       (2) The Administrator shall--\n       (i) make the determination using, to the extent \n     practicable, the procedures specified in part 150 of title 14 \n     of the Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (ii) use the same method for 2000 as for each forecast \n     year;\n       (iii) determine noise impact solely in terms of the \n     aggregate number of square miles and the aggregate number of \n     single-family houses and schools exposed to 65 or greater \n     decibels using the DNL metric, including for this purpose \n     only single-family houses and schools in existence on the \n     last day of calendar year 2000.\n       (3) The condition described in subsection (a) shall be \n     enforceable exclusively by the Administrator, using noise \n     mitigation measures approved or approvable under Part 150 \n     of title 14 the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n     SEC. 5. SOUTH SUBURBAN AIRPORT FEDERAL FUNDING.\n\n       The Administrator shall give priority consideration to a \n     letter of intent application submitted by the State of \n     Illinois or a political subdivision thereof for the \n     construction of the south suburban airport. This \n     consideration shall be given not later than 90 days after a \n     final record of decision approving the airport layout plan \n     for the south suburban airport has been issued by the \n     Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 6. FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) On July 1, 2004, or as soon thereafter as may be \n     possible, the Administrator shall construct the runway \n     redesign plan as a Federal project, provided--\n       (1) the Administrator finds, after notice and opportunity \n     for public comment, that a continuous course of construction \n     of the runway redesign plan has not commenced and is not \n     reasonably expected to commence by December 1, 2004.\n       (2) Chicago agrees in writing to construction of the runway \n     redesign plan as a Federal project by the Administrator,\n       (3) Chicago enters into an agreement, acceptable to the \n     Administrator, to protect the interests of the United States \n     Government with respect to the construction, operation and \n     maintenance of the runway redesign plan, and,\n       (4) Chicago provides, without cost to the United States \n     Government, land easements, rights-of-way, rights of entry \n     and other interests in land poverty deemed necessary and \n     sufficient by the Administrator to permit construction of the \n     runway redesign plan as a Federal project and to protect the \n     interests of the United States Government in its \n     construction, operation, maintenance and use.\n       (b) The Administrator may make an agreement with Chicago \n     under which Chicago will provide the work described in \n     subsection (a), for the benefit of the Administrator.\n       (c) The Administrator is authorized and directed to acquire \n     in the name of the United States all land, easements, rights-\n     of-way, rights of entry, or other interests in land or \n     property necessary for the runway redesign plan under this \n     Section, subject to such terms and conditions as the \n     Administrator deems necessary to protect the interests of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 7. MERRILL C. MEIGS FIELD.\n\n       (a) Until January 1, 2026, the Administrator shall withhold \n     all airport grant funds respecting O'Hare Airport, other than \n     grants respecting national security and safety, unless the \n     Administrator is reasonably satisfied that the following \n     conditions have been met--\n       (1) Merrill C. Meigs Field in Chicago either is being \n     operated by Chicago as an airport or has been closed for \n     reasons beyond Chicago's control. If Meigs Field is closed \n     for reasons beyond Chicago's control, none of the following \n     conditions in subparagraphs 2 through 5 shall apply,\n       (2) Chicago is providing at its expense all off-airport \n     roads and other access, services, equipment and other \n     personal property that it provided in connection with the \n     operation of Meigs on and prior to December 1, 2001,\n       (3) Chicago is operating Meigs Field, at its expense, at \n     all times as a public airport in good condition and repair \n     open to all users capable of utilizing the airport, and is \n     maintaining the airport for such public operations at least \n     from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. seven days per week whenever \n     weather conditions permit,\n       (4) Chicago is providing or causing its agents or \n     independent contractors to provide all services (including \n     police and fire protection services) provided or offered at \n     Meigs on or immediately prior to December 1, 2001, including \n     such tie-down, terminal, refueling and repair services as \n     were then provided as rates that reflect actual costs of \n     providing such goods and services at Meigs Field, provided \n     that after January 1, 2006 the Administrator shall not \n     withhold grant funds under this Section to the extent he \n     determines that withholding of grant funds would create an \n     unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.\n       (b) The Administrator shall not enforce the conditions \n     specified in subsection (a) if the State of Illinois enacts a \n     law on or after January 1, 2006 authorizing the closure of \n     Meigs Field.\n       (c) Net operating losses resulting from operation of Meigs, \n     to the extent consistent with law, are expected to be paid by \n     the two air carriers at O'Hare that paid the highest amount \n     of airport fees and charges at O'Hare for the immediately \n     preceding calendar year. Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, Chicago may use airport revenues generated at O'Hare \n     to fund the operation of Meigs Field.\n\n     SEC. 8. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       An order issued by the Administrator in whole or in part \n     under this Section shall be deemed to be an order issued \n     under Title 49, United States Code, Subtitle VII, Part A, and \n     shall be reviewed exclusively in accordance with the \n     procedures in Section 46110 of Title 49, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I heard the other Senator from Illinois talking about all \nof the people and the officials in Illinois who wanted this. I wanted \nto give another perspective on this issue.\n  I was elected in 1986, the same time Denny Hastert, now Speaker of \nthe House, was elected. All I have heard from Denny Hastert and from my \ncolleagues on the House side all these years was they wanted to have a \nthird airport.\n  I have to admit I prefer the provisions of Senator Durbin's bill. On \na freestanding bill, I am a cosponsor. I think it is a good idea. This \nalso affects something no one has talked about, and that is Meigs \nField. So I have some selfish reasons I would like to see that, but not \non a Defense appropriations bill. I think it is the wrong place for it, \nand I will oppose it, even though I agree with the provisions of the \nbill.\n  I have talked to House Members since 1986, and as near as I can tell \nthey are split down the middle, so there is no unanimity in the \ndelegation that I can see.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. The Senator from Oklahoma makes a very good point. I \nappreciate that point, and I appreciate his efforts to keep Meigs Field \nopen because I think that is an important asset for the city of \nChicago. I have worked with the Senator on that issue before and would \nlike to continue working with him in that regard.\n  I do not believe it is appropriate to have this language on a Defense \nappropriations bill. This language has nothing to do with our national \ndefense. It has nothing to do with protecting our troops in \nAfghanistan, and I regret the Senate has to be in session tonight \ndebating this and, in fact, substituting itself for the Illinois State \nLegislature.\n  I served for 6 years in the Illinois State Senate. Whether we would \namend the Illinois Aeronautics Act is the sort of issue we used to \ndebate and vote on\n\n[[Page S12636]]\n\nin the Illinois State Senate. It is not by my choosing, I assure my \ncolleagues, that the Senate is tonight substituting itself for the \nIllinois Legislature, which would probably not approve this plan. We \nare being asked to preempt the laws of the State of Illinois and \nspecifically the Illinois Aeronautics Act.\n  I am going to give some summary remarks at the outset, and then I \nwill want to walk through a section-by-section analysis of Senator \nDurbin's language.\n  There is no reason for us to be in the Chamber tonight debating this. \nThere is no reason to ask the Federal Government to step in. The mayor \nof the city of Chicago has never requested the State of Illinois for a \npermit to do his expansion plan at O'Hare. If he wants to do it, he \nshould formally request that the State grant him a permit. If the FAA \nalso grants him a permit, presumably he could go forward and do his \nexpansion plan.\n  What we are being asked to do tonight is to gut the State permitting \nprogram, to rip out and make of no effect the Illinois Aeronautics Act. \nOf course, we are also being asked to gut State environmental laws that \nmight protect the environment and the health and safety of the people \naround O'Hare Airport.\n  Nor did the mayor of the city of Chicago ever bring this issue up to \nthe State legislature. If it were a problem he could not get a permit \nfrom the State of Illinois, clearly he could ask the State legislature \nto amend State law. No attempt has been made to go to the State \nlegislature and ask them to amend State law. Instead, as a first step \nthey came to the Senate and asked the Senate to come in and rewrite and \npreempt State law.\n\n  In my judgment, a project such as this should be a bottoms-up \nproject, not a top down; not people in Washington making these \ndecisions; I do not think I would be qualified to act on a runway \nproject in Hawaii or New York or at LaGuardia or JFK or Newark; I would \nnot know the situation. This is not an appropriate issue for the Senate \nto be debating. As Senator Gramm said, we are not an aviation panel.\n  In addition to gutting the State permit process, the other thing this \nlanguage would do is it would gut the analytical framework that we in \nCongress, in the Senate and the House, have mandated for approving \nairport plans. We have no studies, no reports, no FAA modeling \navailable. We do not have any idea, other than news reports, of the \ncost of tearing up the seven runways at O'Hare and repositioning them. \nWe have no FAA models of how much new capacity we would get. We do not \nhave any studies that suggest it would improve or cut down on delays. \nWe do not know what the future capacity would be. We do not know \nwhether it is a safe plan.\n  I have two charts. The first chart is a diagram of the existing \nlayout at O'Hare Airport where we have seven runways, six of which are \nactive. O'Hare is the world's busiest airport and, in fact, this year \nwe have had more operations and enplanements than Atlanta's Hartsfield \nAirport. Mayor Daley's plan is to tear up those existing runways and to \nreorient them so he would have six parallel runways, six of them \nparallel east/west and two running from the northeast to the southwest, \nfor a total of eight runways.\n  We are not safety experts in this body. We do not know if that is a \ngood design. We do not know if that is a cost-effective design. I had \nan air traffic controller in my office on Monday of this week saying he \nwas concerned there could be safety problems. The reason he said he \nthought there could be safety problems is because FAA regulations \nnormally require a 4,300-foot separation between runways. In fact, I \nhave a brochure from the Federal Aviation Administration that suggests \nproper separation between runways is an extremely important issue with \nrespect to the safety of an airport.\n  This is the brochure. This is called ``Improving Runway Safety \nThrough Airfield Configuration.'' It is a little pamphlet put out by \nthe Federal Aviation Administration. One of the points it makes for \nbuilding safe airports is that layouts should be avoided that result in \nclosely spaced parallel runways.\n  It says, provide adequate distance between parallel runways so a \nlanding aircraft can exit the runway, decelerate, and hold short of the \nparallel runway without interfering with subsequent operations on \neither runway.\n  The FAA says the standard separation requires 4,300 feet, but it is \nmy understanding this city of Chicago plan which has not been subjected \nto any vetting by any engineering firms or engineering designers, \nairport designers, airport layout experts, any Federal or State panel \nthat those two runways would be 1,300 feet apart.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would like to speak for a while.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Very quickly, I would close and give the Senator as much \ntime as he wants to speak if the Senator and I can agree to a unanimous \nconsent request to limit the debate on this amendment. I want to give \nhim whatever time he wants, a few minutes to close, and let the Members \ngo to consideration of the bill. Will the Senator give me an \nindication?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would object to a unanimous consent agreement on \nthe time.\n  Mr. President, we are not in a position to approve a runway design \nplan. This is probably the first time Congress has ever been asked to \ncodify a runway design plan. I am not sure whether it is safe to have \ntwo sets of parallel runways only 1,300 feet apart. That seems pretty \nclose to me. Maybe it is a good design and maybe it works. The point \nis, we don't have the expertise in this body, and we should not get the \nframework that we in Congress have set up for approving and subjecting \nsuch proposals to a rigorous analysis.\n  Another point I make at the outset is that as you read the language \nthat Senator Durbin would like to get in the conference committee \nreport, you see that the Federal Government takes a role in this whole \nprocess of building the O'Hare redevelopment plan. The language in the \nbill could arguably drain airport improvement funds from every \nSenator's airport around the country and put it in at O'Hare, when some \nmembers of the Illinois delegation, including myself, don't even favor \nthat plan.\n  I favor the construction of a third airport in the south suburbs. \nThat is something that the FAA and the city of Chicago and the States \nof Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana concluded was the right thing to do \nback in 1986-1988 when they did the Chicago Airport Capacity Study. \nThat study concluded that it was not practicable to expand the capacity \nof O'Hare Airport and that the appropriate solution for the future was \nto build a third airport. It was suggested that the south suburbs of \nChicago would be a good place to start a third airport.\n  My message to my colleagues from around the country is, if you are \nwilling to risk airport improvement funds in your own States for your \nairports, then you should support Senator Durbin. But if you want to \nkeep your share of airport improvement funds for your airports and not \nsend them for an expansion plan that I don't even support in Illinois, \nthen you should vote with me.\n  It should also be pointed out at this point that this is a project \nthat involves blockbuster amounts. In August, the State of Illinois \ntransportation director suggested that the cost of the total project \nwould be as much as $13 billion. And the reason it is so costly is \nbecause you are tearing up existing runways that are very deep--one is \none of the longest in the country--and you are repositioning them. Of \ncourse, the mayor of Chicago already has a $4 billion terminal \nexpansion plan that is on the table, and then included in this language \nthat Senator Durbin has is a western access road that could cost as \nmuch as $3 billion, depending on where it goes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator indicate who will pay for the western \naccess?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. That is unclear. I think under certain circumstances \nthe western access would have to be paid for out of airport improvement \nfunds because in section 6 of your bill you provide for Federal \nconstruction of the project.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware the western access would be paid for \nby the city of Chicago?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. No, and that is certainly not clear from the \nlanguage.\n\n[[Page S12637]]\n\n I cite section 1(f) of your language where you define the runway \ndesign plan to include related facilities, which I take to include \nrelated roadway improvements. So I don't know how many Senators want \nairport improvement funds drained from their States to go for a road in \nthe Chicago area which would be part of this overall O'Hare expansion \nplan. That road happens to be a good idea if they do it in the right \nway. If they do it in the wrong way, it will take up 20 percent of the \nbusiness and an industrial park in the city of Elk Grove, the largest \nindustrial park in the country. Twenty percent of that would be taken \nout.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I will yield for one more question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I refer the Senator to specific language which says, \napproval of western public road access shall be subject to conditioning \nthat the cost of construction be paid for from airport revenues.\n  It does not come from airport improvement by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Where do you have that language?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Airport improvement funds come from Washington; airport \nrevenues----\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. But they would be revenues of O'Hare Airport.\n  Mr. DURBIN. From the ticket charges.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. O'Hare revenues would include whatever revenues they \ntook in, from any source. You don't say that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague, airport improvement funds are from \nWashington, from the General Treasury; and the passenger facility \ncharge is generated by the airport itself. And it specifically says the \nwestern access will be paid for from airport revenues, not from the \nFederal Treasury.\n  I say to the Senator, we can disagree and do disagree, but I want him \nto represent this as it is written.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. To my colleague from Illinois I say I am sure if I \ngot an annual report of O'Hare and looked at the income statements, \nthey would include as airport revenues the funds they receive from \nwhatever source--from airport improvement funds, from PFCs, from \nconcessions, or any source that is part of total revenue. I differ on \nhow this language reads.\n  As I said earlier, there are safety issues raised by this project, \nthis proposal. We currently have 25 taxi runway crossings at O'Hare. \nThat brochure that I held up earlier that the FAA puts out on airport \nsafety, one point it makes is layouts of airports that require aircraft \nand vehicles to cross runways need to be avoided. This goes on to say \nthat every crossing represents a potential runway incursion. Vehicle \ncrossings can be eliminated by constructing all-weather perimeter and \nservice roads. At busy airports with a large volume of vehicles \ntraveling from one side of the airport to the other, it may be cost \nbeneficial to construct vehicle roadway tunnels under the runways.\n  It goes on and emphasizes that the number of crossings, taxiway and \nrunway crossings affect safety. My understanding is the current layout \nat O'Hare Airport has 25 taxiways and runway crossings, but this new \nplan would have 43. It is a much more complicated design. Under the \nstandard set up by the FAA, in their own brochure, there could be an \nincreased threat of a runway incursion.\n  The point has been previously made by my colleagues from Arizona and \nelsewhere that the language Senator Durbin is offering tonight bypasses \nthe authorizing committees in the House and the Senate. It is, in my \njudgment, a circumvention of the process. The appropriations, the \nDefense appropriations bill is not the appropriate vehicle to have a \ntransportation or an aviation measure. In the Senate, we have the \nCommerce Committee that governs transportation and aviation. If there \nis any expertise in the Senate staff and among the Senators who have a \nlot of experience in aviation, it is in the Senate Commerce Committee, \nand in the House it is the House Transportation Committee. The House \nhas, in fact, told our Commerce Committee staff that they will oppose \nthis language in conference because they believe this is not going \nthrough the proper channels. There were no hearings in the appropriate \ncommittee.\n\n  As I said, why aren't we doing this in the State legislature? If for \nsome reason they couldn't do it in the State legislature--say they \nweren't meeting for the next year and they had to come to the Senate--\nyou would think the way to do this would be to bring a bill and go \nthrough the appropriate channels, go through the authorizing committee, \nand have hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  Of course, I was in Chicago with Senator Durbin and Senator McCain \nearlier. We had an informational hearing on aviation in Chicago. At \nthat time, Mayor Daley had decided he was going to come out with a \nplan. But the plan that was just agreed to that we are now being asked \nto vote on is 48 hours old. It was a backroom deal between two people. \nIt didn't involve the State legislature. It is not available to the \npublic. No details are available to the public. We are being asked \nright now to enact it into Federal law.\n  The other thing this language that the city of Chicago is offering \ndoes is take the unprecedented step of saying if this new airport \nviolates the Clean Air Act, if we are going to violate the EPA laws, \nthen the EPA must revise their own regulations so that the plan can \nfly. Isn't that nice? We are just going to give them in Federal law a \ncart blanche to violate the permissible levels of toxic pollutants put \nout, and we are going to do that in the Senate. Isn't that a good idea?\n  My understanding is there are airports around the country that have \nhad problems because they haven't been able to comply with the Clean \nAir Act. But they have to make modifications so they comply with the \nClean Air Act.\n  I would like O'Hare Airport--whether the current airport or a \nredesigned O'Hare--to comply with the Clean Air Act. I wouldn't want \nthe Clean Air Act modified or weakened or the burden put on some other \nindustry to make up for the added pollution given out by O'Hare \nAirport.\n  Of course, one of the problems we have in airports such as O'Hare in \na congested urban and suburban surrounding is that you pose a risk of \ntoxic pollutants to hundreds of thousands of people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would prefer to continue and give the Senator \nplenty of time to respond at the end of my speech.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, another issue I have been concerned \nabout and Congressman Jackson and Congressman Hyde have been concerned \nabout for a very long period of time is that we have two airlines that \nhave 87 percent of the aviation market at O'Hare. Those airlines are \nUnited and American. I applaud the hard-working employees of those \nairlines. I have a great deal of respect for them. They have been \nthrough a very difficult fall.\n  But one of the issues I am concerned about is that there is not \nadequate competition on long-haul flights to Chicago. We have some \ncompetition coming out of Midway Airport, and very good competition \nfrom great airlines, ATA and Southwest. It is difficult to do long-haul \nflights because the runways are so short.\n  I thought it would be preferable to build a third airport because \nthat would provide new entrants in the Chicago aviation area and an \nopportunity to compete with United and American.\n  A GAO study commissioned by Congress a couple of years ago said \nmonopoly overcharges at Chicago's O'Hare Airport--additional fees that \nconsumers of air travel in the Chicago area pay that result from \nmonopoly conditions at O'Hare--amount to $623 million a year. In fact, \nGovernor Ryan, when he was campaigning for Governor, put out a policy \npaper that cited that GAO report in support of his then position \nfavoring the third airport.\n\n  While I think Senator Durbin's ultimate objective and certainly Mayor \nDaley's objective would to be expand capacity at O'Hare, my question is \nhow construction would proceed. When they are tearing up and rebuilding \nO'Hare, my worry would be we would, in fact, have less capacity than we \ndo right now due to construction.\n  Anybody in the Chicago area who drives the expressways from the \nsuburbs to the city or from the city to the suburbs knows what happens \nwhen there is a construction project during\n\n[[Page S12638]]\n\nthe summer on the expressways. It causes huge bottlenecks. People's \ncommutes to work are doubled.\n  My fear is that, while we are doing this massive tearing up and \nrebuilding of O'Hare, the delays we have been enduring for the last few \nyears at O'Hare and around the country would, in fact, be exacerbated.\n  In addition, one of the things that the language Senator Durbin will \nbe offering in the conference committee, if he succeeds in getting this \nlanguage adopted tonight, in my judgment--and I think Senator Durbin \nwill probably dispute it, but I will let him speak for himself--this \nlanguage is a backdoor means of killing the third airport at the south \nsuburban site.\n  There is a section in the bill that mentions Peotone, but it really \nis just lipservice. It says the FAA must consider Peotone. But I think \nI will be able to demonstrate as we go on tonight that the specific \nterms of the language, because they mandate a reconstruction project at \nO'Hare, would have the effect of drying up the justification for going \nforward with a third airport.\n  The State's premise for building the third airport has always been \nthat there was not going to be an expansion of O'Hare. The Chicago \nAirport Capacity Study of 1986 to 1988, in fact, concluded that it \nwasn't feasible--I agree with them--to expand the capacity at O'Hare, \nwhich leads me to my discussion of the wisdom of expanding O'Hare as \nopposed to going forward with a third airport in the south suburbs.\n  The bottom line, in my argument, is that we would get more capacity \nmore quickly at less cost by building a third airport in the south \nsuburbs than we would by going forward with Mayor Daley's expansion \nplan at O'Hare. Of course, going forward with the third airport would \nstill leave money for everybody else's airports in the country. I don't \nthink Mayor Daley's plan would.\n  If I could point to a couple of the advantages, first with respect to \ncost. There have been many estimates of the cost. I think we can count \non the O'Hare expansion being at least $13 billion. That was the figure \ncited by Kirk Brown, director of the department of transportation of \nthe State of Illinois in August with respect to Mayor Daley's expansion \nplan. That is because there is $6 billion in runway reconstruction that \nis being proposed and talked about right now. There is $4 billion for \nthe World Gateway Terminal Program that is already underway. Then there \nis $3 billion in related roadway improvements.\n  In contrast, the third airport would be on a greenfield site on \n24,000 acres in a rural area and would only cost $5 billion to $6 \nbillion, roughly the same amount at Denver International Airport. It is \nlaid out similarly on a lot of land with a lot of space. It is easier \nto build in an open space than it is to go into a congested urban area. \nIt is easier than going into an existing airport such as O'Hare, \ntearing up and moving the runways, and in some cases tearing them up \nand moving them over 500 feet. You don't have that waste if you just go \nahead and build the third airport.\n  Capacity: Mayor Daley's plan would add 700,000 additional flight \noperations at O'Hare. It is now at 900,000 operations. An additional \n700,000 a year would bring it to 1.6 million operations in a year.\n  But, in fact, for a third of the cost, the capacity could be 1.6 \nmillion operations, much greater for the long-term future of our \ncountry.\n  Construction of the third airport: By the terms of the legislation, \nwhich Senator Durbin will provide to the conference committee, you can \nsee they aren't even anticipating getting to the final runway at O'Hare \nuntil 2011. That project is going to go on for more than a decade. It \nwill go on and on and on, and people will probably, in my judgment, be \ndelayed during the construction.\n\n  In contrast, it is estimated that phase I of the third airport could \nbe up in 3 to 5 years after we got approval. And a request for approval \nhas already been started at the FAA. The State has already submitted \nthat plan. The city of Chicago has not submitted its plan yet to the \nFAA.\n  Community: With respect to O'Hare, you have significant opposition \nfrom communities surrounding O'Hare. The quality of life of hundreds of \nthousands of people would be adversely affected by that proposal. Yet \nin the south suburbs, you generally have significant community support, \nalthough there is, of course, some local opposition from homeowners; \nthere is no question about that.\n  Going back to the competition point, the O'Hare expansion, in one of \nthe designs of this whole O'Hare expansion, is to goldplate United's \nand American's position at O'Hare. At United and American, they do a \ngood job. I fly them back and forth every week between Washington and \nIllinois. But they do enjoy a monopoly position. They have an 87-\npercent market share at Chicago O'Hare Airport. The fact is, they have \nbeen opposing O'Hare expansion for years, probably as much as 30 years.\n  O'Hare first reached capacity in 1969. That is when the FAA had to \ncap the number of flights there because the demand for flights started \nto exceed capacity. The former Mayor Daley tried to build a third \nairport. He tried to build an airport at Lake Michigan, a third \nairport. He recognized back in the early 1970s the need for a new \nairport.\n  What this O'Hare expansion would do is, it would lock in American's \nand United's dominance of the aviation market in Chicago. That is good \nfor the shareholders of United and American. But I would say that is \nnot good for consumers. We benefit by having more choices, by having \ncompetition, by having new entrants come into the airport.\n  If we had a new airport, we would have new entrants coming into the \nChicago market almost certainly. We have had testimony before the \nSenate Commerce Committee that new entrants have a hard time or cannot \nget into O'Hare. In fact, a representative of JetBlue testified earlier \nthis year that they wanted to run flights to Chicago out of New York, \nbut they could not get into Midway or O'Hare.\n  We have to confront this issue because passenger travel has gone up \n400 percent in this country since deregulation. But the major hub \ncarriers have blocked every single new airport in the last 20 years \nwith the exception of Denver. And in Denver's case, they insisted that \nStapleton Airport be shut down so they could not get a maverick carrier \nlike Southwest in there competing.\n  So you look around the country now. What Congress has allowed to \nhappen is we have monopolies by region in aviation. If you go to \nAtlanta, Delta has a dominant position. If you go to Minneapolis-St. \nPaul, you have Northwest, which has a dominant position. They have also \na dominant position in Memphis and Detroit. If you look at Dallas, in \nSenator Gramm's State, you have a dominant position by American \nAirlines.\n  In Chicago, United and American share their dominance. We are blessed \nin Chicago because we have a duopoly as opposed to a monopoly; and that \nis somewhat better. But the fact of the matter is, consumers around the \ncountry are suffering because they do not have aviation choices in \ntheir communities. And the airlines kind of like this situation. You do \nnot see Delta making much of an attempt to go into United's and \nAmerican's turf in Chicago, and you do not see much of an attempt by \nUnited and American to go and intrude on Delta's dominant position at \nAtlanta's Hartsfield Airport. They have kind of carved up the Nation's \naviation market like slices of apple pie.\n\n  I would like to focus and turn our attention now to a section-by-\nsection analysis of the language that Senator Durbin would like to \nintroduce into the conference committee on the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  If we start right at the beginning of section (1), it is entitled: \n``Necessity Of O'Hare Runway Redesign And Development of South Suburban \nAirport.''\n  Section (1) (a) reads:\n\n       The Congress hereby declares that redesign and \n     reconstruction of Chicago-O'Hare International Airport in \n     Cook and DuPage Counties, Illinois in accordance with the \n     runway redesign plan----\n\n  And that is later defined----\n\n       and the development of a south suburban airport in the \n     Chicago metropolitan region, are each required to improve the \n     efficiency of, and relieve congestion in, the national air \n     transportation system.\n\n  I submit that the very first paragraph of Senator Durbin's language\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\nthat he hopes to put into the conference committee report--that there \nis no basis for this language. There is not a single report, no \nfinding, no study, no cost analysis, no cost-benefit analysis to \nsupport the idea that we should both build a massive O'Hare and go \nforward with the south suburban airport that I discussed.\n  As we discussed, the State's premise for the third airport is that \nO'Hare would not and could not be expanded. There are studies--there \nare reams of studies--going back many years that say we need a third \nairport. Those studies are premised on the belief that there is no way \nthat O'Hare could be feasibly expanded. And so there is justification \nfor Peotone.\n  There is no study--nothing--that supports the notion that we need \nboth a massive new O'Hare and a Peotone.\n  Now 49 U.S.C., section 47115, subsection (c), says that as a \ncondition of any discretionary grants a cost-benefit analysis of the \nproject should be done.\n  We are mandating a project right now. And apparently we are not going \nto do a cost-benefit analysis. Why is Congress, why is the Senate being \nasked to gut our mechanism for applying an analytical review process to \nimprovements and changes at runways and airports around the country? \nWhat are the costs and benefits here? We do not know. This is a \nbackroom deal that happened about 48 hours ago. In fact, it was less \nthan 48 hours ago that they reached that backroom deal. And we do not \nhave any of the details. We do not have any of the internal documents. \nWe do not have any of the background information that we need. And, \nmoreover, we are not the ones who should be passing on this backroom \ndeal.\n  If there is a runway plan that the city of Chicago has, they should \nsubmit it through the appropriate channels. The other thing that the \nFAA's cost-benefit analysis, that Congress has mandated, requires is \nthat it requires a consideration of alternatives. If an airport is \nproposing an expansion plan, the FAA would make them go through a \nrigorous analysis of what would be the alternative. What are the costs \nand the benefits of an alternative?\n  Isn't that the sort of analytical approach we should take on these \nthings? Why are we mandating, codifying in Federal law, and \npreordaining the outcome? No one is going to look at whether this plan \nmakes sense. We are just going to make it a Federal statute. And it \ndoes not matter whether it makes sense.\n  No one has introduced details of costs. There are no benefits that \nhave been suggested and no alternatives. There is no such analysis \navailable for O'Hare. And they have not offered any new analysis on \nPeotone.\n  So, in short, this language that Senator Durbin hopes to put in the \nconference committee report guts the analytical framework mandated by \nCongress and makes this the only mandated runway construction plan in \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, we talked earlier about how the costs would probably \nbe borne by the airport improvement fund to some extent around the \ncountry. If you go to section 1(b), it says that ``The Federal Aviation \nAdministrator shall implement this Federal policy by facilitating \napproval, funding, construction, and implementation of'' the runway \ndesign plan. So the FAA, its hands are tied. It must facilitate, it \nshall--the word is ``shall''--shall facilitate the approval, the \nfunding, construction, and implementation.\n  What if the FAA were to decide they didn't want to give this any \ndiscretionary grants? I would think anybody who had bought a bond that \nwas issued in reliance on this language that the FAA would be compelled \nto facilitate the funding might have a claim there. They would be in a \nposition, the city would be in a position to force the FAA to cough up \nmoney, and it would be forced to cough up perhaps at the expense of \nother airports around the country.\n  We have said this involves blockbuster amounts. This is not a $1 \nbillion project, this is a $2 or a $3 billion project. This is $6 \nbillion for the construction of runways, and then it is $2 to $3 \nbillion for a ring road and even more costs if it goes through a lot of \nbusinesses.\n  With respect to Peotone in that first paragraph, it says that there \nis a necessity for O'Hare runway redesign and development of a south \nsuburban airport. But it doesn't say what kind of a south suburban \nairport. Is this a one-runway south suburban airport or a six-runway \nsouth suburban airport? There have been different proposals in that \nregard. The State of Illinois has already submitted a proposal to the \nFAA for a starter south suburban airport that would have one runway \ninitially but could be expanded to six. This language does not say.\n  With respect to airport financing, it is pretty well gone, certainly \non the Senate Commerce Committee. And I am sure, as most of the \nSenators, that these projects are typically paid for with a combination \nof general airport revenue bonds that the airlines agree to help retire \nover time, and also another element is passenger facility charges, so-\ncalled PFC fees. Of course, one major component is the one I was \ndiscussing before that I would suggest would be depleted for other \nairports around the country. That is the airport improvement funds. \nHuge amounts of airport improvements funds would be sucked up for \nO'Hare, for a controversial plan that the residents, the legislature, \nthe congressional delegation of Illinois are split on, and many don't \neven want it.\n  Congress should not obligate itself to these huge expenditures in \nSenator Durbin's language. It is clear to me that Congress, if it \nenacted into law Senator Durbin's language, would be obligating itself \nto huge expenditures. But we don't even know what those expenditures \nwould be because those haven't been introduced or shown to anybody. We \ndon't know what it would cost. But we would be obligating ourselves.\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I suppose it would not be the first time we have \npicked up some unspecified liability, but I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been a fiscal watchdog for the taxpayers, and he and I worked \ntogether to make sure that the taxpayers were not abused with respect \nto the airline bailout bill. We were concerned about the amounts there, \nand others in this Chamber were. I would suggest to the Presiding \nOfficer and all Members of this body that we should be very cautious in \nobligating ourselves to unknown costs. We are assuming liabilities that \nare not specified in this language.\n\n  The airport improvement funds have two components. Two-thirds of AIP \nfunding is based on a formula which is in turn based on the size of the \nairport and the number of enplanements at the airport. If O'Hare is the \nbusiest airport in the Nation this year, that means that based on the \nformula, it is probably getting the most airport improvement money of \nany airport in the country.\n  If its size is doubled, then indeed its share of the airport \nimprovement funds, formula funds, would in fact be close to double. \nThat would come out of other airports around the country.\n  The other third of the airport improvement funds comes from \ndiscretionary grants. I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that \nthis language would obligate the FAA to take huge chunks of their \ndiscretionary money and put it into this project at O'Hare that I don't \nsupport, that Congressman Hyde does not support, that Jesse Jackson, \nJr., doesn't support, that the State Senate of Illinois does not \nsupport. All that money would be obligated to come from all of your \nprojects.\n  So, again, why not just go forward and build the third airport? The \nState committed the proposal for the third airport. We would get more \ncapacity by building Peotone alone, and we would have money left over \nfor airport improvements elsewhere in the country.\n  I would also be concerned for the airports I have in downstate \nIllinois. Some of their AIP funds could be sucked up and given to \nO'Hare. This project could in fact be done at the expense of some of \nthe downstate airports in Illinois. We would be doing this all at a \ntime when we have a complete absence of models, a complete absence of \nFAA models, a complete absence of specifics, a complete absence of \nstudies, a complete absence of detailed financial cost disclosures, and \na complete absence of alternatives.\n  With respect to the costs, the costs are written. And in fact the \nrunway design plan that would be mandated here is written and defined \nin such a way as to include undefined elements. In fact,\n\n[[Page S12640]]\n\nin section 1(f), it says that the term ``runway design plan'' means six \nparallel runways at O'Hare oriented in the east-west direction with the \ncapability for four simultaneous, independent instrument aircraft \narrivals and all associated taxiways, navigational facilities--what \ndoes that mean?--passenger handling facilities--is that terminals?--and \nother related facilities, and on top, the FAA would be mandated to \nfacilitate this, presumably with funds, and the closure of existing \nrunways 14L-32R, 14R-32L, and 18-36.\n  I said earlier that the State was preempted and that really is the \ncrux of why we are here. You have a plan that cannot get approved by \nthe State legislature, and therefore we are being asked to substitute \nourselves for the State legislature of Illinois.\n  I am proud to have served in the Illinois State Senate. Many \ndistinguished people, including Abraham Lincoln, served in the Illinois \nGeneral Assembly. I would suggest to my colleagues that it is not \nappropriate for us to be substituting ourselves for the Illinois \nGeneral Assembly. If the mayor needs their help in getting this plan \napproved, he ought to go submit his plans to the Illinois General \nAssembly. But instead, if you look at section 1(c) of Senator Durbin's \nlanguage, what the bill attempts to do is preempt State laws. I will \nread the language here that is the crux of Senator Durbin's bill:\n\n       The State shall not enact or enforce any law respecting \n     aeronautics that interferes with or has the effect of \n     interfering with implementation of Federal policy with \n     respect to the runway redesign plan including, without \n     limitation, sections 38.01, 47 and 48 of the Illinois \n     Aeronautics Act.\n\n  This clearly preempts the Illinois Aeronautics Act. It preempts \nspecifically and gives specific mention to the sections of that act \nthat require a hearing process, a vetting process, a permitting \nprocess. It wipes out the State's permitting process.\n  I believe this language is broad enough. It does not just say it \nwipes out the Illinois Aeronautics Act, although it does mention it \nspecifically. It says any law respecting aeronautics that interferes \nwith or has the effect of interfering with the implementation of this \nlaw. So that would wipe out, in my judgment, environmental laws if they \nwere a roadblock. If Mayor Daley could not comply with State \nenvironmental laws, he would have a Federal mandate to blow those away. \nHe would not have to comply with the environmental laws of the State of \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would rather yield at the end, I say to my \ncolleague, my good friend from Illinois.\n  State securities laws could come into play if there are airport bonds \nthat are issued. If they had the effect of interfering with this, could \nthey be overridden?\n  There are other States that are in this position, in fact, that have \nsome State laws in this area. I have a chart. This chart was actually \nprepared for a different bill, H.R. 2107. That was an attempt by \nCongressman Lipinski in the House to preempt local and State laws \nregarding airport approval processes.\n  I believe there are a total of 26 States that have some control to \ngive approval to local airport projects. Of course, Illinois is one of \nthem, and all these other States--in fact, Mr. President, some of your \nneighboring States--Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire, \nVermont, Massachusetts, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, \nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, New \nMexico, Alaska, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi--\nthey all have some State laws in this regard to regulate airports. In \nmy judgment, it is a bad precedent for the Federal Government to begin \noverriding those laws. Perhaps some of those people in those State \nlegislatures and some of the local permitting authorities know \nsomething about their local projects and we in Washington should not be \nsubstituting our judgment for their judgment.\n  I do not think it is a good idea we come in and blow out the laws of \nthe State of Illinois that have been enacted by people duly elected to \nserve and represent their interests. We would be obliterating the say \nof the people in the Illinois General Assembly by enacting this \nmeasure.\n  Again, the mayor could have gone to the legislature to pass this \nplan, but he did not want to or he could not, so he came to Congress to \nwipe out the State's legislature law. At the heart of this legislation, \nmore than anything else, is really an attack on the Illinois General \nAssembly, if you want my opinion.\n  If we turn to section 1(e) of the bill, this section indicates there \nis a fear on the part of the proponents that the mayor's expansion \nproposal will violate national air quality standards. Therefore, what \nthis language does in section 1(e) of the bill is it will force the \nU.S. EPA to rewrite and weaken environmental regulations to keep them \nat the same strength by having some other industry in Illinois pay for \nit. Either that or it would just cause them to weaken their regulations \naltogether.\n  Section 1(e) reads as follows:\n\n       If the Administrator determines that construction or \n     operation of the runway redesign plan would not conform, \n     within the meaning of section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act, to \n     an applicable implementation plan approved or promulgated \n     under section 110 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall forthwith cause or promulgate a \n     revision of such implementation plan sufficient for the \n     runway redesign plan to satisfy the requirements of \n     section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n  What does that mean? It means if Mayor Daley's runway redesign plan \nviolates the Clean Air Act, then the EPA must weaken the Clean Air Act \nso the plan no longer violates the Clean Air Act, or they must, through \ntheir crediting process, put the burden on some other industry. Not \nmany industries in Illinois are aware of that.\n  Right after that, we have section 1(g) that, again, refers to the \n``south suburban airport.'' It says:\n\n       The term ``south suburban airport'' means a supplemental \n     air carrier airport in the vicinity of Peotone, Illinois.\n\n  Again, there is no definition. Is that a 6-runway or a 10-runway \nairport? We do not know. There have been different proposals, so I do \nnot think this language is necessarily well done.\n  Section 2 of the bill is on phasing of construction. This bill \nsuggests that, in fact, the city would be forbidden from beginning \nconstruction of the sixth runway until 2011. What that means is that \nprior to 2011, there will not be six parallel runways at O'Hare.\n  We have seven runways at O'Hare today. Prior to 2011, there will only \nbe five parallel runways? Will we have less capacity at O'Hare until \nthe sixth runway is finally built in 2011? It raises interesting \nquestions. Western roadway access, again--and I had this colloquy with \nmy colleague from Illinois. He disputes this, but I believe the \nlanguage would require that the airport revenues be made available to \npay for western public roadway access and revenues of the airport.\n  As the Presiding Officer would know, having been the chairman of \nGoldman Sachs, one of our country's leading investment banking firms, \nthe revenues of the airport would include all their revenues, whatever \nsource derived, whether passenger facility charges or airport \nimprovement funds. They could apparently use airport improvement funds \nto help with the roadway project.\n\n       The Administrators shall not consider, and shall reject as \n     incomplete, an airport layout plan submitted by Chicago that \n     includes the runway redesign plan, unless it includes public \n     roadway access through the western boundary of O'Hare to \n     passenger terminal and parking facilities.\n\n  I do believe that roadway access would help with O'Hare. The problem \nis right now we have to build another terminal out there on the western \nside for it to be truly as valuable as it should be. There is a \nquestion as to where this roadway would go. It would be a massive \nroadway. Would it take out several villages, such as Elk Grove and \nother villages, in the area?\n  In fact, Mr. President, we have some maps that show some of the \nsurrounding communities. We see the problems we get into when we start \na massive plan such as this in a congested urban and suburban area.\n  That western ring road would be on the western boundary of O'Hare. It \nwould go from I-90 presumably on the north down somewhere to Irving \nPark Road on the south.\n  I will point out that Elk Grove Village is there. The largest \nindustrial park in the entire Nation is right about\n\n[[Page S12641]]\n\nhere. If this road goes through, it would take out perhaps 20 percent \nor more of the largest industrial park in the country. I do not favor \nthat.\n  If they wanted to do the western access on airport property, I think \nI would favor that, but I would not favor this. Will we give Federal \nimpetus to something that nobody in this body was intending, perhaps \nnot even sponsored the language, and that is the destruction of a large \nportion of Elk Grove Village, IL?\n  I know Elk Grove Village, IL, very well. I represented that area when \nI was in the State senate. I represented the northwest suburbs. I know \nthe mayor of Elk Grove is very concerned about losing the tax base in \nhis village and hundreds of wonderful, strong businesses that use the \nindustrial park.\n  There is a large section on noise mitigation, and I will address that \nsection as well. There seems to be an attempt to address the noise \nconcerns that would be created by this expansion program, but I think \nthere is a trick. If we look at section (4)(b)(1), it says:\n\n       Approval by the administrator of an airport layout plan \n     that includes the runway redesign plan shall be subject to \n     the condition that noise impact of aircraft operations at \n     O'Hare in the calendar year immediately following the year in \n     which the first new runway is first used, and in each \n     calendar year thereafter, will be less than the noise impact \n     in calendar year 2000. The administrator shall make the \n     determination required by this section.\n\n  The trick is they are comparing today's fleet with a much quieter \nfleet in the future. It is not an apples to apples comparison. The \napples to apples comparison would be to take the future fleet at the \ncurrent level of operations and to compare that future fleet at the \nfuture level with the current level with the future fleet. So it gets \ncomplicated. What they are doing is clever but misleading.\n  I say to my constituents who are worried about that issue, there is \nnot a lot to help them with their concern of the disruption in their \nlife caused by this massive expansion plan. Of course, this expansion \nis in a very congested urban and suburban area with hundreds of \nthousands of people living in and around there, most of whom--our \nphones have been ringing off the hook--are opposed to this plan, but \nthe Senate is being asked to approve this plan tonight.\n  I apologize for that because I do not think this is an appropriate \nbill, the Defense appropriations bill, and I regret that we have to be \ndebating this specific issue tonight.\n  Section 5 of the bill pays lipservice to the south suburban airport \nissue. It says:\n\n       The administrator shall give priority consideration to a \n     letter of intent application submitted by the State of \n     Illinois or a political subdivision thereof for the \n     construction of the south suburban airport. This \n     consideration shall be given not later than 90 days after \n     final record of decision approving the airport layout plan \n     for the south suburban airport has been issued by the \n     administrator.\n\n  This has been billed and portrayed in Illinois as legislation that \nwould actually move the ball forward with respect to the third airport. \nI suggest to my colleagues this language, in fact, kills the third \nairport in the south suburbs. The reason I say that is any airport \nfunding for the south suburban airport would be, one, soaked up by the \nmassive expansion at O'Hare and, two, all this language requires is the \nadministrator give consideration to a letter of intent submitted by the \nState of Illinois.\n\n  The FAA is already going to consider the letter of intent submitted \nby the FAA. We do not need this language. They are already going to \nconsider it. Maybe it would speed it up a little bit, but that is about \nall. There is no guarantee the third airport would be approved. In \nfact, I believe the justification for the third airport would vanish in \nlight of the massive expansion of O'Hare. Again, the whole premise for \nthe third airport was it is not feasible to expand O'Hare.\n  Make no mistake about it, everyone in Illinois should know this \nlanguage is a Peotone killer. It is a backdoor way of ensuring the \nthird south suburban airport will never be built in the State of \nIllinois.\n  There is no justification--no cost-benefit analysis would suggest the \nFAA should approve that plan once the massive expansion of O'Hare has \nbeen approved.\n  The next section, section 6, is a section I think should be of \nspecial concern to every Member in this body from every State in this \ncountry. This is the section that would require the Federal Government \nto construct this massive plan at O'Hare, which I have said I do not \nwant, many Members of Congress in my State do not want, and the State \nlegislature will not approve. The Senate will be asked to pay for it as \na Federal project. That would be nice if the Chair would, for instance, \ngive me his airport funds from Newark Airport to pay for this project, \nexcept I do not want this project.\n  I think every Member in this body should think long and hard whether \nthey want their airport improvement funds to be sucked up by a massive \nO'Hare expansion plan, a $13 billion plan at least, in my judgment, \nsomething that I do not even want in my State, that is very \ncontroversial in my State.\n  What this language says is:\n\n       On July 1, 2004, or as soon thereafter as may be possible, \n     the administrator shall construct the runway redesign plan as \n     a Federal project, provided (1) the administrator finds, \n     after notice and opportunity for public comment, that a \n     continuous course of construction of the runway redesign plan \n     has not commenced and is not reasonably expected to commence \n     by December 1, 2004.\n\n  I am not sure whether those are the exact dates they are going to \nwant, but that is the language Senator Durbin shared with me, and I \nappreciate that. He did not spring this language on me. He shared this \nwith me. I called him yesterday and I asked him to fax the language he \nwanted to introduce in the conference committee. I compliment him for \nnot taking me by surprise and for disclosing his intentions as to the \nconference report.\n  What that means is if there has not been a continuous course of \nconstruction on the runway redesign plan, then the Federal Government, \nthe FAA, the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administrator, shall \ntake this project over and shall construct a runway redesign plan as a \nFederal project. So all the taxpayers and all the other States would \npay for it.\n  I love it when the Senate gives money to my State. Our State has not \ngotten its fair share of Federal funds over the years. I think we are \ndoing a lot better. Thanks to the leadership of the Speaker of the \nHouse, who is from Illinois, we are doing better in that regard in \nrecent years. I enjoy it when my colleagues are generous with money for \nmy State, but this is a project I do not support. So I ask, please, do \nnot take money out of your airports and deprive them of revenue to put \ninto a project in my State that I do not support.\n  One of the interesting parts of this whole thing is if we go back to \nsection (1)(c) of Senator Durbin's language, the first thing this bill \nreally does is it preempts the Illinois Aeronautics Act.\n  The interesting thing about the bill, it goes on to say the city of \nChicago shall not build the runway redesign plan, and if for some \nreason they did not, the Federal Government will step into its place \nand do it. But it can delegate those responsibilities, then, back to \nthe city of Chicago.\n  Interestingly, under our State law, municipalities such as city of \nChicago don't have any authority except from State law to operate its \nairports. That is where the city of Chicago gets its authority to \noperate O'Hare. They have it from the Illinois Aeronautics Act. But \nthis Federal bill would obliterate the Illinois Aeronautics Act. How \nwould Illinois or Chicago have the authority to even have the airport? \nWould O'Hare airport or the city of Chicago become a Federal \nreservation? It is not clear. Very unusual language, in my judgment.\n  I am sure the proponents, especially United and American, have a lot \nof employees, a lot of contractors and subcontractors, a lot of people \nwho do work for them.\n  They have influential directorships, they are very active and \ninvolved in the community in Chicago. This is a bonanza for them \nbecause it blocks a third airport for generations to come and they \nwould be assured, in my judgment, of not having any effective \ncompetition in the Chicago market from any other long-haul carriers for \nas long as the eye can see, as far as we can see into the future. In my \njudgment, this is not in the interests of the general public.\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\n  Once the legislature's granted authority is obliterated by this \nFederal legislation, then interestingly the city has no authority to \nbuild. The city would lose its legal authority to contract for an \nairport, so this is very curious language. That would point out that is \nexactly why we shouldn't be acting in the Senate as though we were the \nIllinois State Legislature. You get these problems, unintended \nconsequences, when you start rewriting the Illinois Aeronautics Act or \npreempting it at the Federal level. You get all sorts of unintended \nconsequences. It is not a good idea, in my judgment, to come in and \nrewrite a State act, especially on a Defense appropriations bill at \n8:30 in the evening on Friday night when we should be debating defense \namendments.\n  We have our troops on the ground in Afghanistan. This, clearly, isn't \nthe appropriate forum to debate the propriety of the Illinois \nAeronautics Act. Let the State legislature take up the Illinois \nAeronautics Act when they get back into session next January.\n  Then if you go on--and the language is many pages long--if you go to \nthe end, they do have the provision I support and that is keeping Meigs \nField open in Chicago. I don't know if the President has ever flown in \nor out of Meigs Field, but it is a beautiful airport on the Chicago \nlakefront. The business community loves that airport. People are able \nto fly right into the heart of downtown Chicago. They are right in the \ncity and can easily get to a meeting. It is a great general aviation \nairport. There is a provision that would do something to assist keeping \nMeigs Field open. I support that. It was regrettable the city of \nChicago wanted to close Meigs Field.\n  I always thought that was a mistake. Meigs Field has handled as many \nas 50,000 flight operations a year. If it shuts down, you will put \nthose flights into Midway and O'Hare--a large number of them, anyway--\nwhich will add to congestion at Midway and O'Hare.\n  I have always felt closing Meigs Field was inconsistent with \nalleviating air traffic congestion in the Chicago area. I was \ndisappointed the city wanted to close it.\n\n  This backroom deal we are being asked to codify, which is under 48 \nhours old, and no specifics or financing or details or studies have \nbeen released to the general public back in Illinois, has been \nportrayed in the press as keeping Meigs Field open until January 1 of \nthe year 2026. It appears to give it another 25 years. But they have a \nprovision in here that would allow the Illinois General Assembly to \nclose Meigs Field in 6 years.\n  Now, is this not odd? On the one hand, they take away, obliterate the \nState statute passed by the Illinois General Assembly, passed by all \nthe State representatives and State senators in Illinois and enacted \ninto law by the Governor, we are asked to obliterate one act, but on \nthe other hand, we are writing a law that the State legislature in \nIllinois would have to comply with, and that is they can't shut Meigs \nField down prior to January 1, 2006. But after January 1, 2006, Meigs \nField could be shut down by the Illinois Legislature. In fact, it says \nin section (7)(4)(b):\n\n       The administrator shall not enforce the conditions \n     specified in subsection (a) if the State of Illinois enacts a \n     law on or after January 1, 2006, authorizing the closure of \n     Meigs Field.\n\n  So we are at the Federal level granting the State of Illinois the \nauthority in Federal statute to close Meigs Field. However, we are \ntaking away the Illinois General Assembly's authority to have anything \nto do with O'Hare. It is wildly inconsistent. There is no principle \nbehind what they are doing. That is what you get with a backroom deal \nthat is the product of people saying: I will scratch your back if you \nscratch mine.\n  We are being asked to put a secret backroom deal into Federal law.\n  Now, I get to the final section on judicial review. That is section \n8. It says that what this is designed to do, as I read it--and I have \nto say I have not yet looked up title 49, United States Code, subtitle \nVII, part A, but I have a feeling what this is meant to do is basically \nto cut off the right of trial and to deprive anyone who would question \nthis backroom deal; they would never get their day in court. So this \nsection 8 curtails the judicial review and says you never get your day \nin court. If you want to challenge this deal, that is tough luck. What \nhappens is you won't get a right of trial in the district court. You \nwill have to go right to a court of appeals and the FAA will control \nall the facts below and you will get 20 minutes in a court of appeals \nand that is it.\n  This is a way of cutting off anybody who may object to this, cutting \noff their right to use their legal rights they might have. Those rights \nwould be curtailed.\n  Going back to the safety issue, I have great concerns. I am concerned \nthat two sets of parallel runways in the proposal of the new design at \nO'Hare would be too close together. My understanding is--and we only \nhave what we know from news accounts because no details are released--\nthere has not ever been a formal plan submitted to the FAA or to the \nState, so we don't have all the details. We have maps that have \nappeared in newspapers and the like. It is everybody's best guess as to \nwhat is in the backroom deal we are being asked to codify into Federal \nlaw tonight. But it looks, from what I understand of the information \navailable to me, that these two sets of parallel runways on which they \nwould like to have simultaneous takeoffs and landings would be only \n1,300 feet apart. The FAA regulations require ordinarily, without a \nwaiver, a 4,300 foot separation between runways.\n  Now, the problem with that is if a plane is landing in one direction \nand another taking off in another direction and a plane turns here, it \ncould hit a plane coming into another runway. We are not cutting down \nthe margin of error.\n  I can understand why they can't make a 4,300 foot separation between \nrunways on this airport land in Chicago. They don't have enough room. \nO'Hare's footprint is only about 7,000 acres. They would try to take \n500 homes in the city of Bensenville and displace those people and \nbulldoze their homes. They would be moving some roadways. Mr. \nPresident, you and other Senators might be paying for that out of your \nairport improvement funds under this language.\n  But the problem is they are trying to jam too much in here. There are \nonly 7,000 acres. A newer airport--the third, south suburban airport in \na location known as Peotone in Will County south of Cook County where \nChicago is located--would be on 24,000 acres. There would be plenty of \nroom to have parallel runways. They would be appropriately spaced.\n  We also talked about in addition to the runways being too close \ntogether, several of these--I don't know how far the distance is \nbetween 927-L, the arriving runway, and the south 927 runway. I don't \nknow what that would be. I haven't even seen press accounts of what \nthat would be. Again, there is no formal plan. All of these seem \nawfully close together.\n  In my judgment, we could be working against ourselves by going \nforward with a plan such as that. God forbid. If there ever were a \nproblem that resulted by packing too many runways in too close, we \nwould have made a horrible mistake.\n  Some Members of this body may believe they are capable of passing on \nthe safety of a runway design plan. But I certainly can tell you that I \ndon't have that expertise, and I suspect none of us really has the kind \nof engineering background and experience that would require. Maybe \nsomebody here has that expertise, but I don't think so. That is why I \ndon't think it is appropriate for us to enact into law a runway design \nplan. Never before has Congress, to my knowledge, enacted into Federal \nlaw a runway design plan. We allow this to go through a vetting \nprocess. We allow people to study and vet and test, and we get input \nfrom air traffic controllers, from pilots, from experts, and from \nengineers. They are the ones who need to come and give us their views \non the propriety of such a layout.\n  You shouldn't be called upon, Mr. President, as the Senator from New \nJersey, at a quarter to 9 on a Friday night, to decide whether this is \na good runway design plan. Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't. Do you \nbelieve we can guarantee to the people of this country that in fact \nthis is a safe design plan? I had an air traffic controller in my \noffice this week who told me he had grave concerns that he thought this \nwas an unsafe plan.\n\n[[Page S12643]]\n\n  In fact, I have a letter, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, dated November 30, 2001, from the facility \nrepresentative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     National Air Traffic Controllers Association,\n\n\n                                         Chicago O'Hare Tower,\n\n                             Chicago, Illinois, November 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Peter Fitzgerald,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Fitzgerald, as requested from your staff, I have \n     summarized the most obvious concerns that air traffic \n     controllers at O'Hare have with the new runway plans being \n     considered by Mayor Daley and Governor Ryan. They are listed \n     below along with some other comments.\n       1. The Daley and Ryan plans both have a set of east/west \n     parallel runways directly north of the terminal and in close \n     proximity to one another. Because of their proximity to each \n     other (1200') they cannot be used simultaneously for \n     arrivals. They can only be used simultaneously if one is used \n     for departures and the other is used for arrivals, but only \n     during VFR (visual flight rules), or good weather conditions. \n     During IFR (instrument flight rules, ceiling below 1000' and \n     visibility less than 3 miles) these runways cannot be used \n     simultaneously at all. They basically must be operated as one \n     runway for safety reasons. The same is true for the set of \n     parallels directly south of the terminal; they too are only \n     1200' apart.\n       2. Both sets of parallel runways closest to the terminals \n     (the ones referred to above) are all a minimum of 10,000' \n     long. This creates a runway incursion problem, which is a \n     very serious safety issue. Because of their length and \n     position, all aircraft that land or depart O'Hare would be \n     required to taxi across either one, or in some cases two \n     runways to get to and from the terminal. This design flaw \n     exists in both the Daley and the Ryan plan. A runway \n     incursion is when an aircraft accidentally crosses a runway \n     when another aircraft is landing or departing. They are \n     caused by either a mistake or misunderstanding by the pilot \n     or controller. Runway incursions have skyrocketed over the \n     past few years and are on the NTSB's most wanted list of \n     safety issues that need to be addressed. Parallel runway \n     layouts create the potential for runway incursions; in fact \n     the FAA publishes a pamphlet for airport designers and \n     planners that urge them to avoid parallel runway layouts that \n     force taxiing aircraft to cross active runways. Los Angeles \n     International Airport has led the nation in runway incursions \n     for several years. A large part of their incursion problem is \n     the parallel runway layout; aircraft must taxi across runways \n     to get to and from the terminals.\n       3. The major difference in Governor Ryan's counter proposal \n     is the elimination of the southern most runway. If this \n     runway were eliminated the capacity of the new airport would \n     be less than we have now during certain conditions (estimated \n     at about 40 percent of the time). If you look at Mayor \n     Daley's plan, it calls for six parallel east-west runways and \n     two parallel northeast-southwest runways. The northeast-\n     southwest parallels are left over from the current O'Hare \n     layout. These two runways simply won't be usable in day-to-\n     day operations because of the location of them (they are \n     wedged in between, or pointed at the other parallels). We \n     would not use these runways except when the wind was very \n     strong (35 knots or above) which we estimate would be less \n     than 1 percent of the time. That leaves the six east/west \n     parallels for use in normal day-to-day operations. This is \n     the same number of runways available and used at O'Hare \n     today. If you remove the southern runway (Governor Ryan's \n     counter proposal), you are leaving us five runways which is \n     one less than we have now. That means less capacity than \n     today's O'Hare during certain weather conditions. With good \n     weather, you may get about the same capacity we have now. If \n     this is the case, then why build it?\n       4. The Daley-Ryan plans call for the removal of the NW/SE \n     parallels (Runways 32L and 32R). This is a concern because \n     during the winter it is common to have strong winds out of \n     the northwest with snow, cold temperatures and icy \n     conditions. During these times, it is critical to have \n     runways that point as close as possible into the wind. \n     Headwinds mean slower landing speeds for aircraft, and they \n     allow for the airplane to decelerate quicker after landing \n     which is important when landing on an icy runway. Landing \n     into headwinds makes it much easier for the pilot to control \n     the aircraft as well. Without these runways, pilots would \n     have to land on icy conditions during strong cross-wind \n     conditions. This is a possible safety issue.\n       These are the four major concerns we have with the Daley-\n     Ryan runway plans. There are many more minor issues that must \n     be addressed. Amongst them are taxiway layouts, clear zones \n     (areas off the ends of each runway required to be clear of \n     obstructions, ILS critical areas (similar to clear zones, but \n     for navigation purposes), airspace issues (how arrivals and \n     departures will be funneled into these runways) and all sorts \n     of other procedural type issues. These kinds of things all \n     have to go through various parts of the FAA (flight \n     standards, airport certification etc.) eventually. These \n     groups should have been involved with the planning portion \n     from day one. Air traffic controllers at the tower are well \n     versed on what works well with the current airport and what \n     does not. We can provide the best advice on what needs to be \n     accomplished to increase capacity while maintaining safety. \n     It is truly amazing that these groups were not consulted in \n     the planning of a new O'Hare. The current Daley--Ryan runway \n     plans, if built as publicized, will do little for capacity \n     and/or will create serious safety issues. This simply cannot \n     happen. The fear is that the airport will be built, without \n     our input, and then handed to us with expectations that we \n     find a way to make it work. When it doesn't, the federal \n     government (the FAA and the controllers) will be blamed for \n     safety and delay problems.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                    Craig Burzych,\n                     Facility Representative, NATCA--O'Hare Tower.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, this letter raises several concerns. I \nhave to say that Mr. Burzych and the local chapter of air traffic \ncontrollers support expanding O'Hare. They have made that very clear. I \ncertainly know they want an expanded, modernized O'Hare. There may be \nsome need to modernize O'Hare. I am not disputing that. I am just \nsaying we shouldn't be enacting a runway design plan into law.\n  In his letter, Mr. Burzych told me he had some concerns about what he \nknew of Chicago's O'Hare expansion plan. He said:\n\n       The Daley and Ryan plans both have a set of east/west \n     parallel runways directly north of the terminal and in close \n     proximity to one another.\n\n  That is the set of east/west runways in close proximity to one \nanother that are just north of the terminal.\n\n       Because of their proximity to each other (1200')--\n\n  According to Mr. Burzych; I thought it was 1,300 feet--\n\n     they cannot be used simultaneously for arrivals.\n\n  The idea that we would have parallel runways--I know the intent of \nthe mayor of Chicago is to expand the capacity at O'Hare, but this \nraises the question. The idea of the city was they could have \nsimultaneous takeoff and landing and they would get more capacity out \nof these six active runways than they get out of their current \nconfiguration, which has six active runways as well, but they converge. \nThere are three sets of parallel runways running east-west, northwest-\nsoutheast, and northeast-southwest. There are six active and one unused \nrunway now at O'Hare.\n  The idea has been that by tearing up and rebuilding these runways at \nO'Hare, we get with this configuration about the same number of \nrunways--actually eight, one runway more than we have now--but there \nwould be greater capacity.\n  It appears to me that the whole premise of this expansion program is \nin question because as this air traffic controller, certainly an expert \nin the field, said, because of their proximity to each other, they \ncannot be used simultaneously for arrivals. They can only be used \nsimultaneously as one is used for departures and the other is used for \narrivals, but only during VFR, visual flight rules, or good weather \nconditions. During IFR, instrument flight rules--ceilings below 1,000 \nfeet and visibility less than 3 miles--these runways cannot be used \nsimultaneously; they basically must be operated as one parallel runway \nfor safety reasons. The same is true for the set of parallels directly \nsouth of the terminal. They, too, are only 1,200 feet apart.\n  This shows why enacting into law a $13 billion plan at 9 o'clock on a \nFriday night as part of the Defense appropriations bill, which has \nnothing to do with the subject of aviation--enacting this plan into \nFederal law with the intention of increasing capacity at O'Hare, that \nwhole premise may be wrong. Maybe it is not wrong, but we don't know. \nThere is no study. There is no basis in the record. There is no record \nwhatsoever, no FAA model, and not a shred of any evidence that this \nbackroom deal will in fact accomplish what they are hoping to \naccomplish.\n  Then, if you go on to point No. 2 of this letter, both sets of \nparallel runways closest to the terminals--the ones referred to above--\nare all a minimum of 10,000 feet long. This creates a runway incursion \nproblem, which is a very serious safety issue. Because of their length \nand position, all aircraft that land or depart O'Hare would be required \nto taxi across either one or, in\n\n[[Page S12644]]\n\nsome cases, two runways to get to and from a terminal. Design flaw \nexists in both the Daley and the Ryan plan. A runway incursion is when \nan aircraft accidentally crosses the runway when another aircraft is \nlanding or departing. They are caused by either a mistake or \nmisunderstanding by the pilot or controller. Runway incursions have \nskyrocketed over the past few years and are on the National \nTransportation Safety Board's most-wanted list of safety issues that \nneed to be addressed.\n\n       Parallel runway layouts create the potential for runway \n     incursions; in fact the FAA publishes a pamphlet for airport \n     designers. . . .\n\n  That is the pamphlet I referred to earlier. The pamphlet is entitled: \n``Improving Runway Safety Through Airfield Configuration.'' It mentions \nthe problems that you can have with closely spaced parallel runways, \nwhich I suggest these are. There are serious safety issues here.\n\n       Los Angeles International Airport has led the nation in \n     runway incursions for several years. A large part of their \n     incursion problem is the parallel runway layout; aircraft \n     must taxi across runways to get to and from the terminals.\n\n  That is the problem. If a plane is landing or taking off here, it has \nto first come out of the gate over here. And to get from the gate over \nhere, down to this runway to take off, it has to go through at least \ntwo other runways, perhaps three. Each time it goes through one of \nthose other runways, there is the potential for an incursion.\n  I noted earlier that the current O'Hare Airport has, I think, \naccording to the State of Illinois, 25 so-called taxiway runway \ncrossings. This new plan would greatly increase that number, making it \nmuch harder for air traffic controllers. I believe, on the basis of the \ninformation available to me, that would go from 25 taxiway runway \ncrossings that they have currently at O'Hare up to 43 under the Daley \nplan. We would be nearly doubling the potential for runway incursions \njust on the basis of how many new crossings we would have.\n  I want to be clear, Mr. Burzych and air traffic controllers at O'Hare \ndo favor expanding at O'Hare. Maybe they are right and I am wrong. But \nI do believe they were not consulted in this backroom deal. This \nbackroom deal that we are being asked to codify in Federal law involved \ntwo people, and that was it. They did not have air traffic controllers \nand pilots involved in that deal. We do not even know the details of \nthat deal that we are being asked to codify in Federal law. But there \nwere other issues that he raised in his letter to me dated November 30:\n\n       The major difference in Governor Ryan's counter proposal is \n     the elimination of the southern most runway.\n\n  The Governor had originally proposed eliminating that runway because \nit involves the condemnation of 500 homes and businesses in the city of \nBensenville. He later gave in to the mayor and granted him that sixth \nrunway. The letter reads:\n\n       If this runway were eliminated, the capacity of the new \n     airport would be less than we now have during certain \n     conditions (estimated at about 40 percent of the time).\n\n  So what he is saying is that this plan, until that runway is in \nplace, under certain conditions, would have less capacity about 40 \npercent of the time at O'Hare. We would spend $13 billion for less \ncapacity at O'Hare--at least until 2011--at least 40 percent of the \ntime.\n  That is another reason this is not good government, to try to stick \nplaceholder language in the Defense appropriations bill while our \ncountry is at war in Afghanistan and we need the Defense appropriations \nbill. That is why we should not be acting as an aviation commission for \nthe State of Illinois.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       If you look at Mayor Daley's plan, it calls for six \n     parallel east-west runways and two parallel northeast-\n     southwest runways. The northeast-southwest parallels are left \n     over from the current O'Hare layout.\n  Let me read that again.\n\n       If you look at Mayor Daley's plan, it calls for six \n     parallel east-west runways and two parallel northeast-\n     southwest runways.\n\n  So we have six parallel east-west runways; these are the northeast-\nsouthwest parallels, these two runways.\n\n       The northeast-southwest parallels are left over from the \n     current O'Hare layout.\n\n  This, again, is the current O'Hare layout. These two runways would be \npreserved in this new plan of the city of Chicago.\n\n       These two runways simply won't be usable in day-to-day \n     operations because of the location of them (they are wedged \n     in between, or pointed at the other parallels). We would not \n     use these runways except when the wind was very strong (35 \n     knots or above) which we estimate would be less than 1 \n     percent of the time.\n\n  So they leave these runways. Fortunately, I guess, there is not much \nexpense in leaving these runways. All these other runways would be torn \nup from the existing O'Hare Airport. Other runways would be torn up and \nmoved. In some cases you would be paying nearly $1 billion to dig up a \nrunway and move it a few hundred feet north or south.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How long has the Senator from Illinois been involved in \nthis particular issue?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. At least dating back to 1992.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In 1992. Was that when the Senator was a member of the \nState legislature?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. When I first got elected as an Illinois State \nsenator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask, just since the Senator is well versed on this \nissue, was there a debate on this during the course of his campaign for \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Absolutely. This was an issue when I was in the State \nsenate in every election. Right prior to my going into the State \nsenate, the city of Chicago at that time did not propose expanding \nO'Hare. They proposed a third airport in the south part of Chicago in \nthe Lake Calumet area. Mayor Daley supported building a third airport \nat that time, but the Illinois General Assembly did not approve that \nplan because they favored the site in Peotone.\n  Since that time, because this third airport would not be within his \npolitical jurisdiction, Mayor Daley has fought the south suburban \nairport and worked toward just expanding O'Hare. That way, in my \njudgment, it would keep all aviation within the city limits of the city \nof Chicago.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, is it true that there was a list of proposed \nairports and airport expansion that had been formulated by the \nDepartment of Transportation, and then this proposed Peotone Airport \ndisappeared from that list? Is that correct? Can you illuminate us on \nwhat happened there?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes. What happened there was that Governor Edgar, who \nwas Governor in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was moving forward with \nthis south suburban airport. When President Clinton took office, at the \nrequest of the mayor, the FAA removed the south suburban airport from \nthe so-called NPIAS list, the National Plan for Integrated Airport \nSystems, for airport improvements. Otherwise, we might have that \nairport now.\n  The Chicago airport capacity study of 1986 to 1988 had said we needed \nthe south suburban airport by the year 2000. The city of Chicago \nblocked that by calling President Clinton and asking him to remove the \nPeotone project because it was not within the political jurisdiction of \nthe city of Chicago from that planning list.\n  Aviation capacity around the country and in Chicago would be far \ngreater today if we had that airport up and running. We would not be \nhaving this discussion. So this has, indeed, been going on a very long \ntime. I believe, as Governor Edgar did believe, and as did Governor \nThompson before him, that we ought to go forward and build that south \nsuburban airport. It is a major issue for Congressman Jackson.\n  It is interesting, as a Senator for our whole State, I do not think \nit is in our interest to concentrate all our economic development \nwithin one 7,000-acre spot at O'Hare. I have 2.5 million people who \nlive in the south suburbs of Illinois who have to drive 3, 3\\1/2\\ hours \nto get up to O'Hare to wait in line because it is too congested.\n  I would like to, in addition to bringing more aviation capacity, have \nsome economic development in other parts of the State of Illinois \nbesides 7,000 acres at O'Hare. I understand the city would like to \nretain jurisdiction over\n\n[[Page S12645]]\n\nall economic activity in the State of Illinois, but I don't think it is \nin the interest of my State. I have been working very hard with \nCongressman Jackson to, in fact, bring some economic development to \nareas outside there.\n  Incidentally, in the northwest suburbs where this is located, they \nhave what they would term too much development. There is so much \ntraffic and congestion that it is difficult to get into O'Hare. If you \nwere to double the number of people going into O'Hare Airport, in my \njudgment--right now it takes so long to get into O'Hare Airport because \nthese traffic arteries, the northwest tollway, I-90, the Kennedy \nExpressway, are jammed at all hours of the day practically every day of \nthe week with people going into O'Hare--if we expand O'Hare Airport, \nalready the busiest airport in the country for a long time, by far the \nbusiest airport in the world, we are going to make it almost twice as \nbig.\n  I don't know where the State of Illinois will get the money to double \nthe size of the roadways going in there because you can't get in there \nnow. There is no possible way that it will be feasible to funnel all \nthe people who would be going into O'Hare under this plan put forward \nby the city of Chicago.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a couple more questions, \nperhaps you can explain the importance of this NPIAS list. Many of our \ncolleagues who are not on the committee would like to know the \nsignificance of that list and whether you have ever heard of an airport \nproject being taken off a list of that importance. And my additional \nquestion is, since it seems that one of the arguments against the \nDurbin amendment that the Senator from Illinois has is that this is \nbeing done in a fairly precipitous fashion, has the Illinois State \nlegislature had any input into this? Have they made an agreement? Is \nthere opposition? Is there support?\n  Also, what is the situation with our friends on the other side of the \nCapitol in the other body? I think all of our colleagues should know, \nas the Senator from Texas earlier described--and you did--that this is \nreally the so-called placeholder that will allow in conference, \nbasically, a mandate to start funding a multibillion-dollar project. \nAlthough it is wonderful that the mayor and the Governor have been in \nagreement--and I think that is a remarkable step forward; all of us \napplaud it--aren't there other significant players here, not only in \nthe State legislature but our colleagues from the other side of the \nCapitol as well?\n  My other question is, why would there be a reason for such haste to \nput something such as this on a Defense appropriations bill?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. The Senator brings up many good points. One, you \ndon't have the benefit of the language that they are going to try and \nput into a conference committee report. I do have a copy. And I have to \nsay, Senator Durbin was very straightforward in sharing it with me. But \nfor all the other Members of this body, it is phantom language, so-\ncalled placeholder language that would be used later to create an \nopening in parliamentary rules to slip in the real deal, the real \nbackroom deal between George Ryan and Mayor Daley.\n  The point you made is, that deal has not been shared with you. You \nhave gotten no specifics from Mayor Daley or Governor Ryan.\n\n  Interestingly, it is not the Governor who actually has the authority \nby himself to just decree that a runway plan be done in Illinois under \nState law. There is, in fact, a permitting process. There are hearings, \nand these plans are subjected to an adversary proceeding. There is \nopportunity for controllers and pilots and other interested parties to \ncome and testify. There is a whole permitting process.\n  We are being asked, in codifying the backroom deal made by two \npeople, just 48 hours ago, to preempt the Illinois Aeronautics Act. We \nare being asked to do what the Illinois State Senate should be doing. \nThey can take a look at the Illinois Aeronautics Act. I had 6 years in \nthe State Senate. I didn't think when I got to Washington I would be \nput in the position of debating the sorts of issues they debate in the \nIllinois State Senate.\n  The NPIAS list is the national plan for integrated airport \nimprovements around the country. Many airports, most of your small \nlocal airports, are on the NPIAS list, and that makes them eligible for \ngrants from the airport improvement fund, the AIP fund. It was a very \nmomentous step when the FAA put the south suburban airport on the NPIAS \nlist about 10 years ago. That plan was moving forward. The State of \nIllinois Department of Transportation, with the strong backing of local \nofficials and the State, was going forward with the south suburban \nairport.\n  The State legislature had rejected plans for an airport in a \ndifferent location that Mayor Daley had favored. So Peotone was on the \nNPIAS list. It was eligible for Federal funding, and after it had gone \nthrough the planning process, I believe that it would have gotten \nFederal funding.\n  But when President Clinton took office, that created an opportunity. \nThe mayor of Chicago obviously was good friends with the President, and \nthey were able to prevail upon the FAA at that time to simply remove \nPeotone from the NPIAS list and take it off. I think it was probably \nthe only airport, of the 3,000 airports around the country, that has \never been taken off. At that time the FAA said: Well, there wasn't \nlocal consensus. So they did not know whether they wanted to go \nforward. There was local consensus among some, but Mayor Daley, the \nmayor of the city of Chicago, opposed it.\n  I have to tell you, there is no local consensus on this plan, this \nbackroom deal, this $13 billion deal that will take money from your \nStates and put it into a plan in my State that I oppose. I oppose it. \nThe State legislature has never supported this deal.\n  The reason they are coming to you is because they can't get the \napproval of the State legislature. They didn't even try. You are being \nasked at 9 o'clock at night, while our country is at war in \nAfghanistan, on a Defense appropriations bill, to debate this \ntransportation issue. Clearly, I do not think this is the appropriate \nforum.\n  I don't think it should be before the Federal Government at all. I \nthink if the mayor wants that plan at O'Hare, he ought to submit a plan \nto the FAA. He has never even done that.\n  I applaud many of the things the mayor of the city of Chicago has \ndone. It is a wonderful city. O'Hare is a wonderful airport. It is a \ngreat airport.\n  I want to make it clear, it will have to be modernized sometime. \nThere is a problem that bigger jets can't taxi around at O'Hare. The \nBoeing 747-400, for example, is so wide that other planes have to get \noff taxiways when it is taxying around. I think we need to modernize \nO'Hare. I will be supportive of that. I think a $13 billion project to \ntear up and rebuild O'Hare is wasteful, however, of the funds that \nwould be applied.\n\n  The bottom line is, there may be good arguments, and there are good \narguments on both sides of this issue. But they should be presented to \nthe FAA and the State's panel on aviation. The interesting thing is--\nthe Senator from Arizona would be interested in this--we are preempting \nhere the Illinois Aeronautics Act which, in fact, is the act that \ngrants the city of Chicago the right to run an airport. The city of \nChicago doesn't have a right, except one deriving from the State \ngovernment, the Illinois Aeronautics Act, to even operate an airport. \nWe would be asked to obliterate----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Senator, I wish to go on. I will yield at the end of \nthe evening.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Illinois has the floor. I ask for the \nregular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, from the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator if it is not true that there is \nno legislative approval. The legislature has not been consulted. You \nwere not consulted on this, as I understand it. I am asking if that is \ntrue. The congressional delegation was not consulted and the local \npeople have not been consulted. Is it true that only in the last 48 \nhours this agreement was made, and in only 48 hours we are expected, \nwithout a hearing, without any consultation or advice or information \nprovided to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and\n\n[[Page S12646]]\n\nTransportation, we are taking on this appropriations bill an issue that \nentails billions of dollars of Illinois taxpayers' money and billions \nof dollars of national taxpayers' money? Is it true we are going to try \nto push this through in order that it can be done on a Defense \nappropriations bill, I ask my colleague?\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. The Senator from Arizona is exactly right. We have \nnever been shown any details of this plan. No Member of this body has \nbeen shown details of this plan. Senator Durbin may have some details \nof which I am not aware. I have not been shown any details. It is a \nbackroom agreement that was reached at about 9 or 10 o'clock in the \nevening two nights ago, Wednesday night.\n  Maybe the rush to pass this is because they do not want anybody to \nknow the deals and know the details. Perhaps there is a problem with \nthe details. I think we ought to be very reluctant to codify into \nFederal law a plan obligating the Federal Government to unspecified \nexpenditures of money in the future without knowing the details when \nthere are questions of safety and when we do not have the expertise in \nthis body to do this. None of us has a background in airport \nengineering.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Illinois to yield to \nthe Senator from Nevada for a question without his losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from Illinois, we have been talking now for \nquite a few hours--I should say you have been talking. I am wondering \nif my friend can advise me and the rest of the Senate if he is going to \ntake some more time tonight.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to ask another question through \nthe Chair? I walked by his desk a few times and saw he has a lot of \nspeaking material. It appears the Senator is going to be speaking for \nan extended period of time; is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, I have many more charts.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, it is 10 after 9, and as \nthe Senator knows, we are trying to complete this most important \nDefense bill. The fact is, the Senator from Illinois has several more \nhours of speaking; is that right, if that is necessary?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. If necessary.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I was just trying to \ngauge whether or not the Senator was getting tired yet.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I am doing OK. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield without \nlosing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield to this \nSenator to call up the package that Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, \nand I have been working on, and present it to the Senate and perhaps \nhave a vote up or down, with the understanding that upon the conclusion \nof that action, the Senator from Illinois would regain the floor?\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Senator. I have the greatest respect for \nthe Senator from West Virginia. I respect him as much as any of my \ncolleagues, but I must respectfully decline that request. I have to \nsay, as the Senator from West Virginia will recall, when I first came \nto the Senate, I read his book on the history of the Roman Republic. On \nmy first opportunity to be back in the Illinois State senate and appear \nbefore them, I gave as a gift to every State Senator in Illinois a copy \nof your book.\n  Mr. BYRD. You did?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I gave them the Senator's admonition that the Senate \nshould never yield too much power to the executive, and that was the \ndecline of the ancient Roman Republic.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will keep that rule in mind. Let's not \ngive too much power to the executive. If we could present our \namendment, let Senators vote on the amendment----\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I am afraid----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield for a question only.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Illinois, without losing his right to \nthe floor, yield to his colleague from Illinois for 10 minutes?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. No, I am not in a position to do that. I will yield \ntemporarily to the Senator from Illinois with the understanding that \nwhen he completes his 10 minutes, automatically the floor reverts to \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Illinois is yielding time to his \ncolleague from Illinois without losing his right to the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2343, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues \nfrom Illinois and Nevada for this opportunity.\n  When we were preparing for this debate, it was very important to me \nwe keep it in the context of the bill that was being amended. I cannot \nthink of more important legislation facing our Nation than the passage \nof the Defense appropriations bill at a time when America is at war.\n  Before I prepared the amendment which is before the Senate, I \nreceived assurances that we would not face a filibuster. I received \nassurances that we would not face what we have seen this evening. I was \ntold there would be an up-or-down vote, and I was prepared to accept \nthe outcome of that vote. Something has changed. As a result of that \nchange, the Senate has been here for 3 hours. The most important \nappropriations bill we can consider has been stalled and slowed down.\n  I feel very strongly about this issue, but I also feel very strongly \nabout our responsibility in the Senate. I am prepared to save this \nbattle for another day because I do not want to diminish the ability of \nthis Nation in its war against terrorism or diminish in any way the \nresources available to the men and women in uniform. I do not know when \nthat day will come. I hope it will be soon for the sake of my State \nthat we will consider this important legislation for our airport, for \nour aviation needs in our State.\n  I express my apologies to the Senate. I never believed for a moment \nthat we would face a filibuster over this. In fact, I received \nassurances otherwise. That is not the case. I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn. The Senator from Illinois still has the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nwithdrawing the amendment. I say to him that I do not think I made \nclear exactly how I would respond. I did say that I was willing to take \nan up-or-down vote, and perhaps we may yet have an up-or-down vote on \nthis issue before the Senate. I do not believe I made those \nrepresentations.\n  I do appreciate my friendship with Senator Durbin. I hope there are \nnot many more issues that we disagree with amongst ourselves with \nrespect to our State.\n  In many cases, we have been able to have a great impact for the \npeople of Illinois, and we will continue to do that. We have a \ndifference of opinion on this issue. It has been tough for both of us \nbecause normally we work together and do not have differences of \nopinions on major issues such as this. So I appreciate Senator Durbin's \nwithdrawal of the amendment, and I look forward to continuing to work \nwith him on this and other issues in the Senate.\n  I do think it was important for the Nation and the Senate to be \neducated on this issue because aviation in the heartland does affect \nall of us, and Senator Durbin is certainly right on that. I believe \nthis was a very important discussion, both for the citizens of Illinois \nand also for the citizens around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and I have \nworked during the afternoon with our staffs to bring to the Senate an \namendment which would provide for the carrying out of the purposes that \nI announced earlier when I presented the\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\namendment which was brought down by the failure of the Senate to waive \na point of order.\n  We have drawn up an amendment which stays within the $40 billion \nwhich was voted by Congress 3 days after the attack.\n  A point of order was made against the amendment I had offered. I \nsought to waive the point of order, and it was the Senate's judgment \nthe motion to waive not be adopted. Consequently, what is left before \nthe Senate now is the House bill. So in an effort to move ahead with \nsomething for homeland security and in the attempt to at least try to \ndo something on all three of our original purposes--namely, fund \nadequately defense appropriations, live up to our agreement to New York \nas much as we can under the circumstances, and to provide a homeland \ndefense bill, which while not going as far as we had earlier hoped, at \nleast does something for the cities and rural areas of this country--\nSenator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and I are proposing the following \namendment. It is the Byrd/Stevens/Inouye amendment to Defense \nappropriations.\n  We are living within the $40 billion structure we have already voted \non several weeks ago. The amendment allocates $20 billion. It was \naccording to the law we passed that the Appropriations Committee would \npass upon the final $20 billion of that $40 billion, and this is the \nfinal bill. We are attempting to follow the law in that respect and \nprovide in this bill how that money should be allocated.\n  The amendment allocates $20 billion as follows: Defense, $2 billion; \nNew York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, \nall coming under the rubric of New York as a designation, $9.5 billion; \nhomeland defense, $8.5 billion.\n\n  When combined with the $20 billion allocated by the President, the \namendment results in the following allocation of the $40 billion \napproved: Homeland defense, $10.1 billion; foreign aid allocated by the \nPresident, $1.5 billion.\n  Highlights of the $20 billion are these: New York and other \ncommunities directly impacted by the September 11 attacks, $9.5 \nbillion, and the examples follow. FEMA disaster relief, which funds \ndebris removal at the World Trade Center site, repair of public \ninfrastructure such as the damaged subway, the damaged PATH commuter \ntrain, all government offices, and provides assistance to individuals \nfor housing, burial expenses, and relocation assistance, receives $5.82 \nbillion.\n  Secondly, community development block grants, $2 billion to help New \nYork restore its economy; Amtrak security, $100 million for security in \nAmtrak tunnels; mass transit security, funding of $100 million for \nimproving security in the New York and New Jersey subways; New York-New \nJersey ferry improvements, $100 million; hospital reimbursement, $140 \nmillion to reimburse the hospitals in New York that provided critical \ncare on September 11, and the weeks and months that followed.\n  Workers compensation job training, $175 million that would help New \nYork to process workers compensation claims for the victims of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Fifty-eight million dollars is provided for job \ntraining, environmental health, and other programs; Federal facilities, \n$200 million for the costs of keeping Federal agencies operating that \nwere in the World Trade Center, such as the Social Security \nAdministration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the \nPension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the Commodity Futures and \nTrading Commission, the Secret Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the EEOC, the \nGeneral Services Administration, and the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  Emergency highway repairs, $85 million for damaged roads in New York \nCity; mental health services for children, $10 million that would help \nNew York schools to provide mental health services to the children of \nthe victims of the World Trade Center bombing; law enforcement \nreimbursement, $220 million for New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia to \nreimburse for the costs of law enforcement and fire personnel for costs \nincurred on September 11 and the weeks that followed; $68 million to \nprovide for the crime victims fund; District of Columbia, $200 million \nfor the District and for Washington Metro for improved security; small \nbusiness disaster loans, $150 million; national monument security, $86 \nmillion for improved security at national parks and monuments such as \nthe Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, the Smithsonian, \nKennedy Center, and other facilities. For the Department of Defense, $2 \nbillion including funding to repair the Pentagon; bioterrorism/food \nsafety, $3.1 billion, including $525 million for food security; \nprovides $1.1 billion for upgrading our State and local public health \nand hospital infrastructure.\n  Recent events have made it clear our State and local public health \ndepartments have been allowed to deteriorate.\n  The head of the CDC testified only last week that at least $1 billion \nis needed immediately to begin to upgrade our State and local health \ndepartments. Our package would provide $165 million for the CDC \ncapacity improvements. It would provide $205 million for security \nimprovements and research at the CDC and the NIH. It would provide $593 \nmillion for the national pharmaceutical stockpile. It would provide \n$512 million to contracts for smallpox vaccine to protect all \nAmericans. The USDA Office of the Secretary would receive $81 million \nfor enhanced facility security and operational security at USDA \nlocations. The Agriculture Research Service would receive $70 million \nfor enhanced facility security and for research in the areas of food \nsafety and bioterrorism. The Agriculture Research Service buildings and \nfacilities would receive $73 million for facility enhancement at Plum \nIsland, NY, and Ames, IA, which includes funding necessary to complete \nconstruction on a biocontainment facility at the National Animal \nDisease Laboratory at Ames, IA.\n\n  The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service would \nreceive $50 million for enhanced facility security at land grant \nuniversity research locations and for research into areas of food \nsafety and bioterrorism. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nbuildings and facilities would receive $109 million for enhanced \nfacility security, for support of border inspections, for pest \ndetection activities, and for other areas related to biosecurity and \nfor relocation of the facility at the National Animal Disease \nLaboratory.\n  Next is $15 million provided to the Food Safety Inspection Service \nfor enhanced operational security and for implementation of the food \nsafety bioterrorism protection program; $127 million would be provided \nto the Food and Drug Administration for food safety and \ncounterbioterrorism, including support of additional food security \ninspections, expedited review of drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests, \nand for enhanced physical and operational security.\n  As to State and local law enforcement, the amendment would provide \n$400 million. The amendment would also provide $290 million for FEMA \nfirefighters to improve State and local government capacity to respond \nto terrorist attacks.\n  The amendment would provide $600 million to the Postal Service to \nprovide equipment to cope with biological and chemical threats such as \nanthrax.\n  For Federal Antiterrorism Law Enforcement, the amendment would \nprovide $1.7 billion to be used as follows: $614 million for the FBI; \n$61 million for U.S. Marshals; $100 million for cyber-security; $23 \nmillion for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for training \nnew law enforcement personnel; $21 million for the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms; $124 million for overtime and expanded aviation \nand border support for the Customs Service; $73 million for the Secret \nService; $273 million for increased Coast Guard surveillance; $95 \nmillion for Federal courts security; $84 million for Justice Department \nlegal activity; $68 million for the crime victims fund; $83 million for \nEPA for anthrax cleanup costs and drinking water vulnerability \nassessments; $38 million for EPA for bioterrorism response teams and \nEPA laboratory security; $20 million for the FEMA Office of National \nPreparedness.\n  Now, for the airport transit security, there would be $530 million, \nincluding $200 million for airport improvement grants; $251 million for \nFAA operations\n\n[[Page S12648]]\n\nfor cockpit security; $50 million for FAA research to expedite \ndeployment of new aviation security technology; $23 million for transit \nsecurity; $6 million for transportation security.\n  Now, as to port security improvements, there will be $50 million \nwhich would be broken down as follows: Coast Guard, $12 million; \nMaritime Administration, $23 million; and Customs, $15 million.\n  Finally, for nuclear powerplant, lab, Federal facility improvements, \nthere would be $775 million. There would be $140 million for energy for \nenhanced security at U.S. nuclear weapons plants and laboratories. \nThere would be $139 million for the Corps of Engineers to provide \nenhanced security at 300 critical dams, drinking water reservoirs and \nnavigation facilities; $30 million for the Bureau of Reclamation for \nsimilar purposes; $36 million for Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nenhance security at commercial nuclear reactors; $50 million for \nsecurity at the White House; $31 million for GSA and the Archives to \nimprove Federal building security; $93 million for NASA for security \nupgrades at the Kennedy, Johnson, and other space centers; $256 million \nfor improved security for the legislative branch.\n\n  For nuclear nonproliferation, there would be $226 million for the \nsafeguarding and acquisition of Russian and former Soviet Union fissile \nnuclear materials and to help transition and retrain Russian nuclear \nscientists.\n  Finally, for border security, there would be $709 million of which \n$160 million would be for Customs for increased inspectors on the \nborder and for the construction of border facilities and there would be \n$549 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  These are the breakdowns of the moneys that would be included in this \namendment if agreed to by the Senate. At some point I will ask \nunanimous consent that the substitute be agreed to and considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment, and that no points \nof order be waived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has not made that unanimous consent request \nyet, but I do believe I will support that unanimous consent request. I \nwant the Senate to know that the Senator and Senator Inouye and I have \nconferred about the allocation of $20 billion, and while I regret we \nreduced defense in this allocation to $20 billion, I point out to the \nSenate that this year we have provided $317 billion in the Defense bill \nin section (a) of this substitute. We have added the $15.3 billion here \nin this allocation of the moneys from the $15.7 from the $40 billion. \nThere has been a total of over a $42 billion increase in defense \nspending from the beginning of this year to now. I do believe there is \nsufficient money to carry us through until the President may make a \nrequest.\n  Again, I point out to the Senate that the law we passed on September \n18 does require the President shall submit to the Congress as soon as \npractical detailed requests to meet any further funding requirements \nfor the purposes specified in this act.\n  I also call the Senate's attention once more, there were five \npurposes outlined in the act: First, providing State, Federal-State, \nand local preparedness for mitigating and responding to the attacks; \nsecond, providing support to counterinvestigate and prosecute \ninternational terrorism; third, providing increased transportation \nsecurity; fourth, repairing public facilities and transportation \nsystems damaged by attacks; and five, supporting national security.\n  All these funds may be delivered for any authorized Government \nactivity to meet those purposes.\n  This presentation tonight by Senator Byrd meets those requirements. \nAll of the money is transferred to a Federal system under an authorized \nprogram, and all are within the five stated purposes that the Congress \nused in providing the $40 billion in September.\n  We all differ some in terms of our priorities. In the final analysis, \nthe priorities for this $20 billion will be decided in conference. I \nhave assured Senator Byrd that I will cosponsor this substitute and \nfight for its approval in the conference. I fully expect there will be \nsome changes in the conference with the House in terms of the \nallocation of this money. I am confident we will be hearing from the \nadministration in the meantime.\n  I take the floor to urge the Senate to approve the amendment and to \nallow the Senator's request to be granted. He has, in fact, now offered \nand asked for a unanimous consent, but we jointly are offering this as \noriginal text to replace the Senate substitute that was reported from \nthe appropriations committee. It will be open to further amendment, as \nI understand, on all parts of the bill.\n  It is my hope that we would close their section B soon, because I \nthink this allocation, as I said, will primarily absolutely be done in \nthe final analysis insofar as the $20 billion in conference. And we \ncould argue here all night about where the money would go.\n  We met the President's request to limit that amount to $20 billion. I \nthink that is where we should stop.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Does the Senator from West Virginia wish to renew his request?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2348\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield to me for that \npurpose, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute be agreed to, that \nit be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, \nand that no points of order be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Inouye, and Mr. Stevens proposes an amendment numbered 2348.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from West Virginia? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2348) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that section 8132 \nof the pending amendment constitutes legislation on appropriations and \nviolates rule XVI of the standing rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if we might be able to temporarily \nlay aside this point of order so the Senate could proceed with an \namendment by Mr. Feingold, have the debate on that, and then return to \nthe point of order by Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we get a time agreement on that amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Could we get a time agreement?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I reserve the right to object. I do believe we have an \nagreement on a proposal by Senator Gramm. I would like to dispense with \nthat if the Senator from Alaska is ready and the Senator from West \nVirginia is ready to do that.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Arizona will yield, or whoever has the \nfloor will yield briefly, we are waiting for another Senator to come to \nthe Chamber.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I remove my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. And I certainly thank the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2349\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Wisconsin answer a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator yields for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Alaska asked if the Senator from Wisconsin \nwould agree to a time limit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree to a 10-minute limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would just say, of course, that all points of order and \nstuff would still be available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Baucus, and Mr. Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 2349.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 2002)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     sections:\n\n     SEC.  . COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjustment \n     shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) (relating to cost of \n     living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal \n     year 2002.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It \nwould eliminate the $4,900 pay raise scheduled to go into effect in \njust a few weeks for Members of Congress. And I am very pleased to be \njoined in this effort by the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, \nand the senior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms. Our economy is \nin a recession and hundreds of thousands of workers have been laid off. \nMany families face enormous financial pressures.\n  Shortly, we will debate how best to address this problem, and central \nfor me in that debate is how to produce a short-term economic boost \nwithout undermining our long-term economic and budget position. The \nbudget surpluses that were projected last spring have proved to be as \nillusory as many of us feared. The supplemental spending passed in the \nspring, along with the irresponsible tax cut passed this summer left us \non the brink. The economic slowdown pushed us over the edge. So, when \nit came time to respond to the horrific events of September 11, we were \nforced to return to deficit spending.\n  We have spent all of the on-budget surplus, and are well into the \nsurplus that represents Social Security Trust Fund balances. That is \nsomething that has only been done to meet the most critical national \nprorities. A $4,900 pay raise for Members is not a critical national \npriority.\n  As I said when I last brought this amendment to the floor, I think \nthe idea of an automatic congressional pay raise is never appropriate. \nIt is an unusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Few \npeople have that ability. Most of our constitutents do not have that \npower. And that this power is so unusual is good reason for the \nCongress to exercise that power openly, and to exercise it subject to \nregular procedures that include debate, amendment, and a vote on the \nRecord.\n  As I noted during the debate of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nmeasure, a number of my colleagues have approached me about this pay \nraise in the past few weeks, and some have indicated they support the \npay raise. In fact, one of my colleagues said they would offer an \namendment that actually increased the scheduled $4,900 pay raise \nbecause they felt it was too low. I strongly disagree with that \nposition, but I certainly respect those who hold that position. But \nwhatever one's position on the pay raise, I do think, the Senate ought \nto be on record on the matter if it is to go into effect.\n  The current pay raise system allows a pay raise without any recorded \nvote. Even those who support a pay raise should be willing to insist \nthat Members go on record on this issue. I think this process of \nstealth pay raises has to end, and I have introduced legislation to \nstop this practice. But the amendment I offer today does not go that \nfar. All it does is simply stop the $4,900 pay raise that is scheduled \nto go into effect in January.\n  When I offered this amendment to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill several weeks ago, a point of order was raised \nagainst it as not being germane to that bill. Let me say here that \nunlike that bill, the measure before us today has already raised the \nissue of a pay increase in the legislative branch in Section 810 of the \nHouse-passed bill. So this amendment is plainly germane to the bill \nbefore us.\n  It is possible--in fact, obviously likely--that a Senator may raise a \npoint of order against this amendment, and maybe some people will try \nto hide behind the procedural vote that would result. But make no \nmistake, the vote in relation to this amendment will be the vote on the \ncongressional pay raise.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Iowa's State employees voted to delay their own \ncost-of-living adjustment in order to help that State cope with its \nbudget problems. Members of the Florida house voted to eliminate the \ncost-of-living pay increase they got on July 1 to help meet that \nState's budget get through a softening economy, and South Carolina's \nGovernor Jim Hodges is taking a $4,000 pay cut as part of his efforts \nto keep this State's budget in balance.\n  I hope my colleagues will follow the examples set by Iowa's State \nemployees, the Florida house, and Governor Hodges. Given all that has \nhappened, all that will happen, and the sacrifices that will be asked \nof all Americans, this isn't time for Congress to accept a $4,900 pay \nraise. Let's stop this backdoor pay raise, and then let's enact \nlegislation to end this practice once and for all.\n  Right this minute, our Nation is sending the men and women of our \nArmed Services into harm's way. I do not think it is the time for \nCongress to accept a pay raise. Let's stop this backdoor pay raise, and \nthen let's enact legislation to end this practice once and for all.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as the former chairman and now ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury and General \nGovernment, I would like to make a few observations on this amendment \nand tell my colleagues at the outset that my comments are not designed \nto bring into question the motives of any Senator who votes for the \namendment. But there is an old adage: If the shoe fits, wear it.\n  We have had to wrestle with some pretty important issues since \nSeptember 11. During that time, I think Members of this body have \ndisplayed a great deal of courage. And their constituents certainly \nhave the right to expect that kind of courage. But that is the way it \nshould be.\n  Neither bombs nor fires, terrorists nor wars have been able to shake \nour resolve, but the mention of a pay raise somehow makes a lot of \nSenators' courage melt like snowballs in summer, and that iron will \nbegins to make them shake in their boots.\n  Some Senators may honestly believe we should not receive a pay raise \nat any cost. Some, in fact, think we should be working here for \nnothing. Some maybe just don't think they are worth the salary. But I \ntell you, there is an old saying that has developed over the years, and \nI would like to invite our constituents and the press to explore the \nactions of a Member who falls into the definition of what has been \ncalled: ``Vote no, but take the dough.'' That phrase is a pretty good \ndescription of politicians who want the money but do not want the heat \nof voter displeasure, even though setting our own salaries is a \nconstitutional requirement.\n  I have voted a number of times on pay raises--sometimes for, \nsometimes against. Every time I voted against them, and they passed, I \ndonated those\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\npay raises to charity. I could not, in good conscience, keep the money \nif I would not support it with my vote. I gave a total of five $1,000 \nscholarships and gave other money to a homeless shelter. At no time \nwhen I voted against it did I keep it. I know there are a number of \nother Members who have done the same thing. But those times I thought \nthe increase was warranted, I voted for it, and I kept it and I \njustified it, as many other Members have also done. I think I can \njustify it this time, too.\n  With the tragedies at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center still \nfresh in our minds, I would recommend to those who oppose a cost-of-\nliving increase and, therefore do not want the COLA, to donate it to a \ncharity involved in the aftermath of September 11, if they really truly \nbelieve they don't deserve it.\n  If they are that guilt ridden, they can, in fact, simply return it \nback to the Federal Treasury. There is no law that prevents them from \ndoing that.\n  Every Member has to live with his own conscience and decisions, but \nthere certainly are Members who fall into that category ``vote no and \ntake the dough.'' In the past, in fact, some have come to the floor to \nemphatically denounce the increase while letting other Members shoulder \nthe burden to pass the bill and they quietly pocket the money and sneak \noff in the night hoping nobody will notice that their outrage does not \njibe with their actions.\n  We have been here 16 hours--at least I have, since 6 o'clock this \nmorning--with no end in sight, with important amendments with which we \nhave yet to deal. This bill simply is the wrong vehicle for this \namendment. It should have been offered on the Treasury-Postal-general \ngovernment bill. It was not.\n  To make matters worse, many of the very people who speak out against \nthis COLA have asked money to be earmarked in that bill where this \nshould have been addressed. It is automatic, as all of our Members \nknow. I would also remind the Members that the Treasury-Postal-general \ngovernment bill has all the courthouse construction money, the Federal \ncourts money, the money to fight the war on drugs, security money for \nthe Olympics, other things in it that make it a very important bill.\n  To try to amend this bill, the Department of Defense supplemental, \nwith a decision for Members after it has already been approved in the \nTreasury-general government bill, is not a good policy and opens a \nPandora's box of other amendments that have already been settled in the \nother eight bills that have passed both the House and Senate, and \nconference committees, too. If the opponents of the COLA don't like it, \nthey should have offered an amendment to delete it when our bill, the \nTreasury-general government bill, was on the floor. They had ample \nopportunity when Chairman Dorgan and I were pleading with Members to \ncome to the floor and offer amendments.\n  This amendment may be great theater, but one thing is clear, it is \nnot an automatic ticket to reelection. Self-flagellation never is.\n  As I have already stated, I don't question the motives of any Member \non how they vote. But I would invite our constituents to look into the \nMember's past votes on this issue and see what they did with the money \nthe last time, if they voted against it. I believe their constituents \nwould like to know if they were driven by a deeply held belief about \nself-worth or if they were in the category of ``vote no and take the \ndough.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the amendment \nis not germane.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I raise the defense of germaneness, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to amend my point of order. I failed to \nmention it was also legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that the point of order \nis that it is legislation on an appropriations bill.

SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the military aircraft \n     industrial base of the United States be preserved. In order \n     to ensure this we must retain--\n       (1) Adequate competition in the design, engineering, \n     production, sale and support of military aircraft;\n       (2) Continued innovation in the development and manufacture \n     of military aircraft;\n       (3) Actual and future capability of more than one aircraft \n     company to design, engineer, produce and support military \n     aircraft.\n\n     SEC. 2. STUDY OF IMPACT ON THE INDUSTRIAL BASE.\n\n       In order to determine the current and future adequacy of \n     the military aircraft industrial base a study shall be \n     conducted. Of the funds made available under the heading \n     ``Procurement, Defense-Wide'' in this Act, up to $1,500,000 \n     may be made available for a comprehensive analysis of and \n     report on the risks to innovation and cost of limited or no \n     competition in contracting for military aircraft and related \n     weapon systems for the Department of Defense, including the \n     cost of contracting where there is no more than one primary \n     manufacturer with the capacity to bid for and build military \n     aircraft and related weapon systems, the impact of any \n     limited competition in primary contracting on innovation in \n     the design, development, and construction of military \n     aircraft and related weapon systems, the impact of limited \n     competition in primary contracting on the current and future \n     capacity of manufacturers to design, engineer and build \n     military aircraft and weapon systems. The Secretary of \n     Defense shall report to the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations on the design of this analysis, and shall \n     submit a report to these committees no later than 6 months \n     from the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I again express my sincere thanks to Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens for the very effective way they brought \ntogether a very important bill in these difficult times.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the future of our national \nsecurity as it pertains to U.S. air superiority--the key to ensuring \nvictory in modern war, and to propose an amendment requesting a study \nof our current and future tactical and military aircraft industrial \nbase.\n  The recent Joint Strike Fighter competition was a tough fight between \ntwo well matched and seasoned competitors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. \nThe next generation of Air Force, Navy and Marine fighter pilots will \nbenefit from this fierce competition. But the Defense Department's long \nterm acquisition strategy has revealed a potential and troubling \nweakness in the future health of our tactical and military aircraft \nindustrial base.\n  I have long maintained that no matter which company won this \ncontract, the only way to guarantee our national security over the long \nhaul is to maintain the robust aircraft industrial base that preserves \ninnovation and competition which are critical to the development and \nsuccess of future tactical and military aircraft programs.\n  When the Joint Strike Fighter competition was announced, I stated my \nstrongly held view and supposition that the award would be split so \nthat the loser of the competition would remain in business.\n  Maintaining a robust industrial base is not about Boeing or Lockheed \nMartin or any one commercial enterprise but what is best for our \nNation. I have said for years that, since the cold war's end, we have \nfunded and structured our military on a minimum to get by. And that is \nwrong. Investing the future of American air superiority, or any other \ncritical defense program, in one company is a risky proposition. The \nweakened industrial base that results adversely impacts the kind of \nsurge production capability this Nation may need someday to offset \nunforeseen attrition in our aircraft force structure.\n  The Department of Defense has stated that with regards to the Joint \nStrike Fighter it will maintain a ``winner-take-all'' strategy. By \ntheir our account the winner will be the only U.S. producer of tactical \nfighter aircraft after F-22 and F/A-18 E/F production ceases.\n  As recently as April of last year, the Honorable Jacques S. Gansler \nin a statement provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee on \ndefense industrial base considerations said:\n\n       Today, there exist two or three major (robust and \n     technologically superior) firms in each critical area of \n     defense needs. However, with the potential to go even below \n     that number in the future, we are in danger of losing our \n     greatest weapon in containing costs and insuring rapid \n     innovation; namely, competition.\n\n  DoD's determination to maintain the ``winner-take-all'' strategy, \neven in light of their assessment that we will be left with one \ntactical fighter aircraft producer, deserves a thorough and exhaustive \nreview. A number of broad questions present themselves that must be \nanswered.\n  Will the U.S. Government be able to ensure sufficient expertise \nexists in the long term so we can preserve a competitive and innovative \nindustrial base in the design, production, and support of tactical and \nmilitary aircraft?\n  Will the Joint Strike Fighter be the last manned tactical fixed-wing \nfighter as asserted by Undersecretary of Defense E.C. Aldridge in a \nletter to Senator Levin? And does the ability to bid on unmanned combat \nor surveillance aircraft, as asserted by Under Secretary Aldridge, \nprovide ample opportunity for a tactical aircraft manufacturer to \nretain a robust design, production and support team?\n  Can an aerospace manufacturer reconstitute a tactical and/or military \ncapability once it is lost, and when the barrier to re-entry become too \nhigh?\n  Does this Nation's national security interests outweigh the economic \nbenefits to any one company? And will our national security be affected \nif we cannot continue to ensure a high level of innovation and \ncompetitiveness in the development and production of tactical and \nmilitary aircraft?\n  This includes the presence, or lack of, a robust surge capacity in \nthe event our nation faces high attrition rates with its tactical \naircraft force structure.\n  The Department of Defense commissioned a RAND study to examine both \nnear-term and long-term competition options within the Joint Strike \nFighter program. The study concluded that the additional costs of split \nproduction, estimated to range from $.5 to $1 billion, would not be \nrecouped over the life of the program, currently expected to extend \nthrough the year 2040. But does the nation's national security take \npriority when added costs are less than $1 billion over the life of a \n40 plus year program (a cost of less than $25 million per year to \npreserve more than one source for our fighter aircraft)?\n  A Wall St. Journal article published on Oct. 18, 2001, discusses the \nstinging defeat handed to General Dynamics in their takeover bid of \nNewport News Shipbuilding, Inc., when the Justice Department filed an \nanti-trust suit in federal district court seeking to block the proposed \nacquisition on the grounds it would eliminate competition in the market \nfor nuclear submarines. The article states:\n\n       The critical issue in the review process was whether a \n     combination of General Dynamics with Newport News would \n     eliminate competition in the market for naval submarines and \n     whether the loss of that competition would hurt innovation.\n\n  Comments made by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology and Logistics, the Honorable ``Pete'' Aldridge, in a letter \nto my distinguished colleague Senator Carl Levin, and at a Press \nConference announcing the JSF winner, make it clear that not only is \nDoD going to pursue the winner-take-all strategy\n\n[[Page S12652]]\n\nbut that they are taking a ``hands off'' approach to any potential \nteaming effort between Lockheed Martin--with its coalition of \nmanufacturers--and Boeing. This puts the responsibility and weight of \nthe health of our future industrial base in the hands of a commercial \nenterprise, and not the administration or the Congress. This is not a \nwise policy and it justifiably applies to all aspects of our critical \nneeds military industrial base.\n  Finally, on Oct. 23, 2001, the Department of Justice announced they \nwere filing suit to block General Dynamics' purchase of Newport News \nShipbuilding. In the body of their press release the Department of \nJustice states: Our armed forces need the most innovative and highest \nquality products to protect our country. This merger-to-monopoly would \nreduce innovation and, ultimately, the quality of the products supplied \nto the military, while raising prices to the U.S. military and to U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  The Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill in discussing the \nJoint Strike Fighter program on page 117 of the report contains the \nfollowing language: The Committee believes that industrial base \nconcerns can best be addressed AFTER the source selection decision. \nWhile the future industrial base may be a concern, DoD can be partner \nin discussion to address these concerns as companies work on viable \nteaming or work sharing agreements.\n  As I have noted, it is clear that DoD will not be a partner in any \nteaming arrangements so it is up to the Congress to act. In order to do \nso we must acquire a body of data on our tactical aircraft industrial \nbase. And determine if this base will provide sufficient ``innovation \nAND competition'' in the years after only one company remains to build \nfollow-on aircraft to those currently in production or in development.\n  My amendment specifically asks that the Secretary of Defense conduct \nthe study. I will furthermore recommend that Secretary Rumsfeld select \nRAND Corporation to perform the study. Why RAND? They are already \nfamiliar with the Joint Strike Fighter program, having conducted the \nDoD study that examined the near and long term competition options. The \nDepartment of Defense should have no difficulty working with RAND, and \nin providing them the data they need to do a thorough study of the \nimpact to the industrial base of DoD's acquisition strategy.\n\n  In summary, my amendment calls for a study of the costs, risks, and \nimplications to national security of vesting all our tactical aircraft \nexpertise in one prime contractor. The simple fact is that we, as a \nnation, do not know the risks, costs and implications of this move. We \ndo know intuitively that the loss of competition and innovation can \nhave a disastrous impact on the nation's ability to field future state \nof the art weapons programs.\n  The Defense Department has never studied this issue even though they \nacknowledge that the continuing shrinkage of our industrial base is \ncause for concern. It has never examined the risks or the national \nsecurity implications. The DoD study regarding the JSF program looked \nexclusively at the financial costs of keeping two production lines to \nbuild Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.\n  That study concluded that there is an additional financial cost \nassociated with two JSF production lines. But what the study failed to \nexamine was the national security risks associated with vesting the \nfuture of American air superiority into the hands of a single company.\n  We must not allow our industrial base to shrink down to one company \nin any critical needs area without close examination and an \nunderstanding of the risks and implications. The stakes are too large.\n  We do not--we cannot--know what the future holds for this country 20, \n30 or 40 years hence. We learned on September 11 that there are heavy \npenalties for misjudging unforeseen risks. We cannot afford a similar \nmistake when it comes to the health of our industrial base and the men \nand women responsible for flying into harms way. We cannot go down the \nroad to one company blindly.\n  As my amendment clearly states: We must retain adequate competition \nin the design, engineering, production, sale and support of military \naircraft; We must retain continued innovation in the development and \nmanufacture of military aircraft; and We must retain the actual and \nfuture capability of more than ``one'' aircraft company to design, \nengineer, produce and support military aircraft.\n  This study will help to arm us with the knowledge Congress and the \nPresident need to make a wise decision. We need the results of this \nstudy. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment \nproposed by my friend and colleague from Missouri. Senator Bond's \nlegislation requires the Defense Department to report to Congress on \nthe future of the tactical aircraft industry.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It will allow the Pentagon \nto examine the long term impact of the largest contract award in world \nhistory on October 26 of this year, the Defense Department awarded the \nJoint Strike Fighter contract exclusively to the Lockheed Martin JSF \nteam. Senator Bond and I are concerned that this decision might put \nAmerica's tactical aircraft industry in jeopardy, and set a bad \nprecedent for other defense contracts. The JSF program is the largest \ndefense contract in history. It is the only fighter jet contract \nplanned in the next 30 years.\n  Up until October 26th, Boeing and Lockheed remained America's only \nmajor contractors in the tactical aircraft industry. Now, if the \nLockheed team performs the entire contract, Boeing would likely be \nforced out of the fighter jet business. Competition in the industry \nwould be eliminated. Future innovation would be stifled. Costs would \nrise. Our national security would be put at risk. The preeminent \nmilitary power in the world cannot have just one company building \nfighter jets. That would be unacceptable to me and many members in our \ndefense community.\n  Just 3 years ago, the Defense Department blocked the largest merger \nin defense industry history due to concerns that the merger would \nstifle innovation and reduce competition in key aspects of defense \nproduction. It cannot now stand idly by and allow the elimination of \ncompetition for fighter jets.\n  When the Joint Strike Fighter award was announced last month, many of \nus in the Missouri delegation made it clear that we believe it is \nimperative for Boeing to play a role in the production of this \naircraft. Now we are proposing a study to examine the consequences if \nwe should fail to secure a major role for Boeing in this important \nprogram.\n  Senator Bond has posed some pertinent questions today. I hope this \nbody will support a study that simply seeks to answer these questions. \nAbove all, we must examine how the U.S. Government will be able to \npreserve sufficient expertise in this industry, if Boeing is driven out \nof the tactical aircraft business.\n  When the JSF award was announced, the Defense Department issued a \nstatement that said that the Pentagon would encourage Lockheed and \nBoeing to work together on this program. A Department of Defense press \nrelease stated on October 26 that, and I quote,\n\n       The expertise resident in the teams not selected today can \n     still make a contribution to the JSF effort through revised \n     industrial teaming arrangements. DOD will encourage teaming \n     arrangements that make the most efficient use of the \n     expertise in the industrial base to deliver the `best value' \n     product.''\n\n  I fully agree with this statement. I expect the Department of Defense \nto follow through on its commitment to encourage teaming between \nLockheed Martin and Boeing. Boeing should be a major partner in this \nproject. Boeing and Lockheed Martin executives are currently engaged in \nnegotiations on this very subject. I believe that Boeing has a strong \ncase for why it should play a major role in this critical program.\n  Boeing and its predecessor McDonnell-Douglas have a long history of \ndelivery top-quality airplanes to militaries around the globe. Its \naward-winning management team has built a solid reputation for meeting \nproduction deadlines. Boeing makes some of the most affordable aircraft \nin the world. Boeing's workforce has a unique expertise. Boeing remains \nthe world leader in developing short take-off\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\nfighters for the Marines. Boeing also produces for the Navy the \nforemost jet fighter for aircraft carrier operations.\n  Lockheed Martin could use Boeing's vast experience in building these \naircraft. Lockheed Martin executives should bear this in mind during \ntheir discussions with Boeing. I believe that the next generation of \ntactical jets must be built by an experienced team.\n  This team should include Boeing Managers, engineers and technicians, \nwho have helped build the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornets as well as the \nMarine Corps' AV-8B Harriers. Lockheed should keep in mind the concerns \nof the Pentagon, and Democratic and Republican leaders alike. \nLockheed's discussion with Boeing will have some serious long-term \neffects. With only major companies in the tactical aircraft industry, \nLockheed's decisions will directly impact the industrial base of the \nNation's fighter business.\n  Let there be no mistake. My colleagues and I in the Missouri \ndelegation will not rest until we are assured that Boeing's role in the \ntactical aircraft business is secure. Senator Bond and I are united in \nour determination to pursue every avenue, in the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee, to ensure that the \nindustrial base of this critical industry is preserved.\n  Our colleagues in the House, including the Democratic leader, the \nmajority deputy whip, and the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and committed to this effort. Today, we must take this first \nstep. We must examine the consequences of the JSF contact award, and \nensure that the future of America's tactical aircrafts remains secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Senator Stevens and I commend the Senator \nfrom Missouri for his amendment. We are pleased to accept it.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2354.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require procedures that ensure the fair and equitable \n    resolution of labor integration issues in transactions for the \n                      combination of air carriers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Sec. ____. (a) The purpose of this section is to require \n     procedures that ensure the fair and equitable resolution of \n     labor integration issues, in order to prevent further \n     disruption to transactions for the combination of air \n     carriers, which would potentially aggravate the disruption \n     caused by the attack on the United States on September 11, \n     2001.\n       (b) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier that \n     holds a certificate issued under chapter 411 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) The term ``covered employee'' means an employee who--\n       (A) is not a temporary employee; and\n       (B) is a member of a craft or class that is subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n       (3) The term ``covered transaction'' means a transaction \n     that--\n       (A) is a transaction for the combination of multiple air \n     carriers into a single air carrier;\n       (B) involves the transfer of ownership or control of--\n       (i) 50 percent or more of the equity securities (as defined \n     in section 101 of title 11, United States Code) of an air \n     carrier; or\n       (ii) 50 percent or more (by value) of the assets of the air \n     carrier;\n       (C) became a pending transaction, or was completed, not \n     earlier than January 1, 2001; and\n       (D) did not result in the creation of a single air carrier \n     by September 11, 2001.\n       (c) If an eligible employee is a covered employee of an air \n     carrier involved in a covered transaction that leads to the \n     combination of crafts or classes that are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act, the eligible employee may receive \n     assistance under this title only if the parties to the \n     transaction--\n       (1) apply sections 3 and 13 of the labor protective \n     provisions imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the \n     Allegheny-Mohawk merger (as published at 59 CAB 45) to the \n     covered employees of the air carrier; and\n       (2) subject to paragraph (1), in a case in which a \n     collective bargaining agreement provides for the application \n     of sections 3 and 13 of the labor protective provisions in \n     the process of seniority integration for the covered \n     employees, apply the terms of the collective bargaining \n     agreement to the covered employees, and do not abrogate the \n     terms of the agreement.\n       (d) Any aggrieved person (including any labor organization \n     that represents the person) may bring an action to enforce \n     this section, or the terms of any award or agreement \n     resulting from arbitration or a settlement relating to the \n     requirements of this section. The person may bring the action \n     in an appropriate Federal district court, determined in \n     accordance with section 1391 of title 28, United States Code, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment reflects a bill previously \nentered with my colleague, Senator Carnahan, and other Senators. I ask \nthey be given an opportunity to add themselves as cosponsors to this \namendment.\n  This arises out of the attacks of September 11. It helps solve a \nserious problem in the airline industry. And it provides for fair \ntreatment of the parties involved. I think this is a reasonable \nresponse.\n  Mr. President, the attacks of September 11 created severe strains on \nour Nation and its economy. The economic harm from those attacks has \nbeen most pronounced in our airline industry, the backbone of our \ntransportation system.\n  Congress moved quickly and properly to respond to the crisis facing \nthe commercial airlines with relief legislation in September. The \nfallout of the attacks, however, continues to be felt by the airlines \nand airline employees even after the Federal help.\n  Many will argue that a crisis continues in the airline industry.\n  All of our major airlines received aid through the industry relief \nbill. The Federal help was distributed fairly in proportion to the \ncarrier's share of the market.\n  American Airlines received the largest share of that aid based on its \ncombined size as a result of its acquisitions from TWA.\n  Unlike the other major carriers and their employees, the American and \nTWA employees faced the repercussions of September 11 with the \nuncertainty of the fact that their carriers had not completed the \ncombination of operations envisioned by the AA/TWA transaction.\n  With the severe disruption of the airline industry caused by the \nattacks, the TWA employees in particular faced an uncertain future of \nlayoffs knowing that there was no process in place to fairly and \nreasonably integrate their groups into the much larger American groups.\n  Indeed, the potential exists for them to suffer disproportionate job \nlosses because there is no fair process in place.\n  In support of that principle of fair treatment, I have proposed the \nAirline Workers Fairness Act.\n  This legislation is designed to achieve a simple yet essential \npurpose--to provide a neutral and fair process to integrate employee \ngroups of airlines involved in uncompleted mergers and transactions. It \nachieves this goal through:\n  A third party neutral arbitrator selected by the parties to make a \nfinal and binding decision based on the principles of fairness and \nequity.\n  This is not a new idea, but is the long-established process set forth \nby the former Civil Aeronautics Board some thirty years ago.\n  The notion of a fair and equitable seniority integration before a \nneutral arbitrator has been the industry standard for over fifty years \nin dozens of different airline mergers and acquisitions.\n  This bill recognizes that especially in the midst of severe \ndisruption in the\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\nairline industry, none of the interested parties have the ability to \ndetermine a fair and equitable resolution.\n  It puts the decision making out of the realm of passion and self-\ninterest and into the hands of an experienced and fair-minded \nprofessional arbitrator.\n  Finally, this bill gives both sides the chance for a fair hearing.\n  We are not talking about micro-managing airlines or interfering in \nprivate contracts. The procedures this bill establishes are recognized \nwidely as industry standard for seniority integrations.\n  They are also needed by employees and their families facing the loss \nof a lifetime's work.\n  Layoffs seem inevitable, but we can ensure that in the midst of the \nsevere dislocations and upheaval in the lives of these airlines \nemployees that our fundamental values were preserved, fair treatment \nand a fair hearing.\n  I have heard from all sides on this issue.\n  Both pilots unions have been on the phone and in my office on \ncountless occasions. I have also been contacted by the International \nAssociation of Machinists representing both flight attendants and \nmachinists.\n  All parties have clearly expressed to me and my staff that they want \nthis seniority integration to come to a conclusion. It is ultimately \nclear, however, that an agreement cannot be reached under the status \nquo.\n  A fair process is desperately needed by thousands of hard working and \ndedicated employees and their families who face enormous dislocation \nand insecurity.\n  I ask that we echo the words of our Commander in Chief and our \ncolleagues in the Congress; in a time of crisis we must not give up our \nfundamental values.\n  The Airlines Workers Fairness Act preserves our fundamental value of \nfair treatment during the crisis facing the airline industry.\n  It says that we will not abandon that value, rather we will recognize \nthe enormous sacrifices made by the workers in this industry, both now \nand in the past. We will give them that simple assurance of fair \ntreatment in the face of the crisis and sacrifice.\n  We are not meddling with collective bargaining or union politics * * \n* rather, we are simply helping two parties find the parameters to \nreach a fair and equitable resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important principle to assure \nfair and adequate treatment for all airline employees.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Senator Stevens and I are pleased to \naccept this amendment and take it to conference. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If there is no further debate, without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2354) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while Senators are working out some matters, \nI ask unanimous consent that I may speak for not to exceed 8 minutes on \nanother matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Congratulating Senator Strom Thurmond on His 99th Birthday\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I did not speak on the day that was the most \nfamous of all such days, the day of Senator Thurmond's birthday. I was \nbusy on appropriations matters. I did not want to let this week go by \nwithout my saying just a few words about Senator Thurmond.\n  It was 99 years ago that Strom Thurmond was born in Edgefield, SC. \nNinety-nine years old. What a feat, 99. Abraham lived to be 175 years \nold. Isaac lived to be 180. Jacob lived to be 147, and Joseph lived to \nbe 110. Moses lived to be 120. Joshua lived to be 110. And Strom \nThurmond has lived now to be 99. What a feat. That makes him old enough \nto be my big brother.\n  Well, when Strom Thurmond was born on December 5, 1902, the Wright \nBrothers had not yet made their historic flight at Kitty Hawk. He has \nlived to see men walking on the Moon. He has lived to see American \nspace vessels exploring the far reaches of our galaxy. When he was \nborn, Theodore Roosevelt was President of the United States. Since \nthen, we have had 16 more Presidents.\n  When he was born, the Kaiser still ruled in Germany. Since then, that \ncountry has seen the rise and fall of the Weimar Republic, the rise and \nfall of Nazi Germany, a divided Germany, and now a united Germany. When \nStrom Thurmond was born, the Czar still ruled in Russia. Since then, \nthat country has experienced the Russian Revolution of 1917--that was \nthe year I was born--the Bolshevist government, the Communist \ngovernment, the Soviet empire, and now Russia again.\n  Almost as intriguing has been the extraordinary career of our \nremarkable colleague. During the same time period, Senator Thurmond has \nbeen a teacher, an athletic coach, an educational administrator, a \nlawyer, a State legislator, and a circuit court judge.\n  Joseph wore a coat of many colors, but Strom Thurmond has held all of \nthese offices, these professions, before coming to the U.S. Senate.\n  He won his first elective office, county superintendent, the same \nyear that Herbert Hoover won his first elective office, 1928. Strom \nThurmond was a soldier in World War II where he took part in the D-Day \ninvasion of Normandy. He was a Presidential nominee in 1948. He was \nGovernor of his beloved State of South Carolina from 1947 to 1951.\n  He has been a Democrat, Dixiecrat, and a Republican. Most of all, he \nhas been and is a great American.\n  All of this would have been more than enough experiences and \nachievements in one lifetime for most mortals, but incredibly Strom \nThurmond's greatest days were still ahead of him. In 1954, he won his \nfirst election to the U.S. Senate as a write-in candidate. That is \nsaying something for any man who can win on a write-in seat in the \nSenate, making him the only person in history to be elected to the \nSenate as a write-in candidate. He pledged to the people of South \nCarolina that if they elected him as a write-in candidate, he would \nresign and he would run again and win the election the old-time way. \nAnd he did just what he promised he would do. So now he has become the \nlongest serving Senator in history and the oldest person ever to have \nserved in the Senate.\n  It is more than just longevity that has made Strom Thurmond an \nextraordinary Senator. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has fought \nfor a stronger military, to keep our country free, and he has fought \nfor tougher anti-crime laws to make our streets safer. As President pro \ntempore of the Senate, he has brought dignity and style and a southern \nrefinement to this important position. For these and other \nachievements, he has had high schools, State and Federal buildings, as \nwell as streets and dams and town squares named in his honor.\n\n  A few years ago in 1991, the Senate designated room S-238 here in the \nU.S. Capitol as the ``Strom Thurmond Room'' in recognition of the \nselfless and dedicated service he has provided to our Nation and its \npeople.\n  I remember that day, a long time ago, when Strom Thurmond suffered \nthe loss of his wife. I used to see her sitting in the galleries. I can \nsee her right now sitting in that first seat. We are not supposed to \ncall attention to the people in the galleries, but I can remember \nhaving seen her sitting in that very first seat where the gentleman is\n\n[[Page S12655]]\n\nsitting right at this minute and watching the Senate.\n  I remember the day that that lady passed away. I came to the Senate. \nStrom Thurmond was sitting right back here where Senator Joe Lieberman \nis sitting tonight. I walked up to him, gripped his hand, and told him \nI was sorry. And he was his spartan self. He thanked me and continued \nin his service.\n  On this his 99th birthday, I wish to say what a privilege and an \nhonor it has been to have served with this remarkable man for all of \nthese remarkable years, a man whom the good Lord has blessed with this \nlong lifetime of service to his people. He has always been an \noutstanding legislator, a southern gentleman, and foremost, a good \nfriend.\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers,\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all.\n\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows;\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears;\n     And on this beautiful December evening, Strom, count your age \n           by friends, not years.\n\n  Happy birthday, Senator. May God always bless you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator Byrd is a man of character, a \nman of ability, a man of dedication, and we are all proud of him. Thank \nyou very much.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all the Senators.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been a very hectic day for \neveryone. Before the night passed, I wanted to make sure everyone \nunderstood how much we on this side of the aisle appreciate the Senator \nfrom Hawaii. Senator Stevens today gave a very emotional speech \nregarding Senator Inouye, and it was not appropriate after that very \nemotional presentation was given by Senator Stevens to say anything \nabout Senator Inouye. I did not want the night to pass without everyone \nunderstanding how we feel about Senator Inouye. In fact, he is one of \nthe most revered people in the history of the Senate. I do not know of \nanyone I have ever heard who has said an unkind word about the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. Just because we were silent earlier today does \nnot negate the strength of the feeling we have for Senator Inouye. In \nthe time I have served in the Senate, there is no one I respect or \nadmire more than the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  The work he has done on this bill is as exemplary as the work he has \ndone as a Senator.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2355\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration. n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2355.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funding for necessary expenses of the HUBZone \n    program authorized under the Small Business Act, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n\n                    ``Small Business Administration\n\n\n                    ``disaster loan program account\n\n       ``Sec. 115.

Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to close a gap \nthat was opened as a result of the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. During the consideration of that bill, the \nconference committee deleted funding for a small but important program \nknown as the Hubzone program. We enacted it in this body in 1997 with \nunanimous, bipartisan support to direct Federal contracting dollars to \nthe Nation's most depressed areas of high poverty and high \nunemployment; that is, in the inner cities, in the rural areas, in the \nNative American communities, and in the Alaskan Native villages.\n  We find small firms do not normally want to locate in these areas \nbecause they do not have enough customer traffic to buy their products, \nbut as a result they cannot find a customer base. In the Hubzone \nprogram, the Government acts as a customer and it buys about $190 \nbillion of goods and services each year.\n  This amendment does not appropriate new money. It simply restores the \nprogram to be implemented using the recommendations made in a General \nAccounting Office report. I ask the support of my colleagues in \nadopting this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, the amendment submitted by Senator Bond \nhas been cleared on our side, and on behalf of Senator Stevens, we \naccept that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2355) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2356\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, this is my annual Defense Department \naccounting amendment.\n  I call it my accounting 101 amendment.\n  I call it accounting 101 because it calls on DOD to apply one of the \nmost elementary accounting procedures in existence.\n  It request that DOD match disbursements with obligations before \nmaking payments.\n  Accountants and bookkeepers have been using this procedure since the \nbeginning of time. It is an important internal control check. But it is \nsimple and effective. Most people do it when they reconcile their \nmonthly credit card bills.\n  Before a bill is approved for payment, someone has to check to make \nsure that the item in question was, in fact, ordered and received; and \nit can be located in the warehouse or elsewhere. It is a way of \ndetecting and deterring theft and fraud. Today, it can be done \nelectronically with computers.\n  For unexplained reasons in the past, DOD has not followed this simple \nprocedure. DOD likes to pay the bill first and at some later date--\nmaybe a year or two later--try to match the payment with a bill. In the \nPentagon, they call it ``pay and chase.'' In many cases, the bill is \nnever found.\n  Pay and chase is one big reason why DOD piled up $50 billion in \nunmatched disbursements in the 1990's.\n  Sloppy bookkeeping leaves DOD's financial resources vulnerable to \nfraud and abuse.\n  Earlier this year, the very distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, raised a series of very \ntroublesome questions about DOD accounting practices. He did it at a \nhearing before the Armed Services Committee on January on Mr. \nRumsfeld's nomination.\n  Senator Byrd said and I quote: ``The Pentagon's books are in such \nutter disarray that no one knows what America's military actually owns \nor spends.''\n  Senator Byrd also said and I quote: ``The Department of Defense's own \nauditors say the department cannot account for $2.3 trillion in \ntransactions in one year alone.''\n  The failure to match disbursements with obligations is a big driver \nbehind the problem identified by Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd's inquiry set off a firestorm at the Pentagon. It became \na catalyst for change. Secretary Rumsfeld and his team are now \ncommitted to reform.\n  As a former chief executive officer with a large corporation, Mr. \nRumsfeld understands that he must have accurate, up-to-date information \nat his fingertips.\n  He knows that he can't make good decisions with lousy information. \nBut that's all he gets right now--lousy financial information.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld knows that financial reform is mandatory.\n  This year I have had the privilege of working with the very \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, \nto solve this problem.\n  Our financial reform initiative was accepted by the committee and is \nnow part of the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense authorization bill.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's initiatives and the provisions in the Defense \nauthorization bill are part of a long-term effort.\n  It may take four years or more before the new systems are up and \nrunning and producing reliable financial information.\n  The amendment that I offer today is a short-term, stopgap measure. It \nwill help to maintain pressure and discipline in accounting before the \nnew systems can kick in to action.\n  Mr. President, the policy embodied in this amendment has been \nincorporated in the last seven appropriations acts--fiscal years 1995 \nthrough 2001.\n  Under current law, Section 8137 of the act for Fiscal Year 2001, the \nmatching threshold is set at $500,000.00.\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\n  By a unanimous vote taken on June 9, 2000, the Senate agreed to keep \nthe threshold at the $500,000.00 level.\n  Both the General Accounting Office and the inspector general believe \nthat this policy is helping the department avoid ``problem \ndisbursements'' and other related accounting problems.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has made a firm commitment to ``clean up'' the \nbooks and bring some financial management reform to the process at the \nPentagon.\n  Mr. President, that's half of the battle right there--the will to do \nit. And the will is there.\n  Having that kind of attitude at the top gives me a high level of \nconfidence. Maybe we can get the job done this time.\n  Since Secretary Rumsfeld's proposed reforms are still in the \ndevelopment phase and may be several years down the road, I am \nrecommending that the matching threshold be maintained at the current \nlevel of $5,000,000.00.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2385\n\n   (Purpose: To set aside Army RDT funds for the Three-Dimensional \n                   Ultrasound Imaging Initiative II)\n\n       At the appropriate place in division A, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense, a matter of great importance to our national \nsecurity--our naval shipbuilding programs. As my colleagues are aware, \nboth the House and Senate national Defense authorization bills for the \ncurrent fiscal year contain provisions supporting continued production \nof the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the investment of \nresearch and development in a next generation destroyer or ``DD(X)'' \nprogram, and advanced procurement for the LPD 17 program. I am elated \nto see that the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill for \nFY2002 contain similar provisions, but troubled by the action that was \ntaken in the house, particularly on the DD(X) program.\n  I appreciate the chairman and ranking Member's support for these \nshipbuilding programs and would like to take a few minutes to discuss \nthe vital need for them. All of these programs are critical to \nsustaining a strong forward deployed naval presence, while addressing \nthe anti-access challenges faced by our men and women who continue to \nprotect our nation's assets, interests, and freedom.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Maine in \nrecognizing the critical need for us to acquire and modernize our naval \nfleet in order to strengthen our Navy and Marine Corps for the 21st \ncentury. The Senator from Main has been a real advocate for the Navy's \nshipbuilding programs and I look forward to this and future discussions \non these very important issues.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished Chairman and would like to \nbegin with the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which has been the \nbackbone of the Navy's surface fleet. The Navy has indicated in its \nmost recent study of the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51)-class destroyer \nindustrial base, and in testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, that three DDG-51 destroyers per year is the most economical \nrate of procurement. Last year, the National Defense Authorization Act \nprovided the authority to the Secretary of the Navy to enter into \ncontracts to procure three vessels in each fiscal year 2002 and 2003. \nThe FY2002 National Defense Authorization bill includes $2.966 billion \nfor the procurement of three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.\n  This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee added report language \nagreeing with the Navy's long standing assessment that the destroyer \nindustrial base is at risk unless three destroyers are built each year, \nor unless the destroyer shipbuilders attain significant other work \nbeyond their historic level. As such, the FY2002 national Defense \nauthorization report reiterates that the Secretary of the Navy should \ninclude procurement of three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the \nFY2003 budget request. I strongly support the inclusion in the fiscal \nyear 2003 defense budget of a third DDG-51, which would be built at \nBath Iron Works in my home state. The integrity of our shipbuilding \nindustrial base largely depends upon it. I would ask that chairman and \nranking Member whether they agree with me on this important point.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I join my colleague in her expressed concern with the \nprocurement rate of the DDG-51 program. I am particularly sensitive to \nrecent reports that indicate the DDG-51 procurement rate is projected \nto drop below three ships per year after FY2002 for the first time in \nthe program's history. Such a rate could place this unique, specialized \nindustrial base at risk to meet future naval requirements. It could, in \nfact, jeopardize efforts to sustain an adequately sized surface force \nand maintain the continued affordability of the ships required for our \nfuture naval forces. And so I do support the inclusion of a third DDG-\n51, to be built by Bath Iron Works, in next year's budget.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, my colleagues are correct in stating that \nthe DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers have played, and will \ncontinue to play, a critical role as a vital part of our naval fleet. \nThe DDG-51 program is a mature and highly successful major acquisition \nprogram providing front-line state-of-the-art combatants for the fleet. \nAt the same time, we need to make a smooth transition from the DDG-51 \nto a next generation destroyer. Our committee will continue to support \nthe DDG-51 program and the transition to building a next generation \ndestroyer.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The next generation destroyer, now the DD(X) program, is \nthe Navy's future and way ahead to transform our naval forces to meet \nthe challenges of the 21st century. This program, which will emphasize \na common hullform and technology development, will form the foundation \nof our future destroyer and cruiser production. The Navy will use the \nadvanced technology and networking capabilities from the DD(X) in the \ndevelopment of additional ships in the DD(X) family of ships program. \nAs Chief of Naval Operations testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, earlier this year, the DD(X) program ``is central to our \n[naval] transformation effort . . . and is another step toward the \ncreation of a more integrated Navy/Marine Corps team.'' It is therefore \ncritical that the Senate's FY2002 budget level for the DD(X) program be \nincreased or at least retained in conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I could not agree more with my colleague that while \nthere is some uncertainty surrounding the restructuring of the DD-21 \nprogram, a continued investment and commitment to a next generation \ndestroyer needs to be sustained to transform the Navy and Marine Corps. \nWhile we are waiting for that program to develop, it makes sound \ndefense, fiscal, and industrial base policy to sustain an annual three-\nship DDG-51 procurement rate after FY2002, and most immediately, in \nFY2003, and I encourage the Navy to do so.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I also would like to briefly speak on the \nLPD-17 program, which is a critical ship for the modernization of the \nNavy's amphibious force. Each of these ships can carry more than 700 \nMarines and their equipment to shore to perform their mission. The LPD-\n17 program is critical to replace four aging classes of ships and to \nsignificantly increase the operational capabilities of the Marine \nCorps.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have always been a supporter of the LPD-17 program and \nthe committee very much appreciates\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\nthe need for the lift capacity of this ship. In 2010, when the last \nLPD-17 class ship is scheduled to join the fleet, the amphibious force \nwill consist of 36 ships or 12, three-ship Amphibious Ready Groups \n(ARGs), consisting of one LHA or LHD, one LPD and one LSD. I assure you \nthat we are committed to seeing this program through production.\n  Ms. COLLINS. As always, I am impressed by the ranking member's \nknowledge and his grasp of the issues, and I appreciate that we are in \nagreement as to the value and need for this critical ship. I look \nforward to our continued work together in support of this and all of \nthese shipbuilding programs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Maine for her continued \ncommitment to our naval forces ensuring that we build enough ships to \nmeet the Nation's defense needs. I recognize and am sensitive to the \nfact that the Navy needs to sustain an investment of $10 to $12 billion \nin the shipbuilding account to maintain a minimum shipbuilding rate of \n8-10 ships per year before it will be able to fulfill all the required \nmissions for our naval forces, and I will work with the Navy and my \ncolleagues in the Senate to address this issue. I thank my colleague \nfor her dedication to these issues and I look forward to continuing \nthese types of discussions on the critical needs of our military \nforces.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nforthrightness, their knowledge and their determination to keep America \nstrong. I also commend them for their continued dedication to our men \nand women in uniform and the efforts they have undertaken in this \nimportant appropriations bill to provide them with the compensation, \ntools and equipment they need to maintain America's pre-eminence in the \nworld.\n\n\n                            CRUSADER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am concerned about the funding \nreductions to the Crusader program, and the impact that may have on the \nprocurement of long lead items for the Crusader. The Crusader is an \nimportant new weapon system for the Army and we should not do anything \nthat could delay this important program during this critical time that \nwe are now in.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I assure my friend from Oklahoma that we will do what we \ncan in the conference to ensure adequate funding for the Crusader.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know my friend from Oklahoma has been watching the \nCrusader program for some time and is keenly interested in its \nprogress, as is the Army. I want to add my assurance to that of the \nchairman's that we will do all we can in conference to ensure the \nCrusader is not delayed by inadequate funding.\n\n\n                DEFENSE PERSONNEL RECORDS IMAGING SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, will the ranking member yield briefly \nfor the purpose of a colloquy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee for the purpose of \na colloquy.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I'd like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate an important information technology program. The Defense \nPersonnel Records Imaging System (DPRIS) is the follow-on records \nmanagement system needed to process, store, and distribute military \npersonnel information.\n  Currently, DPRIS is not ready to move from the Concept Advanced \nDemonstration phase to the System Integration phase. In order for the \nprogram to complete developmental activities to mature the system to \nthe point that it is ready for Low-Rate Initial Production, $2 million \nis required for further demonstration/validation work.\n  Mr. President, the recent call up of thousands of National Guardsmen \nand Reservists to respond to the war on terrorism has further taxed an \nalready overburdened personnel records management system. We need to \nget DPRIS completely through R, so we can make a smooth transition \nfrom the old system to the new.\n  I know the chairman and ranking member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee understand the importance of this program, and would hope \nthat they would give this DPRIS funding every consideration during \nconference with the House. At a minimum, I hope the chairman and \nranking member will encourage the Department of Defense to either \nreprogram funds for this purpose, or to request these funds in a \nsupplemental appropriations request that is likely to come early next \nyear.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee raises an \nimportant issue in this IT program. We will do our best to work with \nthe Senator on this matter during the conference with the House. We \nwill also work with the Senator and the Department of Defense on this \nissue in the future.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their attention to this matter, and appreciate the challenges they \nface in crafting the Department of Defense spending bill.\n\n\n                         SMART PAY CARD PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I rise to ask a point of clarification by the chairman and \nranking member relating to a letter that Senator Baucus and I sent to \nthe CBO regarding the use of the Smart Pay Card used by Department of \nDefense employees, the armed services, and contractors with the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield, for the purpose of your question regarding the \nSmart Pay Card.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. At this point, I would ask unanimous \nconsent that the November 15, 2001 letter from Senator Baucus and me to \nCBO Director, Dan Crippen, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2001.\n     Mr. Dan L. Crippen, Director,\n     Congressional Budget Office, Ford House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Crippen: In view of the increased federal \n     expenditures generated as a result of the September 11 \n     terrorist attacks, we believe that, more than ever, the \n     federal government should explore new ways of managing \n     federal outlays by adopting more efficient ways to control \n     federal spending. In that regard, we are requesting CBO to \n     score our proposal for improvements to the GSA SmartPay \n     program, which we believe will provide to the GSA's \n     management of the SmartPay program a positive material effect \n     on the fiscal operations of current and future \n     implementations of SmartPay programs. We would like your \n     comments on the following proposal.\n       By way of background, the SmartPay program was established \n     in 1998 to improve the speed of acquisition and reduce the \n     cost of payments handling for many classes of purchases and \n     acquisitions in the federal agencies, offices and \n     departments. There are approximately 3.5 million active \n     cards, accounting for approximately $20 billion in annual \n     purchases. The GSA estimates that the SmartPay card programs \n     currently save the government approximately $1.2 billion \n     annually in administrative costs. While these numbers are \n     impressive, recent congressional hearings convince us that \n     there have also been tens of millions of dollars of rebate \n     opportunities lost by the government due to card misuse, \n     along with millions in additional savings that have not been \n     realized in the program's implementation thus far.\n\n\n                              The proposal\n\n       There are four specific areas of proposed savings that we \n     would like you to examine:\n       1. Pricing Concession Management: PCM is the measure of \n     unit pricing reductions enjoyed by the government as a result \n     of discount agreements with high-use vendors.\n       a. Roughly 200 retailers nationwide represent 65% of all \n     Visa and MasterCard credit card purchases today. It is our \n     belief that analysis of SmartPay use might show analogous \n     concentrations, and would allow for targeted negotiations \n     with key vendors who provide significant levels of products \n     and services to the federal government.\n       b. There are currently few if any discounts being offered \n     for SmartPay users that are directly tied to the SmartPay \n     card as the purchase mechanism.\n       c. Based on the volume of SmartPay use today, we estimate \n     that there is over $50 million available in discounts from \n     volume purchase agreements that could be negotiated if more \n     detailed analysis were being routinely performed on \n     government-wide purchases made with SmartPay products.\n       2. Rebates Management: RM is the aggressive tracking, \n     invoicing, and collection of all applicable rebates that are \n     negotiated with SmartPay issuers. RM improvements consist of \n     collection all existing rebates and future rebates as well as \n     ensuring that the Issuing Banks are correctly calculating the \n     rebates.\n       3. Loss and Abuse Reduction: GSA rebates from SmartPay card \n     issuers are net of chargeoffs within the program. Currently, \n     these chargeoffs amount to more than $55 million, and \n     delinquency rates on T cards are between 7-14%.\n       a. GSA should enable the use of commercially proven \n     strategies and technologies for reducing, minimizing, or \n     eliminating the current unacceptable level of fraud or abuse \n     losses on the card programs, such strategies\n\n[[Page S12668]]\n\n     could save a significant portion of the $55 million.\n       b. Using the best practices employed by card issuers, as \n     well as those used by corporations for their own card \n     programs, will provide benefits from both the Issuer and the \n     User side of SmartPay programs.\n       4. Increasing SmartPay Administrative Efficiencies: \n     Outsourcing portions of the management of the SmartPay \n     program will allow for application of commercially proven \n     expertise in some areas. It will also serve to expedite \n     timely approval of card charges and increase risk review and \n     validation. As a result, existing personnel will be able to \n     spend less time on the activities required for approving, \n     processing, monitoring, and validating all of the \n     administrative functions associated with procurement, payment \n     and audit processes.\n       a. Automated Daily Approval and Control: Using an outside \n     vendor's system to automated many of the paper processes \n     currently in many SmartPay program implementations would save \n     significant time for SmartPay administrative personnel in the \n     various departments and agencies that use the programs.\n       b. Statement Reconciliation and Payment Approval: Using an \n     outside vendor to perform statement reconciliations, payment \n     approval authorization, and exception reporting will lower \n     fraud as well as the cycle time required to identify \n     potential fraud or abuse issues.\n       For additional information on our proposal please contact \n     Zak Andersen in Senator Baucus's office and Stan Ullman in \n     Senator Burns's office.\n       We appreciate your active consideration of this matter, and \n     we would welcome your office's analysis of this proposal \n     before the next budget cycle begins early next year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Conrad Burns,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Before asking my first question, I want to provide a very \nbrief context for my letter to CBO and the issues I will be raising. \nThe subject of the letter is whether the federal government can save \neven more money than it has been saving with the use of the Smart Pay \nCard program. This matter was brought to the attention of Senator \nBaucus and myself by Michael B. Walker, a Montanan who has considerable \nexperience in the credit industry. Mr. Walker, who is CEO of Payment \nPrograms Management Corporation, believes that there is an opportunity \nfor the federal government to save hundreds of millions of more dollars \nwith its use of credit cards issued to federal employees. Senator \nBaucus and I wanted to get an independent confirmation of those savings \nfrom the CBO before encouraging Congress to adopt the refinement \noutlined in our letter. It is my understanding that CBO will score the \nvarious proposed improvements in our letter before the end of this \nyear, but the scoring may not arrive in time to affect appropriations \nbills for the current fiscal year. Since the largest users of the card \nare the employees of DOD, I thought that it would be appropriate to \nraise this matter in connection with this bill. Assuming that CBO does \nrespond with a scoring that the improvements suggested in our letter \nwill potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars, will the Senator \nfrom Alaska tell me whether he will work with the Department of Defense \nto encourage the consideration of any and all potential savings and \nbenefits suggested in the letter send to CBO by Senator Baucus and \nmyself?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to work with the Senator.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. My next question is a follow up \nquestion. Assuming that the armed services are prepared to offer \nproposed improvements in the use of federal credit cards, would you \nencourage them to work with the General Services Administration, which \nis charged with the overall administration of the Smart Pay Card \nProgram, to get these improvements adopted?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to work with the Senator to ensure \nevery opportunity to meet with the General Services Administration and \ndiscuss this important issue.\n\n\n                             NETFIRES--FOGM\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I applaud and share Senator Inouye's \ndesire to strongly support the Army in its transformation to a lighter, \nmore deployable, agile, lethal and survivable force, in order to meet \nthe challenges we have today and certainly expect in the future. This \ntransformation to an Objective Force is very ambitious in terms of new \ncapabilities, and I think we should all recognize the significant \ntechnological risks associated with this endeavor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator for his support as a member of the \nsubcommittee and for his work on this bill. Army transformation is \nambitious, and, while we are all very supportive of the Army's efforts \nto transform, I know we are equally sensitive to the technology \nchallenges facing the Army.\n  Mr. SHELBY. While the Objective Force and the Future Combat System \nare relatively new terms, many people may not be aware that Army \nscientists and engineers have been working on transformation technology \nsince before the end of the cold war. For example, the Fiber Optic \nGuided Missile, FOGM, has been demonstrated with soldiers and has \nperformed most of the objectives required for the artillery component \nof the Future Combat System known as NetFires. FOGM is inherently \nimmune to radio-frequency jamming, a serious concern for NetFires. It \ndoes not require a not-yet-developed automatic target recognition \ncapability like NetFires. It is soldier-proven technology already in \nservice or in development in several other countries. It offers the \npotential for significant savings in time and money in getting to low \nrate initial production, compared with NetFires. I fully support work \non leap-ahead technology programs like NetFires, but I believe we \nshould take prudent steps to mitigate against high risk programs by \ncontinuing work on alternative capabilities.\n  Mr. INOUYE. As we know well, all weapon development programs involve \nsignificant risk. The NetFires--FOGM example is instructive. We will \ncontinue to monitor the Future Combat System program as the required \ntechnologies mature, and the Senator can be sure we will continue to \npay close attention to alternative capability programs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I believe the off-the-shelf FOGM can provide an \nacceptable alternative to NetFires if circumstances require it. I know \nthat with Senator Inouye's leadership, we will keep on top of these \ncritical technology issues. I look forward to our continuing to work \ntogether as we face funding decisions about these important \ntransformation programs.\n\n\n                             PROJECT ALPHA\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a brief colloquy with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee. We are all too aware of the terrible \nterrorist threats we face and of the difficulty in predicting and \nassessing these threats. I have been especially concerned about \npossible threats to the U.S. food supply and about our lack of \nprotections and monitoring of our food.\n  Project Alpha is a proactive approach using advanced technologies, \nexpert systems, and thinking ``outside the box'' in order to predict, \nassess, and analyze terrorist threats. I am proud that Iowa State \nUniversity and the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA, would \nplay a key role in this project. I hope the committee will open to the \nuse of funds in this bill, and I ask for the chairman's support for \nimplementation of Project Alpha and its National Decision Assessment \nImmersion Center, with emphasis on protecting the U.S. food supply.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am aware of the potential of Project Alpha and of the \nparticipation of the Maui High Performance Computing Center as another \nkey partner. You can be sure I will give careful consideration to this \nproject as we guide this bill through conference.\n\n\n                             bioinformatics\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I will be glad to engage in a discussion \nwith Senator Clinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Hawaii. \nI want to discuss the emerging field of Bioinformatics. Bionformatics \nhas become one of our most important emerging technologies. \nBioinformatics is the use of high-powered computing techniques to \nanalyze the data generated by the Human Genome Project. Massive \ncomputing power is needed in order to interpret this vast amount of \ndata. The University at Buffalo is seeking to establish a Center of \nExcellence in Bioinformatics. The University at Buffalo is home to the \nCenter for Computational Research, one of the top ten\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\nsupercomputing sites in the nation. The University at Buffalo would \nforge an academic and industrial partnership with renowned academic, \nmedical, and research institutions, including Binghamton University. \nWill the Senator agree that Buffalo's blend of leading academic, \nresearch, industrial, and medical institutions make Buffalo an ideal \nlocation for a Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with my colleague that Buffalo is an ideal \nlocation for a Center of Excellence in the important emerging field of \nbioinformatics.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank my colleague. I am aware that funds are made \navailable in both the House version of the Defense appropriations \nfiscal year 2002 bill and the bill the Senator has proposed. I ask that \nthe Senator from Hawaii support as much funding for bioinformatics \nprograms as possible, within the fiscal constraints we face, as the \nDefense spending bill completes conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I assure the Senator we will do all we can.\n\n\n                  hybrid electric vehicle technologies\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the fiscal \nyear 2002 Defense appropriations bill contains funding for Hybrid \nElectric Vehicle, HEV, technologies. I am seeking the chairman's \nassistance to ensure that the funding in this bill for HEVs will also \nbe dedicated to the work of applying currently developed and \ndemonstrated HEV technology to a weapons system.\n  The U.S. Army High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, HIMARS, program \nhas an HEV initiative that will put hybrid propulsion on the Family of \nMedium Tactical Vehicles, FMTV, platform. As the chairman well knows, \nthe Army has identified Hybrid Electric Drive as the key technology for \ntransformation. Hybrid electric propulsion provides greater fuel and \nlogistics cost savings, increased survivability thorough silent mode \noperations, provides improved mobility, and supplies a new capability \nto the vehicle systems power management that currently does not exist \nwithin any Army weapons system. This initiative that I am referring to \nwill jump-start the Army's effort to weaponize an HEV platform with the \nHIMARS program. The timing of these funds for this conversion effort of \nHIMARS to HEV is critical. Providing the funds now, in fiscal year \n2002, would allow the hybrid drive initiative to dovetail with the \ncurrent production planned for HIMARS. Missing the opportunity this \nyear would require untimely changes to the HIMARS production line, and \nwould be excessively more expensive for the U.S. Army conversion to the \nHEV platform.\n  This significant HEV series technology has already been accomplished \nunder the Dual Use Science and Technology initiative by the National \nAutomotive Command under TACOM contract. The contract converted the \nFMTV platform into series HEV technology. The contract should be \ncontinued for a timely series HIMARS HEV conversion. It is my \nunderstanding that the FY 2002 MRLS Product Improvement Program line \ncontains $20 million of which $10 million should be programmed to begin \nthe timely conversion of the hybrid series FMTV truck to a HIMARS \nseries hybrid electric vehicle platform. I urge the Chairman to support \nthis important transformation project.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the senior Senator from New York that HEV \ntechnology is vital to the future success of the Army transformation \nand believe the Congress should support such technologies. This \ninitiative of placing series HEV on a current successful weapon \ndevelopment program leverages the existing technologies and is the \nright course of action. I understanding that this modification will \nsupport initiating the timely introduction of series HEV onto a HIMARS \nplatform. I can assure the senior Senator from New York that this \ncommittee will review this issue during the conference. I understand \nthat utilizing the existing contract and previous accomplished work may \nbe the best means to leverage the taxpayers' investment, as well as to \naccelerate the HEV weaponization for Army transformation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate the leadership that Senator Inouye is \ntaking on this issue in light of today's recognized need to accelerate \nthe Army's transformation and reduction of logistic infrastructure and \nskyrocketing costs associated with supporting fuel requirements on \ntoday's battlefields.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I will ensure that the committee will thoroughly review \nthis issue during the conference of the Defense appropriations bill.\n\n\n                            CRUSADER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to Senator Stevens that I appreciate \nall his hard work on the Defense appropriations bill. I would like to \ndiscuss pending actions on the Crusader Program. Crusader is a critical \ntransformation system, which is already a generation ahead of the \nexisting Paladin system. When fielded, Crusader will have unparalleled \nrate of fire, range of fire and lethality unmatched by any system in \nthe world. We must continue to fund this program in its entirety. To do \nthis we must put $80,972,000 into the Defense appropriations bill. \nAgain, I thank the Senate and the committee for their hard work.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with my colleague, Senator Inohfe, and I also \nfeel that this program warrants full funding under the Defense \nappropriations bill. During conference we must restore the funding in \nits entirety.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I share the concerns of Senator Inhofe and I, too, \nbelieve that we need to fully fund the program. The Crusader is meeting \nperformance tests; it is on schedule and on budget. We must address the \nfunding requirements in conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Crusader Program is vital to Army transformation and \nshould be fully funded to meet the needs of the Army.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I say to Senators Stevens, Inouye, and \nNickles that I appreciate their attention and continued support on this \nmatter.\n\n\n          consolidated interactive virtual information center\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a brief colloquy with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee. There is an important project in the \nIowa National Guard to bring unique networking and secure storage \ncapabilities to bear on distance learning and simulations, including \nreal-time simulations at multiple sites. The Consolidated Interactive \nVirtual Information Center has taken on new immediacy since September \n11 along with the National Guard as a whole. It has been used to train \nGuard members in protecting our airports and could play a critical role \nin homeland defense.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has recommended this \nproject for funding within National Guard distance learning accounts, \nbut I wanted to clarify the intent. Is it your expectation that the \nCIVIC project will receive sufficient funding for a second year of \ndevelopment, and a level at least equal to last year's?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am happy to recognize the value of the CIVIC project. \nWhile there are other worthy distance learning programs, it is \nimportant that sufficient funds be made available to the CIVIC project \nfor its continued development at a level at least as great as last \nyear. In addition, as stated in the committee report, I hope this \nworthy project will be funded in next year's budget.\n\n\n                   transit Capital Investment Grants\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nregarding a section which would provide $100,000,000 in badly needed \ntransit capital investment grants to those transit agencies that were \nmost severely impacted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority (MTA) of New York State and the Port Authority \nTrans-Hudson (PATH) commuter rail system as well as transit authorities \nin New Jersey would be eligible for the assistance provided under this \nprovision as these agencies would have to be considered among the most \nseverely impacted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from New York is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is also my understanding that the portion of this \nprovision that precludes any transit agency that receives a direct \nFederal payment under any other section of this bill from receiving any \nof the $100,000,000 in\n\n[[Page S12670]]\n\ncapital investment grants is not intended to apply to the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson commuter rail \nsystem; or the transit authorities in New Jersey.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from New York is correct. That provision is \nintended to address the Washington, D.C. Metro System, which receives a \ndirect federal payment elsewhere in the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, the Senator from West Virginia, for his \nclarification on this point and for his leadership on this essential \nhomeland security package. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       animal research facilities\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after many visits over the years to the \nanimal disease facilities at Ames, Iowa, I am all too aware of the very \ngreat need to modernize them, providing the security, safety, and \ncapability to conduct necessary work that will both protect animal \nagriculture and human health as well. The Appropriations Committee \nconcurred when it approved the amendment proposed by Senator Byrd that \nprovided very necessary funds for those facilities those at Plum \nIsland.\n  We do not know when a major emergency will be upon us for which these \nfacilities could be crucial. Hopefully, we will have them built when \nthat time comes. In order to maximize the likelihood that will be the \ncase, I believe it is clear that the Secretary should do all that she \ncan to accelerate the design and the construction of the Ames, Iowa \nfacilities, and the design of facilities at Plum Island.\n  Clearly, to the extent that it is prudent, the authorities that are \navailable should be used in the Federal Acquisition Regulations to \naccelerate the planning, design of the entire modernization plan, and \nthe construction of those facilities for which funds are available. I \nalso expect that the Department will provide appropriate support to \nmaximize the speed of planning design and construction, moving to the \nconstruction phases as soon as possible for this important project. \nCertainly, the portion of the design for which construction funds are \navailable should receive the highest priority.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I fully concur with the remarks of the \nSenator from Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nThe Department should move with the greatest dispatch to design and \nconstruct these biosecurity-3 facilities. It is important that we move \nforward quickly in order to enhance research in this critical area, and \nit is also important that research facilities of this nature be in \ncompliance with very strict biosecurity standards. Every area of our \nnation would see very significant damage to animal agriculture if \ncertain diseases manifest themselves. The Department should use the \nauthorities it has to accelerate the design and construction of these \nimportant facilities.\n\n\n              california anti-terrorism information center\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from \nCalifornia and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to address \nthe dangerous gap that exists in the counterterrorism intelligence \nnetwork in this country. Information pertaining to terrorist threats is \nnot currently collected in a centralized place for review, analysis, \nand dissemination. Statewide counter terrorist data is therefore not \naccessible to every law enforcement agency that may need it. The \ncollection, analysis, and accessibility of this information to law \nenforcement are critically important to protect the health and safety \nof citizens.\n  In late September, the California Governor and Attorney General \nsigned a memorandum of understanding that established The California \nAnti Terrorism Information Center (CATIC) to address this critical \nproblem. Every day, State and local law enforcement learn information \nthat may be useful to Federal intelligence authorities or that may \nactually prevent terrorist events from taking place. Despite this \nobvious point, there is currently no reliable and secure system to \nensure that this information flows back and forth among the right \npeople in a rapid and organized manner.\n  The California Anti-Terrorism Information Center is designed to solve \nthis problem by developing a sophisticated data system that includes \ntrained intelligence specialist, extensive technology infrastructure, \nand strong safeguards to protect constitutionally guaranteed civil \nliberties.\n  This new system represents a crucial advance in counter-terrorism \nintelligence sharing and some federal agencies have already committed \nanalysts to CATIC. Dozens of State and local personnel will also be \ndetailed to the various investigative and analytic units of CATIC. I \nbelieve Federal resources are also a necessary component of this \nproject if it is to achieve maximum effectiveness.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It has become increasingly clear that the coordination \nbetween Federal, State and local law enforcement is crucial if we are \nto keep our citizens safe. The California Governor and Attorney General \nhave combined their efforts and devised a system to meet these critical \nneeds. The California Anti-Terrorism Information Center will provide \nlaw enforcement agencies with valuable intelligence support, enhancing \ntheir efforts to combat the threat of terrorism. I join my colleague in \nurging the Department of Justice to fund the California Anti-Terrorism \nInformation Center.\n  Mr. BYRD. I understand the concerns raised by the Senators from \nCalifornia. I urge the Department of Justice and other national \nsecurity agencies to give due consideration to projects such as the \nCalifornia Anti-Terrorism Information Center that ensure a reliable \nsystem of intelligence sharing between local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement agencies.\n\n\n                     reverse commute pilot project\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to engage in a colloquy with my colleague, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, regarding a \nborder security need along our northern border. First, let me commend \nthe chairman for recognizing the many areas of our homeland defense \nthat are in need of funding and for providing that funding in this \neconomic stimulus package. I am especially encouraged to see a large \nborder security initiative that will finally address the lack of \nresources given to the northern border in the past to ensure the safety \nand integrity of our northern border without negatively impacting the \nfree flow of commerce.\n  While much has been done over the last decade to improve security on \nour border with Mexico, the northern border has largely been ignored. \nFor example, only 1,773 Customs Service personnel are present at our \nborder with Canada, while 8,300 protect our southern border. Similarly, \nwhile 8,000 Border Patrol agents monitor our 2,000 mile southern \nborder, only 300 are stationed at our 4,000 mile northern border. This \npolicy of neglect must be corrected without delay and I think the \nadditional funding you are recommending will do that.\n  One of the vulnerabilities which has come to light regarding our \ninternational bridges and tunnels on our border with Canada is that \npotentially dangerous vehicles are inspected only after they have \ncrossed into our country. With the increased security risks faced by \nour Nation in the post-September 11 climate, it seems obvious that \ninspecting vehicles for dangerous materials such as bombs or explosives \nafter they enter our tunnels or cross our bridges is ineffective, at \nbest.\n  To rectify this homeland security vulnerability, we must work with \nour neighbors to establish a reverse inspection program that would \ninspect vehicles before they have entered into our country. This would \nreduce the possibility that important transportation infrastructure \ncould be endangered or destroyed.\n  One way to move this process forward would be to establish a pilot \nprogram on reverse inspection. Customs could work in consultation and \npartnership with the Canadian Customs Service and identify any hurdles \nand the details that would need to be worked out. One logical place to \nstart would be in Southeast Michigan where 50 percent of the U.S.-\nCanada trade traverses the border, and where we have the Ambassador \nBridge and Detroit Windsor Tunnel, two of the busiest border crossings.\n  I would like to inquire of Chairman Byrd if he would agree that this \nis something the Customs Service should take a hard look at?\n  Mr. BYRD. I see no reason why the U.S. Customs Service should not \nlook\n\n[[Page S12671]]\n\nat the issue of reverse inspection and I would support their doing so.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nfirst offer my thanks to the servicemen and women serving our Nation in \nthe War on Terror. Their courage, sacrifice, and professionalism \nassures us of victory over our terrorist enemies, and is a testament to \nAmerica.\n  As the first stage of this war ends, a number of promising \ndevelopments have taken place. In Afghanistan many of our enemies have \nbeen routed. In Germany, Afghan political leaders have taken great \nsteps to secure peace and stability for the future of their nation. As \nwe ask the Afghan people to turn towards peace and democracy, it is our \nduty to help them. Otherwise we risk facing another similar crisis in \nthe future.\n  Tackling the job ahead in Afghanistan will require men and women of \nthe highest caliber. They must be equal parts warrior and statesman. \nFor it is these men and women who will help secure peace for this \ntroubled land and build the foundation for the future of democracy in \nAfghanistan. I speak of course of the soldiers and Marines of the Civil \nAffairs community.\n  As a former Civil Affairs commander, and Deputy Chief of the Office \nof Civil Affairs, I know first hand what a contribution these fine \nwarriors can make. They have made a positive impact on nearly every \ncontinent of the globe. In fact, during the last five years alone, over \n4,600 Civil Affairs personnel have utilized their expertise in securing \nthe peace and rebuilding the Balkans.\n  Civil Affairs soldiers are warriors of the finest sort. They train to \nfight and work for peace. Civil Affairs soldiers are experts in \nhumanitarian operations and institution building. Consequently, I can \nthink of no time when the role of Civil Affairs would be more crucial \nthan it will be in Afghanistan.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Department of \nDefense to take advantage of the unique skills that these men and women \npossess. Furthermore, we owe it to these men and women to equip them as \nwe do our finest soldiers and Marines in accordance with the gravity of \ntheir mission. If we do this I have no doubt that these soldiers will \nsucceed in any mission that comes their way.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I believe this bill provides the right balance of funding for the \nDepartment of Defense given the administration's efforts to reorganize \nand realign the missions and architecture of this pillar of our \nfreedom. I am particularly heartened that President Bush and Secretary \nRumsfeld are working hard to revitalize the Department. I am totally in \nsupport of their efforts and feel it is important that the \nadministration be allowed to determine the new force structure in light \nof our rapidly developing military posture at home and overseas.\n  While we can not fix 10 years of neglect overnight, this bill does \nmany things to help the Defense Department and the men and women who \nserve so proudly. In particular, I am very pleased that this \nappropriations bill fully funds an average 5 percent military pay \nraise. It also provides additional pay raises for military personnel in \nmiddle level ranks, thus helping the Department to retain these \nvaluable personnel. Again, this bill addresses the needs of the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines by reducing out of pocket costs \nfor housing from 15 percent in 2001 to 11.3 percent in 2002. I am also \nglad that we are trying to make our troops lives more stable by asking \nthe Department of Defense to develop a plan that reduces the number of \npermanent change of station moves for the military.\n  This year's defense starts us on the right road to fixing the \nmilitary's readiness, training, and depot support programs. It provides \nalmost $10 billion increase over fiscal year 2001 funding levels for \nthese critical programs. It also fully funds the Army Transformation \ninitiatives which I support wholeheartedly. Additionally, this bill \nenhances critical defense health programs such as breast and prostate \ncancer research and adequately funds TRICARE for life.\n  The fiscal year 2002 Defense bill has made a significant contribution \nto this Nation's intelligence-gathering capability by funding the \nSenior Scout Program which I have long supported. I also pleased that \nthe President's request for missile defense is supported in this bill. \nWe cannot ignore the threat that our Nation faces from enemies who each \nyear grow more and more capable of reaching our Nation with nuclear \nmissiles.\n  However, I am very disappointed about the funding reduction of $50 \nmillion for the D-5 Life Extension Program. This reduction means that \nsome of our submarines will carry outdated and possibly dangerous \ntrident missile systems.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the exceptional efforts of U.S. \nAir Force Major James R. Byrne, who has served me as a legislative \nfellow for the past year. Jim's command of the legislative process and \nhis ability to research complex legal questions have been exceptional. \nI want to recognize particularly Jim's outstanding counsel on homeland \ndefense issues including security preparation for the Olympics.\n  Major Jim Byrne is a true patriot, an officer, and a gentleman. I \nwant to thank him for his dedication and hard work, and to wish him \nwell on his new assignment as he departs the Senate for Germany. The \nstaff and I will miss him. I have every confidence, however, that he \nwill continue to serve our Nation with distinction.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the 2002 \nappropriations bill, particularly some key provisions that will help \nease the financial burdens of our men and women in the National Guard \nand support those on the front lines in the fight against terrorism.\n  The 2002 DOD appropriations bill provides $317 billion to our Armed \nForces. I think it is especially important that the bill provides a 5 \npercent across the board pay raise and targeted raises for skilled \npositions in the Armed Forces. I believe we must provide the best \npossible training, equipment, and preparation for our military forces, \nso they can effectively carry out whatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, \nwar-fighting, or other missions they are given. For many years running, \nthose in our armed forces have been suffering from a declining quality \nof life, despite rising Pentagon budgets. The pressing needs of our \ndedicated men and women in uniform, and those of their families, must \nbe addressed, especially as they continue to be mobilized for duty in \nresponse to the attacks of September 11th. It is because of this that I \nwant to take a second to discuss a very important provision for our \narmed forces included in this bill.\n  This bill includes a provision expanding the protections of the \nSoldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to National Guard personnel \nprotecting our Nation's airports and other vulnerable public \nfacilities. This act suspends certain civil obligations to enable \nservice members to devote full attention to duty. It protects our Armed \nForces from foreclosures, evictions, and installment contracts; \nreinstates any health insurance that may have been terminated during \nthe time of service, protects against cancellation of life insurance, \nand limits interest on debt to 6 percent.\n  It is my belief that the SSCRA was never meant to purposely exclude \nGuard called up by the Governor at the request of the President--as the \ncase of the Guard mobilized today. Passing this bill will provide the \nmen and women of the National Guard some financial security, and more \nimportantly, a little peace of mind.\n  Although I support this bill, I am against its provision of $8.3 \nbillion for missile defense. I oppose the plan to deploy a national \nmissile defense shield for many reasons. The crucial question is \nwhether a missile shield will make the United States more or less \nsecure. After studying the matter carefully, I have concluded that \ndeploying a missile shield is likely to make us less secure, and that \nwe would be better off using these funds to finance key antiterrorism \ninitiatives.\n  The new funding language in the bill allows the President to choose \nbetween missile defense research and development and combating \nterrorism. I believe that fighting terrorism should take priority over \nmissile defense, and should receive most or all of the new funding. I \nam hopeful that the President will choose that option. I would also \nlike to take a moment to talk about the importance of the money \nincluded in this bill to improve our\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\nhomeland security. We have some absolutely urgent national security \nneeds here at home and I thank my colleague from West Virginia for his \nleadership on this homeland security appropriation. Although I had \nhoped we could have provided more money for the important programs in \nthis package, and believe we must re-visit this issue again, I am \ngrateful for what was worked out and am hopeful that we will be able to \npass this bill quickly and get the funding in the communities where it \nbelongs.\n  We need to beef up our ability to anticipate future acts of \nterrorism. We need to better insure the safety of our borders. We need \nto ensure the safety of our transportation system and our energy \nfacilities. And we need to make sure that first responders to any \nfuture acts of terrorism have the resources and training they need to \nfully, adequately, and safely respond.\n  I won't go too much into the details of the homeland security \nappropriation but I would like to mention a few provisions. This \nappropriation has funding for: Health and Human Services for lab \nsecurity, disaster response, smallpox and anthrax vaccines; Department \nof Agriculture and FDA to hire food inspectors, improve lab security \nand expand lab facilities; aid state and local law enforcement \nagencies; FEMA firefighting grants; border security including funds for \nINS and Customs on the northern border.\n  This homeland security appropriation has money allocated for state \nand local law enforcement to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. \nThis is money that can be used for programs such as a local homeland \ndefense emergency reserve fund. Since September 11, support for local \npublic service and servants has never been more important. This type of \nfund would support local communities whose resources have been \nexhausted by our current national emergency posture. Specifically, this \nmoney could be used to create an emergency fund for counties and local \nentities to dip into when their local resources have been exhausted by \nextreme and unforeseen circumstances. In Minnesota, for example, county \nsheriffs provide additional security for nuclear power plants, water \ntreatment facilities, refineries, chemical and other facilities \nvulnerable to terrorist targets; but additional security costs were \nnever factored into local budgets. The extra costs of new hiring and \nstaff overtime have already taken their toll on Minnesota communities' \nlocal budgets and other unexpected costs are sure to arise in the \nfuture. This type of fund would provide much needed relief and adequate \neconomic security to our overtaxed communities.\n  The homeland security appropriation also has money for a FEMA \nFirefighters Grant Program. The FEMA Firefighters Grant Program \nprovides grants to state and local communities to expand and improve \nfirefighting programs. Over 50 percent of funding goes to volunteer \nfire departments in rural communities. In recent weeks, I have had the \nopportunity to meet with fire department officials and first responders \nthroughout the State of Minnesota. The one request that they have all \nmade to me is for additional support for training and equipment. We \nhave learned since the events of September 11 what a crucial role our \nfire departments play in all of our communities. The FEMA Fire Grant \nprogram is an efficient vehicle to get funding out to these departments \nto provide increased training and to purchase new equipment. Given that \nthe issues local fire departments now confront are national in nature, \nit is reasonable that the federal government provide these additional \nresources for training and new equipment.\n  The bill in front of us now also has money to enhance our border \nsecurity, particularly our northern border with Canada. Specifically, \nthe money will be used to increase the number of INS border patrol \nagents and INS facilities, to create a data base for monitoring foreign \nstudent visas, to increase Customs Service border patrol agents and \nfacilities, and for GSA facilities.\n  In Minnesota, the agencies protecting our borders--even in normal \ntimes--are understaffed. Given Sept. 11, the situation is now urgent. \nBorder patrol, INS and the Customs Service simply do not have the \ncapacity to do regular inspections as people come across the border and \nthen to follow-up after they enter the country. Some borders are only \nopen part-time in the summer--such as the border at Crane Lake. Borders \nsuch as these are basically wide-open. Some are even staffed via \ntelephone and video. For example, a person wanting to cross into the \nUnited States from Canada simply arrives and calls the Border Patrol to \nannounce ``we are here.'' Many border crossings do not even have a \nfacility and the checks are conducted outdoors. International Falls is \none place that although open full time, conducts much of its business \noutdoors.\n\n  When I first heard about the security situation on our northern \nborder I was absolutely amazed. The situation there demands immediate \nattention and even now I question if we are providing enough. The anti-\nterrorism legislation we passed earlier authorized money to triple the \nnumber of security agents on our northern border, the money is \nappropriated today will not make that a reality. But it is a good \nstart.\n  This homeland security appropriation also contains money that is \nessential for fighting bioterrorism. We need to improve our State and \nlocal public health capacity. There is widespread agreement that the \npublic health system has been underfunded for years. We need more \nlaboratories, more epidemiologist, more equipment. This appropriations \nbill provides money to do that. Many local public health departments \ndon't have e-mail capacity. Many don't even have fax capacity. In the \nevent of bioterrorism, good communication is an absolute necessity. \nThis appropriations bill helps made sure that communication can take \nplace.\n  The recent antrax attacks have shown us that early detection and \ntreatment saves lives. We learned that hospitals need help to be able \nto recognize the pathogens that may be used in a bioterrorist attack. \nThis appropriations bill provides that help. We learned that \nbioterrorism can have a powerful effect on the workplace. I have been \nadvocating that we work on identifying the best ways to maintain the \nsafety of our workers in the event of bioterrorism. I am pleased that \nthis bill provides money for training and education regarding effective \nworkplace responses to bioterrorism. We learned how important the CDC \nis for the security of all of us. This bill makes sure that they have \nthe money they need to do their job to protect us. This bill provides \nfunds to make sure there are adequate supplies of vaccines, antibiotics \nand other medicines necessary to protect all of us. These are not \noptional programs. They are an essential part of protecting the public \nhealth.\n  We have got to do a better job of addressing the needs of our most \nimportant assets in the fight against terrorism: our law enforcement, \nfirefighters, health care providers, and other first responders. We \nhave a long way to go but we have taken an important first step today \nwith this appropriations bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on this day in 1941. our Nation was \n``suddenly'' and ``deliberately'' attacked by an enemy who sought to \nconquer our homeland and destroy our way of life. Today marks the 60th \nanniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, a day which saw \n2,388 Americans perish and 1,178 wounded. Many though that American \nshores would never again be breeched by enemies, but that most tragic \nday in September visited sadness on our Nation again.\n  I would have liked to have been in the city of New Orleans today, as \nthe National D-Day Museum opens up a new wing dedicated to the war in \nthe Pacific. The D-Day museum is a fitting tribute to all of those who \nstormed the shores of foreign nations to ensure that future \ngenerations, would enjoy the fruits of liberty and democracy. The sneak \nattack on American Naval and Air Forces in Hawaii marked the end of a \ndistinct period in American history, and the beginning of another. In \nthe years that followed that fateful day, America help up the mantle of \nLiberty for all civilized and freedom loving people and she still does \ntoday.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senate amendment, \nwhich pays tribute to all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho gave the ultimate sacrifice to the Nation 60 years ago today at \nPearl Harbor. It also pays tribute to the American spirit that \ntriumphed over enemies in two\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\ntheaters of the world in the most horrible war man had ever known. This \namendment will also commemorate the opening of an institute dedicated \nto commemorating the unique and powerful spirit of America at the \nNational D-Day Museum in New Orleans.\n  Victory in the Second World War by the United States and her allies \nwill probably be known as one of the greatest achievements in all of \nhistory. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe \nis a testament to the uncommon valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. The years 1941-1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry which in large measure \ncontributed to our safety at home and supplied our fighting men on two \ndistant fronts. As the generation that faced this challenge takes its \nfinal lap, it is important that we take the time this day and every day \nto honor them for the many sacrifices they made. These men and women \ncan always be remembers in the promising words of President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt when he proclaimed in a 1942 fireside chat: ``We are going to \nwin the war, and we are going to win the peace that follows.'' It was \nthe gallantry of American troops abroad and the tireless devotion of \nworkers at home that made these words come true.\n  Though our Nation has seen war many time, the strength of American \ndemocracy has ensured that war is an aberration and not the norm in our \nsociety. The conflict we now face will put great strains upon our \nNation and will ask of us to sacrifice in unprecedented ways. In times \nof peace, it is the natural order that children live to bury their \nparents. War violates this National order. War causes parents to bury \nthose children who have been cut down in their prime by the arrows of \nconflict and discord. War makes young men and women widowers and widows \nlong before the proper time, and deprives our youth of parents to teach \nthem the wonders of life. This conflict has already deprived our nation \nof so many brave men and women, and many more will perish before it is \nconcluded.\n  Indeed, the valorous acts of veterans are normally remembered in \nbronze and stone on battlefields both at home and abroad. American \norators have been inspired by their deeds to utter words of uncommon \nelegance. Today in this Chamber and in many places across the Nation, \nthe events of Pearl Harbor will be remembered. But the greatest honor \nwe can give to our veterans is the unwritten memorial of memory, etched \nnot on stone but in the hearts of all who survive and gladly toil on \nliberty's behalf.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the fiscal \nyear 2002 Defense appropriations bill. I believe this bill reflects the \ndifficult times we face, both in the bill's priorities and in the \nspirit of bipartisanship in which it was crafted. I want to commend the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor their patience and hard work.\n  I believe this bill provides funding for the urgent needs of military \npersonnel who are risking their lives every day in this war against \nterrorism. It provides for a 5 percent increase in basic pay for all \nservice members and a targeted pay raise for midgrade officers and E-4 \nto E-9 enlisted personnel. It increases readiness accounts by $9.6 \nbillion to aid our soldiers and sailors carrying out Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Noble Eagle. In addition, while taking care of \nimmediate needs, this bill also considers the future, and provides \nfunding for the services' transformation.\n  One major transformation effort funded by this bill is the Navy's \nSSGN program. The President's budget request included a proposal to \nbegin converting two of the four Trident submarines that would \notherwise be retired under the Defense Department's plan to reduce the \nTrident ballistic missile submarine force from the current level of \neighteen boats to a new level of fourteen boats. This bill adds $193 \nmillion to accelerate the program and preserve the option for \nconverting all four boats.\n  These converted submarines will provide the Navy with next generation \ntechnology. In one scenario, the SSGN can be configured to carry as \nmany as 154 tomahawk missiles, more missiles in one vessel than are now \ncarried in an entire carrier battlegroup and almost as many tomahawks \nused in Operation Allied Force. During operations against Iraq and in \nKosovo, several submarines and surface ships were dedicated solely for \nmissile strikes. With the SSGN, one vessel would be dedicated for \nstrike operations and the remaining platforms would be freed up for \nother missions. In addition, this strike capacity would remain hidden \nso it would retain the element of surprise and be relatively \ninvulnerable to attack.\n  These converted submarines could also be configured to carry up to 66 \nspecial operations forces along with two advanced seal delivery systems \nor two drydock shelters. The ability to insert such a large number of \nspecial operations forces from a position of stealth would give the \nnavy an unmatched capability to conduct covert operations or prepare \nfor a larger landing force.\n  Operations in Afghanistan are revealing on a daily basis the need for \nthe invaluable tools that the SSGN can provide. I am pleased that this \nbill is providing this funding.\n  Now, I would like to address an area of the bill where I have \nconcerns. The recent events in Afghanistan and the reported attempts by \nOsama bin Laden to obtain chemical and biological weapons, and nuclear \nweapons materials and technology, including plutonium and highly \nenriched uranium, have increased the importance of the Nunn-Lugar \nprograms at the Department of Defense and the related programs at the \nDepartment of Energy. These programs account for, secure and destroy \nweapons of mass destruction and supporting materials in Russia and the \nstates of the former Soviet Union. I believe there is general consensus \nthat these programs should not only be accelerated but that they should \nalso be expanded.\n  As a result, I was surprised and disappointed when I saw that the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program at the Department of \nDefense was cut in the Defense appropriations bill by $46 million. This \ncut is particularly troublesome because the fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequest for this program had already been reduced by $49 million by the \nadministration. With this additional cut to Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction program the program is $85 million below the fiscal \nyear 2001 funding level. This is a 19 percent reduction in this \nimportant program, a program which after September 11, is even more \nimportant.\n  I want to note that the additional supplemental funding that has been \nproposed would increase the funding for the companion programs at the \nDepartment of Energy, which I fully support, but there is no additional \nmoney for the Nunn- Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs at the \nDepartment of Defense in the proposed supplemental funding.\n  I hope the funds for the Nunn-Lugar programs can be restored at least \nto the budget request level of $403 million before deliberations on \nthis bill are concluded .\n  I would also like to take a few minutes to discuss the funding for \nballistic missile defense. Before September 11, ballistic missile \ndefense was the administration's top priority. Today, despite weeks of \nevidence of other pressing needs and vulnerabilities that must be \naddressed, ballistic missile defense seems to still be the \nadministration's top national security priority.\n  In its July budget submission, the administration requested a \nstaggering $8.3 billion for ballistic missile defense, a 57 percent \nincrease from last year's funding level. The consensus of the \nDemocratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee was that of \nthe $8.3 billion proposed for missile defense, $1.3 billion was ill-\nconsidered, and could best be spent elsewhere, for example on counter-\nterrorism programs. This is consistent with the report of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, which also recommended a $1.3 billion \nreduction for missile defense.\n  I find it interesting that today many of my colleagues opposed the \nhomeland security provisions in this bill, stating there it was unwise \nto allocate additional funds despite the obvious needs. Yet, there is \nstill support for a 57 percent increase in the ballistic missile \ndefense accounts when the program addresses a remote threat and is in \nsome respects overfunded.\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\n  Even if we had a working missile defense system, such a system could \nnot have defended us from the attacks on the World Trade Center, nor \nthe anthrax attacks, nor any of the other potential threats we face \nfrom worldwide terrorist networks.\n  The fact is that terrorist networks do not have ballistic missiles, \nlet alone missiles capable of reaching the United States. A ballistic \nmissile leaves an easily detectable ``return address'' against which \nthe United States could immediately and devastatingly retaliate. Such a \nweapon is not appropriate for terrorists who operate in shadows and in \ncaves, eluding and evading detection. Furthermore, what nation would \nallow a terrorist organization to launch a ballistic missile from its \nsoil, knowing that it would mean certain destruction for that Nation?\n  Taking into account recent events, this appropriation bill places \nballistic missile defense into a larger context and takes $1.3 billion \nof the $8.3 billion budgeted for missile defense and allocates it for \nmissile defense and/or counterterrorism programs, whichever the \nPresident decides is in the best interest of national security. This \nprovision is consistent with the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization bill previously passed by the Senate.\n  Given the seriousness of the terrorist attacks on our country, and \nthe continuing alerts of possible additional terrorist attacks, I urge \nPresident Bush to spend that $1.3 billion on counterterrorism programs. \nIn the months following September 11, the nation has come to recognize \njust how vulnerable we are to the scourge of terrorism, and now many \nresources are needed to bolster our security. By contrast, if President \nBush chooses to spend the $1.3 billion on missile defense, he will not \nbe addressing the most likely and imminent threats we face, and he will \nnot be furthering the cause of missile defense, either. That is because \nthe $1.3 billion reduction approved by the Appropriations Committee is \nfor activities that are ill-considered and poorly justified.\n\n  Four simple principles ought to apply to missile defense programs, or \nany other development program for that matter.\n  First, avoid deploying equipment that has not been thoroughly tested. \nWe should know the equipment works prior to giving it to our soldiers.\n  Second, do not fund activities that cannot be executed. This simply \nwastes scarce resources.\n  Third, avoid excessive funding for non-specific activities without a \nfirm justification or plan of how to spend the funding.\n  And finally, avoid undue program growth rates--programs that have \nbeen moving along well should not be drastically accelerated without \njustification.\n  The administration proposed spending over $200 million to procure 10 \nuntested missiles and an untested radar for the THAAD theater missile \ndefense system. The administration also proposed spending another $100 \nmillion to buy untested missiles for the Navy Theater-Wide system. \nThese missiles would, if funded, permit the administration to claim \n``contingency deployments'' for these systems by 2004, long before the \nsystems are fully developed, tested and demonstrated to work \neffectively.\n  Deploying systems that are not fully developed and tested is not the \nbest way to get an effective missile defense capability for our nation, \nnor is it a wise way to spend our defense dollars. To do this would be \nto invite what retired Air Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welch \ncalled a ``rush to failure,'' which we have previously experienced in \nmissile defense programs, most notably in the THAAD program a few short \nyears ago. We should not head down that road again. It leads to delays, \ncost overruns and program failure.\n  The administration's desire for ``contingency deployments'' is \nparticularly puzzling since the administration itself has spoken out on \nthe risks of such deployments. Lieutenant General Ronald Kadish, the \nDirector of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, stated in his \ntestimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``emergency \ndeployments are disruptive and can set back normal development programs \nby years.'' Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz provided similar \ntestimony to the committee.\n  The funding reductions for missile defense recommended by Senate \nAppropriations Committee would eliminate funding for ``contingency \ndeployments'' of untested systems, freeing the funding for the fight \nagainst terrorism. I hope President Bush chooses to provide these funds \nfor counter-terrorism rather than for ``contingency deployments'' of \nunproven missile defense systems.\n  Hundreds of millions more dollars were in the administration's \nrequest to accelerate missile defense programs that are not yet fully \ndesigned, and for testing of programs that haven't even been fully \nconceived. For example, the budget request included $50 million for \ndevelopment and testing of a sea-based boost program. However, the \ndesign of a sea-based boost system does not yet exist, and it is \nunreasonable to request funding to test a nonexistent system. The \nAppropriations Committee substantially reduced funding for this \nactivity, to a level more appropriate to a program still in its \nconceptual stage. I strongly support this reduction.\n  The administration unduly accelerated a number of programs that are \nnot ready for acceleration, thereby putting hundreds of millions of \ndollars at risk of being wasted on programs that will have to be \nreworked later. A prime example of this is the SBIRS-Low program, a \nvery complex program of satellites intended to track missile targets by \ndetecting the heat they emit while in space. Not only is this a very \nchallenging mission, but the program has undergone substantial cost \ngrowth recently--the current cost estimate for the program now stands \nat over $20 billion. A few years ago the cost of three SBIRS-Low \nprototype satellites grew so high that the prototypes were canceled \noutright.\n  Substantial cost growth is indicative of programmatic problems which \nshould be resolved before spending more on the program. Options to the \ncurrent plan should be considered and weighed. Yet the administration \nhas proposed over $380 million for SBIRS-Low in 2002, a 60 percent \nincrease over last year's funding level. Such a huge funding increase \nis not appropriate. The Appropriations Committee recommended a \nreduction of $120 million for SBIRS-Low, and I think this reduction is \nvery wise.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has given the President of the \nUnited States a very important choice to make. Following the lead of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, the Appropriations Committee has \nrecommended $1.3 billion of funding reductions for missile defense. \nThese reductions are not based on ideology or partisanship. They are \nbased on an objective technical assessment of each missile defense \nprogram, and are consistent with the four principles I outlined \nearlier.\n  Even with these reductions, the administration would still receive \n$7.0 billion for missile defense, 40 percent more funding than last \nyear. By comparison, the Department of Defense only proposed $650 \nmillion for research in chemical and biological defense, a mere 16 \npercent more than last year.\n  The President can choose to spend the $1.3 billion the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has offered him on the real threats the nation \nis facing today--on combating terrorism. Or he can choose instead to \nspend that money on unwise, ill-justified ballistic missile defense \nprograms that will not increase our Nation's security. I urge him to \nchoose counter-terrorism.\n  This bill was drafted in trying times. It had to be immensely \ndifficult to discern which of the innumerable pressing needs should \nreceive scarce resources. I believe this appropriations bill strikes \nthe proper balance and will provide our fighting men and women with \nwhat they need for victory. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, dislocated workers in Minnesota and \nthroughout America need assistance now. The Nation's unemployment rate \ntook another big leap upward in November, to 5.7 percent, the highest \nlevel in 6 years. An additional 331,000 Americans lost their jobs last \nmonth.\n  For these families, there is no time to waste. As many of us worry \nabout what to buy our loved ones for the holidays, unemployed workers \nare worrying about how to provide for their families. Unemployment \nbenefits are\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nrunning out and savings are being depleted. Laid-off workers are left \nworrying about how they will pay for the basic necessities of life; \nhousing, clothing, food, and health insurance for their families.\n  In Minnesota, the Department of Economic Security reported the number \nof applications for unemployment benefits increased nearly 24 percent \nthis November compared to November of last year. Today there are 55,000 \nworkers receiving unemployment assistance in Minnesota, with an \nadditional 55,000 unemployed who receive no unemployment assistance.\n  As the State of Minnesota faces a budget deficit of almost $2 \nbillion, the problem is only getting worse. Today, Minneapolis-based \nSun Country Airlines announced that it will immediately lay off 900 \nemployees. This underscores the immediate need for Congress to help \nAmerica's financially pressed unemployed now.\n  We must extend unemployment insurance for laid-off workers, putting \nmoney into the hands of dislocated workers and their families. These \nare the people most likely to immediately spend any additional funds \nthey receive. This spending on necessary goods and services will not \nonly help these families make it through tough times, they will help \nspur our economy. Workers need assistance now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Stevens, and Senator Inouye, for their leadership on this \nimportant proposal. In particular, their proposal provides the \nresources that are urgently needed to begin to address the challenge of \nbioterrorism.\n  Our public health and medical professionals at the State and local \nlevels will be on the joint lines in any bioterrorist attack. The \nlegislation that Senator Frist and I introduced recognizes the \nimportance of strengthening preparedness at the State and local levels. \nThe Byrd-Stevens-Inouye proposal provides over $1 billion to begin to \nprepare our health defenses against bioterrorism.\n  The proposal provides the resources needed to enhance the ability of \nCDC to respond effectively to bioterrorism. By investing $165 million \nin new laboratories at CDC, the proposal will allow the disease \ndetectives at CDC to identify dangerous pathogens accurately and \nrapidly.\n  The proposal will expand stockpiles of pharmaceuticals and medical \nsupplies that will be needed to protect Americans in a bioterrorist \nattack. It will allow work to begin immediately on production of new \nsmallpox vaccine.\n  The bipartisan proposal will enhance the safety of the food supply by \nproviding the resources needed to train more food inspectors and \nconduct research on biological threats against American agriculture.\n  The Byrd-Stevens-Inouye proposal takes the first important steps in \npreparing the nation for bioterrorism. We should support this proposal \nand do all we can to see that our national investment in bioterrorism \npreparedness is sustained in the years to come.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd for his \nextraordinary leadership in putting together a plan that addresses \nAmerica's most urgent homeland defense needs. I also thank him for his \ntremendous eloquence, which has helped all of us, and all of America, \nunderstand the critical importance of strengthening our homeland \nsecurity.\n  I also thank Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens for their persistence \nin making sure we didn't leave here before we acted to protect \nAmericans at home and abroad. Thanks to our colleagues, Senators \nSchumer and Clinton, for making sure this agreement helps keep \ncommitment we made to stand with the people of New York as they recover \nfrom September 11. And, as always, I thank my friend, the assistant \nmajority leader. Once again, Harry Reid's patience and his mastery of \npolitics, policy, and process have enabled us to find a principled, \nbipartisan compromise.\n  Sixty years ago, America was attacked at Pearl Harbor. After Pearl \nHarbor, Americans instantly and instinctively came together to protect \nour nation. Together, we defeated a mighty enemy. Nearly 3 months ago, \nAmerica was again attacked on our soil by a foreign enemy. It was the \nfirst time since Pearl Harbor.\n  Now we must decide. Will we do what that earlier generation did? Are \nwe willing, in this Congress, to put aside our party's agendas, and \nperhaps our personal agendas, and do what it takes to protect our \nNation.\n  It had seemed that the answer to that question was clear. After \nSeptember 11, Congress and the President worked together to respond \nquickly to the terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat. We expressed \nour strong support for the President's leadership in the war on \nterrorism, and authorized the use of force in the war. We worked \ntogether to keep the airlines flying, and to make America's airports \nsafer. We made a commitment to the Pentagon, and to the people of New \nYork and Pennsylvania, that we would help them rebuild and recover from \nthe horrific attacks of September 11. We did all of those things with \nstrong, bipartisan agreement. We had hoped that support for \nstrengthening America's homeland security would be just as broad.\n  Clearly, the need is just as urgent. Yesterday, we learned that the \nPresident is preparing his own homeland security package that he \nintends to send Congress next year. The President's plan reportedly \nwill cost $20 billion--nearly three times what is our plan. We also \nknow that, after Congress authorized $20 billion to strengthen homeland \nsecurity and help communities recover from the terrorist attacks, the \nPresident's own agencies submitted to the White House requests totaling \nmore than $200 billion for homeland security alone. The President's own \nCabinet members identified $200 billion in domestic security needs they \nsaid urgently needed to be addressed to prevent future terrorist \nattacks.\n  So we all understand that the need is great, and urgent. We also \nunderstand, on our side, that the Senate can only act when there is \nbroad support. So, we will support this bipartisan agreement. The \namount is different than our plan, but the priorities are the same.\n  We said there must be more money to fight bioterrorism. This \nagreement includes more money for bioterrorism. We said there has to be \nmore money to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or the \nmaterials to build them. This agreement includes more money to do just \nthat. We said we must keep our word to New York. This package does \nthat. It doesn't meet all of America's homeland security needs. It \ndoesn't even meet all of our most urgent homeland security needs. But \nit is better than the inadequate proposal we started out with. It is a \ndownpayment on a stronger, more secure America. In that regard, it is \nat least a partial victory for the American people. For that reason, I \nintend to support it, and I hope my colleagues will as well.\n  When this debate began, Democrats proposed a $20 billion homeland \nsecurity package as part of a larger economic recovery plan. We believe \nstrongly that was the right thing to do. After all, if we want people \nto get back on planes, and go on with their business and their lives, \nthey need to know they are safe. But our Republican colleagues refused \nto even talk about homeland security as long as it was part of an \neconomic recovery plan. So we agreed to take homeland security out of \nour economic plan. Then, the other side said $20 billion is too much \nfor homeland security. So we cut $5 billion from our proposal. They \nsaid even that was too much. So we cut our proposal in half--to $7.5 \nbillion.\n  Again and again, we have made principled compromises in an effort to \nreach a bipartisan solution. Now we are accepting even further \nreductions in size of the package--in exchange for a commitment from \nour Republican friends that they will support more money for \nbioterrorism and other urgent homeland security needs. We want to \ncaution our friends, however. We will not compromise our principles. We \nwill not compromise the safety of the American people. We expect to see \nthese commitments in the final conference report. We do not want a plan \nthat sells our homeland security short.\n  Sixty years ago today, more than 4,000 American sailors and soldiers \nwere killed at Pearl Harbor. Three months ago next week, more than \n4,000 innocent civilians were killed in New York, at the Pentagon, and \nin Pennsylvania. The attacks of September 11 revealed, in a horrific \nway, some of the gaps in our homeland defense. With\n\n[[Page S12676]]\n\nthis vote, we are taking an important first step toward closing some of \nthe most dangerous gaps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments, the \nquestion is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading of \nthe bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 3338), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, with no intervening action or debate.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Hollings, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Reid, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bond, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gregg, \nand Mrs. Hutchison conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Hawaii and \ncongratulate him and his staff for doing such a marvelous job on a very \ncomplex bill in such a short period of time. It is a pleasure to work \nwith him. I also include in that thanks to Steve Cortese, our chief of \nstaff, and the staff working with him. It is a very complex bill. It is \nmy hope we will bring this bill back to the Senate by early next week \nfor final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this has been a long day. I wish to thank \nall of my colleagues for their patience and their cooperation. The \nmeasure that we have just adopted, I have been told, is the most \nexpensive appropriations bill ever adopted by the U.S. Senate.\n  I wish to thank the staff, Mr. Charles Houy and his team. Without Mr. \nHouy and Mr. Steve Cortese, we would not be here at this moment. We \nthank them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want everyone to know, Senator Daschle \nsaid we would finish the bill today, and we did it, with a minute's \ngrace.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of \ndetecting biological agents that could be used in malicious attacks \nagainst our Nation's agricultural industry.\n  Last month, I introduced S. 1560, the Biological Agent-Environmental \nDetection Act of 2001, which calls for the development of new \ntechnologies to detect disease agents that can be used as terrorist \nweapons against humans.\n  I am drafting legislation to address concerns about agricultural \nsecurity that will complement the provisions in S. 1715, the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001, which I have cosponsored.\n  We have heard testimony in hearings before the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal \nServices illustrating the vulnerability of American agriculture to acts \nof biological terrorism directed against livestock and crops, commonly \nknown as ``agroterrorism.''\n  Any agroterrorist attacks could have a profound effect on the overall \nAmerican economy. The combined cash receipts for crops, livestock, and \npoultry in the United States reached nearly $200 billion last year, or \n2 percent of our gross domestic product. An agroterrorist attack would \nalso create a ripple effect on businesses that rely on American \nagricultural products, especially grocery stores and restaurants.\n  For example, agroterrorist attacks could reach across the \nagricultural industry of Hawaii, which had $521 million in revenues \nlast year. Our livestock could be attacked with viral agents such as \nfoot and mouth disease. In Hawaii, this would affect the price and \navailability of beef, pork, and dairy products. 51,000 cattle and \n26,000 hogs were brought to market and slaughtered in Hawaii last year, \nwhile 90 million gallons of milk were produced by the Hawaiian dairy \nindustry. Our $100 million pineapple industry could be attacked with a \nnematode pest that causes an estimated 40-percent loss of crop in the \nfirst year of infection, and 80- to 100-percent losses in subsequent \ncrops. Hawaii's growing agricultural tourism industry was worth $26 \nmillion in 2000, and any attacks on Hawaiian agriculture would also \nimpact those revenues.\n  However, the impact of terrorist attacks against American agriculture \nwould not be measured in economic terms alone. A significant loss of \nagricultural production would also affect the health and welfare of our \nnation's citizens, not to mention hundreds of millions of men, women, \nand children around the globe who depend on American agricultural \nproduction for some part of their daily meals.\n  My colleagues are aware of the recent completion of the Human Genome \nProject to map the basic genetic information contained in human \nchromosomes. This vast undertaking involved the sequencing of over \nthree billion base pairs of genetic information.\n  The diseases that attack crops and livestock are caused primarily by \nbacteria, fungi, and viruses. Each of these microorganisms has its own \nminiature genome that can be sequenced with a fraction of the effort \ninvolved in the Human Genome Project. For example, only last month, \nscientists at the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute \nsequenced the genomes of 15 bacterial species, including plant and \nhuman pathogens.\n  In many cases, we still seek to understand the most rudimentary \nfeatures of disease-causing microorganisms, regardless of whether they \ninfect humans, livestock, or plants. By sequencing the DNA of select \nagricultural diseases agents, we can develop diagnostic tests to \nrapidly identify agricultural diseases; we gain fundamental information \nabout how each disease is caused; and we learn how to mitigate or \nprevent the negative effects of diseases that infect crops and \nlivestock.\n  By preparing to detect the intentional spread of disease through \nbioterrorist attacks on America's agriculture, we are also protecting \nAmerican crops and livestock from the accidental or natural spread of \ndiseases. With rapid diagnostic tests based on genomic information, we \ncan avoid the spread of such diseases as the papaya ringspot virus, \nwhich is carried by aphids throughout infected orchards in Hawaii. \nHowever, Hawaii's agricultural system clearly is not the only industry \nthat would benefit from pathogen detection systems. The fungal pathogen \nFusarium, which infects many Hawaiian crops, including sugarcane, \nginger, and banana, also attacks watermelons in Texas, potatoes in \nIdaho, and tomatoes in Ohio.\n  I commend my colleagues for their efforts to protect our urban areas \nfrom further bioterrorist attacks. However, let's not forget \nagricultural America. We must support the development of rapid \ndetection methods that are based on genomic information from disease\n\n[[Page S12677]]\n\nagents that could be used in bioterrorist attacks against American \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12677-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 16, \n1995 in Seattle, WA.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge an anonymous Senate \ncolleague to lift his or her hold that has been placed on critical \nlegislation for America's veterans.\n  As you are aware, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee approved \nimportant legislation in October that will make significant \nimprovements to the Montgomery GI Bill, expand benefits for Persian \nGulf War veterans, and enhance the VA Home Loan program. The Senate \nmust act on the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2001 before the \nend of this legislative session.\n  I have advocated updating education benefits for veterans and \nintroduced comprehensive legislation with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) \nat the beginning of the year to bring Montgomery GI Bill benefits in \nline with the rising costs of higher education. The Veterans' Benefits \nImprovement Act represents an important first step in ultimately \nrestoring the effectiveness of the Montgomery GI Bill as a tool in the \nrecruitment and retention of the best and brightest in our armed \nforces.\n  Unfortunately, an anonymous member of the Senate is preventing \nveterans from receiving these expanded educational benefits.\n  I am equally disappointed that this anonymous hold is threatening our \nability to increase the VA home loan guaranty in order to keep pace \nwith FHA loan guaranties and extend housing loan guaranties for members \nof the Selected Reserve.\n  Finally, I find it disturbing that during a time of war an anonymous \nmember of Congress is willing to halt legislation that would help \nPersian Gulf War veterans with service-connected disabilities and \nVietnam Veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The Veterans' Benefits \nImprovement Act rectifies several oversights for these brave men and \nwomen who served their country while also illustrating to members of \nthe Armed Forces that our country keeps its promises to our veterans.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) recently wrote Senate Minority \nLeader Trent Lott (R-MS) and urged him to prevail upon his colleagues \nto release the anonymous hold on this bill. The VFW correctly points \nout that with American servicemen and women currently in harms way, \nthere is no justification for blocking action on legislation that \nrecognizes veterans' service to our nation. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave a copy of the VFW's letter printed in the Congressional Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  I urge all Senators to help expedite passage of this important \nlegislation and look forward to continue working with my colleagues on \nveterans legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the 2.7 million members of \n     the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary, I urge \n     you, as Senate Majority Leader, to prevail upon one of your \n     Republican colleagues to release an anonymous hold he has \n     placed on a piece of legislation of great importance to our \n     nation's veterans.\n       This bill, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2001, \n     would significantly benefit the men and women who have served \n     in our Armed Forces as well as those serving today and \n     tomorrow.\n       It is our understanding that the Senator who is blocking \n     action on this bill is concerned that, along with a number of \n     other important provisions, it would authorize too much money \n     on enhancements to the Montgomery GI Bill. We are \n     disappointed and angered that this individual would single \n     handedly prevent a vote on this much needed legislation, \n     particularly for the sake of preventing an essential increase \n     in a educational benefit for veterans.\n       With American servicemen and women on guard at home and \n     standing in harms way abroad, we assert that there is no \n     justification for blocking action on legislation that \n     appropriately recognizes and rewards their very special \n     service to the nation.\n       This measure is much needed and enjoys strong support in \n     both the House and Senate. It is time that it be brought up \n     and voted upon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E. Wallace,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12677-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF JENNY OGLE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. \nJenny Ogle, who is retiring at the end of this month after 23 years of \nservice to the citizens of Ohio and the United States of America.\n  Many of my colleagues might not realize this but Senator Mike DeWine \nand I have one of the few joint casework operations in the Senate. \nShortly after I was elected, Senator DeWine graciously offered to \ncombine our casework services in an effort to better serve our \nconstituents in Ohio by avoiding duplication of effort and by saving \nmoney on staff and office expenses.\n  To head up this office, Mike and I asked Jenny Ogle, who had been \nMike's own Director of Constituent Services since 1995, and who had \nbeen a caseworker for Mike from 1982 to 1989 when he was in the House \nof Representatives. In the interim years, while Mike was serving as my \nLieutenant Governor, Jenny brought her experience to Congressman Dave \nHobson, where she served as casework manager.\n  I knew that Senator DeWine and I were asking a lot of Jenny to run \nthis new one-stop operation, but I was confident, given the great work \nthat she had done for Mike and for Dave, that she could handle the load \nand do it well.\n  And I was right. For the past 3 years Jenny has been our Director of \nConstituent Services, and has done an excellent job in ensuring that \nall our casework is handled properly and in a timely manner.\n  One of the things that I have come to respect about Jenny is her \nleadership and interpersonal skills and her ability to reach out and \nmake a difference in the lives of so many people. In fact, she could \nprobably write a book based on the cases she handled personally as well \nas the cases she ``quarterbacked'' as Constituent Services Director. \nJenny has a unique ability to bring out the best in herself, but more \nimportant, she has a real talent for bringing out the best in her \nstaff.\n  I have often said that the most important work that my office does is \noutreach to my fellow Ohioans, and in terms of outreach and getting \nthings done for the people of Ohio, Jenny has had a major impact. She \ncan rest assured that her accomplishments are appreciated by me and my \nentire staff and her influence will continue to be felt for many years \nto come.\n  I will genuinely miss Jenny's service because she is a consummate \nprofessional. Throughout her career in constituent services in both the \nHouse and Senate, Jenny has dedicated herself to helping solve the \nproblems of tens of thousands of Ohioans, many of whom have had nowhere \nelse to turn. She is one of those rare individuals who can honestly say \nthat they have made a difference in the lives of their fellow man.\n  I am proud of what she has been able to accomplish, and I know that \nher family is just as proud of her, if not more so. I thank Jenny for \nher service, and I wish her and her husband, Mike, a happy and healthy \nretirement together.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12678-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12678]]\n                        PRESIDENT HARRY S TRUMAN\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, as you know, the Senate seat I \ncurrently hold was previously occupied by a distinguished man from \nIndependence, MO, President Harry S Truman. So it is with great \nenthusiasm and pride that I take this opportunity to recognize the \nGrand Rededication of the Harry S Truman Presidential Museum and \nLibrary on December 9, 2001.\n  This weekend, the Truman Museum and Library will open a remarkable \nnew permanent exhibit, ``Harry S Truman: The Presidential Years.'' This \ncompelling installation provides current and future generations with an \ninteractive experience that allows them to fully immerse themselves in \nthe Truman Presidency. Visitors will feel the pressure on Truman and \nhis administration during the formative post-World War II years as \nPresident Truman and his advisors debated crucial decisions, such as \nuse of the atomic bomb and recognition of the state of Israel. Those \ndecisions continue to shape the world we now live in. This exhibit \ncomes after the addition of the new White House Decision Center, which \nopened in October. The White House Decision Center is a replica of the \nWest Wing and provides students with the opportunity to take on the \nrole of President Truman or of his advisors during the Truman \nPresidency.\n  Since its opening in 1957, the Truman Museum and Library has remained \ntrue to the wishes of President Truman, who felt his papers should be \nthe property of the people and accessible to them. With this directive \nin mind, the Truman Museum and Library house and preserve White House \nfiles as well as papers that document President Truman's life and \ncareer. These new projects are just the latest innovative exhibits, \nseminars, and public programs that have engaged and educated the public \nfor over 40 years.\n  I commend all who have made this renovation and grand rededication \npossible, particularly the staff at the Truman Museum and Library. \nTheir remarkable work and dedication to public service exemplify the \nintegrity that Harry S Truman brought to the office of the Presidency. \nEach day as I represent the people of Missouri in the United States \nSenate, I am humbled by the honor to succeed this great man and \nMissouri's own, Harry S Truman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12678-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FATHER MYCHAL F. JUDGE\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the \nfollowing statement, which I was honored to deliver at the funeral mass \nfor Father Mychal F. Judge in New York City on September 15, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Mass of Christian \n   Burial for Father Mychal F. Judge, O.F.M., Chaplain for the Fire \n    Department of New York City, Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, \n                      Saturday, September 15, 2001\n\n       Your Eminence, members of Father Mike's family, especially \n     his sisters Erin and Dympna, his nieces and nephews, members \n     of his beloved Franciscan community:\n       Father Mike left us one last earthly gift with Father \n     Duffy's homily. That will long be remembered for its \n     humanity, its love, and its humor.\n       My husband and I first heard of Father Mike during the \n     White House years. We kept hearing about this charismatic \n     Franciscan who ministered to the homeless, to AIDS victims, \n     to immigrants, with perhaps a special touch for Irish \n     immigrants and who loved his firefighters. So we invited him \n     to the White House for our annual prayer breakfast, and \n     because I was so intrigued by everything I had heard about \n     him, and because I knew that in a big event like that I might \n     not get much time to spend with him, I took the hostess' \n     prerogative and put him at my table. What a beacon of light. \n     He lit up the White House as he lit up every place he ever \n     found himself.\n       We had just purchased our home here in New York so, of \n     course, we first spoke about his love for this city, and he \n     told me the stories of growing up and shining shoes and \n     exploring on his own. And we talked about what drew him to \n     become the chaplain for the fire department and how grateful \n     he was because he felt, as you know so well, that it was a \n     mission he'd been called to do.\n       On Tuesday, when the worst of evil struck our city, I was \n     heading toward my office at the Senate, and I heard first of \n     the crash into the tower and, like so many people, thought it \n     must have been a terrible accident and, shortly thereafter, \n     the second. As I frantically began making phone calls, we \n     were evacuated because of the third crash into the Pentagon. \n     I called the Mayor and the Governor and the President. And I \n     think for so many people in those initial hours it was \n     unimaginable except for those of you and your comrades who \n     were there in the midst of it. And then I was called and told \n     that Father Mychal Judge had died doing what he was called to \n     do, and all of a sudden the enormity of the tragedy became \n     very personal.\n       It will take a very long time before any of us can even \n     find the words to express what this cowardly evil act meant \n     and did to people we knew and loved, to our city and to our \n     country. But as a Christian, I think often of another \n     terrible day, a Friday of despair, darkness and death, a \n     Friday that left behind so much pain and hopelessness and yet \n     Sunday was coming and Sunday did come.\n       As we continue the work of rescue, recovery, rebuilding, \n     reconstruction, we have to remember the spirit, the life, and \n     the love that Father Mike left us. Pulling us one to the \n     other, giving us strength where it seems hard to imagine it \n     could ever come again. And being resolute in our commitment \n     to do everything we can to ensure that not one person that \n     lost his or her life on our Tuesday of death and darkness \n     will have died in vain.\n       So thank you Father Judge. Father, you gave us so many \n     gifts when you were alive. Gifts of laughter and love. \n     Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, and you came \n     to us. And now you've gone ahead, but you will never be \n     forgotten, and we are grateful for the blessings of your \n     life. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12678-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12678-S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING WILBUR FAISS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, recent weeks, one of Nevada's leading \nfamilies, the Faiss Family, has marked important milestones. The \npatriarch, Wilbur Faiss, observed his 90th birthday and the matriarch, \nTheresa Faiss, observed her 86th birthday. In doing so, they and their \nchildren and grandchildren could reflect on 57 years of contributions \nto the growth and success of Nevada.\n  Wilbur and Theresa Faiss and their three sons, Bob, Don, and Ron, \narrived in North Las Vegas, NV, in 1944. North Las Vegas then was an \nunincorporated city. Wilbur opened a small business and devoted a great \ndeal of his time to his community, including service as a volunteer \nfirefighter.\n  Wilbur became one of the first workers at the Nevada Test Site in the \n1950s. He later retired from work as a member of the Teamsters Union on \nthe Las Vegas Strip.\n  Upon retirement at the age of 65, when many of us might think of \nslowing down a bit, Wilbur answered the call of his constituents to \nbecome a Democratic candidate for the Nevada State Senate. He won that \nfirst effort for public office by one of the highest margins in the \nState.\n  Wilbur served two distinguished terms in the Nevada Senate, giving \npriority to the areas of working men and women, senior citizens, \neducation, civil rights, and protection of the environments.\n  Theresa's achievements were recognized in 1996, when she was selected \nas Clark County's Pioneer Mother of the Year. Of Theresa it was written \nthat she ``has not won any public honors or held any office, but she \nheld her family together through adversity and provided her sons a \nmodel of caring, support, hard work, sacrifice, commitment, integrity \nand compassion.''\n  Their sons have followed the example of their parents.\n  Bob Faiss is a senior member of Nevada's largest law firm, Lionel \nSawyer & Collins. Prior to joining his firm, Bob served as Executive \nAssistant to Governor Grant Sawyer of Nevada and staff assistant to \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House. The National Law \nJournal in 1997 named him one of ``The 100 Most Influential Lawyers in \nAmerica.''\n  Don Faiss recently retired as an executive of Bally's Resort in Las \nVegas, formerly the MGM Grand Hotel. Among his public contributions was \nservice as a member of the Clark County School Board.\n  Ron Faiss recently retired as General Manager of the Horseshoe Hotel/\nCasino in Las Vegas, after 30 years of involvement in the spectacular \ngrowth of the Nevada gaming industry.\n  The Faiss grandchildren are also making their ways as responsible and \nproductive citizens, as follows: Mitch Faiss is the co-founder of a \nleading electrical contracting company in Gardnerville, NV; Michael \nFaiss, after\n\n[[Page S12679]]\n\nmany years as manager for a chain of restaurants, has joined his \nbrother Mitch in the electrical contracting business; Philip Faiss is a \nmember of the staff of a major museum in Southern California; Marceline \nFaiss Ayres is an educator in Northampton, MA; and Justin Chambers is a \nmember of the news staff of KTNV--Channel 13 in Las Vegas.\n  Wilbur and Theresa Faiss are in good health and continue to be \nactive. It is fitting to wish them happy birthdays and a happy, \nrewarding and secure future.\n  Mr. President, Nevada is a much better place because of the Faiss \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12679-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JOAN DOUGLAS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Joan \nDouglas who will celebrate here retirement later this month after many \nyears of dedicated service to the citizens of Ohio and the United \nStates of America.\n  For the past 12 years, Joan has been an integral part of my team, \nfrom my earliest days on the campaign trail when I was running for \nGovernor of Ohio, to my current service in the U.S. Senate. Not only \nhas Joan been a valued employee, she has been a friend to me and my \nwife, Janet.\n  One of the things that I admire about Joan is her passion for public \nservice, for it is something that both of us share. Just like I once \ndid, Joan served in the Ohio Legislature, and she has also given back \nto her community at the local level, serving 8 years on the Mansfield, \nOH, City Council and by also serving on the Mansfield Elections Board.\n  Given her interest in helping her fellow Ohioans, I was extremely \npleased that Joan joined my campaign for Governor in 1990 and that she \nstayed through both my terms. Joan was the first impression that people \nhad of the Governor's office whether in-person or on the phone, and I \nbelieve that her professionalism and compassion made thousands of great \nfirst impressions on visitors and callers alike.\n  Joan has always had a wonderful way to make anyone who deals with her \nfeel immediately at ease, whether it was frustrated constituents, \nharried staff or individuals with special needs. She has also always \nbeen cool under pressure, witnessing numerous demonstrations and \nprotests and dealing with more than her fair share of troublesome \nindividuals. And Joan always let me know what ``the pulse of the \npeople'' was by keeping track of the calls we received and letting me \nknow what our constituents were saying.\n  Not only did Joan smooth over the problems of countless Ohioans, she \nalso shared her talents with fellow staff members, serving as ``den \nmother'' to many of the younger staff members in my office. Whether it \nwas a shoulder to cry on, or motherly advice, I know that many people \ncherished her guidance, her comfort and her companionship.\n  When I was elected Senator, I was genuinely pleased that Joan \ncontinued to serve the people of Ohio when she stayed on to work for \nme. A whole new generation of staff and thousands more Ohioans had a \nchance to get to know her and experience her warmth and charm.\n  My wife, Janet and I appreciate all that Joan has done for us and the \npeople of Ohio and the fellowship that she has shared with so many. We \nwill always treasure Joan's friendship, and we wish her many years of a \nhappy and healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12679-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       Tribute to Chick Matthews\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrue American hero from my home State--Mr. Chick Matthews of \nGreenbrier, AR.\n  Mr. Matthews was born on August 19, 1901, in a one-room house in \nBailey Town, AR. Growing up in the most modest of circumstances, Mr. \nMatthews went on to a distinguished career of service to his country, \nserving in four wars in the twentieth century. Mr. Matthews served \nhonorably in World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, either in \nthe uniforms of the Army, the Navy, or the Merchant Marine. It is a \nservice record that he can be proud of, and we are proud of him for it.\n  In 1931, Mr. Matthews married Icie Lee, who served as a postal worker \nin Greenbrier and a postmistress in Wooster, AR. Icie Matthews passed \naway in 1999 after 68 years of marriage to Chick. She is deeply missed.\n  Chick Matthews retired from the Merchant Marine in 1970, but since \nthen he has stayed extremely busy. He has been around the world more \nthan a dozen times. According to his count, Mr. Matthews has visited \nover 100 countries. This past summer, just before his one hundredth \nbirthday, he traveled with his son James on a trip that took him to 18 \nforeign countries.\n  Today, Mr. Matthews leads an equally energetic lifestyle at home, \ntending to a one-acre garden and visiting frequently with his neighbors \nand friends at the Greenbrier Senior Citizen Center, where he regales \nhis companions with tales of his adventures. We should all hope to \nmaintain such a full and active schedule in our senior years.\n  Through his service to his country, his love of family and community, \nhis commitment to making the most of his life, Chick Matthews \nrepresents the most admirable qualities in the American spirit. In this \nnew century, in these difficult times, when a new generation of young \nAmericans is taking up arms to defend our freedoms against the threat \nof international terrorism, let's follow the example set by Chick \nMatthews in the last century. In this, the one hundred and first year \nof Chick Matthews' life, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to his \nexample on the floor of the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12679-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPPORT ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me \ntoday in congratulating the Detroit Zoological Institute upon the \ncompletion of the Arctic Ring of Life. For over 75 years, the Detroit \nZoo has educated and inspired millions, while promoting conservation \nand advancing our understanding of the natural world.\n  The Arctic Ring of Life is one of the cornerstones of the Celebrating \nWildlife Campaign, a series of projects which also includes the \nNational Amphibian Conservation Center, and two other structures that \nare yet to be built: The Ford Center for Environmental Conservation \nEducation and a new Animal Health Complex. Continuing the renaissance \nwhich the Detroit Zoo has experienced over the past 20 years, the \ncompletion of these projects will further solidify the Detroit Zoo's \nposition as one of the leading zoos in the world.\n  Polar bears have lived at the Institute since it first opened its \ngates in 1928. The Arctic Ring of Life builds upon the Institute's long \nrelationship with the bears of the North. Sprawling over 4.2 acres, \nthis exhibit will showcase more than just polar bears. It will provide \na glimpse into life above the Arctic Circle. At the entrance of the \nArctic Ring of Life, visitors will be\n\n[[Page S12680]]\n\ngreeted by a nine-foot granite polar bear sculpture. From there, \nvisitors will travel through an Inuit village as it appeared in the \nearly 1900's. The exhibit also includes a display of a tundra area \ncontaining colorful grasses, wildflowers and other arctic plants. This \narea will also be home to snowy owls and arctic fox, two of the most \ncommon arctic animals. Visitors will then enter into the Nunavut \nGallery, an indoor room containing Inuit art as well as interpretive \ngraphics.\n  Beyond the gallery is the most unique part of the exhibit: a \nspectacular 70-foot-long passage that allows visitors to wind through a \n300,000 gallon marine environment. The first of its kind in the world, \nthe tunnel will take visitors beneath both the polar bear and seal \nareas. Those visitors lucky enough to be in the tunnel when the bears \nare in the water are able to look around and marvel at the grace of the \nlargest land predator swimming effortlessly in the water.\n  After exiting the tunnel, visitors follow the edge of the glacier to \nthe ``Exploration Station.'' Maintaining the exhibit's goal of \neducating while entertaining, children and adults can have a first hand \nexperience with the tools of the arctic scientist while at the station. \nThe equipment in the building includes a thermal imaging station which \nchildren can use to see how heat is escaping the body, and a remote \nvideo camera which can be used to survey the exhibit. Following one \nlast spectacular overview of the whole exhibit, visitors exit with a \nnew and enhanced understanding of the fragile arctic region and its \nimportance for the world.\n  The Zoological Institute is one of Detroit's most important cultural \ncenters. Nevertheless, the zoo, like the city itself, has gone through \nperiods of difficulty and turmoil. However, thanks to the dedicated \nwork and contributions of thousands, the Detroit Zoo has prevailed. \nBeginning with the completion of the Great Apes of Harambee in the late \n1980's, the Detroit Zoo has renovated or opened many new exhibits in \nthe past two decades. While the Detroit Zoological Institute has long \nbeen one of the best zoos in the country, it is now undisputably one of \nthe best in the world.\n  As a lifelong resident of Detroit, I am heartened to see the \nrenovations done to the Detroit Zoo and the opening of this new \nexhibit. The Detroit Zoological Institute is an important cultural \ninstitution for not only the city of Detroit, but the entire State of \nMichigan.

RUSHMORE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dan \nWenk, former Superintendent of Mt. Rushmore National Memorial. Dan was \nrecently promoted and is currently serving the National Park Service as \nthe director of the Denver Service Center.\n  Dan started serving as Superintendent of Mt. Rushmore 16 years ago. \nOver the past 16 years, Dan has had oversight over numerous big events, \nincluding the 50th anniversary observance in 1991, which was a national \nobservance that highlighted the memorial's significance as this \ncountry's `Shrine of Democracy'. President George Bush, actor Jimmy \nStewart and many other national and statewide celebrities took part in \nthe event.\n  In recent years, Mount Rushmore has also been placed on the national \nstage with its awesome and impressive Independence Day fireworks \ncelebration. Thousands of people descend upon the monument around the \nJuly 4th holiday to listen to patriotic music, witness one of the \nNation's best fireworks displays and unite in a patriotic spirit.\n  During his tenure, Wenk helped showcase Mount Rushmore National \nMemorial to a worldwide audience, numbering in excess of two million \nvisitors annually. These visitors have included presidents, cabinet \nmembers, members of Congress, and national celebrities. But I know \nDan's biggest reward came in visiting with the general public and \nanswering countless questions from inquiring folks of all ages.\n  In recent years, Dan shepherded a massive $30 million renovation \nproject to redesign outdated facilities and expand the visitor \nexperience at the memorial. The expanded amphitheater, the Lincoln \nBorglum Museum and the Presidential Trail are just a few of the \nrenovations that marked this project. Expanded and renovated parking, \ndining and gift shop facilities greet today's visitors to Mount \nRushmore.\n  Over the years, Dan has not been afraid to tackle challenging issues \naffecting Mount Rushmore. He has dealt with the occasional protester \nand anthrax threat. As the renovation took several years to complete, \nDan recognized the importance of continued leadership to oversee the \nproject. It was very important to communicate the status of the project \nand the intricacies of the rebuilding phases to the local citizenry, \nmany of whom were skeptical of any changes made to the memorial. At \ntimes, during the renovation and parking fee debates, Dan tackled the \nchallenge of keeping the local public informed, addressed opponents' \nquestions and letters to the editor, and even answered the occasional \ncongressional inquiry--all with calmness, all with a professional \nattitude and all with a dedication to the final goal, which was \ncompletion of a massive renovation to one of this nation's most prized \nsymbols. As if overseeing the political wrangling was not enough, Dan \nwould sometimes get away from it all and come down from the mountain to \ndon a striped shirt and officiate local basketball games. I do not know \nwhich was the bigger challenge: dealing with intricate construction \ndetails and the occasional verbal or written jab, or whistling a foul \nin the final seconds of a tightly-contested high school basketball game \nbetween city rivals.\n  Dan's responsibilities for his new position will include the \noversight of planning, design and construction in national parks \nthroughout the United States. Although this is a big loss for Mt. \nRushmore and South Dakota, I know his experience and leadership will \nbenefit the entire country. Dan and I started roughly at the same time. \nI was first elected to Congress in 1986 and Dan started at Mt. Rushmore \nin 1985. It has been an honor for me and my staff to work with Dan and \nhis staff, and he will be sorely missed. I have appreciated Dan's \ninsight, honesty and professional attitude over the years. I look \nforward to continuing my relationship with Dan in his new position and \nI know that he will show the same professionalism in Denver that he \nshowed in South Dakota.\n  Congratulations Dan and I wish you and your family the best of luck \nin Denver and in your new position.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12681-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n     IN RECOGNITION OF LEE BOLLINGER'S SERVICE AS PRESIDENT OF THE \n                         UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN: Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \na dynamic and visionary leader in my home State of Michigan, Mr. Lee \nBollinger.\n  For nearly 5 years, Lee Bollinger has served as the president of one \nof the world's premier institutions of higher learning, the University \nof Michigan. During the Bollinger administration, the University of \nMichigan has experienced a period of dynamic growth and change.\n  At a time when it is essential to keep higher education affordable \nfor all Americans, it is imperative that universities do all they can \nto provide a quality education at an affordable price. Lee Bollinger \nhas worked hard to place the University of Michigan in a healthy \nfinancial position so that it can meet its financial obligations. The \nUniversity has operated its fiscal affairs astutely under Lee's \nleadership. U of M's endowment is now the fourth largest among public \nuniversities.\n  In recent years, some have suggested that university presidents are \nchosen more for their ability to raise money than for their academic \nprowess or vision for the modern research university. Despite his \nsuccess at managing the University's fiscal affairs, Lee Bollinger was \nnot such a university president. He is truly a Renaissance man whose \nvision of the University as a tool for academic and social progress \npermeated all that he did while in Ann Arbor.\n  Lee Bollinger's vision for the University has reinforced Michigan's \nrole as a leader in the arts and sciences. He was instrumental in the \nconstruction of the Walgreen Drama Center, which houses the 450-seat \ntheater named in honor of the most famous living American playwright \nand an alumnus of the University of Michigan, Arthur Miller. In \naddition, he made it possible to bring the Royal Shakespeare Company to \ncampus.\n  The sciences have also flourished under Lee's tenure. He has worked \nto develop the University's Life Sciences Initiative, which will soon \nhouse hundreds of researchers who will probe the human genome and will \nwork to discover new treatments for a variety of diseases. This \ninitiative has the potential to make both the University and the State \nof Michigan leaders in the emerging field of biotechnology.\n  My admiration for Lee has also been shaped by his unwavering support \nof the University's affirmative action policy in admissions. Under his \nstewardship, the University has made inclusion and diversity its \nbywords. Lee has steadfastly led the defense of the University's \npolicies in two separate lawsuits that are currently being heard in \nFederal court, and which may ultimately be heard before the Supreme \nCourt. I thank him for his tremendous commitment to making sure that \nthe University of Michigan continues to provide a diverse learning \nenvironment for all of its students. I know the University will \ncontinue to fight for these issues even after Lee moves on to his new \nposition as President of Columbia University.\n  Just last month, Lee was recognized by the Association of Academic \nHealth Centers with the Herbert W. Nickens Award in honor of his strong \nadvocacy for diversity at the University and in our Nation. It is an \naward that is well deserved.\n  As Lee Bollinger leaves Ann Arbor for New York City, I want to take \nthis opportunity to wish him and his wife, Jean, all the best. During \nhis tenure as President, Lee Bollinger enhanced the University of \nMichigan's stature as one of the premier institutions of learning in \nthe world. I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating Lee Bollinger on his tenure as President of the \nUniversity of Michigan. I trust that the Columbia University community \nwill soon come to admire him as much as we have in Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12681-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 1786.

A bill to provide that all American citizens living abroad \nshall (for purposes of the apportionment of Representatives in Congress \namong the several States and for other purposes) be included in future \ndecennial census of population, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inouye for joining me \ntoday in introducing an important piece of legislation, the Full \nEquality for Americans Abroad Act. This legislation directs the \nSecretary of Commerce to ensure that all American citizens living \nabroad be included in each future decennial census for the purposes of \nthe tabulations required for the apportionment of Representatives in \nCongress. The Secretary of Commerce will report its findings to \nCongress no later than September 30, 2002.\n  Americans living abroad play an important role in shaping the World's \nview of our country. As the trade becomes more and more global, \nAmericans living abroad will have an even larger role in the exports \noverseas that help our Nation's economy. They vote and pay taxes in the \nUnited States, yet they are not included in the census. They spread the \nseeds of democracy in areas throughout the world and help to promote \nthe value of freedom that Americans hold so dear. We count the men and \nwomen of the Armed Services and other government employees who serve \nthis country abroad, it is time that we count private citizens living \nabroad as well.\n  I commend Representative Gilman for his work on this issue in the \nHouse and look forward working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mrs. Carnahan, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Miller, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1785. A bill to urge the President to establish the White House \nCommission on National Military Appreciation Month, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am here today, on the 60th anniversary \nof the attack on Pearl Harbor. My father served in World War II at \nPearl Harbor after the attack, and I grew up with the legend of Pearl \nHarbor in my own life.\n  I will introduce a bill urging the President to establish the White \nHouse Commission on National Military Appreciation Month.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleagues and cosponsors, Senators \nBiden, Bingaman, Carnahan, Clinton, DeWine, Hagel, Levin and Lieberman, \nMikulski, Miller, and Senator Harry Reid.\n  Thanks also are due to General Tilleli, the president of the USO, and \nto Ms. Alice Wax, whose support and tireless efforts on behalf of \nNational\n\n[[Page S12684]]\n\nMilitary Appreciation Month have made this day a reality.\n  The bill is framed to afford the President the widest possible \nflexibility with regard to the recommended Commission and National \nMilitary Appreciation Month itself. There is no money authorized in \nthis bill. The establishment of the Commission, the composition of the \nCommission, and the scope of the Commission's activities are framed as \nrecommendations. I have framed it in this way to make it an easy bill \nto support, because I believe it is a bill we should all support, and I \nwill tell you why.\n  Sixty years ago today, just before 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning, the \nfirst wave of bombers began the attack on Pearl Harbor that thrust the \nUnited States into World War II. It was an unforgettable day for those \nwho lived through it, one which called America forth from an \nisolationist slumber to defend itself, and in so doing, inspired a \ngeneration of Americans to rise and lead the defense of freedom around \nthe world. In the years since that fateful day, our Nation has become \nthe most powerful and prosperous nation in the world. A few short years \nago, with the generation that secured this prosperity and power still \nin our midst, I and my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee heard testimony from the leaders of our military concerning \nthe difficulties they were having recruiting and retaining sufficient \nnumbers of young Americans in our Armed Forces. We crafted a package of \nincentives, and began the process of restoring military compensation to \na more appropriate level. Even today, with recruiting and retention \nback to more acceptable levels, we continue to struggle to meet the \nfunding levels required to sustain a strong military.\n\n  Eighty-seven days ago, America was attacked again, and for only the \nsecond time in modern history, American blood was shed on American soil \nby a foreign foe. Most of the casualties of this most recent attack \nwere civilians, a reflection of the many ways in which the world has \nchanged since 1941. Once again, a generation of Americans has been \ncalled to rise to the defense of our way of life--this time not against \nan aggressor nation but against the global terrorist networks that have \ntargeted us. Osama bin Laden's network in Afghanistan is our target \nnow. It is not as clear how many other networks lie in wait.\n  Some things are clear, though. The American military has been \nessential in responding to this latest attack. There will continue to \nbe challenges, but we must recognize our military in every special way \nwe can.\n  That is why we, as a nation, cannot afford to forget the price of our \nfreedom.\n  Maintaining our military and our readiness is one of the keys to our \nfreedom. I support this National Day of Military Recognition and urge \nthe support by this body of the Commission that recommends the month of \nMay as National Military Appreciation Month.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1787. A bill to promote rural safety and improve rural law \nenforcement; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the lobby of the James A. Byrne United \nStates Courthouse located at 601 Market Street in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, as the ``Edward R. Becker Lobby''; to the Committee on \nEnvironmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of Senator Rick Santorum and myself to name the newly remodeled \nlobby of the United States Courthouse at Sixth and Market Streets, \nPhiladelphia, PA, in honor of Chief Judge Edward R. Becker of the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  It would be impossible to find a Federal jurist in the United States \nmore deserving of recognition than Chief Judge Becker. I say that from \nmy intimate knowledge of Ed Becker for more\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\nthan fifty years, since we first rode the elevated train from Northeast \nPhiladelphia to the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in \nSeptember of 1950 when he was a freshman and I was a senior. We studied \ntogether, debated together, socialized together, and married beautiful \nyoung women, Flora Lyman and Joan Levy, who sat next to each other at \nOlney High School.\n  Ed was an honors student at Penn where he was elected to Phi Beta \nKappa and similarly an outstanding student at the Yale Law School, \nwhere our law school studies overlapped for two years with Ed \ngraduating in 1957. For thirteen years, he was a distinguished \nPhiladelphia lawyer in partnership with his father, Herman Becker, and \nhis brother-in-law, Lewis Fryman. During his legal career he was active \nin Republican politics. It is, of course, an open secret that \nnomination to the Federal Bench has a political aspect as well as the \nrequirement for legal skills. After all, the President makes the \nappointments with some consideration for the recommendations of United \nStates Senators. Ed Becker is an unusual example of qualifying for a \nseat on the United States District Court, where he was appointed in \n1970, for being a Republican loyalist and political activist as well as \nan astute, accomplished lawyer. Most are appointed with only one of \nthose two credentials. In addition to being counsel to the Republican \nCity Committee, Ed took on candidacies for State Senate and City \nCouncil in Philadelphia which are kamikaze ventures except in rare and \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  Judge Becker served on the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania from December 1970 until January 1982 \nwhen he was elevated to the United States District court for the Third \nCircuit. On the Federal Bench, Ed's legal scholarship has been prolific \nand prodigious. His 958 opinions cover the cutting edge of evolving \njurisprudential issues. He once wrote an opinion in rhyme. His opinion \nin the Japanese Electronics Case was more than 500 pages long replete \nwith extensive footnote documentation, as is his practice. He was \nrecently honored by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review in May \n2001 which details his extraordinary judicial service. He is the fifth \nmost senior active Federal judge in the United States.\n  To name the Federal Courthouse Lobby for Chief Judge Becker would be \na reciprocal honor. It would be an honor to Judge Becker. It would also \nbe an honor to the Federal Courthouse Lobby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12686-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 188--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \n   LOBBYISTS SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED SPECIAL ACCESS PRIVILEGES TO THE \n   CAPITOL AND CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO OTHER \n                           AMERICAN CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the followintg \nresolution; whichwas referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S. Res. 188\n\n       Whereas a fundamental principle of American democracy is \n     that all citizens are created equal and all should have \n     access to Government leaders;\n       Whereas there is a perception among many Americans that \n     special interest groups and lobbyists for special interest \n     groups have access to decision makers that ordinary citizens \n     do not have;\n       Whereas this perception contributes to a belief that \n     middle-class citizens, and those of more modest means, are \n     treated unfairly in the political process;\n       Whereas it is important that Americans have confidence that \n     Congress will treat all citizens equitably, regardless of \n     whether they are represented by professional lobbyists;\n       Whereas recent terrorist events have increased the need for \n     security precautions at the Capitol and surrounding \n     congressional office buildings;\n       Whereas tightened security measures may make it more \n     difficult for members of the public and lobbyists to gain \n     access to the Capitol complex;\n       Whereas some lobbyists are now seeking to gain special \n     privileges for access to the Capitol complex that would not \n     be available to other members of the general public who have \n     official business before Congress;\n       Whereas giving lobbyists privileged access to congressional \n     offices that is not available to the general public who have \n     official business before Congress would further contribute to \n     the perception that ordinary citizens are treated unfairly in \n     the legislative process; and\n       Whereas granting privileged access for lobbyists is likely \n     to increase public cynicism about Congress and the political \n     process and heighten concerns about the excessive influence \n     of special interests and lobbyists: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that in \n     establishing rules governing access to the Capitol or \n     congressional offices for those who have official business \n     before Congress, lobbyists should not be granted special \n     privileges that are not available to other American citizens.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Feingold, I am \nsubmitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that in \nestablishing rules governing access to the Capitol or congressional \noffices for those who have official business before the Congress, \nlobbyists should not be granted special privileges that are not \navailable to other American citizens.\n  A fundamental principle of American democracy is that all citizens \nare created equal and all should have access to government leaders. \nUnfortunately, there is a perception among many Americans that special \ninterests and their lobbyists have access to decision-makers that \nordinary citizens lack. This contributes to the widespread belief that \nmiddle class citizens, and those of more modest means, are treated \nunfairly in the political process. In my view, it is critically \nimportant that we do everything reasonably practicable to give \nAmericans confidence that Congress will treat all citizens equitably, \nregardless of whether they are represented by professional lobbyists.\n  Recent terrorist events have focused attention on the need for \nsecurity precautions at the Capitol and surrounding congressional \noffice buildings. Already, tightened security measures have restricted \naccess to the Capitol. I expect that other changes will be considered \nin the future as we seek to find an appropriate balance between \nlegitimate security concerns and the need to give citizens access to \ntheir elected representatives. Unfortunately, in recent weeks, we have \nheard increasingly that some professional lobbyists are seeking to gain \nspecial privileges for access to the Capitol complex that would not be \navailable to other members of the general public who have official \nbusiness before the Congress. I believe that granting such special \naccess would be a mistake, and that is why I am introducing this \nresolution.\n  I understand that lobbyists can play an important role in the \nlegislative process and have legitimate rights to participate in that \nprocess, just like other Americans. In my view, however, it would not \nbe fair to provide lobbyist with special privileges that are not \nprovided to other citizens who have official business before the \nCongress. Such privileged access would further contribute to the \nperception that ordinary citizens are treated unfairly in the \nlegislative process and heighten concerns about the excessive influence \nof special interests and lobbyists. All Americans have a stake in \ndebates before the Congress, not just lobbyists. If an elderly \nindividual spends her own money to come to Washington to protect her \nSocial Security benefits, there is no reason why she should face \ngreater restrictions than a lobbyist representing a corporation seeking \na special tax break. I hope my colleagues will support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12686-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12686-S12687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 89--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING JOSEPH HENRY \n   FOR HIS SIGNIFICANT AND DISTINGUISHED ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND \n           ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AND THE USE OF ELECTRICITY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title--This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial \n     Reusable In-Space Transportation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\n       (1) It is in national interest to encourage the development \n     of cost-effective, in-space transportation systems, which \n     would be developed and operated by the private sector on \n     commercial basis;\n       (2) Reusable in-space transportation systems will introduce \n     higher levels of performance into in-space operations, more \n     efficient and safe end of life satellite disposal and \n     increase the capability and reliability of existing ground-\n     to-space launch vehicles;\n       (3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance the Nation's economic well-being and national \n     security by reducing space operations costs for commercial \n     and national space programs, adding new space capabilities to \n     space operations;\n       (4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will provide new cost-effective space capabilities, \n     including: orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high \n     altitude orbits and return; correct erroneous orbits of \n     satellites; recover, refurbish, and refuel satellites; and, \n     provide upper stage functions to increase ground-to-orbit \n     launch vehicle payloads to geostationary and other high \n     energy orbits;\n       (5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States \n     by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth \n     orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival \n     deceleration to support potential Mars, Pluto, and other NASA \n     planetary missions;\n       (6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbits due to \n     deficiencies in their launch represent major situations of \n     economic loss to the United States, which has been as high as \n     $3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 within a 12 month period, \n     and present major concerns for the current backlog of \n     national space assets valued at $20,000,000,000;\n       (7) A commercial reusable in-space transportation system \n     can provide new options for alternative planning approaches \n     and risk management to enhance the mission assurance of \n     national space assets;\n       (8) A commercial reusable in-space transportation system \n     developed by the private sector can provide in-space \n     transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, Department of Defense, National \n     Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need \n     for the United States to bear the cost of development;\n       (9) The provision of limited direct loans or loan \n     guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States \n     paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which \n     the United States can help qualifying private-sector \n     companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing, \n     while at the same time minimizing government commitment and \n     involvement; and\n       (10) It is in the national interest to utilize existing \n     loan and loan guarantee programs to promote the development \n     of in-space transportation systems, which are reusable and \n     provide cost-effective solutions to operations within the \n     space environment.\n\n     SEC.  .

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\n     charter of the United Nations and undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is among the leading nations in the \n     world in conducting basic scientific research;\n       (2) that leadership position strengthens the economy and \n     national defense of the United States and provides other \n     important benefits;\n       (3) the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, owned by the \n     Homestake Mining Company of California, is approximately \n     8,000 feet deep and is situated in a unique physical setting \n     that is ideal for carrying out certain types of particle \n     physics and other research;\n       (4) the Mine has been selected by the National Underground \n     Science Laboratory Committee, an independent panel of \n     distinguished scientists, as the preferred site for the \n     construction of the National Underground Science Laboratory;\n       (5) such a laboratory would be used to conduct scientific \n     research that would be funded and recognized as significant \n     by the United States;\n       (6) the establishment of the laboratory is in the national \n     interest, and would substantially improve the capability of \n     the United States to conduct important scientific research;\n       (7) for economic reasons, Homestake intends to cease \n     operations at the Mine in 2001;\n       (8) on cessation of operations of the Mine, Homestake \n     intends to implement reclamation actions that would preclude \n     the establishment of a laboratory at the Mine;\n       (9) Homestake has advised the State that, after cessation \n     of operations at the Mine, instead of closing the entire \n     Mine, Homestake is willing to donate the underground portion \n     of the Mine and certain other real and personal property of \n     substantial value at the Mine for use as the National \n     Underground Science Laboratory;\n       (10) use of the Mine as the site for the laboratory, \n     instead of other locations under consideration, would result \n     in a savings of millions of dollars for the Federal \n     Government;\n       (11) if the Mine is selected as the site for the \n     laboratory, it is essential that closure of the Mine not \n     preclude the location of the laboratory at the Mine;\n       (12) Homestake is unwilling to donate, and the State is \n     unwilling to accept, the property at the Mine for the \n     laboratory if Homestake and the State would continue to have \n     potential liability with respect to the transferred property; \n     and\n       (13) to secure the use of the Mine as the location for the \n     laboratory, and to realize the benefits of the proposed \n     laboratory, it is necessary for the United States to--\n       (A) assume a portion of any potential future liability of \n     Homestake concerning the Mine; and\n       (B) address potential liability associated with the \n     operation of the laboratory.\n\n     SEC. ____3.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about S. 1196, \nthe Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, Amendments Act of 2001.\n  For those who don't know, the SBIC program is a very successful \npartnership between the SBA and private venture capital firms. It has \naccounted for about half of all venture capital deals done in the \ncountry over the past few years, and it has helped finance some of \nAmerica's companies that are now house-hold names--Federal Express, \nIntel, Outback Steakhouse, America Online, Callaway Golf, and \nMassachusetts' own Staples.\n  The main purpose of this act is to adjust the fees charged to \nParticipating Security SBICs from 1 percent to 1.38 percent. The change \nis necessary because, at the President's request, all funding for this \nprogram was eliminated. I disagree with that. I preferred to show \nfiscal responsibility by level funding the program and then increasing \nthe fees only as much as necessary to raise the program level from $2 \nbillion to $3.5 billion. Consistent with that opinion, as my colleagues \nmay remember, Senator Bond and I offered an amendment to the Budget \nResolution, Amendment No. 183, that did just that. It was agreed to in \nthe Senate by voice vote in April and retained in the final budget \nresolution. Unfortunately, the appropriators had very tough decisions \nto make and the funding agreed to in our budget amendment was not \nincluded in the appropriations process. Despite my disagreement, I am \nsupporting S. 1196 because if we want to continue this program, it must \nbe funded entirely through fees, which forces us to authorize the fee \nchange.\n  For the record, let me state that the National Association of Small \nBusiness Investment Companies testified before both the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business in favor of increasing the program \nlevel from $2 billion to $3.5 billion and raising the fees to make that \nlevel possible. As I just explained, this legislation makes that \npossible.\n  This bill also includes modifications to the program in order to \nstrengthen the oversight and authority of the SBA to take action \nagainst bad actors, to protect the integrity of the SBIC program, and \nto streamline operations.\n  With this bill, I am offering an amendment, cosponsored by Senator \nBond, to reinforce our efforts to keep the economy strong. The \namendment strikes section six, which my colleagues in the House \nincluded when they deliberated and voted on this bill, and replaces it \nwith similar language which accommodates changes requested by the \nAdministration. Specifically, starting in FY2003, it reduces for two \nyears the fees for the Small Business Administration's 7(a) and 504 \nloan guarantee programs in order to make these loans more affordable \nfor borrowers to access capital and lenders to\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\nmake. In reducing the fees, it gives the largest reduction to the \nsmallest small business borrowers, those who take out loans of less \nthan $150,000. It also provides fee relief for small business borrowers \nwho need working capital for medium-sized loans, those in amounts of \nbetween $150,000 and $700,000.\n  The 7(a) program is one of the SBA's most popular and successful \nsmall business credit programs. In FY2000, 43,748 small businesses were \napproved for 7(a) loans, which added up to $9.3 billion. Of those \nbillions, 31 percent went to minority business owners, 11 percent went \nto veteran business owners, and 16 percent went to women business \nowners. These loans would not have been made but for the SBA; in order \nto get an SBA loan, borrowers must demonstrate that they are unable to \nget comparable credit, at comparable rates, from an area lender. Year \nafter year, as this program has generated billions of dollars in small \nbusiness development, fueled job creation and generated tax revenue, \nits default rates by cohort have dropped sharply since 1990 from more \nthan 6 percent to less than 2 percent. Not only have these loans \ncontributed to the economy, but the program has largely paid for \nitself. From fiscal years 1992 through 1998, Congress appropriated \nclose to $1.4 billion to run the program, and the lenders and borrowers \npaid $1.3 billion more than necessary in fees to participate in the \nprogram.\n\n   The track record of the 504 program is equally impressive, and they \ntoo have overpaid because the SBA and OMB have over-estimated the cost \nof providing these loans. Reducing fees will help encourage lending at \na time when surveys from the Federal Reserve have found that anywhere \nfrom 35 to 45 percent of banks have tightened credit to small \nbusinesses, making it harder and more expensive to get loans.\n  Originally, my amendment also included a provision to require the SBA \nto give new markets venture capital companies two years to raise their \nmatching capital. Even though we had legislated in the 106th Congress \nto give them two years, and Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg \nreinforced this by making the relevant matching capital available until \nexpended as part of supplemental funding to the FY2001 Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill, the Small Business Administration \nrequired the approved new markets venture capital companies to raise \ntheir money first in six months, and later proposed extending the \nperiod to one year. The declining economy, particularly in the \naftermath of September 11, has made raising capital even more \ndifficult. Consequently, these companies need more time than one year. \nHere is what Dr. Julia Sass Rubin, a community development venture \ncapital expert from the Harvard Business School, has explained about \nthe nature of raising funds these days: ``This task of raising capital \nfor a new fund is particularly challenging during an economic slowdown, \nwhen the sources of funds for any kind of venture capital become more \ndifficult to access. Additionally, with the dramatic recent slowdown in \ninitial public offerings, even traditional venture capitalists are \nhaving a very difficult time raising money. It is simply not practical \nto expect a new CDVC fund to capitalize within one year.''\n  I am very happy to report that we were able to work out a compromise \nwith the Small Business Administration to give these companies to year \nand half to raise their capital. It's not the full two years, but I am \nhopeful that the new markets venture capital companies can raise their \ncapital in the that time. The Administration has also recommitted to \noffering a second round of funding starting in the August/September \ntime frame of 2002.\n  Let me quickly explain a bit about this innovative venture capital \ninitiative. The new markets venture capital initiative is modeled after \nthe SBA's very successful SBIC program, which I talked about earlier. \nHowever, unlike the SBIC program which makes larger deals, new markets \nventure capital companies target smaller investments to the development \nof high-growth small businesses in our country's poorest urban and \nrural areas. They tie those investments to the creation of local jobs \nwith livable wages and benefits for individuals who historically have \nno opportunities for employment or who are the working poor. One \nexcellent example of such a company is City Fresh Foods in Dorchester, \nMassachusetts. They run a smart business, providing a needed service to \nthe elderly in their community by producing and distributing meals for \nthe Meals-on-Wheels program. They hire from the community, and they \nprovide good jobs with sustainable wages. The SBA's new markets venture \ncapital investments, if given a real chance to work, could help develop \nmore companies like City Fresh Foods.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and ask my colleagues in \nthe House to pass this bill as soon as possible.\n  I thank Senator Bond for his work on this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to support passage of the Small Business Investment Company \nAmendments Act of 2001, S. 1196 and an amendment being offered by \nSenator John Kerry, which I strongly support. Time is of the essence \nsince a critical component of the Small Business Investment Company, \nSBIC, Program was shut down on November 28, 2001, when the Commerce \nJustice State appropriations bill became law, while the bill modifying \nthe annual fees paid by the Participating Securities SBICs had not been \nenacted. Once S. 1196 becomes law, it paves the way for more investment \ncapital to be available for more small businesses that are seeking to \ngrow and hire new employees.\n  When the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship unanimously \napproved S. 1196 on July 19, 2001, the Committee adopted a fee increase \nfrom 1.0 percent to 1.28 percent. At that time, some members of the \ncommittee believed they could obtain an appropriation for the SBIC \nParticipating Securities Program that would offset part of the fee \nincrease. The final version of the Fiscal Year 2002 Commerce Justice \nState appropriations bill did not include any funds for the SBIC \nprogram. Consequently, it is critical that legislation be enacted \nincreasing the program fee to 1.38 percent. So long as the fee is not \nincreased, the SBIC Participating Securities will remain shut down as \nrequired by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n  Last month, on November 15, the Senate unanimously passed S. 1196, \nafter approving a managers' amendment increasing the annual fee to 1.38 \npercent. When the House of Representatives considered the bill, it \nincluded an amendment that changed the fee structure for two other \ncredit programs at the Small Business Administration, SBA: the 7(a) \nGuaranteed Business Loan Program and the 504 Development Company \nProgram. Today, Senator Kerry and I are offering an amendment to S. \n1196 that makes minor modifications to the House-passed amendment on \nthe 7(a) and 504 loan programs.\n  There has been a significant growth in the small business sector of \nthe U.S. economy over the past two decades. Today, small businesses \nmake up over one-half of the entire U.S. economy. Over 99 percent of \nall employers in the United States are small businesses. They employ \nover 50 percent of workers and provide 75 percent of the net new jobs \neach year. Small businesses generate 51 percent of the Nation's private \nsector output. In light of the ongoing dip in the U.S. economy with the \naccompanying retrenchment by many businesses, both large and small, S. \n1196 will serve as part of the solution to move us toward a recovery.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners in obtaining investment capital. Forty years later, small \nbusinesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment \ncapital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although \ninvestment capital is readily available to large businesses from \ntraditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking \ninvestments in the range of $500,000--$3 million have to look \nelsewhere. SBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital \nfor growing small businesses.\n\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNations best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, Federal Express received a needed \ninfusion of capital from two SBA-licensed SBICs at a critical juncture \nin its development stage.\n\n[[Page S12744]]\n\nThe SBIC program also helped other well-known companies, when they were \nnot so well-known, such as Intel, Outback Steakhouse, America Online, \nand Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program \nprovides to Main Street America small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld \nEquipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufacturers \nutility truck bodies in St. Clair, Missouri. The truck bodies are \nmounted on chassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. \nSteelweld provides truck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., \nTexas Utilities, Paragon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet.\n  Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, \nElaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk \nright out of high school. She rose through the ranks of the company and \nwas selected to serve on the board of directors. In December 1995, \nfollowing the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, Ms. Hunter \nreceived financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for Business \nCFB, Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of \nSteelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt \nand seller debt were also used in the acquisition.\n  Since Ms. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was \nredesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, \nSteelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million \nand 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's \nexperience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States.\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program.\n  Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the \ngrowing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment \ncapital. And it is important to focus on the significant role that is \nplayed by the SBIC program in support of growing small businesses. \nWhen Fortune Small Business compiled its list of 100 fastest growing \nsmall companies in 2000, 6 of the top 12 businesses on the list \nreceived SBIC financing during their critical growth years.\n\n  The ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001,'' as \namended, would permit the annual interest fee paid by Participating \nSecurities SBICs to increase from 1.0 percent to no more than 1.38 \npercent. In addition, the bill would make three technical changes to \nthe Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (`58 Act) that are intended \nto make improvements in the day-to-day operation of the SBIC program.\n  Projected demand for the Participating Securities SBIC program for FY \n2002 is $3.5 billion, a significant increase over the FY 2001 program \nlevel of $2.5 billion. It is imperative that Congress approve this \nrelatively small increase in the annual interest charge paid by the \nParticipating Securities SBICs before the end of the fiscal year. The \nfee increase included in the bill, 1.38 percent, will allow the program \nto operate at its authorized level--$3.5 billion--an amount needed to \nhelp support small businesses as they help lead our country to an \neconomic recovery.\n  The Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001 would \nalso make some relatively technical changes the `58 Act that are \ndrafted to improve the operations of the SBIC program. Section 3 would \nremove the requirement that the SBA take out local advertisements when \nit seeks to determine if a conflict of interest exists involving an \nSBIC. This section has been recommended by the SBA, that has informed \nme that it has never received a response to a local advertisement and \nbelieves the requirement is unnecessary.\n  The bill would amend title 12 and title 18 of the United States Code \nto insure that false statements made to the SBA under the SBIC program \nwould have the same penalty as making false statements to an SBIC. This \nsection would make it clear that a false statement to SBA or to an SBIC \nfor the purpose of influencing their respective actions taken under the \n`58 Act would be a criminal violation. The courts could then assess \ncivil and criminal penalties for such violations.\n  Section 5 of the bill would amend section 313 of the `58 Act to \npermit the SBA to remove or suspend key management officials of an SBIC \nwhen they have willfully and knowingly committed a substantial \nviolation of the `58 Act, any regulation issued by the SBA under the \nact, a cease-and-desist order that has become final, or committed or \nengaged in any act, omission or practice that constitutes a substantial \nbreach of a fiduciary duty of that person as a management official.\n  The amendment expands the definition of persons covered by section \n313 to be ``management official,'' which includes officers, directors, \ngeneral partners, managers, employees, agents or other participants in \nthe management or conduct of the SBIC. At the time section 313 of the \n`58 Act was enacted in November 1966, an SBIC was organized as a \ncorporation. Since that time, SBIC has been organized as partnerships \nand Limited Liability Companies, LLCs, and this amendment would take \ninto account those organizations.\n  The Kerry-Bond amendment would reduce the fees paid by the \nparticipants in two SBA programs: the 7(a) guaranteed business loan \nprogram (7(a) program) and the 504 Development Company program (504 \nprogram). The need for this legislation to reduce fees has been growing \nin recent years. The issues surrounding the fees paid by small business \nborrowers and the banks came to a head earlier this year, when the \nGeneral Accounting Office determined that the Federal government had \ncollected over $950 million in excess fees paid by the borrowers and \nlenders and taxpayers' funds appropriated by the Congress. The driving \nforce behind this amendment is to adjust the fees paid by small \nbusiness borrowers and lenders to reflect more accurately their \nappropriate share of the cost of the program.\n  On May 4, 2001, Senator Kerry, Mr. Manzullo, Ms. Velazquez, and I \nasked the Comptroller General to undertake an in-depth analysis of the \nSBA's 7(a) credit subsidy rate calculations. Specifically, we asked the \nGAO to assess the level of difference between the projected cost of the \n7(a) program's financing account, or loan loss reserve, and the actual \ncost. This calculation is required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of \n1990. The purpose of the credit subsidy rate is to determine the amount \nof funds that should be appropriated each year to cover expected losses \nwhen the Federal government guarantees 7(a) loans.\n  What the GAO uncovered confirmed our worst concerns. The GAO pointed \nout that defaults and recoveries are key variables in the calculation \nof the 7(a) credit subsidy rate. Since FY 1992, the first year under \nthe rules of the Federal Credit Reform Act, defaults and recoveries \nwere significantly overestimated by the SBA and OMB. Defaults have been \noverestimated by nearly $2 billion and recoveries by $450 billion. What \nthe overestimates mean in real costs is that the Federal government \ncollected significantly more money than needed to fund its loss reserve \naccounts. Specifically, the Federal government collected over $950 \nmillion in excess fees paid by borrowers and lenders and by taxpayers' \nfunds appropriated by Congress.\n  My shade tree analysis leads me to believe that small business \nborrowers, banks and taxpayers have been and continue to be overcharged \nfor the 7(a) program. First, it is clear that they are paying too much \nbecause each year the SBA and OMB overestimated the default rate for \nthe 7(a) program. Second, if a more accurate default rate were adopted, \nthe credit subsidy rate could be reduced. Third, a lower credit subsidy \nrate could mean lower fees paid by small business borrowers. And \nfourth, the 7(a) loan program could expand to meet the demands of small \nbusinesses without requiring a larger appropriation.\n  Mr. President, time is of the essence. We need to act promptly and \npass the Small Business Investment Company Act of 2001 today, so that \nthe House of Representatives has time to act before the Congress \nadjourns in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/07/senate-section/article/S12745-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n                       AUTHORIZATION FOR PRINTING\n\n  Mr. REID.

Administration.''.\n\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``A Bill to amend title \n     38, United States Code, to modify and improve authorities \n     relating to education benefits, compensation and pension \n     benefits, housing benefits, burial benefits, and vocational \n     rehabilitation benefits for veterans, to modify certain \n     authorities relating to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for Veterans Claims, and for other purposes.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2462\n\n  Mr. REID. Senators Rockefeller and Specter have an amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Rockefeller and \n     Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 2462.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass S. 1088, the proposed \n``Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2001,'' as it will be modified \nby a manager's amendment which I developed with the Committee's Ranking \nMember, Senator Specter. I will describe provisions of the amendment in \na moment.\n  The pending measure is an omnibus bill that improves many veterans \nbenefits, such as the amount and flexibility of the Montgomery GI Bill, \nand enhances compensation to Gulf War veterans, as well as to Vietnam \nveterans with Agent Orange-related conditions.\n  Although the Budget Resolution assumed some significant spending on \nveterans benefits, our Committee nonetheless had to make some difficult \ndecisions to assist the most veterans within the resources available to \nour Committee. I thank Ranking Member Specter and the minority staff \nfor their significant efforts toward attaining that goal.\n  S. 1088, as reported, which I will refer to as the ``Committee \nbill,'' makes significant enhancements to educational benefits for \nveterans and their families. The original GI Bill allowed a generation \nof soldiers returning from World War II to create the booming post-war \neconomy, and, in fact, the prosperity that we enjoy today. Today's \nMontgomery GI Bill (MGIB), modeled after the original GI Bill, provides \na valuable recruitment and retention tool for the Armed Services and \nbegins to repay veterans for the service they have given to our Nation. \nAs a transition benefit, it allows veterans to gain the skills they \nneed to adjust productively to civilian life.\n  I am very pleased that section 101 of the Committee bill would \nincrease the MGIB basic monthly benefit by $50 per month this year, \n$100 in 2002, and $150 in 2003. I am even more proud that S. 1088 also \ntakes the next evolutionary step to keep pace with the careers and \neducation that today's veterans require. As our colleagues know, many \nservicemembers leave the military with skills that place them in demand \nfor careers in the technology sector. But even these veterans may \nrequire coursework to convert their military skills to civilian \ncareers. Section 103 of the Committee bill would allow veterans to use \ntheir Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits to pay for short-term, \nhigh technology courses that would allow veterans to earn the \ncredentials they need to gain entry to lucrative civilian-sector \ncareers.\n  Currently, the MGIB provides a basic monthly benefit of $672 for 36 \nmonths of education. This payment structure is designed to assist \nveterans pursuing traditional four-year degrees at universities. \nHowever, in today's fast paced, high-tech economy, traditional degrees \nmay not always be the best option. Many veterans are pursuing forms of \nnontraditional training, such as short-term courses that lead to \ncertification in a technical field. In certain fields, these \ncertifications are a prerequisite to employment.\n  These courses, such as Microsoft or Cisco systems training, may be \noffered through training centers, private contractors to community \ncolleges, or the companies themselves. They often last just a few weeks \nor months, and can cost many thousands of dollars. The way MGIB is paid \nout in monthly disbursements is not suited to this course structure. \nFor example, MGIB would pay less than $1,400 for a two-month course \nthat could cost as much as $10,000.\n  The percentage of veterans who actually use the MGIB benefits they \nhave earned and paid for is startlingly low--45% of eligible veterans, \naccording to VA's Program Evaluation of the Montgomery GI Bill \npublished in April 2000--despite almost full enrollment in the program \nby servicemembers. By increasing the flexibility of the MGIB program, \nwe will permit more veterans to take advantage of these benefits. We \nshould give veterans the right to choose whatever kind of educational \nprogram will be best for them.\n  This legislation would modify the payment method to accommodate the \ncompressed schedule of the courses. Specifically, section 103 would \nallow veterans to receive an accelerated payment equal to 60 percent of \nthe cost of the program. This is comparable to VA's MGIB benefit for \nflight training, for which VA reimburses 60 percent of the costs. The \ndollar value of the accelerated payment would then be deducted from the \nveteran's remaining entitlement. This provision would also allow \ncourses offered by these providers to be covered by MGIB.\n  Another provision of the Committee bill would correct an unintended \nexclusion of certain Gulf War veterans from eligibility for service-\nconnected benefits. Our efforts to explain symptoms reported by many \ntroops returning from the 1991 Gulf War have been frustrated by \ninconclusive scientific data and by poor military recordkeeping during \nthe conflict. In 1994, Congress passed the Persian Gulf War Veterans' \nBenefits Act to provide compensation to certain Gulf War veterans \ndisabled by ``undiagnosed illnesses'' for which no other causes could \nbe identified.\n  Since then, changes in medical terminology have led many Gulf War \nveterans to receive diagnoses for chronic conditions without known \ncause--such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia--which VA has \ninterpreted as precluding them from eligibility for benefits. Section \n202 of the Committee bill would correct this unintended exclusion by \nexpanding service connection to ``poorly defined chronic multisymptom \nillnesses of unknown etiology, regardless of diagnosis,'' characterized \nby the symptoms already listed in VA regulations.\n  Because scientific research has still determined neither the cause of \nveterans' symptoms nor the long-term health consequences of Gulf War-\nera exposures, and because the Department of Defense recently expanded \nits estimates of who might have been exposed\n\n[[Page S12751]]\n\nto nerve agents, this section also extends the presumptive period for \nbenefits for Gulf War veterans for 10 more years. I thank the \nCommittee's newest member, Senator Hutchison, for her leadership on \nthis issue.\n  For many years there has been a prohibition on paying compensation \nand pension benefits to an incompetent veteran who has no dependents \nand who has assets of $1,500 or more, if the veteran is being provided \ninstitutional health care by the government. This reduction of benefits \nto this population of veterans dates back to 1933, when incompetent \nindividuals might be institutionalized for years. At that time, it was \nbelieved that a large estate based on the veteran's benefits should not \nbe allowed to build up just to pass to the state upon the veteran's \ndeath. Now, however, treatment modalities have changed and veterans do \nnot generally remain hospitalized for years at a time. Instead, they \nare more likely to cycle in and out of treatment, which results in \nvirtually constant suspension and reinstatement of their benefits.\n  Last year, in Public Law 106-419, Congress addressed this anomaly in \nlaw. Although we had hoped to fully eliminate the disparate and \ndiscriminatory treatment of incompetent veterans, due to cost \nrestraints we were only able to raise the dollar amount of the cutoff \nfrom $1,500 to five times the 100 percent compensation rate, which is \n$10,535 in the current year. The current monthly VA disability \ncompensation rate for a veteran rated 100 percent disabled is $2,107.\n  Section 209 would fully repeal the limitation on payment of benefits \nto incompetent institutionalized veterans who have no dependents and \nthereby end decades of prejudice and discrimination against these \nveterans.\n  The Committee bill also enhances and extends home loan programs. As \nmost of our colleagues appreciate, VA does not provide a direct home \nloan for servicemembers and veterans. Instead, it provides a guaranty \nto mortgage lenders should the borrower veteran be unable to meet the \npayments and go into foreclosure. A VA guaranty allows a veteran to buy \na home valued at up to four times the guaranty amount. The price of \nhomes in major metropolitan areas has increased significantly in the \nlast several years, yet the VA guaranty amount has not been increased \nsince 1994. VA estimates that during fiscal year 2001, VA will have \nguaranteed 250,000 loans for veterans.\n  Section 301 would increase the home loan guaranty amount to $63,175 \nfrom the current $50,750 to keep pace with FHA loan guaranties, thereby \nsupporting a loan of up to $252,700.\n  Section 302 would extend the Native American veterans housing loan \nprogram, set to expire in 2002, by 4 years. Special authority to \nprovide these loans is necessary, in addition to the general VA home \nloan guaranty, because these homes sit on tribal land. This makes \ntraditional foreclosure and resale by the mortgage holders impossible.\n  Section 303 would extend for 4 years the authority for housing loan \nguaranties for members of the Selected Reserve, currently set to expire \nin 2007. Reservists must serve 6 years in order to become eligible for \na VA-guaranteed loan. In order for the home loan to be used as a \nrecruiting incentive now, the benefit must be authorized beyond 6 \nyears. Senator Akaka, my good friend and colleague on the Committee, \nhas again championed the loan programs for Native Americans and \nreservists in the Senate.\n  I now turn to the provisions contained in the manager's amendment. \nThey include further enhancements to educational benefits, pension \nsimplification, and eliminating an arbitrary bar to benefits for \nVietnam veterans suffering from Agent Orange-related respiratory \ncancers.\n  First, new section 105 would protect educational benefits for those \nthat must leave their course of study to serve on active duty in \nsupport of the National Emergency declared in response to the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001. This provision would restore educational \nentitlements for recipients of the Montgomery GI Bill, Veterans \nEducational Assistance Program, VEAP, and Dependent's Educational \nAllowance, DEA, for regular servicemembers and reservists who are \ncalled up for active duty and who are forced to relocate or take on \nextra work because of their participation in support of the National \nEmergency. This provision would be an amendment to a provision that \nrestores such entitlements for servicemembers and reservists called to \nactive duty for the Persian Gulf War. In 1997, Congress similarly \nexpanded educational benefits restoration for the Selected Reserve \nProgram.\n  New section 106 would increase the Dependent's Educational Allowance \n(DEA) for dependents and eligible spouses of veterans. Congress created \nthis educational program in 1968 to provide educational opportunities \nto children whose education would be impeded or interrupted because of \nthe disability or death of a parent from a disease or injury incurred \nor aggravated in the Armed Forces. In addition, unremarried surviving \nspouses of veterans are generally eligible for the educational \nallowance in order to assist them in preparing to support themselves \nand their families at the standard-of-living level that the veteran \ncould have been expected to provide for his or her family but for the \nservice-connected disability or death. Children and surviving spouses \nof servicemembers who are missing in action for 90 days, captured in \nthe line of duty by a hostile force, or detained or interned by a \nforeign government, are also eligible for the educational allowance.\n  DEA is available for full-time, three-quarter time or half-time \nattendance at an institution of higher learning, for students taking \ncorrespondence courses, pursuing special restorative training, or \napprenticeship training. The increase in DEA for full-time students \nwould be to $690 from $608 on November 1, 2002, with no cost-of-living \nadjustment that year. The allowance for a three-quarter time student \nwould increase to $517 from $456, and the allowance for half-time \npursuit would increase to $345 from $304.\n  In addition, new section 107 would address statutory gaps that led to \na court decision, Ozer v. Principi, 14 Vet.App. 257 (2001), that \neliminated the delimiting date for use of DEA benefits by surviving \nspouses. Under the new provision, subject to the Secretary's approval, \nthe surviving spouse would be allowed to change the beginning date of \nthe 10-year period during which he or she is eligible for benefits. \nThis provision would allow the surviving spouse to select the beginning \ndate of eligibility from any date between the effective rating of the \nveteran's total and permanent service-connected disability and the date \non which the Secretary determines that the veteran died of a service-\nconnected disability. The amendment would restore the delimiting date \nprovision, making the DEA program more uniform with other VA \neducational programs.\n  New section 201 would remove the arbitrary 30-year limit for \nmanifestation of Agent Orange-related respiratory cancers in Vietnam \nveterans. Currently, title 38, United States Code, only provides a \npresumption in Vietnam veterans for respiratory cancer if the disease \nmanifested within 30 years of their service in Vietnam. The most recent \nNational Academy of Sciences report confirmed that there is no \nscientific basis for assuming that cancers linked to dioxin exposure \nwould occur with a specific window of time. This provision would \neliminate the 30-year limit and allow future claims for Vietnam \nveterans' respiratory cancers, irrespective of the date of \nmanifestation of the disease.\n  Finally, new section 203 would restore the presumption of disability \nfor pension purposes by allowing VA to accept certain types of \nevidence, beyond just medical evidence, to establish permanent and \ntotal disability. VA non-service-connected pension is a needs-based \nmonthly benefit paid to certain disabled wartime veterans.\n  Currently, the VA must determine if medical evidence demonstrates \nthat the veteran can be rated as permanently and totally disabled. This \ncan be a very time-consuming process that creates hardships for pension \nclaimants. This provision would allow VA to consider a veteran to be \npermanently and totally disabled for pension purposes if the veteran is \na patient in a nursing home, the Social Security Administration has \ndetermined that the veteran is disabled for their benefit programs, or \nthe veteran is age 65 or over. This provision should streamline the \nprocessing of pension claims and\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\nprovide faster service for disabled and elderly veterans.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support these vital \nenhancements to veterans benefits. As has been the case in previous \nyears and is particularly important in light of our country's current \nmilitary actions, this truly represents a bipartisan commitment to our \nNation's veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of S. 1088 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Summary of S. 1088, as Amended by Manager's Amendment\n\n\n                               Education:\n\n       Increase the rate of the basic benefit of the Montgomery \n     G.I. Bill (MGIB) from the current $650 per month to $700 per \n     month beginning in October 1, 2001; $800 per month in October \n     1, 2002; and $950 per month in October 1, 2003.\n       Allows MGIB participants to receive their otherwise monthly \n     payment as an accelerated lump-sum payment for the month in \n     which the course begins.\n       Currently, MGIB benefits are paid in monthly installments. \n     S. 1088 would create flexibility in the payment method for \n     MGIB to partially pay for short-term/high tech courses. It \n     would accelerate payment of up to 60 percent of the cost of \n     an approved program that leads to employment in a high \n     technology industry.\n       Preserves educational benefits for those that must leave \n     their course of study to serve on active duty in support of \n     the National Emergency declared in response to the events of \n     September 11, 2001.\n       Increase Dependent's Educational Allowance (DEA) for \n     dependents and eligible spouses of veterans for full-time \n     students is to $690 from $588 on November 1, 2002.\n\n\n                        Compensation and Pension\n\n       Removes the arbitrary 30-year limit for manifestation of \n     Agent Orange-related respiratory cancers in Vietnam veterans. \n     The most recent National Academy of Sciences report confirmed \n     that there is no scientific basis for assuming that cancers \n     linked to dioxin exposure would occur with a specific window \n     of time.\n       Tasks the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to continue \n     reviewing scientific evidence on effects on dioxin or \n     herbicide exposure for 10 more years (five reports); and \n     extends authority of the VA Secretary to presume service \n     connection for additional diseases as based on future NAS \n     reports for 10 more years.\n       Expands the compensation definition of ``undiagnosed \n     illness'' for Gulf War veterans by adding poorly defined \n     chronic multisymptom illnesses of unknown etiology, \n     regardless of diagnosis. Congress provided compensation to \n     these veterans disabled by ``undiagnosed'' illnesses. Since \n     then many have received diagnoses for chronic conditions \n     whose causes cannot be identified conclusively, but which \n     preclude them from eligibility for benefits under the current \n     law.\n       Streamlines VA pension eligibility and income reporting \n     requirements.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n       Increases the home loan guaranty amount to $63,175 from the \n     current $50,750, to keep pace with FHA loan guaranties \n     supporting a loan of up to $252,700. The VA guaranty amount \n     has not been increased since 1994.\n       Extends the Native American veterans housing loan program, \n     set to expire in 2002, by four years. Special authority is \n     necessary, in addition to the general VA home loan guaranty, \n     because these homes sit on tribal land. This makes \n     traditional foreclosure and resale by the mortgage holders \n     impossible.\n       Extends the four years the authority for housing loan \n     guaranties for members of the Selected Reserve (now set to \n     expire in 2007). Reservists must serve six years in order to \n     become eligible for a VA-guaranteed loan. In order for the \n     home loan to be advertised as a recruiting incentive now, the \n     benefit must be authorized beyond six years\n\n\n                             Burial Matters\n\n       Increases VA burial benefits for service-connected deaths \n     of veterans from $1,500 to $2,000.\n       Authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish \n     bronze markers for already marked graves in order to more \n     permanently commemorate the veteran's military service. VA is \n     currently restricted by statute from providing a headstone or \n     marker for already marked graves.\n\n  Mr. REID.

I understand S. 1789, introduced earlier today by Senator \nDodd, is at the desk, and I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1789) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to improve the safety and efficacy of \n     pharmaceuticals for children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, which reauthorizes the pediatric drug \nexclusivity provision enacted as part of the FDA Modernization Act in \n1997. I commend Senator Dodd and Senator DeWine for their effective \nleadership on this provision as well as Senator Clinton for her \nimportant contributions to this legislation, and I also commend their \nstaffs for their long and skilled work on this bill.\n  Combined with FDA's Rule that requires pediatric testing for drugs \nand biological products, this legislation is intended to do more to see \nthat medicines are adequately tested for safety and effectiveness in \nchildren.\n  The 1997 provision has been a major success in encouraging essential \nstudies of pharmaceutical products in children. Dozens of such drugs \nhave been studied in children, and many of the products have now been \nrelabeled or even reformulated for use in children. But the 1997 \nprovision has not been an unqualified success. Although many products \nhave been studied, others have not. For every label changed, others \nremain incomplete.\n  This reauthorization provides that every pharmaceutical product that \nis needed to treat children will, in fact, be studied in children. In a \nfew years, there will be far fewer of these products that lack adequate \ninformation about pediatric use. The Food and Drug Administration will \nbe able to act more quickly and successfully to see that drug companies \nlabel their products for such use. The bill also gives needed new \npriority to the appropriate use of cancer drugs for children.\n  In addition to extending and improving this program which has been so \nimportant in improving therapies for children, the bill closes \ntechnical loopholes which might have improperly barred generic drugs \nfrom the market or limited the incentives for generic drug development.\n  This is a bill that will make a major contribution to the health of \nAmerican children and I urge its prompt passage by the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  Mr. REID.
