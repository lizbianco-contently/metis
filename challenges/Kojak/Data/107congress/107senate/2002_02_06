Mr. President, as the Chair announced, we will be in a \nperiod of morning business until 11:30, at which time we will have a \ncloture vote. At that time, we will vote on the economic recovery act. \nIf cloture is not invoked, the Senate will immediately vote on cloture \non the Grassley amendment. Additional rollcall votes, of course, are \npossible throughout the day.\n  Following the cloture votes, if cloture is not invoked, I have been \ndirected by the majority leader to inform everyone that he is going to \nask unanimous consent that we move forward today on the additional 13 \nweeks of unemployment insurance, something we have been trying to do \nfor months now. We asked for that in the closing hours of the last \nsession of the Senate before the Christmas recess. That was not \naccepted by the minority. I hope they will follow the example of the \nmajority leader and not strip everything out of his economic stimulus \npackage, and certainly let us not leave out of consideration these \npeople who are so desperately in need of these additional weeks.\n  During the first Bush administration, we extended unemployment \nbenefits on\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nfive separate occasions because of economic downturns. We have done \nthat routinely in the past. It should not have taken this long. There \nare a significant number of people whose unemployment benefits have \nexpired. We have a number of people who won't be able to collect \nunemployment benefits. It is really too bad that people have fallen \nthrough the cracks who have gone from welfare to work and who do not \nmeet the requirements statutorily. They certainly should be included, \nand I hope some consideration will be given them also.\n  Again, the majority leader will, after the cloture votes, ask \nunanimous consent that there be 13 additional weeks of unemployment \ninsurance extended to those people who so desperately need it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am here this morning to express my \ndisappointment that I am not going to have an opportunity to call for \nthe yeas and nays on the permanent extension of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit. It has to be one of the most important \nprovisions and amendments that will be made to the stimulus package.\n  I again am disappointed that stimulus package is not going to move \nforward out of the Senate. Many of us have worked hard. We think it is \ntime for us to have a stimulus package. The economy needs to have that \nhappen.\n  I want to refer to some charts and to what some very key individuals \nare saying about the R tax credit being extended on a permanent \nbasis. Right now, it is not extended on a permanent basis. I think the \nNational Association of Manufacturers is trying to address the \nquestion. I think they have said it very succinctly. They ask: Why \nworry? They say: because the R tax credit expires in 2 years and \nmajor R projects take an average of 5 to 10 years to complete.\n  If we don't get this passed now and move forward, that is going to be \nanother reason our economy will not move forward. I am very concerned \nabout that.\n  The Democrats in the Senate also recognize the importance of the R \ntax credit. I looked at what the majority leader said in January of \n2002. He said:\n\n       We should act to make the research and development tax \n     credit permanent; the sooner the better.\n\n  The action we are getting from the Senate today doesn't show any \ninterest at all in moving forward in keeping up with the ``sooner the \nbetter'' pledge. This is a serious problem and a catastrophe.\n\n       The R development tax credit is one of the most effective \n     mechanisms to encourage innovation, increase business \n     investment, and keep the economy growing.\n\n  Again, that is the majority leader speaking on January 4 of this \nyear.\n  I am extremely disappointed that we will not have an opportunity to \nbring this amendment up for discussion.\n  Just to again point out how important this amendment is to the \neconomic recovery of this country to restore economic prosperity, I \nwould like to show you a one-half-page ad from the Wall Street Journal.\n  Mr. President, I show you an ad that was put in the Wall Street \nJournal from Ontario, Canada. It points out: ``The Future's Right \nHere'' in Ontario, Canada.\n  They say:\n\n       With pharmaceutical R spending up 300 percent in the past \n     decade, Ontario is proving to be an excellent locale for life \n     sciences.\n\n  The reason they are saying that is because they have a research and \ndevelopment tax credit of which companies can take advantage.\n  They go on further to say: ``Protection of intellectual property \nrights and R tax credits, [which are] among the most generous in the \nindustrialized world, are a couple of key contributing factors'' and \nwhy it is so important to do business in Ontario.\n  We are missing the boat. We need to do more to encourage economic \nresearch and development in this country. It is key to restoring \neconomic prosperity.\n  Again, I cannot emphasize enough how very disappointed I am that I am \nnot going to have an opportunity, along with Senator Hatch, who has \nworked very hard on this particular amendment over the years, to get it \npassed on a permanent basis.\n  In addition to what I have shown here, we have looked up studies that \nsay the permanent extension may, in some cases, by 2010, increase \ndomestic economic growth by $58 billion.\n  We have the tax credit available for incremental research and \nactivities in both the United States and Puerto Rico where 75 percent \nof research and development tax credit dollars go to salaries and wages \nof employees associated therewith. These are high-paying American jobs, \nand high-paying American jobs pay taxes. It is taxes that go to the \nFederal Government and help us balance our budget at the Federal level.\n  So it is important. I am disappointed that not only my amendment but \nother amendments that would lead to economic growth in this country are \nnot going to have an opportunity to be brought up. I cannot emphasize \nenough how very disappointed I am that this has been stalled because of \naction on the other side, even after we have had such positive \nstatements made on January 4 of this year as to how we need to move \nforward with some of these tax cut provisions that stimulate economic \ngrowth, such as the research and development tax credit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment--I \nthink this is the order in which we appeared on the floor--so we can \nall make plans, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator from \nTexas finishes, I be recognized for 5 minutes, and then the Senator \nfrom Georgia be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. And that following that, the Senator from Missouri be \nrecognized for 5 minutes. I think that covers everybody present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was just setting up a procedure where we can all speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S384-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S384-S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEED FOR A STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, so many of us wanted a stimulus \npackage. The President asked for a stimulus package. We see the stock \nmarket continuing to go up and down, up and down. It certainly has not \nstabilized yet. We wanted to try to stimulate investment to try to make \nsure we would have an economy that would be able to remain strong as we \nare prosecuting a war for the very freedom of future generations in our \ncountry. But what we had before us was not a stimulus package. It was \nthe end of a compromise without the compromise part.\n  There was no tax cut. There was no help for people who pay taxes. \nThere was no stimulation for businesses that would invest in plant and \nequipment. And that is what we need to make sure we have those \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  What I had hoped to do--and I had already filed the amendment--was to \nmake permanent some of the tax cuts that are temporary over the next 10 \nyears. I wanted to make permanent the marriage penalty relief that is \nin the tax bill that Congress has already passed and the President has \nsigned but which could teeter in the next few years if we have a change \nin Congress.\n  Why should anyone have to pay a penalty because they get married? Why \nshould they pay a different rate in a higher tax bracket when they get \nmarried as opposed to when they were single?\n  We are trying to correct the marriage penalty. Making marriage \npenalty relief permanent so people can count on it would be a stimulus.\n  Repeal of the death tax is one of the most important things Congress \nhas done. Congress has finally acknowledged money that has been taxed \nwhen\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\nit was earned, taxed when it was invested, should not then be taxed \nwhen it is passed to future generations. What the death tax does is \nkeep family-owned farms and ranches and small businesses from being \npassed to members of the family. Fifty percent of the family-owned \nbusinesses in this country do not make it to the second generation; 80 \npercent do not make it to the third generation. Who benefits from that? \nCertainly not the members of a family who have worked to create a \nbusiness to give their children a chance.\n  What about the employees who work for that family business. When it \nchanges hands, their livelihoods then are at stake. So who is it good \nfor? It does not even help the Federal Government because the income is \nminuscule and would be totally overcoming to a thriving business with \njobs that are stable that can contribute to our economy.\n  So we wanted to make repeal of the death tax permanent. We wanted to \nmake repeal of the marriage penalty permanent. That was what we were \ntrying to do to this bill. But now the bill is going to be pulled from \nthe floor before we can offer these amendments.\n  I do not think that is sound economics. I do not think that is good \nfor our country, and it certainly is not going to stabilize our \neconomy.\n  So when you talk about people being disappointed, I think all of us \nare disappointed that we are not going to have a chance to offer our \namendments. We had all day yesterday to offer our amendments, but we \nwere held from offering the amendments and having votes. That is just \nnot right.\n  We adopted an amendment offered by my fellow Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Bond, that would have helped small businesses. It would have been a \nhuge help. It would have given them a $40,000 writeoff for investment \nin equipment. For small business that is huge. Otherwise, they would \nhave had to depreciate it. Instead, they would have a writeoff that \nwould have encouraged small businesses to make those capital \ninvestments that create jobs in America.\n\n  So we are missing a major opportunity. I will call on Senator Daschle \nto reconsider, after the cloture vote--which, hopefully, will fail \nbecause we have not been able to offer our amendments yet. We do not \nwant to pass the bill that is before us because there is no stimulation \nin it. I ask the majority leader to reconsider because we would like to \nhave a stimulus package that makes permanent the marriage penalty \nrelief, that makes permanent the death tax repeal so businesses and \nfamily farms can be passed through the generations without being taxed \nby the Federal Government and made to sell assets at bargain basement \nprices and take away jobs from people who work on those farms and take \naway the ability of the children in a family to continue to make their \nlivelihoods from that family farm. It would take away the opportunity \nto give small business a boost by giving them a writeoff of $40,000 \nover a 2-year period for capital investment.\n  I urge the majority leader to reconsider. Let's work with the \nPresident. Let's work with the Democrats and Republicans in Congress. \nLet's have a stimulus package that really stimulates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S385-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             REDUCING TAXES\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, back in January of last year, Senator Zell \nMiller of Georgia and I started working together in support of the \nPresident's tax cut. Obviously, I am awfully happy and awfully proud \nthat we succeeded.\n  Taxes are being reduced for working Americans. The marriage penalty, \nwhich my dear colleague from Texas just talked about, is being \neliminated. The death tax is being phased out. Rates are being reduced \nfor every American. The net result is that working people are getting \nthe opportunity to keep more of what they earn.\n  I think that was the right policy. It was supported on a bipartisan \nbasis. It got a strong vote in both Houses of Congress, but because of \na technicality in the Budget Act, we have this incredible anomaly that \n10 years from now all of that tax cut goes away.\n  Nothing could be more destabilizing than having a tax system which is \nnot permanent. Nothing could have a greater impact on the economy that \nwould happen 10 years in the future, that you could know about today, \nthan having the specter of a massive tax increase occur automatically.\n  Congress never intended that. It was a technicality in the budget \nthat forced it. So when the debate started to occur about how do we \ndeal with the recession, how do we stimulate the economy, Senator \nMiller and I got back together and tried to come up with a simple \nprogram that did not cost money during the recession and drive up the \ndeficit but yet stimulated the economy dramatically, in the process \nputting people back to work and putting money back in the Treasury.\n  We concluded there were two simple things we could do that would \nachieve both those goals: put people back to work, have them paying \ntaxes into the Treasury, and at the same time would not cost the \nFederal Government much money.\n  We concluded that the strongest stimulus package that could be \nadopted that would meet those goals was to make the tax cut permanent \nby repealing the sunset provisions in the Tax Code so that when we \neliminate the marriage penalty, it is forever, and people know it. When \nwe eliminate the death tax, it is gone, and people can plan on it. \nThese new rates are going to be permanent so you can invest and save \nand work harder knowing it.\n  The second proposal we had was cutting the capital gains tax rate. I \nam not sure that is politically correct in an era where the first thing \nwe debate is, would anybody who has any money, make any money. But \ncutting the capital gains tax rate in the entire 20th century never \nfailed to put money in the Treasury, never failed to stimulate the \neconomy. And based on that experience, we were proposing that we cut \nthe top bracket from 20 percent to 15 and the bottom bracket from 15 to \n7.5 percent.\n  That simple proposal would have raised Federal revenues in the next 2 \nyears--no one debates that--and would have provided a very strong \nstimulus to the economy. It appears we are not going to have an \nopportunity to offer it because the debate is going to be ended. We \nthought it was important that there be a vote on a real stimulus \npackage. We have debated a stimulus package, but no one has really \nproposed one.\n  The President, very much to his credit, thought, in light of \nSeptember 11, that we had enough bipartisanship that he could take half \nof the ideas the Democrats had, take some ideas Republicans had, make a \nproposal, and it would be adopted on a bipartisan basis. That turned \nout not to be the case. But if you wanted a real stimulus package that \nwould stimulate and that would make money for the Government at the \nsame time, our proposal--making the tax cut permanent and cutting the \ncapital gains tax rate--is that proposal.\n  I am proud of it. I wish we had had an opportunity to vote on it. I \ndon't believe it would have been adopted. But if we are going to debate \nstimulus, we ought to have a vote on something that will stimulate. If \nyou are trying to produce an economic response, you want something that \nis going to produce it. We had it, and I am very proud to have had an \nopportunity to work on this with Senator Miller.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I hear today we are about to have a \nfuneral, that the stimulus bill is on life support, and that the plug \nwill be pulled sometime today. The cause of death? Partisan politics. \nIt is a shame, although perhaps the money can now be applied to the \ndeficit, which has concerned some of us, and we will be closer to a \nbalanced budget.\n  The soon-to-be-deceased could have been saved. We had a reasonable \ncompromise right before we adjourned for Christmas. The President \nsupported it. Some Democrats, including this one, supported it. It had \na majority of the votes in the Senate. Right now, if it had passed, it \ncould have already been signed, the rebates could be being prepared, a \nreasonable health care benefit could have been a reality--such promise. \nWho was it who wrote that the saddest words of word or pen are that it \nmight have been--something like that?\n  This week we could have made the tax cut permanent. We could have \nadded a capital gains tax cut. That is what Senator Gramm and I have \nadvocated for some time.\n  No one ever stated so well how powerful an effect a cut in the \ncapital gains tax could have on the economy as a Democrat, President \nJohn F. Kennedy. I quote:\n\n       The tax on capital gains directly affects investment \n     decisions . . . the mobility and flow of risk capital from \n     static to more dynamic situations . . . the ease or \n     difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital . \n     . . and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the \n     economy.\n\n  That was Jack Kennedy, not the Washington Times or the Wall Street \nJournal or Lawrence Kudlow or Phil Gramm or Bob Novak. That was John \nKennedy, a Democrat.\n  Over the years, he was not the only member of my party who advocated \ncutting the capital gains tax as a good way to stimulate the economy. \nSenator Patrick Moynihan, that wise and brilliant former Member of this \nbody, consistently advocated it over the years.\n  What history shows is that, once upon a time, Democrats were tax \ncutters. I wish I could bring that time back. I rise today to strongly \nadvocate making the tax cut we passed last year permanent and to cut \nthe capital gains tax rate.\n  Unfortunately, the tax cut we passed last year, although it was a \ngreat tax cut, was compromised on its way to final passage. What \nstarted out as a broad, immediate, and permanent tax cut became one \nwhere some of the tax relief is delayed by several years. Then to add \ninsult to injury, the whole thing is to be repealed in 2010.\n  We do something that, to my knowledge, Congress never had the gall to \ndo before on a broad basis. We sunset individual tax cuts. We have done \nthat several times with business tax revisions. But to individuals, to \nfamilies, we have never done it where we gave them their money back and \nthen took it away again later. That is playing games with our \ntaxpayers. We should never do that. Eliminate the uncertainty of this \ntax cut and you will stimulate our economy. How can anyone make any \nlong-range plans for a business or for a family with a here-today, \nmaybe-gone-tomorrow tax cut, a tax cut that has a perishable date on it \nlike a quart of milk?\n  The fastest way to show taxpayers we are serious about tax relief--\nthe only way, really--is to make the tax cut permanent. The fastest way \nto prompt businesses to expand and to invest is to cut the capital \ngains rate from 20 to 15 percent. We are not in a slump just because \nconsumer sales are down. We are in a slump because venture capital fell \n74 percent in the past year. Capital spending by businesses is at its \nlowest in decades.\n  As Senator Gramm said, every time we have cut the capital gains \nrate--every time--tax revenues have risen, not fallen, and asset values \nhave always shot up.\n  Today a capital gains tax cut would bring even better results because \ntoday's stock market is no longer the playground of the rich. Almost \nhalf of all Americans now own stock, and almost a third--one out of \nthree--who earn less than $30,000 a year own stock. Aren't those the \npeople whom we Democrats say we want to help? The American middle class \nhas become, for the first time in our history, the American investment \nclass.\n  So as I eulogize this soon-to-be-deceased, I think of the bruised and \nbattered Marlon Brando's ``On The Waterfront''--what could have been. \nWe could have had a contender.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine).

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Georgia and from \nTexas for presenting some very cogent arguments as to why we need to \nkeep working on this stimulus bill. I am disappointed by the sounds I \nam hearing that it is going to be pulled. We need stimulus in this \neconomy, and we have already adopted an amendment that I proposed, on \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, to allow small businesses to write \noff immediately their investments.\n  As I have said, I have two more amendments, frankly, in addition, \nthat are pending at the desk that I think my colleagues, if given an \nopportunity to vote on them, would vote for overwhelmingly.\n  First is a measure that addresses the tax benefits for the armed \nservices members who served in the operations in Somalia. I don't think \nthere would be many on this floor who would not vote for it if they had \na chance. It provides that those who served during peacekeeping efforts \nin Somalia should receive the same tax benefits in the same manner as \nif such services were performed in a combat zone.\n  As we fight the global reach of the terrorist networks, we are asking \nour men and women in uniform to perform at the very highest levels and \nat an unprecedented operational tempo. This amendment I filed would \nallow the men and women who served within the hostile fire zone in \nSomalia to file for the same tax breaks afforded to military forces who \nserve in a combat zone. Anybody who has seen the movie ``Blackhawk \nDown,'' based on the real world conflict in Somalia, will understand \nthat our forces who served in that conflict were in a combat zone.\n  The Pentagon criterion for hostile fire pay requires the duty is \n``event based, payable to members certified that have been subject to a \nhostile fire. . . .''\n  Former SSG Kenneth Chatman, from Oran, MO, served the Army for 16 \nyears as an avionics electronics repair technician. He served in \nSomalia from August of 1993 to January of 1994 with the 101st Airborne \nDivision, air assault. The only tax exemption soldiers in Somalia got \nwas when they transited to some other zone. In his case, he flew over \nEgypt and got a tax-free month. That is unjust. I believe anybody who \nappreciates the battle that our military are taking on against \nterrorism will understand that the sacrifices made by our forces \nrequire that we give these brave men and women the same tax breaks that \nothers under direct fire receive.\n  The second amendment I have is truly a stimulus measure. It is \ndesigned to increase the amount of venture capital available to small \nbusiness. The Small Business Administration Small Business Investment \nCompany Program--the SBIC Program--has a significant role in providing \nventure capital to small businesses seeking investments in the range of \n$500,000 to $3 million.\n  Small Business Investment Companies are Government-licensed, \nGovernment-regulated, privately managed, venture capital firms created \nto invest only in original debt or equity securities of U.S. small \nbusinesses that meet size standards set by law.\n  In the current economic environment, the SBIC Program represents an \nincreasingly important source of capital for small enterprises--small \nenterprises that are struggling to get back on their feet, to grow now \nin the face of this economic recession we have been in for well over a \nyear. They need to have funding. While debenture SBICs qualify for SBA-\nguaranteed borrowed capital, the Government guarantee forces a number \nof potential investors--namely, pension funds--to avoid investing in \nSBICs because they would be subject to tax liability for unrelated \nbusiness tax income--UBTI. Thus, they don't put their money in it. As a \nresult, 60 percent of the private capital potentially available to \ninvest for these SBICs to create jobs, put men and\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nwomen to work, create wealth in the community, is ``off limits.''\n  My amendment would correct that problem by excluding Government-\nguaranteed capital borrowed by debenture SBICs from debt for purposes \nof the UBTI rules.\n  When we are looking at the need to diversify pension funds, this \ngives those who hold pension funds who seek retirement security an \nopportunity to use Government-guaranteed funds for investment in small \nbusinesses in a professionally managed small business investment \ncompany the opportunity to put their retirement funds to work and \ncreate jobs in their community, create growth and opportunity for men \nand women who need those jobs now.\n  I hope and expect, once again, that if this targeted small business \nstimulus incentive were put up on this floor for a vote, it would be \noverwhelmingly adopted and we would see jobs and growth of small \nbusiness.\n  I urge the leader, the Senator from South Dakota, to give us an \nopportunity to continue to work on this very important package, which \nhas some good things in it and, if we had the chance to work on it, \nwould have more good things in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep and \nprofound opposition to a decision by the International Olympic \nCommittee to ban the carrying of a special American flag during the \nopening ceremonies of the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n  This flag is very special. It was found in the rubble of the World \nTrade Center after the attacks on September 11. It is a powerful, \nmoving, visual reminder of America's strength, endurance, and freedom.\n  In fact, I believe this flag carries with it a profound parallel with \nthe original Star-Spangled Banner--the historic flag that flew over \nFort McHenry in the War of 1812, and in the battle of 1814 it survived \n25 hours of bombardment and inspired the creation of our national \nanthem.\n  Now, to those who say that the carrying of this particular flag by \nAmerican athletes marching into the stadium would be a ``political \nstatement,'' I say this is a ridiculous argument on its face. The \nAmerican flag from the World Trade Center is the American flag, just as \nsurely as the flag that flanks our Presiding Officer, as the flag that \nhas flown in many classrooms, in front of many homes, and at the top of \nthis great Capitol dome. It is not a symbol of politics. It is the \nrepresentation of our Nation, and it does what so many of us believe \nneeds to be done right now: It demonstrates clearly our resilience and \nour persistence in the face of terrorism. We should have the right to \ncarry this flag in whatever national or international setting we \nchoose.\n  To those who say that the carrying of this flag would set some kind \nof improper precedent, I say this is an equally absurd argument. First \nof all, the attacks on our country on September 11 were themselves \nunprecedented, and there is every reason for us to mark the tragic \nevents of that day by having our athletes hold the flag from the World \nTrade Center aloft during the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.\n  Second, should the unthinkable occur and any similar tragedy strike \nthis or any other nation in the years ahead, I cannot imagine any \nserious objection being raised if any nation wanted to carry its own \nflag, like this flag, in a future Olympic event. The world was shocked \nby the attacks of September 11.\n  Freedom-loving people everywhere are united with us in our \ndetermination to fight back against terrorism. While the terrorists may \nhave destroyed buildings and ended lives, they did not destroy the \nvalues we share, and those values define our Nation and find expression \nin the stars and stripes of our flag.\n  I believe the carrying of this flag that terrorists could not destroy \nis fully in keeping not only with the spirit of America but with the \nspirit of the Olympics.\n  According to the International Olympic Committee, the Olympic \nmovement is meant ``to contribute to building a peaceful and better \nworld,'' and the Olympic spirit is built on ``mutual understanding with \na spirit of friendship, solidarity, and fair play.''\n  I believe the carrying of this World Trade Center American flag does \nhelp contribute to building a peaceful and better world, especially \nbecause those who attempted to destroy our way of life and who did \ndestroy buildings tried to accomplish the exact opposite goal. They \nwere not trying to contribute to a better and peaceful world but just \nthe opposite.\n  This flag, in a sense, for the entire world portrays that ``spirit of \nfriendship, solidarity, and fair play'' that underscores the Olympic \nspirit.\n  Mr. President, today I am writing to the International Olympic \nCommittee to urge them to reverse their decision regarding the carrying \nof this American flag during the opening ceremonies of the Olympics. I \nask my colleagues for their support and their signatures on this \nletter.\n  We are the host Nation for the Olympics. Our athletes and the \nAmerican people they represent want this flag carried by them on \nFriday, and I do not believe the International Olympic Committee should \nstand in the way of this fitting and patriotic act, nor should they \nhave any role in telling us which particular American flag we can carry \nin the Olympics staged in our country just a few months after the \nterrible and tragic attacks of September 11.\n  I hope the Olympic Committee will change this very ill-thought-out, \nill-advised, and insulting decision before Friday. But until then, I \nhope my colleagues will join me in expressing not only our concern but \nour outrage at what seems to be a demeaning decision meant to undermine \nwhat this flag represents and in some clear way to undermine the heroic \nefforts of the firefighters who found it and hoisted it. I hope this \ndecision will be changed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this morning--in fact, just a few \nminutes ago--our colleague from Georgia, Senator Miller, spoke quite \neloquently about a patient on life support and said the life support \nwas about to be withdrawn.\n  The patient in his comments was the economic stimulus package we have \nbeen trying to negotiate since October. I like his analogy, but I think \nhe may not have picked the right patient.\n  The patient we have been trying to bring back to health is not a \nstimulus package. The patient that has been in the hospital bed has \nbeen the economy. We have had a sick economy, and we have been working \nto try to figure out how we might ensure the full, complete, and \nhealthy recovery of that economy.\n  Today, we pull the plug, if you will, from that recovering economy. \nWe pull the plug on hope for a stimulus package. It is not going to \nhappen. I do not think we ought to spend our time today, tomorrow, or \nthis week casting aspersions--Democrats on Republicans or vice versa. \nThere has been a lot of good will and a lot of effort exerted in \nOctober, November, December, January, and even earlier this month by \nboth sides, people of good will trying to figure out how we infuse \ncapital investments, how we reach out to those who lost their health \ncare, how we reach out to those who are losing unemployment benefits, \nhow we help States that are struggling financially right now.\n  There is an old saying which I think everybody has used once or \ntwice: The first rule is do no harm. By essentially walking away from \nthis debate today, we will have done no harm. Had we been able to act \nin October, November, or December with a reasonable package that was \nconsistent with the three principles we talked about for the last 4 or \n5 months--a stimulus should be temporary, it should be truly \nstimulative, and it should not exacerbate the deficit over the long \nhaul--if we could have come to agreement on that and presented a \npackage for the President's signature, that would have been fine. We \njust could not do that.\n  Now we face a time when the Federal Reserve has launched the most \naggressive monetary policy, ratcheting down interest rates for the last \nyear, infusing extra money in our money supply,\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\na drop in energy prices that fueled economic recovery and shortened the \nrecession, and we have been doing a lot of deficit spending.\n  Those three factors, rather than harm, have done great good. Because \nof those three factors, as we disconnect from the patient, if you will, \nthis hope of a stimulus package--the economy itself--the patient is \ngoing to get well. The patient is going to check out of the hospital \nand go on to live, hopefully, a reasonably long, healthy life until we \nhave another economic downturn.\n  Meanwhile, as we turn our attention from the economic recovery and \nthe need for a stimulus package, I would have us keep this in mind: If \nby a miracle we were able to pass a stimulus package today, before it \nwould have effect, a couple months are going to go by. It has taken \nalmost 12 months for the full force of the monetary policy, the \ninterest rate cuts of the Fed to have their impact, but they are having \nit today.\n  Now the Federal Reserve is reversing course. Instead of cutting \ninterest rates when they met last week, they decided not to further \ntheir cuts in interest rates. Before long, they are going to be turning \ntheir attention not to how we get the economy moving again but how do \nwe dampen down inflationary expectations.\n  Congress is real good at coming in when the recession is basically \nover and passing a package which, in the end, will probably be \ninflationary, and what we really do not want to do is have the Federal \nReserve working in a few months on the other side of the domestic \nmonetary policy trying to dampen inflationary expectations by raising \ninterest rates at the same time that a stimulus package from the \nCongress, adopted late, begins to have an effect. We will be at cross-\npurposes, which we do not need.\n  I am encouraged, I am bullish on the economy. I know people are \nsuffering today. I hope we can pass at least an extension of short-term \nbenefits for 13 weeks and help people. That will stimulate the economy \nand, more importantly, it will help people who are suffering.\n  Another action we can take--and I hope we will--to promote a healthy \nrecovery for an extended period of time--not a couple of months or a \ncouple of years--is as we go into these investigations as to what led \nto the collapse of Enron and what led to people losing their pensions, \ntheir 401(k)s, to do the hard work, the long work, the steady work that \nis required to find out why things went wrong at Enron, why so many \npeople got hurt, and how we can ensure that does not happen again to a \ncompany, to its employees, to those who invest in a company, and those \nwhose pensions are tied to a company. We can do that.\n  Today, as we walk away from this economic recovery package, I just \nwant to say a word of thanks to a lot of people who worked very hard to \ntry to get us to a consensus.\n  We could not get there. It is not the end of the economic recovery. I \nthink we are just beginning that economic recovery, and I am encouraged \nthat it will continue and we will have done no harm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am disappointed today that the majority \nleader has decided to pull down the stimulus package. We are going to \nhave a cloture vote on the majority leader's package. He calls it a \nstimulus package, but there is no stimulus in it. There is a lot of \nspending. He says if he does not get 60 votes, basically preventing any \nother amendments, he is going to pull down the stimulus bill. In other \nwords, he wants a spending package, not a stimulus bill, and if we are \ngoing to put stimulus amendments in it, no bill.\n  I am looking at an amendment Senator Kyl has pending to make the \ndeath tax repeal permanent. That would make a real positive change to a \nlot of businesses, a lot of agriculture. That is a positive amendment. \nIt is added as an amendment to one Senator Baucus had dealing with \nagricultural spending.\n  I looked at almost all the Democratic amendments, and they are almost \nall spending: More money for agriculture, more money for Medicaid, more \nmoney to increase the Federal payments share, more money for temporary \nemployees to the Federal program--we have never done that in the past--\nnew entitlement programs; no stimulus.\n  I am looking at the amendment Senator Bond offered on expensing. That \npassed overwhelmingly. That would help stimulate the economy. The \naccelerated depreciation that Senator Gordon Smith offered would help \nencourage people to make investments. The R tax credit Senator Allard \nwas offering would help encourage people to make investments, \nparticularly in research and development. Senator Domenici had a \npayroll tax holiday. We are not going to be able to vote on that. Most \nimportantly, we are not going to get to vote on the substitute Senator \nGrassley, Senator Collins, Senator Breaux, and others worked on. The \nbipartisan package that I believe we have a majority vote for in the \nSenate, we are not going to even have an up-or-down vote on. We get a \ncloture vote on it. If we enact cloture on the Daschle bill, we do not \neven get a vote. That bill is nongermane. It falls.\n\n  We did not get to have votes yesterday. This side was ready to have \nvotes. I made the commitment I would help finish the bill yesterday, \ncertainly by today, trying to limit amendments, trying to have votes on \nthe amendments. Let us pass the bill. Let us pass the bill and see how \nthe votes come out, but no, we cannot do that. We do not want to vote \non the Kyl amendment. We do not want to have a vote on making a \npermanent death tax repeal. We do not want an up-or-down vote on the \nGrassley-Breaux-Collins amendment. We do not get to have that. So I say \nto my colleagues, if they really believe in the Senate tradition of \nallowing Senators to offer germane amendments, in this case stimulative \namendments, to vote no on the cloture vote we will have in the next 15 \nor 20 minutes. I think it is an important vote. I hate to see us give \nup and not pass a stimulus bill. We have a chance now to make a bill \nthat is not stimulative into a bill that really could create jobs.\n  The economy is soft. It does need a little shot in the arm. The \nunderlying bill, the Daschle bill, does not do it. There are several \nproposals, several good amendments on which Senator Gramm, Senator \nGrassley, and others have worked. I mentioned about a half dozen. If we \ncould pass some or all of those, I think we would make the bill \nworthwhile, make it worth passing. Not only would it do no harm, it \nwould do some good. It would help create jobs.\n  More importantly, for the process of the Senate, I urge my colleagues \nto vote no on the Daschle cloture petition in a few moments because \nindividual Senators should be entitled to offer those amendments. They \nshould have their day. They should have a chance. Then they will send a \nbill that truly is stimulative to conference and hopefully we can get a \nbill on the President's desk that would create jobs.\n  Let me make it crystal clear; some people said the Republicans are \nfilibustering, but there is no way. No one can say Republicans \nfilibustered this bill. We have legitimate amendments that would \nstimulate the economy. I urge my colleagues to give us a chance to \noffer those amendments, to pass a good stimulus bill today, and to vote \nno on the Daschle cloture petition in a few moments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S388-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S388-S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKES\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, to distort Shakespeare's words, I come to \nthe floor today to bury the stimulus package, not to praise it. There \nhas not\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nbeen much praiseworthy in the way Congress has responded to the \nrecession that started last March and intensified after the attacks of \n9-11.\n  Last fall, and even this month, there were short term actions we \ncould have taken that would have had immediate and beneficial economic \nand humanitarian results. We could have extended unemployment benefits, \nas we have in every recession, and as I still hope we will. We could \nhave offered an immediate tax rebate to those lower income workers who \ndid not receive a full rebate from the first tax cut. We could have \nused the Medicaid payment formula to send financially strapped states \nstruggling to provide health care for their residents an immediate \ninfusion of cash. We could have offered a temporary acceleration of \ndepreciation to encourage reluctant businesses to invest now in the \nrecovering economy.\n  We agreed on basic principles: help now, and do no harm in the long \nrun. We agreed on the need. But we could not agree to put aside our \npartisan agendas long enough to do what we all agreed was right. \nInstead of talking about what we could do to help workers unemployed \nnow, factories lying idle now, we redebated tax cuts passed last spring \nand pushed tax breaks that wouldn't even take effect for 10 years. We \nshould have focused on workers, investment, consumer confidence. \nInstead we fought over estate taxes and tried to lay the blame for our \ninaction.\n  As the recession winds down and the war on terrorism continues, I \nsincerely hope Congress will be able to rise above the partisan \nbickering that doomed the stimulus package. We will have many \nopportunities this year to act in a bipartisan manner to make this \nNation stronger, safer, and better. We will also have many \nopportunities to wrap the flag around our pet proposals and fight for \npolitical advantage. We should commit today to learn from the mistakes \nthat have killed the stimulus package--not to repeat them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader \nannounced yesterday he is going to kill this bill if he does not \nprevail on the first cloture vote. Of course, we know if he did get \ncloture, many good amendments that have been offered to try to improve \nSenator Daschle's skeletal bill will fall. We will not be able to vote \non them. All we have asked for all along on this side, and even some \nMembers on that side, is a vote on the bipartisan centrist-White House \nbill that I have offered as an amendment, along with Senator Snowe.\n  In fact, that bill is a product of the work of people such as Senator \nSnowe and Senator Collins, and Democrats on this side of the aisle such \nas Senators Nelson, Miller, and Breaux. There is a long list of \namendments. I do not think I will go through the long list of \namendments that we will not have a chance to vote on, but I am going to \nhighlight a couple because I think Senator Nickles did a good job of \nhighlighting those most important amendments.\n  Let me take a look at a couple that will be killed if Senator \nDaschle's cloture motion is invoked. My friend, the majority whip, who \nis with us, Senator Reid, offered, along with Senator Kyl, so it is \nbipartisan, an amendment that is designed to help the travel industry. \nWe were told during the debate that this tax credit was very important. \nIf it is that important, we ought to have a chance to vote on it.\n  Guess what. If the Democratic leadership prevails on the first \ncloture motion, Senator Reid's amendment falls. I guess I can only \nassume that since this amendment is so important for Nevada and other \nStates where there is a lot of tourism, the majority leader would \noppose cloture. Surely he would not vote to kill his own amendment. \nThat is what I would think. I am afraid I am probably being optimistic \nor maybe naive.\n  Other Democrats have offered amendments, too. For those Senators, a \nvote for cloture is a vote to kill their own very important amendment. \nSo I hope these Democratic Senators are not telling their constituents \nthey are for something and then turning around and voting to kill it by \nsupporting this cloture vote.\n  Let us take a look at Senator Allard's amendment, one that is so \nimportant to have the United States competitive, particularly in \nmanufacturing and information technology, the R tax credit. If \ncloture is invoked, that amendment is dead as well. We had 70 Senators \nvote for that amendment on a previous tax bill, as an example. So make \nno mistake about it, if the distinguished leader's cloture motion is \nsupported, every one of these amendments will be killed, as well as the \nones Senator Nickles brought to our attention.\n  If the distinguished leader prevails on his cloture motion, then we \nend up with another conference with the House and that could take weeks \nor months to resolve. The best we can hope for is delay. That means \ndelay for the unemployed, delay for the stimulus, not helping those who \nare dislocated because of September 11.\n  By contrast, the Democratic leadership will not let us vote on the \nonly plan that has majority support in the Senate. They are \nfilibustering the only bipartisan stimulus plan and preventing \nunemployment benefits from reaching the workers who need them. That is \nwhat the second cloture vote is all about. The second cloture vote \nguarantees an up-or-down vote on the White House-centrist stimulus \nplan. A vote for that plan is a vote for a bill that the President will \nsign. He said he would sign it.\n  If cloture is voted for, Senators are saying with their vote they \nwant to send a bill to the President that he will sign in a New York \nminute. That means these things will happen and happen fast. Unemployed \nworkers get checks. For the first time, unemployed workers get health \ncare assistance. Payroll-tax payers get a rebate. Income-tax payers get \na little more tax relief in their paycheck. Businesses, large and \nsmall, get stimulative accelerated depreciation, which is going to mean \nmore jobs. So we have two cloture votes coming up very shortly.\n  The first cloture vote is an effort by the majority to block further \namendments to the bill, which will effectively kill the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose that cloture vote. The second cloture vote is an \neffort by our side to force a vote on the bipartisan centrist amendment \nthat the majority leader has been furiously blocking to this point. But \nwe cannot get to this vote unless the majority leader fails his first \nvote.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, these votes come down to a choice between \naction now or endless delay. If we want action now, Senators should \nvote for cloture on the White House-centrist agreement. If Members want \ndelay, vote for cloture on the Daschle amendment.\n  How much leadership time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time remains on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will speak briefly about comments made by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. He is my dear friend, he is my counterpart, \nbut I don't know how he kept a straight face, saying: We are not \nfilibustering this bill. I am sure he went to his office and started \nlaughing. This is a classic filibuster taking place on this bill--for \nweeks and weeks and weeks.\n  Of course, amendments have been offered that we like. I heard Senator \nAllard talking about tax credits. We like tax credits. In fact, it is a \nshame we did not extend those.

That is the parliamentary situation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a lot of amendments that we \noffered and the minority offered that are good amendments. Being \nrealistic, we spent all day yesterday talking about the estate tax, \nmaking the repeal permanent, which does not take place for 10 years. \nThat is not very stimulative. We have been told by the President and \nothers that to have stimulative efforts, it must be short term and do \nnothing to exacerbate the deficit. That simply does not apply in this \ninstance.\n  With all due respect to my friend, the minority whip, this is a \nfilibuster by the Republicans. Everyone knows it is. Members can say it \nisn't as many times as they want, but it is still a filibuster.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  Let me say why the Senator from Nevada is wrong.

Mr. President, I praise Senator Grassley for his heroic \nefforts in trying to bring together a bipartisan group to come up with \na package that would help our economy recover. I am disappointed the \nSenate majority leader has announced his intention to abandon work on \nthe economic recovery package.\n  In light of that reality, however, it is absolutely imperative that \nthe Senate move today to extend to unemployed workers an additional 13 \nweeks of benefits. This has been needed for a long time, and it is \nsomething I have been working on for the past 4 months.\n  In October of last year, I introduced a bipartisan bill for a 13-week \nextension. I was joined by Senators Landrieu, Gordon Smith, Cleland, \nand Voinovich. We introduced this bill because we thought it was \nimportant to quickly pass a measure of additional security for the 7 \nmillion unemployed workers across our Nation. Since that time, \nunemployment rolls have swelled by 900,000 and over 1.2 million \nAmericans have exhausted their unemployment compensation benefits \nwithout being able to find new jobs.\n  Last week, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and I wrote to the \nSenate leaders to ask them to call up legislation extending \nunemployment benefits as soon as possible. I am pleased that the \nassistant leader has indicated his intention to do just that.\n  Unfortunately, we saw the handwriting on the wall, spelling the \ndemise of the broader economic recovery legislation which I believe is \nstill very much needed.\n  Regular unemployment benefits end after 26 weeks in most States. When \ntimes are good and businesses are hiring, that is an adequate period of \ntime for most unemployed workers to either find new jobs or to be \nrehired to their old jobs. In fact, that usually happens long before \nthe 26 weeks have expired. However, when times are tough--and they are \ntough now--finding work is much more difficult and many unemployed \nworkers exhaust their 26 weeks of regular unemployment compensation.\n  Congress needs to do what it has traditionally done whenever our \ncountry has been plunged into a recession. That is to temporarily \nextend the safety net by providing 13 additional weeks of unemployment \ncompensation. This package would do just that for up to an additional \n13 weeks for workers who lost their jobs after the economic downturn \nbegan in March and who have exhausted their benefits prior to being \nrehired or finding new employment.\n  More than 10,000 unemployed workers in my home State of Maine \nexhausted their unemployment benefits last year without being able to \nfind a new job. They work hard. They want to work. They want new \nemployment. And they have been looking very diligently. However, the \neconomy is such that they simply have been unable to find new work. An \nunemployment extension would provide immediate relief to hundreds of \nthousands of Americans, including the 10,000 Mainers who have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits and have yet to find work.\n  Over the course of the coming year, approximately 3 million Americans \nwho are out of work and looking for a job would be assisted. This \nproposal would provide approximately $60 million in assistance to \nunemployed workers in Maine alone. These are our neighbors; these are \nfamilies who have been hurt most by the economic downturn.\n  Let us, therefore, today pass this much needed legislation to extend \nbenefits to millions of unemployed workers. Even if we have failed in \ncoming up with a compromise on the broader package, we can at least do \nthat, and do it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

Mr. President, I will use my leader time in addition to \nthe remaining Democratic time for my closing comments.\n  Mr. President, the other day I came to the floor to talk briefly \nabout our current circumstances. I will recount one last time for the \nrecord in case there is any question about how it is we got to this \npoint this morning. I will again briefly recount the events over the \ncourse of the last several months. There were bipartisan Finance \nCommittee discussions as early as last September about an economic \nstimulus package. There was a hope that we could come together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, on an economic stimulus package as we did on \nairport security, on counterterrorism, on the assistance provided to \nNew York and to the Defense Department in the wake of the tragedy of \nSeptember 11.\n  We reached out to experts who could give us guidance on what the \nprinciples ought to be for an economic stimulus package. We had a \nnumber of conversations with Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin, both, early \nin the months of September and October.\n  The bipartisan Budget Committee, I think on a unanimous basis, issued \nsome principles on October 4. Those principles were: If you are going \nto have a stimulus package, make sure it is truly stimulative. If you \nare going to have a stimulus package, make sure it is temporary. If you \nare going to have a stimulus package, make sure it is immediate. If you \nare going to have a stimulus package, make sure you take into account \ncost. All of those principles were ones enunciated by the economists \nand agreed to, in large measure on a bipartisan basis, by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  That was the lead up to the discussions we had. The House Republicans \nbroke off those bipartisan talks. What they said is that they wanted to \nuse the regular order, move through the committee and present the \nSenate a bill. The Republicans blocked the Finance Committee bill on a \npoint of order in December, even though they could have amended it. \nThey could have said: Look, we don't like this but we will offer \nsomething else. We do not like this but we will amend this bill and \nhave up-or-down votes on amendments.\n  The Republicans refused to negotiate for a 3-week period of time, as \nthey did mostly throughout the fall. There were no negotiations in \nlarge measure because Republicans delayed. First, they didn't like \nvirtually the shape of the table. Then they didn't like who was in the \nroom. They came up with reason after reason why we could not sit down \nand talk: delay, inaction, and ultimately a conflict that could not be \nresolved.\n  In negotiations, the Republicans insisted on a couple of issues: \nrepeal of\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nthe alternative minimum tax and an acceleration of the rates passed \nlast spring. The session ended, obviously, without agreement. We got \nnowhere. They insisted on these issues. We had ideas they didn't like. \nSo we ended in a stalemate last December.\n  Over the break I kept examining ways that we might break the impasse, \ntry to find ways with which to deal with the clear inability we had at \nthe end of last year to come to some resolution. So what I did was to \nwork with staff and examine just where the overlay was. Certainly all \nthat the Republicans had proposed was not foreign to what the Democrats \nhad suggested. And all that the Democrats had proposed was not foreign \nto what the Republicans had suggested. So we came up with a diagram \nthat kind of looks like a MasterCard, ironically.\n  You take the circle on the right-hand side and these two columns \nrepresent basically what the Democrats insisted ought to be in an \neconomic stimulus package. We wanted to increase the unemployment \nbenefits. We wanted to provide coverage for part-time workers and \nrecent hires. Republicans said: Oh, no, we can't do that. That is \nripping off the Federal Government. How terrible it would be if we gave \nthose benefits to unemployed workers. Heavens. We can't afford that.\n  Affordable group health coverage for the unemployed, we can't do \nthat. We aren't going to start new entitlements, for Heaven's sake. \nLet's get real here.\n  Job creation tax credit for business is something they said might be \na possibility but that clearly isn't as good as a corporate AMT repeal.\n  Republicans had ideas we did not like. We did not like the \naccelerated rate reduction. When I say ``we,'' I am talking about \nprobably 95 percent of the Democratic caucus. We did not like corporate \nAMT repeal, or health coverage for the unemployed going through the \nindividual insurance market, pitting an individual against a company, \nan individual with a preexisting condition, and just saying good luck--\nwe can't do that.\n  What I said was if we can't do that, and they don't want us to do it, \nhow about if we do the things we both said might work? We both said we \nwanted to extend unemployment benefits.\n  Again, when I say ``we both,'' there were proposals for these issues \nby large numbers on both sides of the aisle. Not every single Member, \nbut tax rebates, bonus depreciation, and 62 Senators voted for fiscal \nrelief for States--62.\n  Republicans, to a Governor, across the country, are saying if you are \ngoing to do us any good at all, if you are going to help us at all, \ngive us some relief, especially through Medicaid. Letter after letter \nfrom Governors has come to the attention of every Member of this \nSenate, urging support for that fiscal relief.\n  That was a bona fide effort to try to find common ground. I know the \nRepublicans do not like that either because what they said, basically--\nand what they are saying this morning--is if you don't give us \neverything in our circle, we don't want to have an economic stimulus \npackage. It is all of this or it is nothing at all.\n  We aren't saying if it isn't all of this it is nothing at all. We are \nsaying we will just take what is here and it's a ticket to conference \nand then let's see what happens. What could possibly be wrong with \nsending a bill to conference, allowing both the House, the Senate, and \nthe White House to work out a compromise? They don't want to do that. \nThey are saying it is this entire package or we don't want to work with \nyou. We don't want a consensus. We don't want a bill.\n  They have said that now for 3 weeks. They have rejected the common \nground approach. They are continuing to insist on two things that I \nhope everybody fully appreciates before they vote this morning. They \nare insisting on making the estate tax repeal and the Bush tax cuts \npermanent--that is what they are insisting on.\n  Making the estate tax repeal permanent presents two concerns. If we \nare serious about listening to the Budget Committee recommendations, \nthe principles the Budget Committee suggested ought to guide us, then I \ncan't imagine that anybody with a straight face would say we want to \nrepeal the estate tax permanently now under the guise of economic \nstimulus.\n  First of all, the Budget Committee said--didn't they?--that you have \nto make sure it is temporary and that it is immediate. This does not \ntake effect until the year 2011. There may be a recession in 2011, and \nit might be nice to be able to deal with that 2011 recession, but not \nwith the recession happening in the year 2002.\n  This thing costs $104 billion. We agreed the entire stimulus package \nshould not be more than $75 billion, but they want to spend $104 \nbillion of Social Security money to make it permanent when it doesn't \ntake effect until the year 2011.\n  The tax cut, they want to make it permanent. CBO has provided an \nestimate of $350 billion in the first 10 years, $4 trillion in the \nsecond 10. There is nothing cost effective about that. And it, too, \ndoes not take effect until 2011. Again, what is the stimulative value \nof a tax provision that takes place in the year 2011? What is the \nwisdom--I guess that is the word I am looking for--what is the wisdom \nof exacerbating our already growing deficit this year by adding $350 \nbillion more?\n  I don't know the answers to those questions, but I know this. On a \nbipartisan basis the Budget Committee said this is not the direction we \nshould go.\n  On a bipartisan basis, they said let us try to contain the cost. \nLet's do something stimulative, and do something immediate--not in the \nyear 2011, but now.\n  Really, there are only two choices. We can pass it, or we can block \nit. I do not know of anything else.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will pass it. I hope they won't \nblock it. I hope we will do the right thing. I hope we will send the \nmeasure to conference so that we can try to work through these issues \nand resolve them and come back with a bill which we can support and \nmove on to other priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S391-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 48, the nays \nare 47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is unfortunate we were unable to \nmove the economic stimulus legislation forward, but I hope at the very \nleast we could recognize, as we have in past recessions, that at some \npoint one has to acknowledge the pain, the uncertainty, the financial \ndifficulty that so many families are facing. In 1992, we extended \nunemployment benefits for up to 59 weeks. In 1982, we extended them for \nup to 49 weeks. In 1974, we extended them for up to 65 weeks. I ask \nunanimous consent that we extend them for at least 13 weeks now.\n  I have been discussing the matter with our Republican colleagues, and \nthey have had the opportunity to view the language. Let me make one \nother clarification. This is a simple extension of current law. There \nis no other\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nextraneous matter, and there is no other issue I would suggest at this \npoint be included in the extension. So for all Senators, this is simply \nan extension of current law as we now have it enacted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2819\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a program of temporary extended unemployment \n                             compensation)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I send an amendment to the desk regarding 13 weeks' \nextension of unemployment benefits. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot object, I believe what Senator Daschle is offering is something \nthat this Senate should support in a bipartisan fashion. I ask \nunanimous consent to add to Senator Daschle's request an amendment to \nthe same bill relative to unemployment insurance benefits, which had 57 \nvotes and 3 absentees who are present today, a sufficient number that \nit be included in this unanimous consent request. It is an effort to \nimprove and increase unemployment insurance benefits by $25 a week to \ntry to keep up with the cost of inflation but, more importantly, to \ncover temporarily displaced workers as well as expand coverage to low-\nwage and recent hires. This money is all Federal money going to the \nStates. Governors have entire discretion as to whether or not they want \nto enhance the unemployment insurance benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent to amend the request of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, our majority leader, to include this amendment, which I \nnow send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I hope our colleagues on the other side give the Senator \nfrom Illinois an opportunity to raise this issue. This is a very modest \nrequest to include this amendment as part of the package. The other \nmeasures of the bill obviously are going to have to be addressed some \nother way, but I cannot imagine anyone in this Chamber, regardless of \nparty, who would deny people who have lost jobs under the circumstance \nof this past number of months would want to turn down what the Senator \nfrom Illinois is suggesting. This is basic stuff for people who are \nhurting, and I urge my colleagues on the other side, whatever \ndifferences we may have on other issues, please do not disagree with \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we \ndebated this before. If my colleague from South Dakota wants to, we \nhave a couple of amendments on our side we did not get a vote on that I \nbelieve we would have a majority vote on as well.\n  Now I oppose the amendment of my colleague from Illinois because he \nis expanding a program that we have never done before. The majority \nleader mentioned all the times we have expanded unemployment \ncompensation in the past. We have never done that for temporary \nworkers. That is a brand new expansion that doubles the cost. That \nincreases the cost from about $8 billion to $16 billion. So with great \nrespect, I object to the unanimous consent request of my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthe proposal the Senator from Illinois offered should be commended. It \nhas been objected to. I certainly hope, the amendment having been \nobjected to, that the proposal being put forward by the majority leader \nwould not be objected to, which is a simple extension for an additional \n13 weeks of unemployment insurance under the current arrangement, as I \nunderstand it.\n  I ask the majority leader, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is far overdue already. There are people now out \nof work who are hurting. The unemployment insurance for many of them \nhas already run out. For others, it will soon run out. This is not an \neffort, as the Senator from Oklahoma indicated, to broaden the program \nin terms of its beneficiaries or its benefits. It is simply to extend \nit in order to take care of people who are in real and desperate need.\n  So I very much hope the request of the majority leader will be \nhonored and we will at least be able to move on that aspect of this \nproblem. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, but I do object to the fact we are standing in the Senate \ntoday, and we are taking care of one group of people --and we need to \nand I support it--in extending unemployment benefits, but there are \nmillions of others who are sitting in their offices watching us working \nwho are afraid that tomorrow may be their day and we are not doing \nanything to help them keep their jobs. We may be giving them \nunemployment checks, but we are doing absolutely nothing for the \nmillions and millions of people in America who watch us on television \nas their neighbors get laid off, who watch what is going on around the \ncountry with layoffs, who think they may be next. We have done nothing \nto help them keep their jobs. We have done nothing in this bill. We \nwill do nothing to help those who have been laid off, who are going to \nget unemployment checks, to get a paycheck again. That has been the \nfight all along.\n\n  The President from day 1 said we need to extend benefits. We have \nbeen unanimously supportive of extending unemployment benefits for \nanother 13 weeks. The problem has been, and consistently is, what are \nwe going to do about the people who want a paycheck, not an \nunemployment check? What are we going to do about the people who are in \njobs right now who are worried about losing their jobs? What are we \ngoing to do to help those businesses survive? What are we going to do \nabout helping those individuals who are afraid of what might happen, \nnot what has already happened? That is the problem with what has \nhappened in the Senate. We have provided no security for the 90-plus \npercent of Americans who have jobs that they will be able to keep their \njobs. That is the real unfortunate situation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, could I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will first, again, propound the \nunanimous consent request, and then I will yield to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be withdrawn. So \nI propound the unanimous consent request once more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I, \ntoo, want to say this is too little to late. The Senator from Maryland \nis right. We would like to have done more. We would like to have helped \nall the people of this country. We could have had a stimulus package if \nwe had had a compromise. We could have had a stimulus package that \nwould have stabilized our economy, that would have preserved jobs. We \ncould have given tax relief to people so they could have spent their \nown money that they earned.\n  So I hope this modest proposal that would extend the benefits for 13 \nweeks is not the end. I hope it is the beginning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I \nheard my colleague from Pennsylvania speak; I heard my colleague from \nTexas speak. My colleague from Pennsylvania was talking about the \nproblem being this or that and we need to make sure people are able to \ngo back to work.\n  Obviously, political truth can be elusive and there can be different \ndefinitions of what we need to do. Most of the people I have talked to \nin coffee shops in Minnesota cannot figure out how $1 billion for this \nmultinational and $1 billion for that multinational\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nand $13 billion of tax breaks helps them. But that is almost beside the \npoint.\n  The real problem is this. We can put aside all of our differences, \nbecause we have different views about what needs to be done, and we can \nsay: Let's help people right now. Right now. No more rhetoric. No more \nspeeches.\n  People are flat on their backs, through no fault of their own. Can we \nnot just at least have a straight extension of unemployment insurance? \nThat is all this vote is on now. The majority leader is asking for \nunanimous consent for that alone. That is it. Let's end the speeches \nand end the rhetoric and just support him.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as I stated on the floor earlier \nthis week, I support a 13 week extension of unemployment Insurance. I \ndo so as an issue of basic fairness to help and protect those who have \nbeen hurt by the economic downturn. Unemployed workers need assistance \nnow.\n  There are people in my State of California, and indeed across the \ncountry, who need an extension not because they have not been looking \nfor a job, but because the downturn in the economy has made jobs \ndifficult to keep, and even more difficult to find.\n  As I stated earlier this week, there are over a million people \nunemployed in California, and since September 11, unemployment benefits \nhave run out for 190,000 Californians.\n  Because an average of 40 percent of Californians who go on \nunemployment exhaust their regular unemployment benefits, over 360,000 \npeople in California alone could be helped by receiving this 13-week \nextension.\n  These are the people who would be immediately helped by an extension \nof unemployment benefits.\n  Throughout the United States, workers are running out of unemployment \nbenefits while competing for less and less open jobs. In New York, \nthere are 515,000 people without jobs, and over 90,000 of them have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits since September 11. The same is \ntrue for 86,000 Texans, 47,000 Floridians, and 52,000 people from \nIllinois. In Pennsylvania, over 300,000 people are unemployed, and \nalmost 47,000 of them have exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n  Extending unemployment coverage will benefit more than 600,000 people \nnationwide, and help revive an economy that needs a boost to get back \non its feet.\n  Since the program's inception in 1934, Unemployment Insurance has \nserved time and again to act as a stabilizing device--providing direct \neconomic assistance to people who are likely to spend any additional \nmoney in providing basic needs for themselves and their families.\n  The need is no different now. As an issue of basic fairness, I \nstrongly believe that the Senate should act to extend UI benefits by 13 \nweeks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there is good news today for working \nmen and women across the Nation.\n  For months, we have fought to extend unemployment benefits for the \nmillions of workers who need them in this troubled economy. Today, \nafter weeks of debate, our opponents in the Senate finally relented. \nThey joined us to pass a 13-week extension for all laid-off workers who \nhave exhausted their benefits.\n  Since the beginning of the recession more than 2 million workers have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits. Extending benefits will help \nthese workers, including nearly sixty thousand workers in Massachusetts \nwho have lost their jobs, and are still looking for new employment. \nThey have been refinancing their homes, and in some cases, even selling \nthem, just to make ends meet.\n  The battle is not over. We still need to get approval from the House \nof Representatives. And then it is up to President Bush to honor the \ncommitment he made in his State of the Union speech to make this \nachievement a reality for our workers.\n  Unfinished business remains. Outdated unemployment rules exclude \nhundreds of thousands of workers who have been laid-off through no \nfault of their own. Laid-off part-time and low-wage workers have paid \ninto the system, but often fail to receive the benefits they need. \nRecent data suggest that only 18 percent of unemployed low-wage workers \nwere collecting benefits. For months, we have fought to expand coverage \nto benefit more than 600,000 additional unemployed part-time and low-\nwage workers. We will not give up that fight.\n  We have also fought to increase weekly unemployment benefits by the \ngreater of $25 a week, or 15 percent. Currently, unemployment benefits \ndo not replace enough lost wages to keep workers out of poverty. In \n2000, average unemployment benefits replaced only 33 percent of \nworkers' lost income, a major reduction from the 46 percent of workers' \nwages replaced by jobless benefits during the recessions of the 1970's \nand 1980's. During an economic crisis, unemployed workers have few \nopportunities to rejoin a declining workforce. They depend on \nunemployment benefits. We will continue to work for a benefit increase \nto ensure that laid-off workers are not impoverished during periods of \nunemployment.\n  Benefit levels are too low for laid-off workers to afford the health \ncare they need. Health premiums can cost nearly $600 a month for a \nfamily--most of an unemployment check. That is why only about one in \nfive laid-off workers today continue their coverage, even if they are \neligible. For months, we have fought to pass an economic recovery plan \nthat would cover 75 percent of the health care premium for those who \nare eligible to continue their coverage, but can't afford the cost.\n  Some workers are not eligible for any continuing health plan. Our \nplan would have allowed states to cover these vulnerable workers. Taken \ntogether, our plan would have ensured that men and women who lose their \njobs don't have to worry about losing their health insurance as well. \nWe cannot let our workers down when it comes to health care. America \ndeserves better.\n  We have also fought to provide fiscal relief to the states, which \nface serious budget shortfalls, yet must meet yearly balanced budget \nrequirements. We have been working to increase Medicaid payments, so \nthat states don't have to cut back on coverage, just as more workers \nneed help. This is the top priority for Republican and Democratic \nGovernors. We should provide our States relief now.\n  The American people have strongly supported our efforts to give \nworkers the support and assistance they deserve. But some of our \ncolleagues in Congress have stalled our efforts to help these \ncourageous workers. Democrats have proposed an effective and balanced \nplan to stimulate the faltering economy, but throughout the past few \nmonths, our opponents have used procedural maneuvers to block the \nmeasure. When House and Senate negotiators tried to reach a compromise, \nour opponents delayed it at every turn.\n  They were unwilling to support any recovery package unless it \ncontained tens of billions of dollars for new tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals and corporations, including $250 million in tax breaks for \nEnron. It makes no sense to hold laid-off workers hostage to such \nirresponsible and costly tax breaks.\n  Our opponents consistently offered plans that fail the nation's \nworkers. They offered a plan to extend unemployment benefits, but only \nto laid-off workers in a few states. They offered a plan to use \nNational Emergency Grants for unemployment insurance, health care and \njob training--guaranteeing that few funds would actually go to \nunemployment insurance. They offered a plan to provide Reed Act \ndistributions that would primarily be used for state tax cuts and could \ngo into state unemployment trust funds, instead of offering new or \nextended benefits.\n  Today, we will vote to extend unemployment benefits for 13 weeks, \nsomething we have done in every recession. Today, we will celebrate our \nlong-fought for victory. Tomorrow, we will continue the fight for \nAmerica's workers.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, over the past nearly 5 months, the \nentire Nation has been inspired by the grit, bravery and selflessness \nof the workers at the World Trade Center site who have labored around \nthe clock on the rescue and recovery efforts. The courageous images of \nfirefighters, police officers, emergency medical personnel, \nconstruction workers and clergy have inspired workers throughout the \ncountry.\n  There are many other images of New York, however, that have not been \nshown on the news, but that are also\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nthe heart-wrenching results of the terrible September 11 attack and a \nweak economy.\n  These images that our Nation has not seen, but that everyone here \nknows all too well, are the faces of hundreds of New Yorkers who have \nfound themselves without a job. These are the workers whose jobs were \nliterally destroyed, jobs when the Twin Towers collapsed: The janitors, \nthe doormen, the waiters and waitresses, the secretaries, and \nmessengers.\n  Or, the workers who did not work in lower Manhattan, but who have \nfelt the ripple effect of the so-called frozen zone primarily the hotel \nworkers and small businesses owners.\n  In New York State, we have 71 percent more workers on Unemployment \nInsurance than we did one year ago. In New York City, we are \nexperiencing unemployment rates that we haven't seen in years. In \nDecember, the unemployment rate continued to spike up to 7.4 percent--\n2.4 percent above the national average for the same period. New York \nCity is expected to lose 150,000 jobs in the aftermath of September 11 \nand we are not expected to rebound until 2004.\n  What is happening to our unemployed who are waiting for the economy \nto rebound? Well, let me tell you--in the last quarter alone, over \n65,000 unemployed workers exhausted their UI benefits.\n  Over the past two weeks, I have received hundreds of calls and pleas \nfrom my constituents in New York--some are being evicted from their \nhomes, others are uncertain how they will continue to put food on their \ntables, and all are desperate to go back to work.\n  Senator Daschle has put forward a proposal to extend unemployment for \nan additional 13 weeks. This proposal is not only the right thing to do \nfor our thousands of workers who are without a job, but it is the right \nthing to do for the economy. In fact, some experts argue that extending \nunemployment insurance is more likely than any other policy to \nstimulate the economy.\n  We may not agree on a comprehensive package to stimulate the economy, \nbut I think we all agree that we must do the right thing for the \nworkers of this country by extending unemployment insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2819) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 622), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I hope the House will take the matter \nup immediately, perhaps as early as this afternoon, and get it to the \nPresident. As has been noted, the President has indicated already he \nsupports the extension. I think it is now up to the House to do their \npart so that these people will be a little more confident they can be \ngiven some assistance now. Too many of them have already run out of \nbenefits to which they are entitled. We have to act now.\n  For those who have lamented the fact we could not reach a compromise, \n56 Senators went on record today looking for that compromise. We only \nfell four short. There were a couple of absentees. So there is no doubt \nthat there is a growing percentage, an overwhelming majority, in my \nview, who want to move forward. I would have only hoped some of those \nwho lamented this could have supported cloture so we could have had the \nticket to conference. We were denied that.

Madam President, I thank the majority leader and also \nappreciate his willingness to modify the unemployment compensation \namendment to make it basically universal for all States for 13 weeks. I \nthink that is fair, appropriate, and supported by all Senators. I am \nglad we were able to pass it. I encourage my colleagues in the House to \npass it as well.\n  Also, our colleague and friend, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, has \nsuggested improvements to be made on the adoption credit. Senator \nBunning also has an amendment dealing with adoption and deductibility. \nWe will work with both colleagues to see if we cannot come up with a \npackage in the not too distant future that I hope all of our colleagues \nwill pass and likewise I hope the House will favorably review.\n  I make one additional comment. I am disappointed we have not been \nsuccessful at making the bridge in partisan warfare to pass the \nstimulus package to help create jobs. I urge our colleagues not to be \nquite so fast in the future with cloture votes. I didn't like cloture \nvotes when this side offered them, and I don't like them when the other \nside offers them. It denies the Senators the opportunity to offer \namendments. We had several amendments on this side that we could not \noffer because of cloture. If cloture were invoked, they would not have \nthe ability to offer a permanent R amendment, which I believe has a \nmajority vote; we could not offer making the death tax repeal \npermanent, which I believe has a majority vote; we could not offer an \namendment that Senator Domenici was pushing for, a payroll tax holiday, \nwhich many people on both sides of the aisle say has merit.\n  I hope in the future, when we are talking about the farm bill--and I \nbelieve we will go to the farm bill soon--I urge the majority leader \nnot to move forward with cloture. Consider amendments. No one I know \nwants to filibuster the farm bill, no one was filibustering the \nstimulus package, but we had several provisions in the stimulus package \nto try to make it truly stimulative and create jobs. When we get to the \nfarm bill, I hope the first thing we look at is not a cloture vote. \nSome Members want an amendment to have payment limitations so some \nfarmers are not making millions--corporate farmers are not making \nmillions out of the farm bill. We find out they are under present law. \nSo there is an amendment to have payment limitations. Those amendments \nwould fall if cloture were invoked.\n\n  I urge our colleagues to offer amendments, be timely, be considerate \nof others, have good debate, find out where the votes are, and, \nhopefully, not go through the idea of a cloture vote, and if we don't \nget cloture we pull the bill down. That is a recipe for getting nothing \ndone. That is how the stimulus bill did not pass. We cannot get 60 \nvotes; we will pull the bill down. I wish that were not the result.\n  I suggested we maybe take up the stimulus bill and consider X number \nof amendments on each side and pass the\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nbill. That was not the way the majority leader went on this bill. That \nis fine. That was his decision. I think it is regrettable. I think we \ncould have done some things to increase employment, increase jobs.\n  I hope when we take up the agriculture bill, it will not be under \ncloture, it will be with both sides offering constructive amendments to \nimprove a bill that is in desperate need of improvement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I commend Senator Daschle, the majority \nleader, for his leadership on this very important measure to extend \nunemployment benefits. I am pleased this has received the unanimous \nsupport of this entire Senate. It is an outstanding issue that needs to \nbe addressed today. There are millions of Americans who are exhausting \nbenefits as we speak. Looking forward, the prospect is that more and \nmore Americans will exhaust their benefits. The benefit extension is \njust simple justice for these Americans and will also provide real \nstimulus for our economy.\n  The reality is, if you have been laid off from work and you are \ndepending upon unemployment checks, you are not typically putting that \ncheck under your mattress. You are going out and buying food, buying \nclothes for your children, paying your rent, doing those things that \nwill put resources directly and immediately into the economy. That is \nthe whole point of any stimulus proposal, to put resources directly and \nimmediately into the economy.\n  That is why I have to take exception to the comments of some of our \ncolleagues who talk about the fact that we have not done anything to \nstimulate the economy, to help secure the jobs of those who are still \nworking.\n  Frankly, we can tell a lot about people from what they support and \nwhat they reject. If Members support the permanency of the estate tax, \nthey should know that is not at all stimulative. It occurs 10 years \nfrom now, long after we have worked through this economic cycle one way \nor the other. It provides no immediate stimulus. It provides no \nimmediate incentive for behavior because the estate tax comes with \ndeath--not a conscious decision by most people. So it has no \nstimulative effect. That is what they are proposing to help the \nAmericans who are working today. It will not help people today. It will \nhelp a very few, and 10 years from now.\n  Now, they reject proposals such as Senator Daschle's proposal to \nprovide a rebate for working Americans who did not pay income tax. It \nwas quite disturbing to me that the insinuation was that these people \nare not part of our economy; they did not pay income taxes, why should \nthey get any rebates?\n  What those Members misperceive and misunderstand is the huge \ncontributions that these millions of poor, working Americans make, in a \nrange of endeavors, that immensely help our economy. They work very \nhard and, at the same time, payroll taxes are some of the most \nregressive taxes that Americans pay. As a result, these individuals \nshould get some relief. Again, most likely those resources would go \ndirectly and immediately back into the economy.\n  So the arguments by the other side--their claims that nothing has \nbeen done to help Americans who are working today--are not consistent \nwith the proposals they make and the proposals to which they object.\n  If you look in the President's budget, you'll find another indication \nof the insensitivity, I would say, to the issue of Americans struggling \nto keep their jobs and struggling to find jobs--a significant reduction \nin job training funds. These moneys are necessary to put people back \ninto the workplace, to give individuals the skills they need to enhance \ntheir jobs or even keep their jobs in a tough, competitive climate.\n  So the rhetoric about doing nothing to stimulate the economy is just \nthat. Senator Daschle made proposals that would stimulate this economy \nwithout long-run detrimental effects to our fiscal discipline.\n  That stimulus package, that I would argue is the only real stimulus \npackage, was rejected by the other side. So we are left to do something \nthat is absolutely necessary, necessary both on the grounds of \nproviding justice for Americans and also on the grounds of providing \nsome limited stimulus for our economy.\n  There are nearly 5 million workers who are out of the job market but \nwant to work. Many have left the job market because they have been \ndiscouraged, which factors into the slightly lower unemployment rate \nlast month. The unemployment rate went down not because there are more \njobs. In fact, we lost jobs. The unemployment rate went down as people \nleft the labor force, many discouraged by the lack of employment \nopportunities. For those people and for others, these unemployment \nbenefits are important.\n  In January, more than 2.5 million people had been unemployed for 15 \nweeks or longer, and nearly half of those people had been unemployed \nfor more than 6 months. We have in the past responded to that dilemma, \nthat crisis, by extending unemployment benefits. I am pleased today \nthis body has taken action to do that.\n  Even if the economy begins to recover, this problem will stay with \nus. At the end of the recessions of the last several decades, \nunemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, continued to linger. \nOn average, long-term unemployment rates grew for 9 months after the \nofficial end of the recession. So even if today--and I think we are \nunsure of this--even if today we are seeing some change in economic \nconditions, we will still see continued unemployment problems and we \nwill still have to respond to it.\n  Indeed, this effort should be bipartisan because, not only in this \nSenate but throughout the country, I believe most people recognize the \nright thing to do and the smart thing to do is to give unemployed \nindividuals a chance to get benefits until they get the opportunity to \nwork again. Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has \npointed it out. His words:\n\n       I have always been in favor of extending unemployment \n     benefits during periods of rising unemployment. Clearly you \n     cannot argue that somebody who runs past the 26-week level \n     is slow for not looking for a job or not actively seeking \n     to get re-employed. There are just no jobs out there.\n\n  Those are Chairman Greenspan's words. We have to respond to that, \nrecognize that, and I am pleased that the majority leader today took \nthat action and received the support of this Senate.\n  About a week ago Senator Collins and I wrote to Senator Daschle and \nto Senator Lott and urged them to move on this measure if we could not \nfind a compromise on the stimulus package. Again, I am pleased today \nthis measure is moving forward. It does make sense. It is good policy \nwith respect to people who need help. It is good for the economy. These \nresources will go back immediately and directly into our economy, \nhelping to spur, we hope, consumer demand and help us out of this \nrecession.\n  I commend the majority leader. I am pleased we are able at least to \naccomplish this today. I hope we can return to the stimulus debate \nagain, but a debate about real stimulus proposals, not a debate about \nthe warmed over tax proposals of last spring, the second phase of the \ntax cuts, the second phase of those tax cuts that contributed and will \ncontribute more to the deficit in the years ahead.\n  Instead of those warmed over proposals, let's look at things that \nwill help Americans and the American economy directly, immediately, in \nthis quarter, not 10 years from now. Let's do those things.\n  I hope when we return to this debate we will be conscious of trying \nto stimulate the economy and not simply trying to rehash old tax \nproposals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think we have a basic obligation to \nprovide relief to Americans who have lost their jobs. This is one of \nthe most fundamental responsibilities of this Congress. The extension \nof unemployment benefits today for an additional 13 weeks is a way of \ncarrying out that obligation.\n  We are all aware of the increase in the number of Americans who have \nlost their jobs as a result of this recession. Every one of our States \nis feeling it. Michigan alone has over 300,000 workers who have lost \ntheir jobs, and that number, as the numbers in many of our States, is \nlikely to continue to rise in the coming months.\n  I am terribly disappointed we could not agree on a economic stimulus \npackage, but that is no excuse for failing to address the plight of \nAmericans who have lost their jobs. Extending unemployment benefits is \nnot just about doing what is right and doing what is equitable and \ndoing what is fair; it is elementary economics. It is common sense. \nProviding additional unemployment benefits is a very good economic \nstimulus.\n  The Department of Labor has found that for every dollar invested in \nunemployment insurance, we generate $2.15 for our gross domestic \nproduct. So putting money into the hands of people who need it, we are \nalso putting money into the hands of people who are going to spend it. \nThat helps our economy. That helps create jobs.\n  I congratulate Senator Daschle for offering this legislation today, \nand I hope now that the House will promptly pass it.\n  I thank my friend from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chamber seems to be filled with congratulatory \nmessages. We are congratulating ourselves that we have finally acted, \nwhen, in fact, all we have done is the least possible, minimum, lowest \ncommon denominator kind of action, and we have demonstrated our \ninability to act on any kind of visionary plan.\n  The majority leader says he will be happy to bring this subject up \nagain if there is an indication that we can get something upon which we \ncan agree. There is an indication that we can get something upon which \nwe can agree, that we can get something that is a compromise, that we \ncan get something that cuts across party lines. That is the proposal \nmade by the Centrist Coalition.\n  I have been a member of the Centrist Coalition, and its predecessor \nnames of the group, ever since I came to the Senate in 1993. We started \nout holding meetings in Senator John Chafee's hideaway. John Chafee was \nthe founder of this group. He said, let's reach across party lines and \nsee if we can't put partisanship aside and come up with some kind of a \nsolution. We have had our good moments. We have had our disappointing \nmoments. But we have hung together as a group, even as the membership \nhas changed in the years since I have been here.\n  The Centrist Coalition, involving Democrats and Republicans, \ninvolving people of very strong positions on the liberal side of issues \nand very strong positions on the conservative side of issues, have \nsaid: For the good of the country, let's see if we can't fashion a \npackage that makes sense. And the majority leader will not allow a vote \non that package.\n  He will not allow us even to debate it. He will not allow us to bring \nit up. He will not allow people who were not part of the Centrist \nCoalition to offer amendments. Then as he shuts the process down, he \nsays: I am open to any suggestion from anybody. I will take him at his \nword, and I have a suggestion for him. I say to the majority leader, \nbring up the Centrist Coalition stimulus package backed by Republicans \nas well as Democrats. Put it on the floor and allow it to be amended by \nthose who say it isn't wonderful; allow the normal parliamentary \nprocedure to go forward; and then allow it to come to a vote.\n  I suggest to you that if the majority leader really believes we need \na stimulus package, if he is really true to his word that he is open to \nany suggestion, if he really does want to move in this direction, that \nis the way he should go. But he has not allowed that. He has not \nallowed a vote. Let us understand that.\n  There is a proposal. It is not a series of rehashed tax ideas, as the \nSenator from Rhode Island suggested, about some of the things people on \nthis aisle wanted to put in. It is something worked out by a group of \nRepublicans and Democrats acting in good faith and in consultation with \nthe White House--reaching out beyond the Congress to get the opinion of \nthe President of the United States, and receiving from the President \nthe comment that, well, it is not exactly what I want but I would be \nwilling to sign it.\n  It seems to me this is an extraordinary moment in cooperation, \nreaching out, and resolution that the majority leader will not allow to \ncome up. This is an extraordinary opportunity which the majority leader \nwill not allow to happen.\n  I hope the majority leader reconsiders. I hope he recognizes that \ntaking a strong partisan position on one side, or taking a strong \npartisan position on the other side, has been proven ineffective; that \nhe recognizes that there are those of us who have spent time talking to \neach other across the aisle outside of the partisan straitjacket who \nhave reached out in an effort to find a compromise that makes sense, \nwho have crafted something that we think will pass and the President \nhas indicated he will sign, and that this is available to the majority \nleader and to the country if the majority leader will simply allow it \nto come to a vote.\n  Mr. President, as you and others know, my father served in this body \nfor 24 years. My first experience here was sitting up in the family \ngallery as a teenager watching the Senate operate as I tried to \nunderstand it. My father said something that was very profound. When \npeople would say to him, why didn't you do this or why didn't you do \nthat, he would say: We legislate at the highest level at which we can \nobtain a majority.\n  I think there is a majority for the centrist package. I ask the \nmajority leader to let us find out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S397-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S397-S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEED FOR AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over four months after the idea was \noriginally proposed, the Senate remains divided on an economic stimulus \npackage.\n  Much has changed since an economic stimulus was first proposed in \nresponse to the September 11 attacks. Both the stock markets and the \neconomy have proved to be more resilient than economists had expected.\n  Moreover, there are signs, as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \ntold the Budget Committee last month, that some of the forces that have \nbeen restraining the economy over the past year are starting to loosen \ntheir strangle hold. The Fed Chairman told the Committee that ``while 3 \nmonths ago, [a stimulus package] was clearly a desirable action . . . I \ndo not think it is a critically important issue to do. I think the \neconomy will recover in any event.''\n  Aside from the positive economic data that have been released by \ngovernment agencies in recent weeks, there is already a significant \namount of stimulus in the pipelines.\n  That's not to say that we are home free. As Chairman Greenspan \npointed out last month, the economy could go either way at this point. \nMost troubling is the higher unemployment rate since last year.\n  However, we must not delude ourselves into thinking that an economic \nstimulus package--whether crafted by Democrats or Republicans--is some \nsort of panacea. Stimulus packages can't work miracles. We have a $10 \ntrillion economy. That's gross domestic product--the total of all \nspending. We cannot flip the economy over like a pancake. A boost of \n$70 billion to $100 billion would amount to less than 1 percent of GDP.\n  Nobody can say at this point with certainty in which direction the \neconomy is headed.\n  What we know is that, since the recession began last March, the Labor \nDepartment reports that 1.8 million\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\nworkers have lost their jobs. We could address this problem by \ntemporarily extending unemployment insurance.\n  What we do not know, is whether a more comprehensive stimulus package \nat this point is really necessary.\n  I submit that the danger we face is not that the economy won't turn \naround--inevitably it will--but that we may unnecessarily worsen our \nbudgetary position by taking unnecessary, but politically popular, \naction on a so-called ``stimulus package.''\n  Any stimulus package, at least in the short-term, will increase the \nprojected budget deficits for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. We may well \nneed to devote more resources to our military overseas and to homeland \ndefense, and we will have to bear the costs of doing so.\n  The erosion in the budget picture over the past year, along with the \ndefense and homeland security demands placed on our budget and the \ninevitable long-term Social Security and Medicare deficits \novershadowing the retirement of the baby-boomers, suggests that tough \nchoices must be made as to whether the limited dollars we spend will \nprovide a worthwhile return on our investment. From what we have seen \nfrom experts ranging from the Federal Reserve Chairman, to \nCongressional Budget Office officials, to private-sector economists, a \nstimulus package does not meet that test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to comment \non the Senate's inability to pass an economic stimulus package. I, like \nmost of my colleagues, wanted to pass an economic stimulus package. We \nwanted to pass such a package not only at the end of last year, but at \nthe beginning of this year in order to jump start our economy.\n  Finally, the majority leader allowed us an opportunity to look at an \neconomic stimulus bill. But it wasn't a bill that came out of the \nSenate Finance Committee nor was it the bipartisan/centrist proposal \noffered by my colleagues and which the President said he would support. \nInstead, it was a one-man show, put on the floor with no input from \nother Senators.\n  As I said on the floor almost 2 weeks ago, the Daschle substitute \namendment is much like a patient needing emergency treatment. Our only \nchoice was to patch it up.\n  So, for the last several days, we were performing emergency surgery--\none ``amendment bandage'' at a time. Some of my colleagues have since \ndescribed the stimulus package or the economy as a patient on life \nsupport.\n  While I am not a surgeon, I do take great pride in being the only \naccountant in the Senate. As a result, I think I have a good \nunderstanding of what is needed to help the economy. So, I had a few \namendments to offer to fix up the substitute amendment offered by the \nmajority leader, and to really help stimulate the economy.\n  One of those amendments would have repealed the special occupational \ntax on alcohol. This is an unfair tax imposed on all businesses that \nmanufacture, distribute or sell alcohol products. It is one of the most \negregious taxes to affect small businesses. My amendment would have \ntaken a regulation and tax off the books which the General Accounting \nOffice has concluded cost too much to administer compared to the \nrevenues it generates. That is a bad tax.\n  And it is unfair, too. The same tax is paid by little businesses as \nlarge ones. Let me explain. Right now, four small family-owned bait \nshops which sell beer pay as much in taxes as the nation's largest \nsingle site brewery--a whopping $1,000.\n  Repeal of this tax would have helped stimulate the economy. Last \nyear, rebate checks put $300 in American citizens' back pockets, and \nmost people went out and spent it-on much needed back-to-school clothes \nand supplies; toward that new computer; and to buy groceries.\n  My amendment would have put $250 to $500 back in the hands of small \n``Mom and Pop'' businesses around the country. In turn, those small \nbusinesses owners would have used that extra money to make more needed \npurchases or pay expenses.\n  I also had a couple other amendments to offer. One would have put \nmore money into the hands of charities, who in turn could buy needed \nsupplies, including food, clothing, shelter, blankets, medicine, and \nhygiene and other products. When charities buy these things they are \nnot only helping those in need, they are helping businesses and workers \nwho manufacture or sell those products or services. In a small, but \nimportant way, this would also stimulate the economy.\n  How would my amendment have done this? It would have allowed those \ncontributing their IRA's to charities to not have to pay a tax on the \ndistribution to the charity. In other words, the government won't be \nskimming money off the donation. As a result, charities would have had \nmore money, and the donors would have had the pleasure of giving more \nand the feeling of helping their communities and our nation.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle had good amendments to offer \ntoo. The senior Senator from Montana and I had a drought relief \namendment we could have used to help ranchers and farmers. I proudly \nendorsed our bipartisan amendment. Wyoming really needs the drought \nrelief contained in that piece of legislation.\n  The senior Senator from Texas had amendments to speed up the tax rate \nreductions and tax cuts implemented last year. Senator Bond had an \namendment that passed the Senate 92 to 0 to allow an increase in small \nbusinesses expensing. This would have given vital assistance to small \nbusinesses across this country affected by the recession we are in. The \nSenator from Idaho had an amendment to make the death tax repeal \npermanent.\n  Well, we do have a death right now to contend with, and it's a \ncasualty that even Senator Kyl's death tax amendment can't help. As my \ncolleague from Georgia explained, we are now having to pull the plug on \nan economic stimulus bill and will be attending a funeral on its \ndemise. Why? Because this country could have largely benefitted from a \nreasonable economic stimulus package, which now will not be passed.\n  Like my distinguished colleague Senator Miller said, we are all here \ngiving our eulogies. Those eulogies extend to those many amendments \ntruly meant to stimulate the economy. It is extremely disappointing we \nwill not be able to help the unemployed, or our American workers and \nsmall businesses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S398-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S398-S400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE NEED FOR A STIMULUS BILL\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, with the votes that have been cast this \nafternoon, we have once again shown the American people that we have \nput politics before their needs. Quite frankly, I think this body \nshould be ashamed that we could not rise above our party differences \nand give the American people a stimulus package that will help secure \nour economy, put people back to work and respond to the human suffering \nthat is occurring as a result of the recession.\n  Too often, it seems to me, we spend more time trying to score \npolitical points than addressing the needs of real people. And I can \ntell you, there are real needs in the State of Ohio. Despite claims \nthat an economic turn around is just around the corner, the citizens of \nmy State are still suffering the effects of this recession. Many more \nare ``shaking in their boots,'' wondering if they are going to be laid-\noff and the next to join the unemployment line.\n  Since the first week of December, we have had 320 companies in Ohio \nannounce their intention to lay-off workers, affecting nearly 70,000 \npeople.\n  Right now, we have some 191,000 people receiving unemployment \nbenefits, and each week, thousands file for initial benefits.\n  Also each week, around 3,000 people exhaust their benefits without \nhaving found another job.\n  In 2001, initial unemployment claims in my state jumped by 41.5 \npercent compared to 2000--the highest since 1992.\n  While the U.S. Department of Commerce reported a two tenths of a \npercent increase in the economy in the fourth quarter, I consider it \nanemic economic growth, which is providing little benefit--if any to \nthe men and women of Ohio.\n  We need robust growth, and a balanced stimulus package is critical to \ngetting us there.\n  The President was right on target in his State of the Union address \nlast\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nweek when he called for an economic stimulus. He did not advocate for a \npartisan stimulus measure, trying to maximize his political advantage, \nbut rather he elected to press for the stimulus proposal that was \ninitially proposed by the Senate Centrist Coalition.\n  I am a member of the Centrist Coalition, and I was proud to work with \nmy colleagues Senators Snowe, Collins, Breaux, Miller, and Ben Nelson \non a bipartisan measure that would be fair, would help stimulate the \neconomy and would respond to basic human needs.\n  This proposal does not have everything I, the other members of the \ncoalition, nor the President want. In fact, it includes items I might \nnot necessarily support as freestanding legislation. However, this \nproposal is the embodiment of compromise, and this is how it should be \nin an evenly divided Senate. That is why I cannot believe that members \nof this Senate have allowed economic stimulus to fail.\n  If we are to have any progress this year, we must work together as \nour constituents elected us to do.\n  I voted in favor of cloture on both versions of the stimulus package, \nsince I felt it necessary to move the process along and not demagogue \nthe issue just to score a political victory. I had hoped to move \nsomething along to a conference committee.\n  I think if we all had simply agreed to the majority leader's stimulus \npackage when he proposed it 2 weeks ago, we could have gone to \nconference with the House, hashed out our differences, and today we \ncould possibly be voting on a compromise stimulus bill.\n  Conversely, if the majority leader had recognized the bipartisan \nnature of the Centrist Coalition package--crafted by members of his own \nparty here in the Senate and passed by the House--we could possibly be \nat a bill signing ceremony today. However, the process has degenerated \ninto a political fight.\n  The Senate could pass a stimulus bill. Senator Grassley proposed a \nvery good compromise by offering the Centrist Coalition package, which \nshould have been adopted because it gets the job done.\n  In fact, I believe if the Senate was given the opportunity to cast a \nstraight ``up or down'' vote on the Grassley amendment, it would pass \nby a large margin since many in this Chamber actually want to pass a \nmeaningful stimulus bill.\n  However, that is not the way things sometimes work around here, and \nthe American people are the ones who suffer because they will not get \nthe economic relief they need. In the end, the only person who got what \nhe wanted was the majority leader. He did not want a bill, and he got \nhis wish.\n  Still, I think the American people deserve to know what the Senate \ncould have passed and what the Centrist Coalition package could have \nprovided in the way of economic stimulus to illustrate the good policy \nthat too often falls victim to partisan politics in this Chamber.\n  One thing the Centrist Coalition proposal would do is provide a real \nboost to roughly 38 million low-income workers who did not qualify for \nrebate checks last summer and fall. Those rebates would mean $13.5 \nbillion would go into the pockets of those individuals to help them \nthrough these difficult times. And I am sure it would help stimulate \nthe economy because they would likely spend that money rather than save \nit.\n  The Centrist Coalition package would also lower the marginal tax rate \non individual income from 27\\1/2\\ percent down to 25 percent. That \nmeans single people who make between $28,000 and $68,000 a year, and \nmarried couples who make between $47,000 and $113,000 a year would find \nadditional money in their pockets. About one-third of the taxpayers in \nthis nation, 36 million people, would benefit with these rate \nreductions.\n  Add the 38 million beneficiaries of the rebate checks, and the 36 \nmillion who would benefit from the reduction in marginal rates, and the \nCentrist Coalition package would help a majority of the roughly 100 \nmillion American households that file taxes.\n  The thing I would really like to concentrate on is the part of this \npackage that deals with health care. When we got started debating the \nstimulus package, the House passed a package that had something like $3 \nbillion for health care. Likewise, the President's package also had $3 \nbillion. The Democratic Finance Committee proposal was $16.7 billion. \nAt the end of the day, the Centrist Coalition and White House \ncompromise package had $21 billion in it for dislocated workers' health \ncare, and money for the States for national emergency grants, including \n$4 billion to the States for Medicaid funding. This is a tremendous \namount of help for the needy.\n  The Centrist Coalition proposal would also assist displaced workers \nby providing an extension of 13 weeks of unemployment benefits--\nbenefits that would be available to those who became unemployed between \nMarch 15, 2001, and December 31st of this year. An estimated 3 million \nunemployed workers would qualify for benefits averaging about $230 a \nweek. Those extended benefits would be 100-percent federally funded at \na cost of about $10 billion to the Federal Government, so States would \nnot have to pick up the tab.\n  The bill would allow states to accelerate the transfer of $9 billion \nfrom State unemployment trust funds so they could distribute that money \nearlier than now possible. This transfer of money, which already \nbelongs to the states, would help state treasuries, which are in dire \nstraits today.\n  With respect to health care benefits, the Centrist Coalition and \nWhite House compromise proposal would provide $19 billion in health \ncare assistance for all dislocated workers who are eligible for \nunemployment insurance with a refundable, advanceable tax credit for \nthe purchase of health insurance--not just individuals who are eligible \nfor COBRA coverage. This is an important distinction since the credit \nis available to unemployed people who do not have access to coverage \nthrough COBRA, since their employers did not provide health insurance \nor their employer went out of business. Under this bill, these \nindividuals would have been able to get a 60-percent subsidy of their \nhealth insurance costs without any cap on the dollar amount of subsidy.\n  The proposal also would include reforms to ensure that people have \naccess to health insurance coverage in the individual market. If a \nperson has 12 months of employer-sponsored coverage, rather than 18 \nmonths as under the current law, health insurers are required to issue \na policy and not impose any preexisting condition exclusion.\n  The Centrist and White House proposal also includes $4 billion in \nenhanced national emergency grants for the States which Governors could \nuse to help all workers--not just those eligible for the tax credit. \nThey could use this to pay for health insurance in both public and \nprivate plans. In other words, we would be paying $4 billion out to the \nStates so they can reach out and help people in their respective States \nwho are not covered by some of the particular provisions in the \nstimulus package.\n  The Centrist Coalition package would also provide a $4.6 billion, \none-time grant to assist States with their Medicaid programs. Our \nStates are in deep budgetary trouble because, unlike the Federal \nGovernment, they have to balance their budgets every year. The money \nisn't there for them to take care of the many needs they face. This \n$4.6 billion grant would go out to the States to help them provide \nMedicaid for the neediest Americans. In many States, they are going to \ncut Medicaid payments because they simply do not have the money since \ntheir State treasuries are in such deep financial trouble.\n  All in all, I believe the Centrist Coalition and White House \ncompromise package was a good proposal, one that should have passed \neasily in the Senate before Christmas and which should have easily \npassed today.\n  There are a lot of concerned Americans, men and women who have lost \ntheir jobs, and who do not know where they are going to get health care \nfor themselves and their families. We have an obligation to help. At \nthe very least, we have provided an additional 13 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits to our constituents who are out of work. It is only a fraction \nof what we should have done, but it will give some assistance to those \nwho need it. Still, I believe we must address our unfinished business.\n  I believe that there is still time to set aside our differences, put \nthe needs of the American people ahead of politics and pass the \nCentrist Coalition proposal. It is fair, it is balanced and it is \nbipartisan and I believe it is the best thing we can do to restores \npeople's\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\nfaith in the economy and restore people's faith that we do care about \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S400-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S400-S402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, while I am pleased that this body has \npassed legislation to extend unemployment benefits for thirteen weeks, \nI rise to express my deep regret at an opportunity lost to help \nAmerican workers. . .to help create jobs. . .to bolster our economy. . \n.to provide vital health insurance benefits. . .and to increase our \nfederal surplus projections for the long term.\n  I voted for cloture on both the Daschle and the Grassley-Snowe \namendments because the bottom line is, I am convinced an economic \nstimulus plan would make a vital difference when it comes to the \nstrength of our economic recovery. And I cosponsored Senator Grassley's \namendment not only because it is the product of the work of the \nCentrist Coalition, which I co-chair with Senator Breaux, but also \nbecause it was crafted through bipartisan, bicameral negotiations with \nthe White House and already passed the House of Representatives in \nDecember on a bipartisan vote.\n  I want to thank all of us who worked so diligently on that package, \nmost especially Senators John Breaux, George Voinovich, Ben Nelson, \nSusan Collins and Zell Miller. And of course I want to thank Senator \nGrassley for his remarkable commitment to building consensus and \ngetting a strong stimulus package passed. We earnestly believe and I \nstill believe that the adoption of the Centrist package would have been \nour best means to get a final conference report to the President's \ndesk, and ensure that the economy and America's workers would benefit \nfrom the most robust economic recovery possible.\n  I have said I think it's critical at the beginning of this new \nlegislative session that we start off on the right foot by enacting an \neconomic recovery plan for the American people. I was prepared before \nChristmas, and many of my colleagues were prepared, to stay here to \naddress the needs of those who have lost their jobs and their health \ninsurance--and to bolster economic growth. Because the fact of the \nmatter is, we knew then what is still very much true today--this \neconomy remains in a recession and people are hurting while Congress \nhas dithered.\n  We now know we lost more jobs last year than in any year since 1982, \nwhich was during the worst recession since the Great Depression, and we \nlost almost a million jobs since the President proposed an economic \nstimulus plan on October 5. And while the unemployment rate in January \nfell to 5.6 percent--the first decline in 15 months and certainly \nbetter than the alternative--the two-tenths percent drop was likely \nmore a sign of job-seekers giving up than the economy improving.\n  As a February 4 Wall Street Journal article put, ``Economists warned \nthe drop in the jobless rate could be misleading. The January decline \nwas largely due to the fact that the Labor Department reported an \nunusually large drop of 924,000 in the size of the labor force, to \n141.4 million people. A shrinking labor force, say economists, could be \na sign workers have become discouraged and have stopped looking for \njobs.''\n  And, finally, consider this statement from the Federal Open Market \nCommittee on January 31--in deciding to keep its target for the federal \nfunds rate unchanged at 1\\3/4\\ percent, it said, ``. . .the Committee \ncontinues to believe that. . .the risks are weighted mainly toward \nconditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable \nfuture.''\n  Of course, the economy may, in fact, be on the road to recovery. I \ncertainly hope that's the case. But it's also a question of what kind \nof recovery. Will it be a robust recovery with rising employment and \nnew job opportunities, or a ``jobless recovery'' as we had back in \n1991? Given our nation's war on terrorism both at home and abroad--the \nfuture is far from certain. Any ``shock'' could immediately send our \neconomy reeling, so I am especially disappointed that we haven't taken \nthe appropriate steps to ensure that the road to recovery is an \n``expressway,'' rather than a dirt road.\n\n  The bottom line is, a well-structured, comprehensive stimulus package \nis the means by which we could have at least laid the foundation for \nsuch a road. The reality is, such a package could have had an impact on \nthe kind of recovery we ultimately realize. And you don't have to take \nmy word for it. Just two weeks ago, Chairman Greenspan testified before \nthe Senate Budget Committee on the state of the economy. And while some \nhave latched-onto Chairman Greenspan's remarks that ``. . .the economy \nwill recover in any event'' and argue that a stimulus package is, \ntherefore, no longer necessary, it's critical to listen to the rest of \ntestimony.\n  Specifically, when I asked Chairman Greenspan about whether or not a \nstimulus package could aid in the type of economic recovery we \nexperience, he stated that, although it was difficult to judge how the \neconomy would develop this year, quote:\n\n       . . .with the potential, at least, that the economy may be \n     more tepid than we would like later in this year, some form \n     of stimulus program probably would be useful.\n\n  So I, for one, was not prepared to risk a more ``tepid'' recovery--\nnot with millions of Americans already out of work and America engaged \nin a war that will be carried out over a matter of years, not months. \nAnd based on the Chairman's response, a strong and effective stimulus \nplan could have been the difference.\n  Moreover, let's not forget--restoring economic growth would not only \nrestore jobs, it would also help restore our projected budget \nsurpluses.\n  Specifically, last week, the Congressional Budget Office outlined new \nbudget surplus estimates for the coming 10 years. As we learned, the \nprojected surplus through the year 2011 has fallen 70 percent, from \n$5.6 trillion last year to $1.6 trillion today--the most dramatic \ndecline in budget projections ever. While a combination of factors has \nbrought about this decline--including last year's $1.3 trillion tax cut \nand $550 billion in projected new spending--the most dramatic impact, \nfully 40 percent of the lost surpluses--or nearly 1.6 trillion \ndollars--arose from economic and technical changes linked to our \ncurrent economic decline.\n  What is both alarming and instructive is that a downgrading in \nprojections of economic growth for just a relatively short amount of \ntime clearly has a dramatic impact on our 10-year surplus projections. \nAs you can see by this chart, the contents of which I'd like to submit \nfor the record, CBO has only lowered its economic growth projection for \n2001 and 2002--by 1.4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively--while 2007 \nonward remains the same and 2003 to 2007 is actually higher. And yet, \nthose lowered growth projections for just those two years have \ndramatically reduced the surplus projections in the long run.\n  This fact, coupled with CBO's estimates that an annual increase in \neconomic growth of only one-tenth of one percent translates into a $244 \nbillion increase in the surplus over 10 years, should tell us \nsomething. It should tell us that the benefit of a strong recovery in \nthe near term--and the resulting increase in average economic growth in \nthe long-term--cannot be understated. And the stimulus could have \nhelped us achieve that critical goal.\n  In fact, Bruce Steinberg, a chief economist with Merrill Lynch, \nestimated in November that a stimulus package could add one percent to \neconomic growth this year. The White House put the figure at half a \npercentage point, which would put 300,000 more Americans to work, while \nMacroeconomic Advisers of St. Louis estimated a stimulus package could \nactually double economic growth projections.\n  And Allen Sinai of Decision Economics argued that a package could \nmean the difference between a weak rebound, such as in the 1991 \nrecovery, and one with real potency. He said, ``At this point what \nyou're doing, with both monetary and fiscal stimulus, is loading powder \ninto the recovery.''\n  Which brings me to what happened today on the floor of the Senate. \nThe fact of the matter is, we should have passed the bipartisan \nCentrist plan that already passed the House of Representatives on a \nbipartisan vote and enjoyed the support of the White House--and that \naccomplished what several weeks of bicameral negotiations failed to \nachieve at the end of\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\nlast year: a consensus on all provisions addressing the needs of the \nunemployed, including health insurance assistance, and providing a \nboost for the economy.\n  And the bottom line, is that developing a consensus requires \ncompromise. The bicameral negotiators made significant progress during \ntheir negotiations last year, but, unfortunately, were unable to break \nthrough on several final issues and, consequently, negotiations broke \ndown.\n  So, given this stalemate and the risks it posed to workers and the \neconomy, members of the Centrist Coalition--which I co-chair with \nSenator Breaux and which had already put forward a compromise proposal \nin November--sat down with Republican leaders and the White House to \nsee if we could reach the agreement that had proven so elusive. And I \nask unanimous consent have printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks a time line of all our efforts on the stimulus package, \nbecause I think it illustrates why we had such a strong bipartisan \nbasis for moving forward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is, we already had bipartisan \nagreement on issues like stimulus checks for low-income individuals, \naccelerated depreciation, increased expensing, and an extension of and \nincreased funding for unemployment benefits. So we had a sound \nfoundation for a compromise, and the package that cleared the House was \nthe product of our negotiations.\n  That package truly reflected the middle ground on both tax and \nspending issues that had confounded the bicameral negotiators. Just \nconsider where we started on many of these issues and where we ended \nup.\n  At the outset, one of the most controversial issues was that of \naccelerating marginal rate reductions that were adopted last year. \nWhile President Bush called for an acceleration of all marginal rate \nreductions and Democrats opposed any acceleration, the Centrist package \nwould have accelerated the reduction in the 27 percent bracket only, to \n25 percent--an imminently reasonable middle ground approach.\n  This change--which only applied to taxable incomes of $27,050 to \n$65,550 for individuals and $42,500 to $109,250 for married couples--\nwould have put money in the hands of 36 million taxpayers, or one-third \nof all taxpayers, at a time when consumer demand needs a boost. And let \nme make one point perfectly clear--more than two-thirds of these \nbeneficiaries have incomes under $100,000.\n  Or consider another controversial issue: corporate AMT. While the \noriginal House-passed package would have repealed the corporate AMT, \nthe Democratic proposal only included a ``hold-harmless'' so that \nbusinesses taking advantage of accelerated depreciation and other \nprovisions in the stimulus package would not see an increase in their \nAMT liability.\n  The Centrist package found the middle ground by ensuring that items \nthat are currently added-back to a company's taxable income for \npurposes of calculating the AMT--namely, depreciation, net operating \nlosses, and foreign tax credits--would no longer be included in this \ncalculation. And by achieving that compromise, we dramatically reduced \nthe cost of the proposal as well--falling from $25 billion in 2002 in \nthe House-passed package, to $1.3 billion in the White House-Centrist \npackage.\n  But as we learned from the breakdown in the bicameral negotiations, \nthe most controversial element of the stimulus debate proved not to be \nover tax policy, but on health care assistance for workers who lost \ntheir jobs. However, policy trumped ideology and politics during the \nCentrist negotiations--and our package provided a better benefit more \nrapidly for more unemployed workers than anything that had been \npreviously proposed.\n  The starting positions on this issue were stark, as the original \nHouse-passed measure--and White House position--called for $3 billion \nin funding to states to help those who could lose their health coverage \nif they lost their job. The original Centrists package went further by \nproposing $13.5 billion in federal health care assistance for displaced \nworkers.\n  The $16.7 billion package put forward by Democrats last year proposed \na 75 percent subsidy to help displaced workers afford COBRA health \ncoverage, and assistance and coverage through the Medicaid program for \nindividuals who are not eligible for COBRA benefits. The Democratic \nproposal also offered a temporary increase in federal Medicaid matching \nfunds for states that are struggling with increased Medicaid costs.\n  Many people, including the nation's governors, did not believe the \nDemocrat's proposal for relying on Medicaid was feasible because states \nwould have to contribute about 25 percent of the cost--funds the states \ndo not have because of estimate state revenue shortfalls of $15 billion \ndue to the economic downturn. In fact, the governors were calling for \nincreased federal funding for Medicaid just to maintain coverage and \nbenefit levels for current Medicaid recipients.\n  On the health care issue too, the Centrist package found the middle \nground and even went further. Specifically, our bipartisan package \nwould have provided a total of $21 billion in federal health care \nassistance--or $21 billion more than Senator Daschle proposed in his \namendment. I can't understand why or how we could have denied four \nmillion hardworking Americans this kind of assistance this year for the \nsake of shadings in philosophical dispositions.\n  The fact of the matter is, it didn't have to be that way. Our package \nprovided $13 billion in health care tax credits to displaced workers \nwho are eligible for unemployment insurance who do not have other \nhealth care coverage, $4 billion in National Emergency Grants, and \nalmost $5 billion in emergency Medicaid funding so states would not \nhave been forced to cut back their current health care programs for \nchildren, workers, and families with low-incomes.\n  Indeed, our displaced worker proposal went further in covering \ndisplaced workers than any other proposal that was considered--\nincreasing funding to provide health coverage to displaced workers by \nalmost 700 percent from where we started. This package would have \nhelped those workers who lost their jobs regardless of whether they \nworked for the largest corporation or the smallest business or even if \nthey were self employed.\n  Under this plan, any worker who involuntarily lost their job and who \nis eligible or formerly eligible for unemployment insurance benefits \nwould have been eligible for a 60 percent tax credit to use for \ncontinued health coverage. Workers would have automatically received a \ntax credit certificate when they applied for unemployment compensation.\n  The tax credit certificate could have been used toward COBRA coverage \nfrom their former employer, if eligible, or for purchasing health \ninsurance coverage of the individual's choosing. The monthly premium \npayment would have been reduced by the amount of the tax credit so that \ndisplaced workers would not be forced to pay the full cost of their \nhealth coverage up front, while waiting for federal assistance that \nwould arrive at a later date. In addition the states would have used \nthe $5 billion in National Emergency Grant funding to provide further \nassistance and additional benefits.\n  The bipartisan agreement gave displaced workers portable assistance \nthat they could use in any part of the country to get health coverage. \nDisplaced workers who cannot continue coverage with their current plan, \nwould have had federal-law protections that require health plans to \noffer guaranteed issue coverage with no pre-existing condition \nexclusions.\n  Our proposal for assisting displaced workers with their health \nbenefits was a straightforward proposal that could have been \nimplemented quickly for all firms and all states because the Department \nof Labor would have made the funds immediately available to states so \nthey could deliver assistance to displaced workers.\n  The bottom line is that the Centrist package provided the most \ncomprehensive approach to addressing the needs of those who are out of \nwork and an economy trying to pull itself out of a recession. And by \nenjoying bipartisan, bicameral support as well as the support of the \nWhite House--it would have ensured that this relief would be on the way \nin the fastest manner possible.\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\n Again, I deeply regret that stimulus delayed has now become stimulus \ndenied.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      CBO PROJECTED ECONOMIC GROWTH\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               2001    2002    2003    2004-07   2008-11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJanuary 2002................     1.0     0.8     4.1       3.3       3.1\nJanuary 2001................     2.4     3.4     3.3       3.0       3.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCBO January 2002, Budget & Economic Outlook.\n\n                                TIMELINE\n\n       September 25, 2001: Finance Committee meets with former-\n     Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan to discuss basic \n     principles of economic stimulus package.\n       October 17, 2001: Centrist Coalition lays out principles to \n     leaders Daschle and Lott.\n       October 24, 2001: (1) Centrist Coalition meets with \n     Secretary O'Neill; (2) House passes first version of stimulus \n     plan.\n       October 31, 2001: Centrist Coalition meets to consider \n     compromise package.\n       November 8, 2001: Stimulus markup in Finance Committee, \n     Democrat package reported.\n       November 13-14, 2001: Senate Finance stimulus plan (Baucus) \n     on Senate Floor.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are. It is now February 6, 2002. \nThat comes as no shock to anyone. We are back on the farm bill--where \nwe were back on December 6, 2001.\n  Again, we are trying to get this bill finished before it gets too \nlate in the planting season. I am hopeful that we can work out some \narrangements to do that. The beginning of a new session always marks an \nopportunity for a renewed effort to solve the challenges before us. In \na spirit of cooperation, I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto pass this new farm bill without further delay, in order to provide \nfarm families in rural communities critically needed stability and \ninsurance for this year and in the future.\n  There is widespread agreement that farm families and rural \ncommunities are in dire need. The Senate has dealt with the farm bill \nfor 12 days already. Again, I want to underscore that rural America \ncannot survive under the current Freedom to Farm bill. It will suffer \nseverely if the farm bill here is further delayed. I look forward to \nworking with Senators on both sides of the aisle to get the bill \nfinished deliberately but quickly, and we will work our way through \namendments. I hope that maybe even this afternoon sometime we may reach \nan agreement on a finite list of amendments, with a reasonable amount \nof time to debate them. Then we can work through that list of \namendments and, hopefully, within 2 or 3 days, go to third reading and \npassage.\n  I believe we can get the conference done in adequate time to have the \nbill enacted for this crop year. A tremendous amount is at stake in \nthis farm bill, not only for farmers but for rural and agriculture-\nrelated businesses, rural communities, conservation, trade, nutrition \nprograms, and renewable energy.\n  The Department of Agriculture recently predicted a 20-percent drop in \nnet farm income for this year if we do not take action on this new \nlegislation--20 percent. Farmers are struggling as it is. They most \ncertainly cannot afford to take a fifth off their net income.\n  I understand that after the farm bill the Senate will take up an \nenergy bill. During debate on the energy bill there will be a lot of \ndiscussion about CAFE standards, and about drilling for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, which I am sure will be a hotly \ncontested issue. Well, this farm bill has a new energy title in it. As \nit is written now, the energy title calls for an investment of half a \nbillion dollars in mandatory money over 5 years to spur production of \nrenewable energy.\n  Even if we do drill for oil in ANWR, we will remain dependent on \nforeign oil unless we begin making significant investments in the \nproduction of renewable energy. Moreover, a greater emphasis on \nrenewable energy in our nation's energy policy will also create new \nmarkets for agricultural products. We need to develop these new \nmarkets, and I submit that one of the biggest opportunities we will \nhave to do this in the future will be in the area of renewable energy. \nIt has been said that anything that can be made from a barrel of oil \ncan be made from a bushel of corn, soybeans, cottonseed oil, or any \nnumber of other crops that we grow in this country.\n  I visited a project in northern Iowa last week involving agriculture-\nbased industrial lubricants. It is a project sponsored and supported by \nthe University of Northern Iowa. I actually visited a farm where they \nhave set up equipment. They bring in raw soybeans, crush them, take out \nthe oil, and they mix it and put it through another machine I can't \ndescribe, and they get grease, like axle grease. It looks just like \nthat--the same thing you use in your grease gun when you\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nare greasing a car, or an axle, or anything such as that. I understand \nthe Norfolk Southern Railway has begun using this product to grease the \nrailroad tracks. Trucking companies are using it for the fifth wheels \non trucks, where they put a lot of grease.\n  The beauty of this is it is all biodegradable. I understand some \nrailroads, because of the grease going down the railroad track lines, \nhave to put down liners underneath the tracks. This agriculture-based \nindustrial lubricant is a new product that can take the place of all \nthe grease we use, it is made out of soybeans and it is biodegradable. \nAll the hydraulic fluid required by machinery could one day be made out \nof soybean oil.\n  And then there is ethanol. We haven't even scratched the surface in \nterms of the use of ethanol. Fuel that is 80 percent ethanol--developed \nover the next 10, 15 years--can drastically reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and help clean up our atmosphere. Again, that is \nbiodegradable, and it is renewable every year, with every corn crop.\n  So I think if we really want to become more energy independent and \nless dependent on the Middle East for our oil, it is not drilling in \nANWR that will accomplish that--at least not from the data I have \nseen--it is developing new markets for agricultural products in this \ncountry by supporting the development of renewable fuels made from \nagricultural commodities.\n  We now have over 30 buses running in Cedar Rapids, IA, on soy diesel. \nAll the trucks on the nation's highways could one day be burning soy \ndiesel. When one thinks about the potential market for agricultural-\nbased lubricants, fluids, and fuels, that market is the same as the \nmarket for the oil we are getting from the Middle East now. Maybe we \ncannot take up all of that market with renewable lubricants, fluids and \nfuels, but we can take up enough of it so the producers of oil in the \nMiddle East will not have us by the throat any longer. We can have \nenough of that market that the Middle East will be a minor supplier, \nnot a major supplier, of the energy we use in this country. There is a \nlot in this farm bill to start moving us in that direction.\n  We have done our work in the Committee. We had an aggressive schedule \nof hearings on the farm bill. We had hearings here in Washington, DC, \nand in several States across the country. Then, of course, our \ntimetable was set back by the terrorist attacks on September 11. \nNonetheless, we moved ahead and started marking up the bill on October \n31, voted to report the bill out of committee on November 15, and we \nwere on the Senate floor November 29. We acted expeditiously to get \nthis bill done. We went from markup on October 31 to the Senate floor \non November 29, and yet we are still here today, February 6, 2002.\n  It is essential that the new farm bill be completed without further \ndelay before the planting of this year's crop. Again, if we do not pass \nit in time, this year's crop will be covered by the existing Freedom to \nFarm legislation and, Mr. President, as you know, we will probably have \nto come up with another supplemental payment for this year's crops. \nThat is why we need a new farm bill and not more uncertainty.\n  The longer the bill is delayed, the greater the risk the $73.5 \nbillion in new farm bill funding will be forfeited. As I said, the \nplanting season is here. The stimulus bill just went down, as I \nunderstand it, but this farm bill is also a stimulus bill a stimulus \nbill for rural America.\n  President Bush was recently in Moline, IL, which is part of the quad-\ncities area, across from Davenport and Bittendorf, IA. Of course, \nMoline is the home of John Deere. A lot of Iowans across the river work \nat that Moline plant. We also have John Deere plants in Iowa.\n  President Bush visited that plant a couple weeks ago. I was with him, \nas were other Senators and Congressmen. In a meeting with the CEO of \nJohn Deere, it was said by him or by some of the other people in the \nmanagement of John Deere that they have laid off a lot of people. They \nhave 300 people working at the plant who are working because of \ncontractual arrangements with the union, but they are not building \nanything. I asked whether there is any hope that these people can start \nbuilding again.\n  The response was: Yes, we know there are orders out there or pending \norders for new combines, tractors, planters, and other equipment, but \nthe farmers are going to the bankers to get the financing to buy the \nequipment, and the bankers are saying: What is your income going to be \nlike this year? What are you counting on? And the farmer says: I don't \nknow, they haven't passed the farm bill yet.\n  The message came through clear to me and others and, I hope, to the \nPresident that we have to get this bill done. It not only helps the \nfarmers, but it helps rural America and it helps the workers in that \nJohn Deere plant, too. It helps them get back to work. That is why we \nneed to get this bill through in as short order as possible.\n\n  I believe bipartisanship has been the hallmark in our work of \ncrafting this farm bill. At the outset, Senator Lugar, the committee's \nranking member and former chairman, and I developed a set of \nobjectives. We worked in consultation with other members of the \ncommittee on all titles of the bill that the committee reported out, \nwith the exception of the commodity title, to be honest, where we \nrecognized we probably would not find any agreement.\n  Other than the commodity title, all reported titles were approved by \nvoice votes. Of the votes on amendments to those titles, not one was \nalong party lines. We did have a recorded vote on adopting the \ncommodity title, as I said, and even that was a bipartisan vote.\n  We have tried to come out with as bipartisan a bill as possible, and \nI believe that is what we have done. This is a balanced, comprehensive \nbill. It is a bill that does very well by commodities but also goes \nwell beyond the commodity programs to address needs in the areas of \nconservation, trade, rural development, research, energy, which I \nmentioned earlier, credit, nutrition, and forestry.\n  On the commodity side, we have maintained full planting flexibility, \nand we have restored a stronger countercyclical income protection \nsystem. The bill continues fixed direct payments but phases them down, \nnot totally out, as a new countercyclical payment system is phased in.\n  Also, farmers may elect to update their program bases and payment \nyields instead of using outdated ones, but they may keep the old bases \nand yields if that is more advantageous to them. We leave that choice \nup to farmers.\n  The bill continues marketing assistance loans with modestly higher \nloan rates for feed grains, wheat, and cotton. The soybean loan rate is \nreduced by 6 cents but that reduction is offset by new fixed and \ncountercyclical oilseed payments which were not in the previous Freedom \nto Farm bill. Keep in mind, all of these loans are marketing assistance \nloans, so the higher loan rates will not build stocks and will, in \nfact, enhance our international competitiveness.\n  When I hear arguments that somehow the higher loan rates will price \nus out of the market, I do not understand that. These are marketing \nassistance loans so that cannot be true.\n  One key difference between the Senate bill and the House bill is the \napproach to farm income protection. The Senate bill puts a greater \nemphasis on countercyclical income protection. If commodity prices are \nnot as high as predicted, which is usually the case, then the Senate \nbill offers the better income protection. There is a built-in price \nprotection mechanism to increase payments if prices fall.\n  Again, one of the biggest outcries I heard about the Freedom to Farm \nbill is that in the good years--the initial years under Freedom to Farm \nwhen farmers were making good money from the market--they were still \ngetting Government payments. That did not seem to make sense to anyone.\n  What we have done is phase those payments down, and we will have a \ncountercyclical program so if prices go down, farmers will be held \nharmless.\n  The majority of people in this country do not know a lick about \nagriculture but would support it. They say there are certain times when \nfor certain reasons--whether it is trade, the strength of the dollar, \nor other factors--prices for agricultural commodities just go all to \nheck.\n  I think most people recognize the cyclical nature of agriculture, \nthat it is\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\ndifferent from a hardware store, that it is very reliant on so many \noutside factors over which a person has no control.\n  I believe most Americans would say: Yes, if these things happen and \nprices fall, you ought to support the farmers until we can get the \nprices back up. I find general acceptance of that. What I do not find \nis any support anywhere for the proposition that if farmers are doing \nwell in the marketplace we ought to give them more money. I do not find \nany support for that anywhere. That is what we tried to do in this \nbill: to get off that old system and get onto a new system of \ncountercyclical payments.\n  Regarding international trade, the Senate bill will comply with our \nWTO commitments and will put our Nation in a strong position to \nnegotiate new trade agreements.\n  This bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to adjust \nsupport payments to make sure we do not violate WTO limits. However, \nthere is only a very remote chance this authority will ever be needed. \nUnder the expected market conditions for the next 10 years, the amber \nbox limit ``amber box'' means that under WTO agreements we can only \nspend so much money on certain types of support--is $19.1 billion. \nUnder all of the scenarios we have run on our bill, the most we can see \nis about $16 billion in amber box payments.\n  Now I have heard--I will admit I have not heard it lately, but last \nDecember I heard a lot of talk from the administration and the \nDepartment of Agriculture that somehow what we had in our bill would \nbump us up against the WTO limits, and that would take us to court and \nall kinds of dire things would happen. At that time, I challenged those \nwho were making such statements to come forward and give us the proof, \ngive us the data, show us what they mean, how we were going to bump up \nagainst the $19 billion limit. Well, I have been waiting since then. I \nstill do not have it.\n  So I said at the time, if the administration keeps saying this, then \nI am simply going to have to call another hearing of the Agriculture \nCommittee and we will have to have the Secretary of Agriculture down to \ntell us. If they have data, I would like to see it. I think the fact is \nthat it is not so. Even if we do get up around $16 billion or $17 \nbillion, so what? That is well within our limit.\n  It seems to me there is some thought we ought to be down around $10 \nbillion or less. I say, why? Do you think the Europeans would do that? \nOf course not. They are going to be right up to their limits under the \nWTO.\n  Well, we are not even that close. We are still quite a bit under the \nlimit. All I can say is, if we ever got to the point where our payments \nwould bump up against that $19.1 billion, we would be in such bad shape \nthat the WTO would be the least of our worries.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Iowa if he would \nyield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am glad to yield to our assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. While the two managers have been speaking, I did what they \nasked me to do, and we now have a unanimous consent agreement that will \nmove us through a good part of the afternoon. I ask unanimous consent \nthat there be a time limitation on the following pending amendments: 40 \nminutes equally divided on both of the pending amendments by Senator \nBurns, Nos. 2608 and 2607; 40 minutes equally divided on Senator \nWellstone's amendment No. 2602; and 30 minutes equally divided on \nSenator Harkin's amendment No. 2604.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin do his amendment \nfirst--there has been a request that he do his amendment first and the \nothers can come up later--that all times be divided in the usual form; \nthat no other amendments be in order prior to disposition of the above \nlisted amendments; that at the conclusion or yielding back of time on \nall of these amendments, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation \nto each amendment, with 2 minutes for debate equally divided between \nthe votes following the first vote; that the vote sequence be as \nfollows: Senator Harkin be first; Senator Burns; Senator Burns; and \nthen Senator Wellstone; that if any amendment is not disposed of after \nthe first vote, they remain debatable and amendable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthe agreement is an excellent one. I simply want to raise the question \nwith the distinguished Senator. After Chairman Harkin has completed his \nopening statement, I would like to make an opening statement before we \nproceed to the amendments.\n\n  Mr. REID. I think that would be entirely appropriate. Does the \nSenator request up to half an hour?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That would be adequate, yes.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent--the only change that has \nbeen brought to my attention by the staff on both sides--that the \nlanguage be that ``no other amendments be in order prior to the votes \nin relation to the above listed amendment'' rather than ``the \ndisposition of the above listed amendments.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. A point of clarification: Is that 40 minutes on each of \nthe Burns amendments?\n  Mr. REID. Forty minutes total.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have a question for the distinguished manager. Then we \nwould have four stacked votes? Members could anticipate, once we begin \nvoting, there will be four votes?\n  Mr. REID. Probably around 4 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is good news. I thank the assistant majority leader \nfor working this out, and I thank Senator Lugar for working this out on \nall sides. That is progress. So we are going to be able to dispose of \nfour amendments that have been hanging since December, and hopefully \nthat indicates some progress on this farm bill. So I will wrap up my \ncomments very shortly.\n  I was talking about the WTO, and I will wrap it up in terms of income \nprotection for farmers. I describe our bill as having four legs, which \nmakes it very sturdy. We have fixed payments, countercyclical payments, \nmarketing loans, and conservation payments, all of which will help \nsupport farming.\n  Lastly, I want to talk a little bit about the conservation title. We \nhave been able to accomplish a great deal on the conservation title. It \nis important in and of itself. Farmers and landowners desire to \nconserve soil, water, and other natural resources. Sound conservation \nis one of the best ways for agriculture to continue to build good will \nwith the rest of America. Plus, it is also a way in which we can help \npromote better farm income. So we have funded programs like the \nWetlands Reserve Program, the Farmland Protection Program, the Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program. Those three programs, I might add, are all \nout of money right now. So every day we do not pass this farm bill and \nget it through, none of those programs will be funded.\n  We made a large increase for the EQIP, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, and I think improved that substantially for \nlivestock, dairy, and poultry producers.\n  Our main emphasis in conservation in this bill has been on land in \nagricultural production. I believe that is where our focus should be, \nand the Senate bill reflects that. It contains the new Conservation \nSecurity Program, which will provide incentive payments for maintaining \nexisting and adopting new conservation practices on lands that remain \nin production. Thus, it does both, promotes conservation and supports \nfarm income.\n\n  The other good thing about it is that it is fully within the WTO \ngreen box. So whatever we spend to help support farm income does not \nbump up against our WTO limits.\n  One other thing I will mention before I yield the floor is what I \nsaid before, in December--I think I may have said it in committee, too: \nIf this farm bill devolves into being a commodity bill, then I think we \nwill do a great disservice to our farmers and to all of America because \nwe will have narrowed the farm bill to a very small scope of people who \nproduce storable commodities. I think the farm bill is much broader \nthan that. It speaks not only to those who produce the food and fiber \nand to those who produce our livestock, but also to those who produce\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nfruits and vegetables, specialty crops, orchards, many of the items we \nbuy in our grocery stores that do not come from row crops.\n  And it is even more than that. It is rural economic development. It \nis small towns and communities. It is making sure we have jobs and \neconomic opportunity in our small towns. This bill has a very strong \nrural economic development portion to it. There are even things in the \nbill to get broadband access to our small towns and communities.\n  I happened to meet a farmer this morning from northwest Iowa. I asked \nhim what he was doing here. He said his wife was here on a business \ntrip and he was accompanying her and sort of relaxing a little bit, \ngoing down to the Smithsonian and coming to watching the Senate--things \nlike that.\n  I asked him what kind of business his wife is in. Well, it is over my \nhead, but it has something to do with computers and software. So I got \nto thinking about that and thinking, here is someone who lives in a \nsmall town in northwest Iowa doing a job that normally might be done in \na large city. Now, again, the problem is getting broadband access so \nthat they have all of the access to the Internet in a high-speed \nsetting. We can develop those types of job opportunities for people who \nlive on our farms in rural America. That is in this bill, too.\n\n  Commodities, yes, but it is broader than that. Rural economic \ndevelopment, as I mentioned, is so important. That is why in this bill \nwe have a treasury equity fund, a rural business investment program to \nsupport equity groups. We have a national rural cooperative and \nbusiness equity fund to try to get equity capital to rural areas so we \ncan promote the kind of business development we need. We have a \nfourfold increase in the value-added agricultural product market \ndevelopment grants. These grants help develop solid value-added \nenterprises owned by agricultural producers. The business and industry \nloan guarantee program is improved. We provide $100 million a year for \nbroadband Internet access to our small town communities.\n  This is a broadly based bill. I not even touched on the enhanced \nnutrition, forestry, or trade programs. We put more funds and guidance \nand direction into the foreign market development program and the \nforeign market access program. We enhance our trading abilities. For \nforestry, we have new language and new programs to provide more support \nfor the private forests and renewable forestry incentives.\n  There is a lot more than just commodities in this bill. That is as it \nshould be. Agriculture touches everyone in America. It is more than \njust that one person on a farm. It is people all up and down the food \nchain: our processors, shippers, wholesalers, grocery stores, and \nconsumers. We have put a lot in here to protect consumers, to make sure \nwe have the safest and most affordable and steady food supply of any \ncountry in the world.\n  That is why this bill is so important and why we have to move this \nbill. I think it does no one any good to continue a filibuster or \ndelay. I am hopeful with the breakthrough we had this afternoon with \nthese four amendments, we look forward tomorrow to continuing to debate \nsome amendments. I hope some time, perhaps even later today, we can \nreach an agreement on a finite list of amendments, and how much time. \nThen we will know exactly when we will finish the farm bill and get to \nconference and get it to the President as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I appreciate the excellent statement by \nthe distinguished chairman of our committee. I join him in attempting \nto work constructively for completion of a good piece of legislation.\n  There is broad agreement among Members of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, on the titles, aside from the \ncommodity title. We have had amendments that have pertained to the \nother title and some may still be heard from Members who were not a \npart of our committee deliberations.\n  Clearly, the bill before the Senate does excellent things in the area \nof conservation, possibly a credit for young farmers, rural \ndevelopment, nutrition, agricultural development, to try to get jobs in \nrural America for people not engaged in farming.\n  This is why I regret that the commodity section, as it now stands, \nseems to me to be a considerable step backward. I am not going to \nengage in extravagant language about the situation. Honest Senators can \ndiffer as to the implications of this. One good reason the Senate chose \nnot to pass legislation before Christmas was that this disagreement \npertains to a lot of farmers and other Senators who are not farmers \nwanted to take a second and third look at this legislation.\n  I want to talk during these informal remarks at the beginning of our \nsession today about the prospect of some who are well informed who have \nlooked at our work so we might improve it through the amendment process \nwe are about to undertake. I mention, first of all, a report by the \nFood and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, well-known to Members \nof our Agriculture Committee, and, I think, to the general public as an \nextraordinarily reputable agricultural institution at the University of \nMissouri and Iowa State University. I cite specifically their report of \nNovember 2001, at the time we were last deliberating on the farm bill, \non the trade issues.\n\n  The distinguished chairman has mentioned the attempt by the committee \nto stay clear of ceilings that might lead the United States to severe \ndifficulties with the World Trade Organization and our other trading \npartners. Some Senators might say that is the tough luck of anybody \nelse who happens to stand in our way; this is the United States of \nAmerica, and if we want to spend money on our farmers, by golly, we \nought to do that--leaving aside whether we run into conflict that is \nlikely to lead to lawsuits, less exports, and blockages that are \nalready considerable with foreign trading partners.\n  Clearly, in most of our debates on agriculture, we are in agreement \nthat if farm income is going to go up substantially in the United \nStates, it will have to be through exports because we have a market in \nthe United States which is often termed mature. There is only so much \nfood that we can consume in the United States of America. Even though \nwe must do a better job with our food pantries, with feeding programs--\nand this farm bill does address those issues and they are important for \nlow-income Americans and for those who are unfortunate--the fact is, \ngiven the productive capability of American agriculture, we have to \nmove the product.\n  In order to move the product, we have tried to work with other \nnations under an agreement called the World Trade Organization. That \ngives us some certainty of legal status in other countries. If they \ncomplain and were to take action to stop our exports, we have an action \nto get moving, to move this through arbitration or decisions of the \nWorld Trade Organization. Most people in the agricultural business \nunderstand that.\n  What is in dispute is whether the Harkin-Daschle bill now before the \nSenate bumps up against the ceilings or, in fact, goes through them. \nThe distinguished chairman has said in his best calculation, in fact, \nwe are well below the ceiling, in a safety margin. However, if the \nFAPRI is not so assertive, and I read from page 7 of the November 2000 \nreport:\n\n       Under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, the \n     United States agreed to limit spending on domestic support \n     programs that are considered trade distorting to $19.1 \n     billion per year.\n\n  We made that agreement.\n\n       Given the structure of the proposed policy changes, we \n     calculate a 30.3 percent chance that the United States will \n     exceed this limit in the 2002 marketing year.\n\n  This is the marketing year that will begin later this calendar year \nafter the 2002 crops are harvested this fall.\n\n       Over the projection period, price increases result in \n     smaller marketing loan expenditures, which will tend to \n     decrease this probability. But the counter-cyclical program \n     begins payments in the 2004 marketing year, essentially \n     replacing green box expenditures. . .with amber box \n     expenditures.\n\n  Those are ones that become more dangerous in the calculations.\n\n       This substitute increases the probability that the U.S. \n     exceeds its WTO limits.\n\n  I mention that because clearly this can still be remedied. We are in \nthe course of having a debate in which\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nother Senators or other institutes may make calculations. But I am \nsuggesting that we have a serious point of jeopardy here that may not \nbe well understood by Senators. That is why in this opening statement I \nmove, not to the rhetoric of my colleagues, but rather to an \nindependent organization that is in a position to make informed comment \non this.\n\n  We have a further problem that is posed simply by the way this bill \nis structured in the payments. I cite an article by Philip Brasher of \nthe Associated Press, dated today, in which he points out:\n\n       A Democratic-backed farm bill pending in the Senate would \n     use an estimated $45 billion by the end of 2006\n\n  This is of the $73.5 billion in new spending over a 10-year period of \ntime that has been often mentioned--leaving but $28.5 billion for the \nremaining 5 years. The problem comes up that the Department of \nAgriculture has spoken, through the Secretary, Ann Veneman, who said, \nagain yesterday, that the money should be distributed evenly over the \n10-year period of time.\n  Secretary Veneman says:\n\n       We feel strongly that we shouldn't front-load a farm bill.\n\n  Let me mention that this is a fairly large sum of money. Just a quick \ndivision of the $73.5 billion, if one agrees that much more on top of \nthe baseline ought to be spent, would mean if we were to have fairly \nlevel payments, our work should come out at something less than $37 \nbillion.\n  The Daschle-Harkin bill amounts to $45 billion now. Some others have \ncited figures between $42 billion and $43 billion. It would appear to \nbe $5 billion or $6 billion too rich in the first 5 years. It got that \nway through a number of compromises.\n  I sympathize with the distinguished chairman of the committee who \nmust entertain all sorts of suggestions from people who come in and \nhave enthusiasm for doing it now, but I would point out one reason for \nnot moving ahead in November or December, with the farm bill, is that, \nobviously, we have a disagreement.\n  One may say the Secretary of Agriculture is entitled to her opinion \nand we may be entitled to ours. If we want to stack the $73.5 billion, \n$50 billion in the first 5 years, that is up to us. But on the other \nhand, at this point the administration has indicated the $73.5 billion \nis available, that the budget assumptions that have been made are the \nones that have been followed through, and, indeed, the President's \nbudget submission includes this.\n  But she is saying maybe enough is enough. We don't want to spend any \nmore of that money in the first half because that is going to make for \na very difficult period following that, in which the suggestions of \nSenators will be: Let's at least do what we have been doing before. At \nthat point we have a much richer product over the 10-year period of \ntime than the administration or the Budget Committees have agreed to. \nIn any event, we will address that, I am certain, in several amendments \nthat will reduce that sum of money in the first 5 years.\n  A more comprehensive critique of what we have been doing appeared in \nthe Washington Post this morning. It appeared earlier in Newsweek \nmagazine under the byline of the noted economist Robert J. Samuelson. I \nwish to quote directly from some of the paragraphs of economist \nSamuelson's analysis.\n  He starts with the proposition:\n\n       Government programs are, for all practical purposes, \n     immortal.\n\n  Perhaps so and perhaps not. But then he offers as evidence of this.\n       Anyone who doubts this last proposition should examine the \n     farm subsidy programs, which are the classic example of how \n     unnecessary spending survives. Here is a parable for our \n     larger budget predicament. Every year the government sends \n     out checks to about 700,000 to 900,000 farmers. Since 1978, \n     federal outlays to support farmers' incomes have exceeded \n     $300 billion. How large is that? Well, the publicly held \n     federal debt (the result of past budget deficits) is about \n     $3.3 trillion. The past 23 years of farm subsidies equal \n     almost 10 percent of the debt.\n       But wait: Congress is about to expand the subsidies. The \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates that new farm \n     legislation would increase costs by $65 billion over a 10-\n     year period, on top of the $128.5 billion of existing \n     programs. (And these figures exclude costs for agricultural \n     research, trade and nutritional programs.) The Republican-\n     controlled House has passed one version; the Democratic-\n     controlled Senate is about to debate a slightly different \n     version. And the Bush administration has supported what it \n     calls the bill's ``generous'' funding levels. ``Extravagant'' \n     would be more like it.\n       Government spending should reflect some ``public \n     interest.'' For farm subsidies, this is hard to find.\n       Let's examine the possibilities. Do we need subsidies to \n     ensure food production? No. The subsidies go mainly for \n     wheat, corn, rice, cotton, soybean and airy production, \n     representing about a third of U.S. farm output. The rest \n     (beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, fruits) receive no direct \n     subsidies. Has anyone noticed shortages of chicken, lettuce, \n     carrots or bacon? The idea that, without subsidies, America \n     wouldn't produce ample wheat for bread, milk for ice cream or \n     corn for animal feed is absurd. Before the 1930s no federal \n     subsides existed, yet annual wheat production rose 77 percent \n     to 887 million bushels from 1880 to 1930.\n       Do subsidies ``save the small family farm''? In the 1930s, \n     or even 1950s, this argument might have been plausible. No \n     more. Mechanization and better seed varieties have promoted \n     farm consolidation. In 1935 there were 6.8 million farms. In \n     1997 there were 1.9 million and, of these, about 350,000 \n     accounted for almost 90 percent of farm production. These \n     farms had at least $100,000 in sales. About 42 percent of \n     food production came from farms with $1 million or more in \n     sales. Countless newspaper stories complain that subsidies go \n     overwhelmingly to large, wealthy farmers. But given the \n     distribution of food production, they must go to large \n     farmers--unless government decides to subsidize farmers who \n     essentially don't farm.\n       Do subsidies stabilize farm incomes, offsetting period of \n     low prices? Not much. There are two problems. First: When \n     crop prices drop, the subsidies promote overproduction, which \n     prolongs and deepens the price decline. Second: The value of \n     the subsidies increases the prices of agricultural land by \n     about 20 percent, according to the Agriculture Department. \n     This raises the purchase prices for new farmers or lease \n     payments for farmers who rent their fields.\n\n  We found in the USDA report this year, 42 percent of farmers are, in \nfact, renters.\n\n       About 45 percent of crop land is leased [according to \n     Samuelson] as opposed to the 42 percent USDA suggested. And \n     of course, there's this question: Why should government \n     stabilize farmers' incomes? It doesn't stabilize incomes of \n     plumbers, print shops or most businesses.\n       Despite farm programs' nonexistent public benefits, \n     Congress routinely extends the programs for political \n     reasons. On the public-relations front, farmers are thought \n     to be hard-working and, therefore, deserving. Somehow, it \n     seems unfair to withdraw a government benefit they're \n     accustomed to receiving. And if farm programs didn't exist, \n     the congressional agriculture committees would be less \n     powerful. So would various farm lobbies and interest groups. \n     They all have an interest in perpetuating the subsidies. \n     Finally, there's control of Congress.\n\n  At this point, Mr. Samuelson quotes me. So this quote was my own.\n\n       ``The main factor is a concern among lawmakers of both \n     parties that power in Congress could hinge on a few races in \n     heavily subsidized agricultural regions,'' Sen. Richard \n     Lugar, Republican of Indiana, bravely wrote in The New York \n     Times. ``If either party stands in the way of this largesse, \n     they risk being labeled the `anti-farm party' and targeted \n     with sentimental imagery associated with farm failures.''\n\n  Back to Samuelson:\n\n       Farm subsidies are huge political bribes. Though they're \n     perfectly legal, the ethics are questionable. The trouble is \n     that hardly anyone raises the questions. The silence defines \n     Washington's self-serving and hypocritical ``morality.'' \n     Everyone in Congress is justifiably outraged these days by \n     Enron's collapse and the losses for workers and investors. \n     But the same legislators will vote for massive giveaways of \n     billions of dollars to farmers without any sense of shame or \n     outrage. There is no inkling that they might be plundering \n     the public purse and doing wrong. (The press is guilty of \n     similar hypocrisy. Farm subsidies excite casual, intermittent \n     curiosity.\n\n  I am hopeful that these remarks will excite both Senators and the \npress because I think we are on the threshold of a very large mistake \nin the commodity section.\n  I have made these points before, but let me tick through them \nquickly.\n  One problem with the farm bill that now lies before us is that it \ndoes increase subsidies very substantially.\n  From the beginning of the debate, the suggestion has been that the \nBudget Committee set aside $73.5 billion for additional farm subsidies \nover the next 10 years. The dilemma here is that the subsidies will \ncreate incentives for more production. They are production based. The \nmore bushels, the more dollars for the farmer who produces the bushels. \nAs a result, unless El Nino, or some extraordinary weather phenomenon \nsuch as a comet crash, or something of that variety occurs, it is\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nvery predictable that production of the five basic row crops--cotton, \nrice, soybeans, corn, and wheat--will increase very substantially over \nthe next 5 years. Perhaps export demand will escalate rapidly. Perhaps \nwe will do the things we need to do and evade the blockages of the \nWorld Trade Organization and our trading partners that for the moment \nare outraged by this bill.\n  Letters I have received from ambassadors from friendly trading \ncountries--the Australian Ambassador, for example, or Commissioner \nFisher of the EU, and others--point out very troubled waters ahead. But \nperhaps we will overcome that. I hope we will because there is no way \nout of the box unless we export a whole lot more to meet the production \ngains we are going to have.\n  The genius of American agriculture is that the yields continue year \nby year. That is the potential salvation for feeding people all over \nthe world. But between now and then, the question is, How do we get the \nproduct out of the country? Failure to do that will lead to oversupply \nin the country and lower prices. That will trigger higher subsidies. \nThis is what countercyclical is all about. It never counters, it goes \none way --down.\n  If that were all of it, that would be bad enough. But the problem is \nthat only 40 percent or fewer of American farmers are going to receive \nany of these subsidies. That is the nature of the row crop situation.\n  Sixty percent--three-fifths--a majority of farmers, really have no \ninterest in these subsidies at all. At least they are not going to \nreceive them. That is not widely understood among farmers, quite apart \nfrom the public as a whole. The public as a whole, when they hear of \nthat, say: How can this be? This is the way the program started in the \n1930s, and it has been perpetuated.\n  That is not the half of it. Take this 40 percent. The statistics show \nin State after State over two-thirds of the money--just in this 40 \npercent--goes to this 10 percent of the 40. The 4 percent is the total. \nStated another way, we are now down to 60 percent at zero, and 10 \npercent of the 40, or 4 percent, are getting about two-thirds of all \nthe money. The public say, that is preposterous; how in the world can \npeople in a democratic legislative body skew the payments in such a \ndistorted manner that 4 percent of the farms get two-thirds of all the \nresults? We are doing it. We have done it, and we are about to compound \nit.\n  It is no wonder that small farmers go out of business. These bills \nguarantee it. The same Senators on the floor today who will say, What \nabout the small family farmer, and what about the medium-sized family \nfarmer--I am here to tell you that farmer is not going to do well under \nthis bill. Land prices will continue to go up. I do not predict a \nbubble. Nevertheless, in my own farm situation, I have witnessed \nmanagement--I have owned farms since 1956--and at least two situations \nof crash and burn. I can recall--I think most Senators who are \nfollowing this in our committee will recall--the boom of the 1970s in \nwhich those of us who had land throughout that greater time saw an \nincrease of two or three times the value only to see 50 or 60 percent \nof that stripped away in the early years of the 1980s.\n\n  Why is it that we are failing by going through this history again and \nagain? We do it because our programs almost mandate it. USDA's 120-page \nbooklet goes through chapter and verse about how it happens. It is no \nmystery.\n  The problem is, for young farmers looking into this, it is a tragedy \nin terms of entry. For 42 percent of our farmers who rent, it is a \ntragedy because their rents go up. That is a big percentage.\n  Whether Members understand who the farmers are in their States or \nnot, the farmers understand their predicament, and the 60 percent who \nare getting nothing understand that zero. By now, given the \nEnvironmental Working Group site, the rest of the farmers understand \nwho the 10 percent are who are getting two-thirds of what happens in \ntheir States. They have them listed by name. That is new. And a good \nnumber of farmers are suggesting is not fair because it is an intrusion \nof Government payments. It is an intrusion because in some cases \nfarmers have been receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n  I don't go into the extraordinary cases of movie stars, basketball \nplayers, universities, and so forth. After all, under the rules of the \ngame, they own the land and they produce the stuff. Nevertheless, there \nare some anomalies here that have not been taken well.\n  The predicament is that we have a farm bill as it stands before us, \nbefore we start amending it, that, in my judgment, almost guarantees \nlower prices, guarantees larger payments, and the payments we know go \nto very few people. They are huge.\n  In November and December, I made the point--and I will make it even \nmore forcefully now--that this debate occurs in almost an ``Alice in \nWonderland'' situation in which somehow we can talk about farm policy \nas if it were totally divorced from the budget of the U.S. Government \nor from the needs of ordinary people.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, \nand others on the committee have pointed out that the billions of \ndollars in deficit that we are now piling up are taken out of the \nSocial Security funds. That is now clear. We are in deficit finance. We \nare not in surpluses. This is not free money. Social Security \nrecipients surely understand that the $73.5 billion is coming out of \nthe Social Security fund. It is money that could be spent perhaps for \nreform of Medicare, prescription drugs for the elderly, and other items \nthat most of us in our campaign talked about and promised but clearly \nare not going to occur so long as our Government is running huge \ndeficits.\n\n  We are doing the deficits because we have a war on. And that is \nproper because terrorists hit our country on September the 11th. But \nthat is the country in which we live. Agriculture is not divorced from \nthat which is our country. It is not another world in which we deal \nwith a very few farmers, maybe 4 percent of the people who are doing \nbusiness.\n  How farmers could get into such a predicament is easily predictable, \ngiven the types of policies we are about to formulate; albeit, telling \nthe farmers: We are doing it for you and we want your support.\n  If farmers ever figure this out, we will not have their support. They \nwill wonder how misguided we could have been.\n  We have been through these arguments several times. I appreciate the \nindulgence of my colleagues in listening to them again. But we do have \na second chance. Thank goodness we did not adopt this legislation in \nunamended form in November or December because we will be coming into \nconference with a House bill that, in my judgment, is equally \ndisastrous.\n  Madam President, with these thoughts in mind, I hope we can proceed \nthrough the amendments in an orderly way. I promise to work with the \ndistinguished chairman to make that so.\n  We are now getting the ideas from all of our Senators on this side of \nthe aisle. I understand that is occurring with the chairman. Hopefully, \nwe will have a finite list of amendments and have an idea of a roadmap \nfor a successful conclusion.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2604\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nbusiness before the Senate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment No. 2604 with a 30-\nminute time limit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. With a 30-minute time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators Grassley, \nFeingold, Wellstone, and Enzi. This is the livestock production \ncontract amendment that I offered in December. This amendment furthers \none of the\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nmost important goals of this farm bill, and that is to promote \ncompetition.\n  We had a competition title in the original farm bill I introduced in \nthe committee. Two other amendments have already been adopted: Senator \nFeingold's amendment prohibiting mandatory arbitration in livestock \ncontracts, and Senator Johnson's amendment on packer ownership.\n  My amendment will address yet one more issue in the competition \narena, and that is livestock production contracts and the right to \ndiscuss contracts with close advisers.\n  The amendment does two things: It closes a loophole in the Packers \nand Stockyards Act by including livestock production contracts under \nits jurisdiction; and, secondly, it provides livestock producers the \nability to discuss terms of their contracts with certain people, such \nas their attorney, banker, landlord, and Government agencies charged \nwith protecting a party to the contract.\n\n  Livestock production contracting is an arrangement between a packer \nor another owner of livestock and a farmer. The basic contract requires \na farmer to provide the buildings, the equipment, and the labor to \nraise the livestock; and the livestock is owned by someone else, the \ncontractor.\n  This type of arrangement differs from the traditional livestock \nindustry structure where the farmer both owned and raised the \nlivestock. In the poultry sector, production contracting is nearly \nuniversal and, I might add, has been covered by the Packers and \nStockyards Act since 1935. It is becoming more prevalent in hogs, and \nis growing in the cattle industry.\n  What this amendment would do is protect livestock production growers \nfrom unfair and deceptive acts. The same type of fairness rules are \ncommon in other markets where people are threatened by inequitable \nbargaining positions. For instance, Federal law affords similar \nprotections to produce and vegetable growers, automobile dealers, \ngasoline franchisees, individual securities investors, and livestock \nfarmers who own the livestock.\n  Currently, the Packers and Stockyards Act provides protections for \nfarmers who sell livestock to packers. That has been in the law since \n1921. But the act does not protect those who raise livestock, under a \nproduction contract, for someone else. The amendment would close this \nloophole. Current law does not fit current practice. Production \ncontracts, as I said, are becoming more common.\n  In 1990--just 11, 12 years ago--production contracting in the hog \nindustry was almost unheard of. By the year 2000, 34 percent of hogs \nwere raised under production contracts.\n  So again, farmers and ranchers need this amendment because the \nconsolidation and vertical integration of the markets are providing \nthem an unequitable bargaining position.\n  Livestock production contract growers are the ones most at risk of \nunfair conduct because, like a franchisee, they tend to make large \ninvestments to enter into a contract, and then they feel constrained to \nendure unfair treatment because of their large capital investments.\n  Basically, the amendment would allow a producer to share his or her \ncontract with their attorney, business adviser, landlord, manager, \nfamily, and State and Federal agencies charged with protecting parties \nto the contract.\n  The amendment does not require anyone to share the contract if they \ndo not want to. And it does not say the contract should be made public \nin any way. The provision even allows contracts between a contractor \nand farmer to prohibit farmers from sharing a contract with their \nneighbors or the contractor's competitors, for example.\n  So, again, the amendment enjoys broad support. The American Farm \nBureau Federation and the National Farmers' Union--the two largest \ngeneral farm organizations--as well as dozens of other farm and \nconsumer groups, support the amendment.\n  It is bipartisan. As I mentioned, there is support on both sides of \nthe aisle for this amendment. I am hopeful we can adopt the amendment.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2607, As Modified; Amendment No. 2608, As Modified; and \n                    Amendment No. 2602, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNos. 2607 and 2608 be modified with the text at the desk, and that \nWellstone amendment No. 2602 be modified with the text of amendment No. \n2631.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator want on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am sorry, I did not realize we were under time \nagreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to go back to a very \nimportant subject that the Senator from Indiana brought up, and that is \nwhether or not the bill is compliant in the future with some of our \nWorld Trade Organization obligations.\n  I think it is very obvious that the committee anticipated that it \nmight not be compliant because on page 35 of the report there is a \nparagraph on the Secretary of Agriculture doing an adjustment to farm \npayments if that becomes a problem.\n  I cannot find fault with the writers of the legislation for putting \nthis in here because in the other body, in the House bill--a Republican \nbill--they saw this as a problem, too.\n  On page 131 of that House bill it says: The Secretary may make \nadjustments in the amount of such expenditures during that period to \nensure that such expenditures do not exceed but in no case be less than \nsuch allowable levels.\n  To me, it is a very serious problem we have; albeit, you might say it \nis going to happen--if it happens at all--in a minority of the \ninstances because, as the Senator referred to FAPRI of Iowa State and \nMissouri, you said you think they said it would happen 30 percent of \nthe time.\n  But if you are in a situation where it happens that 37 percent of the \ntime and we exceed and we are retaliated against, and that would be \nlegal retaliation and it would be retaliation at a time, presumably, we \nget high payments, farmers are already in trouble or they wouldn't get \nthe additional payments. So you could find yourself in a situation \nwhere at the very time prices are going down, and we also have the \nadditional problems that we can't export because we are being \nretaliated against, that just at the time farmers need the safety net, \nthen that safety net has one great big hole in it.\n  We need to find some way to protect the American farmer so that the \nsafety net the farmer has doesn't have a big hole in it. And we ought \nto also do it because we are in the leadership of all the nations of \nthe world on reducing barriers to trade, particularly through our work \nin the Cairns group of nations. We are trying to get impediments to \nagricultural trade down to zero, both from the standpoint of market \nopening and from the standpoint of tariffs. That is our goal in the \nnext round of negotiations under WTO.\n  If we are a nation in trade that believes in the rule of law, we have \nto follow the rule of law. We anticipate we would be in trouble on that \nbecause of the farm bill. It seems to me at a time that we are talking \nabout a safety net for farmers, we ought to do what we can to make sure \nthat hole is mended before this bill leaves the Senate. If it goes to \nthe House and the House is willing to ignore it, then where are we? We \nare in a situation where down the road 5 to 10 years, depending on how \nlong a farm bill we have, we have a big potential problem for the \nAmerican family farmer. When they need help, they aren't going to get \nit. We can't go to the WTO and complain because we ourselves have \nrecognized the possibility we might be in jeopardy.\n\n  In this regard, since we are going into the negotiations in the WTO--\nthey start next week--I think, in the special round on agriculture that \nis going to be discussed in Geneva, for example, even the larger \nnegotiations of the Doha development round, we are hoping to accomplish \na great deal in reducing or eliminating tariff barriers and tariffs on \nagricultural products. In fact, it is such an important item, I think \neventually we are going to start referring to this as the agricultural \nround. We are going to set an example. We have always tried to set an \nexample.\n  Where we are, if we pass a bill that potentially violates WTO, we are \ngiving encouragement to the competitor that we most have trouble with--\nEurope. Europe has about 85 percent of all of the subsidies for exports \nin the entire world. Europe has about a $400 billion common \nagricultural program.\n  We want that common agricultural program reduced. I think Europe \nknows they have to reduce it. We are going to be in a situation where \nwe pass this legislation and, as they are looking at their common \nagricultural program, which they are doing, they are going to put off \nthe big decisions of reducing that until probably the year 2005.\n  In the process of our complaining to them about they aren't doing \nenough, they are obviously going to cite not only what they believe the \nimpact of our legislation is, but they are also going to cite that our \nlegislation actually recognizes that as based upon this paragraph on \npage 35 and based upon the House bill.\n  I don't know why we don't live in the real world and why we don't try \nto deal with this. I am not saying that in a denigrating way to the \nSenator from Indiana. I am just saying that in a commonsense approach \nbecause he recognizes it. I suppose for the people who write the bill, \nthey don't find an easy way to get out of it other than putting this \nparagraph and this language in the respective bills of the House and \nthe Senate. This isn't directed towards Democrats because Republicans \nhave put us in this boat as well.\n  I know that the White House sees this as a problem. They want us to \nwork our way out of it. I happened to be able to have breakfast this \nmorning with the person who is going to succeed Mr. Mooree as executive \nfor the World Trade Organization, Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi of \nThailand. He is a parliamentarian there. He is going to take over in \nSeptember. He expressed this concern to me as well. And, by the way, \nhis country is very much a participant in the Cairns group that wants \nto eliminate agricultural subsidies. He reminded me, even though he has \na small country, his agricultural subsidies are $1.3 billion compared \nto Europe's $400 billion. But regardless, he says that it does not put \nthe United States in a very good position going into the Doha round of \nnegotiations to be able to say to the other 142 nations, in particular, \nas we address the 77 developing nations within the World Trade \nOrganization that tend to be more protective about their agriculture, \nand wanting to do less in this area, it doesn't put us in a very good \nposition if we are writing legislation that we recognize is a potential \nviolation of the world trading organization because we are exceeding \nthe $19.1 billion that is in the amber box limit.\n  I have put forth some suggested amendments, a couple different \napproaches that I would have to confess maybe don't totally meet our \nrequirements under the WTO, but I think tend away from heavy reliance \nupon price and heavy reliance upon production, which are the two items \nthat if we tie our payments to tend to make us violate amber box \nrequirements.\n\n  I want to work with both managers of the bill and see what we can do \nabout this. To repeat the two or three reasons why I want to work with \nthem, because, No. 1, we brag about passing a safety net for farmers, \nthat safety net\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nshould be a pretty certain safety net for the next 5 to 10 years, the \nlength of the legislation. At a time when it is most needed, it should \nbe most predictable what would happen.\n  This language tells me that the bankers, to whom we are always \nlistening, have to know what the farm program is going to be so they \ncan make loans to farmers. They are going to look at this and say: We \nreally don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield 30 seconds of the opposition time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No. 2, then, so that we maintain our leadership in this \neffort to reduce trade barriers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the Chair? Is there \n15 minutes of opposition time, minus the concession to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the legislation offered by the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair contains provisions that respond, \nin my judgment, to a number of unintended consequences for the farm \nsector of our economy.\n  I believe it is a matter of fact that in order for Senators to have a \npretty good idea, at least, of how this amendment shapes up, a letter \nhas come to me from a number of groups that are affected. Let me cite \nthose groups. It was signed by the American Cotton Shippers \nAssociation; American Soybean Association; National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation; National Chicken Council; National Corn Growers \nAssociation; National Cotton Council; National Pork Producers Council; \nNational Sunflower Association; United Egg Producers; U.S. Canola \nAssociation, and the Wheat Export Trade Committee.\n  They have written the following letter, which responds to the \nSenator's amendment:\n\n       The Senate Agriculture Committee may soon be considering \n     legislation as part of the Farm Bill to address the issue of \n     agricultural competition and concentration. This extremely \n     broad legislation would give the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture unprecedented authority to regulate corporate \n     relationships, commercial practices and contracts for the \n     production of agricultural commodities.\n       Tough laws already exist to ensure open and fair \n     competition throughout the U.S. economy--including \n     agribusiness. The current laws should be aggressively \n     enforced. Creating new laws in an already complex regulatory \n     environment is unnecessary and could result in serious \n     unintended consequences. Legislation limiting the ability of \n     agribusiness to attract the needed capital for future \n     development could harm the constituents that this legislation \n     is intended to serve.\n       Risk is an ever-present element of agriculture and \n     effectively managing risk is a fundamental goal of \n     agricultural producers. The key to effectively managing risk \n     involves the use of creative risk management tools. Farmers \n     and ranchers have worked with agribusiness firms to develop \n     creative solutions for managing risk. Implementing these \n     solutions requires capital investment, and to attract the \n     necessary capital, firms must offer attractive rates of \n     return. Statutory and regulatory burdens that focus on \n     agriculture--ignoring the broader economy--inhibit the \n     ability of agribusiness to attract the necessary capital to \n     stay competitive and provide innovative risk management \n     solutions.\n       Unique marketing opportunities and new products present \n     premium opportunities for producers. Placing agriculture \n     under an isolated legal umbrella could well inhibit progress \n     and limit the ability of agricultural producers to adopt new \n     and innovative systems that increase profitability and \n     sustainability. Modifying existing laws and statutes could \n     segregate agriculture from the rest of the economy, causing \n     capital flight and hurting long-term growth, investment, \n     competitiveness and success of agribusiness and consequently \n     American agriculture.\n       Several state legislatures have taken steps such as the \n     ones we are concerned about, and the results have been \n     negative not only for agribusiness, but for producers as \n     well. For instance, South Dakota and Missouri passed well-\n     intentioned price discrimination legislation that resulted in \n     severe cash/spot market disruptions, and Minnesota has passed \n     legislation that has hindered the availability of some risk \n     management and quality-based production contracts.\n       In this day and age, agriculture needs more capital and \n     human investment in order to remain productive for the long \n     term. The undersigned organizations will not support \n     legislation that would create unfair regulatory burdens or \n     cause scarce capital resources to be diverted away from \n     agriculture toward other sectors of the economy.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Cotton Shippers Association\n       American Soybean Association\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association\n       National Chicken Council\n       National Corn Growers Association\n       National Cotton Council\n       National Pork Producers Council\n       National Sunflower Association\n       National Turkey Federation\n       United Egg Producers\n       U.S. Canola Association\n       Wheat Export Trade Education Committee\n\n  I find merit in what has been suggested by these groups. I regret \nthat the amendment would add, in my judgment, burdens and costs, \nrestrictions, and more regulations for producers. It appears to me the \ntools that have been created are, in fact, both innovative and do help \nto manage risk. I hope they will be perpetuated.\n  Processors use contracting, which is a specific subject of the \nSenator's amendment, to secure stable and consistent supplies of the \nproducts that the market desires, as well as increasing operating \nefficiency.\n  A Purdue University study of agricultural contracting conveys the \nconcern that legislation prohibiting or impeding contracting in \nagriculture could spur increased coordination in agribusiness. The \nstudy discusses the need for a contract in order for a process or to \nguarantee a quality and consistent product to consumers. I think that \nis the heart of the argument.\n  In essence, contracting is helpful in managing risk. It is helpful, \nat least to the buyer, to make certain of the quality and quantity and \nthe supply of what is required for the benefit of consumers down the \ntrail. Therefore, I am hopeful that the amendment will not be adopted. \nI appreciate the spirit in which it has been offered. I hope Senators \nwill take seriously the arguments I have presented and, even more \nimportantly, the arguments presented by the distinguished list of \nagricultural producers that authored the letter I cited.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a mild colloquy?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the ranking member, is that the letter that came \nlast fall or is it a new one? I am not familiar with that. If that is \nthe one----\n  Mr. LUGAR. It came in November of last year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think that letter is just opposed to the whole \ncompetition title that we had in the chairman's mark of the farm bill \nlast fall.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am sure the Senator is correct. There are a number of \naspects of the competition title to which it would refer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. That is why this amendment I have offered is much \nmore limited in scope than the broad issue they were talking about.\n  Mr. LUGAR. They cited contracting in that part of it specifically, \nbut it covers, obviously, a much more comprehensive set of \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to make sure this wasn't a different letter. I \nthank the ranking member.\n  Madam President, when I took the chair, I had yielded some time to \nSenator Grassley from Iowa. I thought he was going to talk on this \namendment. He wanted to talk on something else. I think my time has \nexpired on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes to respond a little bit to the letter written.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think, again, the letter that was read addressed the \nentire competition title and it was comprehensive. This amendment is \nmuch more narrow. It only affects production contracts in livestock. \nThe letter does not point out, nor have I heard anybody point out, any \nspecific negative consequences that could occur from this very limited \ntype of amendment. This provides for fairness in production \ncontracting. It closes a loophole in the Packers and Stockyards Act. \nThat act already covers production contracting in poultry and has since \n1935, if I am not mistaken. But at that time there\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nwas no such thing as production contracting in other areas, such as \nlivestock, cattle, and hogs, it was not addressed. Since then, \nproduction contracting has become much more prevalent in livestock.\n\n  As I pointed out, in 1990, there wasn't such a thing. Now, 30 to 35 \npercent of all our hogs are raised under production contracts. If we \nwill provide fairness rules for gasoline station owners, for Dairy \nQueen owners, or securities dealers, or others that are franchisees, to \ngive them a little bit of fairness in their contracts, that is all we \nare trying to do with our cattle and hog producers.\n  Again, this is to close the loophole in the Packers and Stockyards \nAct. I cannot imagine why our cattle producers or any organization that \nrepresents them would be opposed to that. Who are they representing? \nWhat organization is going to tell my farmers they can't have \nprotections under the Packers and Stockyards Act like our poultry \nproducers do?\n  The packers, of course, want unlimited power. All we are trying to do \nis put in some fairness, and this amendment does that.\n  I thank the Chair for yielding this additional time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, today I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Harkin. This amendment puts ranchers with production \ncontracts under the same umbrella of protections the Packers and \nStockyards Act provides to other livestock producers. Producers with \nproduction contracts, excluding those that raise poultry, are not \nincluded in the Packers and Stockyards Act. They are not protected from \nunfair and deceptive practices as other livestock producers are.\n  In a production contract, a producer provides the labor and materials \nto raise livestock owned by another individual, the contractor. Until \nrecently, the contractor could be a packer or another person. On \nDecember 13, 2001, this body passed an amendment to the farm bill that \nprevents packers from owning, feeding, or controlling livestock more \nthan 14 days before slaughter. This means that packers can no longer \ndirectly enter into production contracts because they would own the \nlivestock more than 14 days before slaughter. However, the amendment we \npassed in December does not prevent other individuals from production \ncontracting with producers. These producers with production contracts \nneed the same protections other producers receive against unfair and \ndeceptive practices.\n  We should not be fooled into thinking that this ban of packer \nownership we passed in December will completely shrink packer influence \nover the market. This bill must still go to conference and the ban will \nface incredible scrutiny. The ban will probably go the way many similar \namendments have gone in the past. Amendments that reduce the choke hold \nof the packers have routinely disappeared in conference. It took years \nof work to get mandatory price reporting into law. However, we all know \nthe packers are still withholding a fair amount of pricing information \nfrom producers.\n  Many of you may be wondering why these producers need protection from \ntheir contractors. A production contract entails a large capital \ninvestment to feed, shelter, and care for the livestock that the \nproducer does not own. Many producers have suffered through unfair \ntreatment because their contract was too large to risk contending with \nthe unfair practices. This great pressure from the contractor was also \nthe reason the second part of the amendment was included.\n  The second portion of the amendment guarantees that the producers \nhave the right to discuss the contract with their business advisors, \nlandlord, managers, family, and State and Federal agencies charged with \nprotecting parties to the contract. In States where producers already \nhave this right, the pressure and intimidation from contractors is so \nextreme producers forego sharing the contents of their contracts. They \nfear retribution. Other producers are given contracts with secrecy \nclauses that prevent them from discussing the contract terms with \nindividuals that could help protect their interests.\n  This amendment offers an overlooked group of livestock producers the \nsame protections others in their industry already have. They would be \nprotected from unfair and deceptive acts and given the right to discuss \ntheir contracts with certain individuals. I urge my colleagues to throw \nyour support behind this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I appreciate the arguments made by the \ndistinguished Senator. It would appear to this Senator, however, that \nthe objectives of the Harkin amendment are already met on the statute \nbooks. The reason I have suggested that the amendment creates confusion \nis that it might subject the current law to reinterpretation. To that \nextent, it seems to me that this amendment is not productive, except of \npotential confusion and difficulty. Very clearly, current statutes are \nagainst fraud, unjust practices, and abusive activity in contracting.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, the groups I cited, that at least a \ngood number of members who are subject to the competition section, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa has pointed out, and this part of \nit in particular, object for good reason and cite this is going to be \ndisruptive at least in terms of their operations and capital flow in \nwhat they are doing.\n  For those reasons, I do not perceive the necessity for the amendment \nand ask Members to vote in opposition.\n  Madam President, unless there is further need of debate by my \ndistinguished colleague, I yield back my time on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Under the \nunanimous consent agreement entered into some time ago, what is the \nnext order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business is 40 minutes of \ndebate on the two amendments by the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand the Senator from Montana will be in the \nChamber very shortly. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2607, As Modified, and Amendment No. 2608, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my ranking member. I assume my \ntwo amendments are in order.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. I yield to the Senator 20 minutes \nof the 40 minutes allocated for debate on the amendments for his \ncontrol.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend from Indiana. I do not think I will \ntake that much time because these amendments were pretty well discussed \nprior to the holiday break.\n  There was some question about a budgetary point of order. I have \nsince modified these amendments, and they are in concert with the \nbudget and ready for consideration because it is a change in policy on \nhow we handle CRP, the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  One of the amendments limits the number of acres--these will be the \nnew acres coming into the system or any acres that are renewed--a \nfarmer can enroll in the CRP.\n  What we are seeing in rural America is that instead of selling the \nfarm or the ranch to a younger farmer or putting the acres into \nproduction, those acres are enrolled in the CRP and they do not produce \nanything. In other words, the farmer who enrolls them takes the check \nand it is like going to Arizona--he is still getting the paycheck and \nstill paying for the farm.\n  I think this is wrong. Those acres are enrolled for a good purpose. \nThe original intent of CRP was to put marginal acres in the CRP and \nleave the good acres to production. What happened? The trend has \nreversed, and farmers are putting in some good land. It forced some of \nthe fellows who needed to raise their production into breaking up some \nland that was marginal for grain production.\n  This one amendment calls for a limitation on the number of acres a \nfarmer can put in the CRP. It is not the total\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nacres of a county or a State but for each farmer.\n  The other amendment deals with the form of payment. As I said, we had \none payment for everything. It was designed to take those marginal \nacres, highly erodable acres, out of production for a conservation \nreason--wildlife habitat. It worked. Land was set aside. The population \nof upland birds, sporting birds, and wildlife returned to those areas.\n  Then, because payment for the acres increased, good land was being \nput into the CRP. That was not the intent of the Conservation Reserve \nProgram.\n  What my second amendment says is we will pay higher prices for those \nacres that are highly erodable and should not be farmed and should be \nset aside for conservation purposes--in other words, it is just good \nconservation--and a lower price for the highly productive land because \nthat is the land that should be in production.\n  I do not know how many people have gone through our rural areas, but \nCRP has not been a great thing for our smaller towns. One does not see \ndealerships. Machinery dealerships have gone away, and feed and wheat \nhouses have gone away because good land was put into the CRP and taken \nout of production, and nothing happens on that land. That is not what \nthe original intent of CRP was about.\n  As I stated to the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, these \nissues have been pretty well aired. The purpose, as far as I can see, \nis good conservation. It also is good business practice.\n  If there are questions, I will certainly entertain some conversation \non these amendments. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, in conversations with my friend from \nMontana and with the staff, I understand there is a budget score on \nthese amendments that may be a problem. In discussions with the Senator \nfrom Montana, he has obviously raised some good points. Part of the \nbill addresses some of the problems already. I refer to page 213 of the \nbill, section 212. We provide for a study on economic effects regarding \nthe Conservation Reserve Program.\n  Our staffs are going to work together to develop further language, as \nI understand, that could be added to this section to for additional \nstudies in the area that the Senator from Montana is concerned about, \nbut that would not have a budget scoring implication. We will work \ntogether with the staff of the Senator to try to develop that language.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Iowa. I don't \nthink we have any other route until we complete this study. Maybe we \ncan enlighten our friends down at the CBO. They came up with \nunbelievable numbers. We changed our language, on their recommendation. \nThere was a point of order raised when we first offered the amendments; \nthey were wrong then. Then they suggested the language. Now they say \nthe language is not good enough. So here we go again.\n  I take issue with their numbers. However, I will not take issue with \nthe recommendation made from the chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture. We need to complete some sort of a comprehensive study of \nrural areas and the impact that CRP, specifically this program, has had \non rural communities, when you take good land out of production or you \npay the same for highly erodable land and highly productive land. I \nthink we can work on some language.\n  We would like to see what happened. Maybe they will put some little \nfellow somewhere to work, give him a job for the next 2 or 3 months and \nmaybe we can come back and change some of this.\n  It defies common sense. They say that is about all the sense I have--\npretty common--but it defies common sense that this would have an \nimpact on the budget or outlays of money when we talk about the \nenrollment of acres into a conservation program, designed for a good \nreason, but that has gone astray. We are trying to fix that. That is \nall we are trying to do. If it requires a study and we have to go back \nand visit with those people, that is what we will have to do.\n  I thank my friend and his staff for that recommendation. I think it \nis a good recommendation.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2607, As Modified, and Amendment No. 2608, As Modified, \n                               Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I will withdraw these amendments.\n  If the manager of the bill will permit me a hold somewhere in there, \nsay, if we get the language worked out, then we can reoffer these \namendments, referring to the section that he recommended in his opening \nstatement.\n  I appreciate the help of my good friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2607 and 2608, as modified) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Montana, we will work together to \ntry to get this language modified. I guarantee the Senator he will have \nthe opportunity to offer that at some point before we finish this bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2602\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2602.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President and colleagues, this is a simple \nreform amendment. We have done a lot of good in the farm bill--I thank \nthe chairman, Senator Harkin--which I really think represents a reform \nmeasure. The energy section of the bill is very important, economic \ndevelopment, and the Conservation Security Act, and the list goes on.\n  I think the amendment Senator Johnson offered--I was proud to offer \nit with him--on captive supply is extremely important. The country-of-\norigin label is really important. Later in this debate, we will \nconsider a payment limitation amendment that I am in favor of which \nwould stop subsidizing the megafarms that have driven independent \nproducers out of business.\n  Part of the problem right now in the food industry is a few \nconglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table exercising \ntheir raw economic and political power over independent producers, over \ntaxpayers, and over consumers.\n  This debate has made me a true conservative. I am interested in \nputting more free enterprise into the free enterprise system. I want \nmore competition in the food industry and more competition in \nagriculture.\n  If you support a payment limitation, you should certainly be in \nsupport of this amendment. This amendment is about stopping the flow of \nbenefits to these large livestock conglomerates that over the years \nhave been squeezing out the independent producers and that have also \nall too often represented an assault on the environment.\n  The amendment is simple. It says we in the Congress should and will \nwork to help alleviate the environmental and public health threat posed \nby existing large-scale animal factories. However, Congress should not \nbe subsidizing the expansion of these large animal confinement \noperations.\n  My colleagues should know that this amendment has broad support from \nboth the farm and environmental community with groups such as the \nNational Farmers Union, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense, \nEnvironmental Working Group, the Humane Society, the National Wildlife \nFederation, National Resources Defense Council, and the Sustainable Ag \nCoalition.\n  Problem: Current law limits payments under the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program--we call it EQIP--to small- and medium-sized \noperations. Any operation with over 1,000 animal units is not now \neligible for EQIP farms. Again, any operation with over 1,000 animal \nunits is not now eligible for EQIP funds.\n  For colleagues who are not from agricultural States, what does 1,000 \nanimal\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nunits mean? It means 1,143 cattle, 714 dairy cows, 5,400 hogs, 454,545 \nboilers, and 66,667 turkeys.\n  Unfortunately, the farm bill of the House of Representatives removes \nthe 1,000 animal unit cap, opening millions of dollars to factory farms \nfor managing their livestock waste. The House bill also raises the \ncurrent payment limitation to $50,000 a year. The Senate Agriculture \nCommittee's farm bill also eliminates the 1,000 animal unit cap and \nraises current payment limits to $50,000 per year.\n\n  Over the last decade, there is little doubt and little debate that we \nhave seen these large-scale animal factories proliferate across the \nNation. These big operations have grown with little regard for \nenvironmental damage and public health threats rising from the huge \namounts of animal waste generated by these operations. Many rural \ncommunities have seen drinking water supplies and recreational waters \ndegraded. In some cases, neighboring property owners, including those \nwho have lived in their communities for generations, have been driven \nfrom their homes as a result of the animal waste. Farmers and ranchers \nhave joined with others in bringing legal action against these \nfactories for the unbearable stench from millions of gallons of liquid \nanimal feces and urine or tons of poultry waste for the degradation of \nsurface and ground water.\n  This is an environmental amendment, but it is more than that. \nAdditionally, the expansion of these factory farms has, in large part, \nled to the disruption of family farms. Across America you see this \nconcentration of livestock production into fewer and larger industrial \noperations taking over, driving out the small businesses.\n  I am saying that these large operations can right now get technical \nassistance. They can receive EQIP money with no problem whatsoever.\n  But what I am saying is they want to expand. Later in the Chamber we \nare going to be talking about this again. If they want to expand, they \nwill be receiving more Government money. The Government ought not be in \nthe business of promoting this expansion by giving money to these large \nconglomerates which quite often are destructive of the environment and \ndestructive of what is good for consumers and are driving independent \nproducers out of business.\n  Again, Senators, I will repeat what I said earlier. There is going to \nbe a payment limitation amendment on the floor. Anyone who is for that \ncertainly ought to be supportive of this amendment.\n  It is very simple. My amendment is simple. It says new or expanding \nlarge-scale animal factories shall not be eligible to receive cost-\nshare funds under the EQIP program for animal waste structures. \nExisting large animal operations would continue to be eligible.\n  That is a very important point for EQIP assistance. Let me be crystal \nclear about that. Let me also say that there has been language added in \nconsultation with both the majority and the minority committee staff to \nmy amendment to clarify the point that adoption of new technologies \ndoes not, absent expansion of capacity, trigger new or expanding \nprovisions. You can always add technology. It is not a problem. We are \nnot talking about new technology. We are talking about the actual \nexpansion of these operations.\n  Another point: What you have going on with these CAFOs is some of \nthese big conglomerates don't own just one but there is multiple \nownership.\n  What I am simply saying is to let us do something but let us do \nsomething for the family farmers. Let us not oversubsidize corporate \noperations that own multiple CAFOs around the country. Some of the \nbiggest hog producers in the United States are these large corporations \nthat own 10, 15, or 20 CAFOs.\n  My amendment says if you own more than one CAFO, you don't get any \ntaxpayer subsidy. I am sick and tired of this taxpayer subsidy in \ninverse relationship to need in agriculture. By the way, so are \nconsumers, so are taxpayers, and so are the citizens we represent.\n\n  Finally, this amendment also disqualifies funds for construction of \nnew livestock waste facilities located in a 100-year floodplain. That \nis a no-brainer. I don't I think even need to explain it.\n  But I do want to point out that this revised amendment would allow \nlivestock operations to expand up to 1,000 animal units, even if they \nare in a 100-year floodplain, but would retain the restriction on \nestablishing new facilities in the floodplain.\n  Colleagues, I have already made it clear that the payment goes not \nfrom 10 to 50 but 10 to 30. So we increase the payment.\n  I have also made the case that for those who say we ought to be \ntargeting the assistance, we ought not to have this largess going out \nto the largest conglomerates, we ought not be using taxpayer money for \nsubsidizing environmental degradation, we ought to be getting this to \nthe independent producers, this amendment is a dream for you.\n  If we do not pass this amendment, you are going to have editorials, \nand I am sure there will be a Web site somewhere that is going to track \nthese CAFO payments and reveal just how these integrators and \ncorporations are receiving them. Frankly, the reason for that is \nCongress just gave it away.\n  This is a reform amendment. I urge my colleagues not to go down this \nroad again. I urge my colleagues to retain some degree of \nreasonableness on the payment limit issue.\n  For those who support reform on the crop side, we should support this \nmeasure. If we don't pass this amendment, we will see the same abuses \nin the EQIP program as we have seen under the commodity programs with \nall of the money going to the very biggest of the operators. Let us \nmake sure that the small and midsize producers are the ones that get \nthe help. Let's make sure they have access to environmental quality \nincentive payments. Let's not open the floodgates wide to take care of \nthe full costs of any operation no matter how large it is and no matter \nits environmental degradation.\n\n  I simply say the limits in my amendment are triple the size in \ncurrent law and nearly 10 times larger than the current average \npayments. It is reasonable. I urge your support.\n  This is a reform amendment for agriculture. It should be adopted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time does the Senator from \nMinnesota have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask the Senator if he will yield me a \ncouple minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, absolutely. I am very proud to have \nthe support of the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, during the 1996 farm bill debate, I \nsuccessfully offered an amendment to limit cost-share funding under \nEQIP for large confined animal feeding operations, which is present \nlaw.\n  I offered that amendment because of the special environmental \nconcerns associated with these large operations. Again, let's keep in \nmind, as the Senator from Minnesota said, these are large CAFOs, \noperations larger than 1,000 animal units. That is 4,000 head of veal, \nor 5,400 head of swine, with an average weight of 185 pounds. So, \nagain, we are talking about pretty large operations.\n  I believe we need to help producers comply or avoid the need for \nregulations. I believe we should provide cost-share funds to these \nCAFOs to build structures that will contain waste to protect and \nimprove water quality, and to protect the quality of the environment.\n  However, as the Senator from Minnesota has said, EQIP was never \ndesigned to subsidize expansion of livestock operations.\n  The underlying bill allows for the use of cost-share funds for \nexisting and expanding CAFOs. This amendment, as I understand it, does \nnot prevent the use of funds for existing CAFOs but prohibits cost-\nshare funding for new or expanding CAFOs; that is, operations over \n1,000 animal units, but with several exceptions like for operations \nthat expand using innovative technologies.\n\n  So this amendment still allows cost-share funding for existing and \nsmaller facilities but does not subsidize growth of the very largest \nlivestock operations that are not yet in existence. Remember, it \ngrandfathers the ones that are\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nalready large. That is, the existing CAFOs are not limited or excluded.\n  I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying bill. It \nstill helps all livestock producers now in operation. But, as the \nSenator said, we should not be in the business of subsidizing for \nfurther expansion. I do support the amendment and hope that it is \nadopted.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is informed we are \nnot in a quorum call.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of the opposition's time.\n  Mr. President, I will not, in fact, oppose the Wellstone amendment \nbecause it appears to me to be consistent with the legislation that is \nbefore us with some modification with regard to expansion. But I want \nto take this time to try to indicate the logic for my views on this in \nview of an amendment I will be offering tomorrow that is obviously a \ngreat deal more restrictive than the Wellstone amendment today or, in \nfact, payment limitation amendments that will be offered by \ndistinguished colleagues.\n  Essentially, tomorrow, I am going to offer an amendment that would \ndisplace the entire commodities section of the bill and substitute for \nthat a system of payments to farmers in this country that has basic, \nfairly simple elements, unlike the present system in which 60 percent \nof farmers do not receive subsidies, which includes, in most cases, \nfarmers who are purely in the livestock business, as well as those who \nare involved in vegetables and fruits and various other agricultural \nproducts that do not have row crop situations.\n  In the current situation, 40 percent of farmers receive money, and in \nthat group about two-thirds of the money goes to 10 percent of the \nfarmers. As I have mentioned earlier today, using arithmetic, this \nreduces to 4 percent the number of farmers--principally, those in the \nfive row crops: cotton, rice, soybeans, corn, and wheat--receiving two-\nthirds of the money.\n  I want to end all of that and, as a matter of fact, now consider \nevery farm in America that has $20,000 of revenue. I select that figure \nbecause that at least denotes, in much agricultural literature, a farm \nthat is a serious farming effort as opposed to a hobby farm or someone \nwho is involved in incidental planting.\n\n  In America, there are about 800,000 farms that have $20,000 of \nincome--farm entities that would meet that criteria. In some of these \ncases, these farms have an owner and those who are doing the farming \nand they share the risk. So both of those would count for a farm entity \nprovided the amount of revenue coming into the farm meets my criteria.\n  Essentially, under my plan, each of these 800,000-plus farm entities \nin the country would receive $7,000 a year for the 4 years starting \nwith fiscal year 2003. That means 100 percent of farms--not 40 \npercent--would receive money. That would be the safety net, the \ncashflow, the money that we have often talked about as saving the small \nfamily farmer and keeping everybody alive.\n  But it also means farmers who are now receiving hundreds of thousands \nof dollars a year would, in fact, receive $7,000. We would finally come \nback to market economics in terms of what we plant. We would come back \nto a situation which is clearly competitive in the world trade \nsituation without danger of running into retaliation for trade \npractices which I believe the legislation in front of us now brings us \nto.\n  We would end the bubble effect of agricultural land being priced \nbeyond that which the young farmer has any hope of meeting.\n  We would meet the situation of 42 percent of farmers who rent as \nopposed to own and do not benefit from our farm program that escalates \nland values artificially.\n  In short, we turn around a bill which I believe has very unfortunate \nimplications for the future in agriculture to one of equity. And we do \nso for tens of billions of dollars less than the moneys that are now \ntalked about in this farm bill.\n  That, I believe, is important for each one of us who wants to reduce \ndeficits, who wants to take less money from the Social Security \naccount, who wants to at least make possible some type of forum in \nwhich we might talk about medical reform and other issues that are \nimportant to the American people.\n  For that reason, because I am going to present that kind of an idea, \nI do not plan to oppose the Wellstone amendment which in fact does have \nsome modest limitations in the livestock area. My amendment and others \nthat deal with payment limitation really pertain principally to the CCC \npayment, commodity payments. It would be inconsistent to support that \nkind of limitation and to find that it occurred, only to find that in \nanother part of agriculture people were able to proceed without \nrestraint and sometimes in ways which the Senator from Minnesota has \npointed out are environmentally destructive.\n  For these reasons, my own view is that the legislation that we now \nhave before us in this area is in fact reform and is important. And the \ndistinctions made by the Senator from Minnesota are there, but they are \nnot large. Therefore, I do not plan to oppose the legislation, but I \ndid want to explain why I took that point of view and at least the \nlogic of my own position in view of an amendment which will be before \nSenators tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the other side wants to yield back \ntime, I will.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana for his intellectual integrity. The \nargument he made, if I understood--and I do not want to at all \nmisconstrue his point--was that he will not oppose this amendment \nbecause that would be inconsistent with his very strong focus on \npayment limitation. I am thrilled because I very much want to pass this \namendment. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  If the other side wants to yield back its time, I will as well. We \ncan move forward.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no other Senator who wishes to \nspeak in opposition. And having called for such and not finding the \nsame, I am prepared to yield back. Let me ask, however, for just a \nmoment to make sure, as we check our cloakroom, that there is not \nsomeone who wants to speak and who will be precluded from doing so. For \nthat reason, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes of the opposition \ntime to the distinguished Senator from Iowa and 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota. I certainly \ncommend the Senator's role of reversing the trend towards larger farms \nand greater concentration in agriculture. I have been pleased to work \nwith Senator Wellstone to address a number of concerns related to \nconcentration and consolidation in the agricultural industry. Most \nrecently we worked together to secure passage of the bipartisan \namendment to address vertical integration by limiting packer control \nover livestock.\n  While the Senator from Minnesota and I share the goal of reversing \nthat, I am concerned that this amendment would fall short of that goal. \nIn short, Senator Wellstone's amendment would have the detrimental \neffect on many midsize family farmers who are struggling to comply with \nstringent new environmental regulations by slashing the amount of \nfunding available to make responsible environmental improvements in \nrural areas.\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\n  The reason I take some caution in addressing opposition to his \namendment is that I complimented the Senator from Minnesota, as we were \ndebating this bill in December, that he was going to offer this \namendment. But when I held meetings in my State of Iowa during the \nmonth of January--I held several town meetings just on the farm bill-- \nI had this concern from people who are strictly family farmers who came \nto my meetings. They were very concerned about the CAFO regulations \nthat they have to meet and the fact that if they have to meet those, \nthey may not be able to stay in livestock. They did find EQIP \nprovisions in the original farm bill to be helpful to meet those \nrequirements so they could stay in agriculture.\n\n  So I changed my mind, I need to tell the Senator from Minnesota. I \nsay it apologetically, in the sense that I had encouraged him in the \nfirst instance. I think these stringent, new regulations proposed by \nEPA are meant to get help from the provisions of this farm bill in \naddressing water pollution from livestock operations. According to \nEPA's own estimate, the new regulations could cost producers from \n$280,000 to $2.4 million over 10 years.\n  While the goals of the new regulations are certainly commendable, we \nobviously have to take the financial costs of the regulations into \nconsideration. I drew the conclusion, after my meetings in January, \nthat it was too much for many family farmers to absorb.\n  Recognizing the dire situation of these farmers, last year the Senate \nsupported the amendment I offered to the budget resolution to increase \nEQIP funding by $350 million in each of the next 10 years. This \nimportant funding will provide cost-sharing assistance to family \nfarmers to help them comply with the new CAFO regulations.\n  The Wellstone amendment would significantly reduce the level of EQIP \nfunding available to family farmers. According to EPA estimates, over \n1,000 livestock operations in Iowa would be ineligible for EQIP funds.\n  Mr. President, again, I am in opposition to the amendment offered by \nmy colleague, the Senator from Minnesota. Let me first say that I \ncertainly commend the Senator's goal of reversing the trend toward \nlarger farms and greater concentration in agriculture. I have been \npleased to work with Senator Wellstone to address a number of concerns \nrelated to concentration and consolidation in the agriculture industry. \nMost recently, we worked together to secure passage of a bipartisan \namendment to address vertical integration by limiting packer control \nover livestock.\n  While the Senator from Minnesota and I share the goal of reversing \nconcentration, I am concerned that this amendment falls far short of \nthat goal. In short, the Senator's amendment would have a detrimental \neffect on many of my state's mid-sized family farmers who are \nstruggling to comply with stringent new environmental regulations by \nslashing the amount of funding available to make responsible \nenvironmental improvements in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, the future prosperity of Iowa's family farmers, and \nfarmers across this nation, is currently threatened by stringent new \nregulations proposed by the EPA aimed at addressing water pollution \nfrom livestock operations. According to EPA's own estimates, the new \nregulations could cost producers from $280,000 to $2.4 million over the \nnext ten years.\n  While the goals of the new regulations are certainly commendable, the \nfinancial costs of these regulations will simply be too much for many \nfamily farmers to absorb.\n  Recognizing the dire situation of these farmers, last year the Senate \nsupported an amendment that I offered to the budget resolution to \nincrease EQIP funding by $350 million in each of the next ten years. \nThis important funding will provide cost-sharing assistance to family \nfarmers to help them comply with these new regulations.\n  The Wellstone amendment, however, would significantly reduce the \nlevel of EQIP funding available to family farmers. According to EPA \nestimates, over 1,000 livestock operations in Iowa would be ineligible \nfor EQIP funds. Another 500 to 1,000 could be ineligible if they expand \nin order to remain competitive or to comply with the new rules by \nbuilding new structures with new technologies.\n  The bottom line is that if these family farmers are denied EQIP \nassistance, the result will be poorer management systems and practices, \nand the environment will suffer.\n  The farm bill reported by the Agriculture Committee makes reasonable \nchanges to the rules of the EQIP program by limiting eligibility by a \nsimple and reasonable payment limit--not by the size of the operation. \nA payment limit puts livestock and poultry operations on an even \nfooting with the program limits for row-crops.\n  Without the technical and cost-sharing assistance provided by EQIP, \nmany family farmers in my state will be forced out of business--leaving \nonly the largest farms who can absorb the costs--and leading to even \ngreater concentration in the industry. In this farm bill, we have made \ngreat strides toward reducing the level of concentration and vertical \nintegration in agriculture. Unfortunately, this amendment would be a \nstep backwards.\n  Over 80 percent of Iowa's farms are individually or family-owned. \nIt's these producers I have always sought to help. These are the people \nwho produce our food and keep main streets in rural America in \nbusiness. These are the farmers who depend on the assistance from the \nEQIP program. It is for these farmers that I will oppose this amendment \nand support a strong EQIP.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I inquire, Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nthink what we really have to do, as in the case of other kinds of \nissues, is look at what it is we are seeking to do. If the purpose of \nthis EQIP program--which, by the way, is used thoroughly in my State \nwith a lot of good success--is to limit the environmental impact, or if \nit is to help with the technical information necessary for operators to \ndo something about the impact of the CAFO regulations or those kinds of \nthings--if you want to try to find a way to limit the size of farms and \nredistribute income, those are two different things.\n  The purpose here is to find the most efficient way we can to deal \nwith the most livestock out there putting the environment at risk, so \nwe can do something about it, and to then provide it to those people \nwho can have the most impact on doing something about the environment. \nThat is what it is all about. It is not about trying to keep farmers \nsmaller or having to do with size. There is a limitation under the law \non how much money can go to any operator during the period of the life \nof the farm bill, over the 6-year period. So I think we may want to, \nobviously, do something about payments, total payments. That is a \ndifferent question.\n  The question here is, how do you best utilize the resources in an \neffort to help farmers and ranchers deal with the question of \nenvironment and, more particularly, to deal with the regulations that \nhave been put in place for nonpoint source pollution, and the idea of \nhaving lots and corrals and feedlots along water supply sources. I \nthink it is very important that we look at it in a broader sense. If \nEQIP cost-sharing assistance is not made available to operations with a \nthousand animal units or more, EQIP would fail to meet the needs of the \nproducers managing more than half the livestock in the country.\n  If you are trying to do something about the pollution problems and \ngive help to people who are seeking to limit the livestock's \ninvolvement in pollution of water and nonpoint source waters, then I \nthink this kind of a limitation is not in keeping with that purpose and \nindeed hinders that purpose. Like my friend from Iowa, I joined with \nthe Senator from Minnesota on several amendments, and I certainly want \nto continue to do that. I just don't believe this amendment helps to \naccomplish the goals out there for the EQIP program. So I hope people \nwill vote against this amendment so we can move on to accomplishing \nenvironmental solutions.\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the farm bill before us recognizes the \nimportance of environmental conservation in agriculture and provides \nfunding for programs that support those measures. California livestock \noperations come in all sizes, but many of them are large operations \nrequiring substantial environmental management activities. Access to \nprograms that support environmental improvements is key to ensuring \nthat the best environmental practices are undertaken on these farms.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment, which would limit access to \nconservation funding based on factors like the size of the farm, falls \ndisproportionately hard on California farmers and would ultimately slow \ndown environmental improvements. Limitations on these payments will not \neliminate those farms, it will only limit support for conservation \nefforts that are so critically important in these operations. For those \nreasons, I must vote against the Wellstone amendment and support \nconservation funding for California farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, both my colleagues and good friends, \nthe Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Wyoming, break my heart. \nFirst of all, actually with this amendment, under current law, if you \nare over a thousand animal units, you don't get any EQIP money \nwhatsoever. Under my amendment, if you are over a thousand animal \nunits, you can get the money. We go from $10,000 to $30,000 a year. If \nyou are over a thousand units, you can get money. You can't right now.\n  We are saying that if you are under a thousand units and you want to \nexpand to over a thousand, or you are over and you want to expand even \nfurther and you want to get bigger and bigger, at that point the \nGovernment ought not to be subsidizing this expansion.\n  This is a reform amendment. This is consistent with those who are in \nsupport of payment limitations. This is ranked by the environmental \ncommunity as a key environmental amendment because it is crazy for the \nFederal Government to be subsidizing this environmental destruction.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, we are going to provide the money. \nRight now, under current law, if you are over a thousand animal units, \nyou can't get EQIP money. Under this amendment, you can. If you want to \nexpand it more and get bigger, at that point it is not appropriate for \nthe Government to provide the payments. That is exactly what the \nGrassley amendment is going to say when it comes to payment \nlimitations. It is exactly the same philosophy.\n  This is a reform amendment. It is an environmental amendment. It is \nan amendment that is for our independent producers. If you look in your \nState and at your producers, the vast majority of them are helped by \nthis amendment, as opposed to current law. The only thing this \namendment says is, if you want to get bigger and expand even more, at \nthat point, you are not going to get any more Government money. This is \na reform amendment. It deserves support.\n  I yield the floor, and if my colleagues want to yield back the \nremainder of their time, I will do so also.\n  Mr. LUGAR. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. We are prepared to yield back that \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided prior to the vote on the Harkin amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment closes a loophole in the \nPackers and Stockyards Act by including livestock production contracts \nunder its jurisdiction. It also provides livestock producers the \nability to discuss the terms of the contract with certain people, such \nas their attorney, banker, landlord, and government agency charged with \nprotecting a party to the contract. It does not say they have to but \nthey are so allowed.\n  Basically, since 1935, poultry producers have uncovered production \ncontracts under the Packers and Stockyard Act but other livestock were \nnot--for example, swine and cattle were not. But production contracts \nare becoming a bigger and bigger part of the establishment. Yet they \nare not covered under the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  The two largest farm organizations, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation and the National Farmers Unions, as well as dozens of other \nfarm groups, support this amendment. It does not create any regulatory \nburden.\n  As I said, we have had this provision under the Packers and \nStockyards Act since 1935. If we can help Dairy Queen franchisees and \ngasoline franchisees, and if the poultry people have lived under this \nsince 1935, I think it is time we give the cattle producers and the \npork producers in this country the same kind of protections under the \nPackers and Stockyards Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I oppose the Harkin amendment on the basis \nthat it is likely to confuse interpretation of the contract issue. It \nis a narrow issue we are discussing. The amendment offered by the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee is a narrow issue. On balance, \nit appears to me to be unnecessary and redundant.\n  It is opposed by a host of livestock and poultry organizations for \nthose reasons. I cited a letter from many of them with regard to a \nnumber of competitive issues that are in the bill, and this one in \nparticular.\n  For these reasons, I suggest a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Members, this will be the last vote \nof the day. We have an agreement tentatively worked out that is being \ncleared by both sides that there will be debate on an amendment offered \nby Senator Durbin tonight. There will be a second-degree amendment \noffered by Senator Gramm of Texas on that amendment tonight or in the \nmorning. I think Members can expect a rollcall vote around 10 or 10:30 \nin the morning,\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nafter which there will be two amendments that will take approximately 4 \nhours. There will be a vote after each one of those. So we have until 3 \nor so tomorrow afternoon already tentatively worked out on this bill.\n  We also are going to try to work out a finite list of amendments. The \nminority and majority staffs are now working to whittle that down. It \nis down now, even as we speak, to a fairly small number of amendments. \nSo hopefully there is some end in sight for this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 2604, as modified. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin \nbe recognized now to offer a Durbin-Lugar amendment, as modified, \nregarding cropping history and nutrition, with 60 minutes for debate in \nrelation to the amendment this evening, equally divided in the usual \nform, with no amendments in order prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment; further, that when the Senate resumes consideration of the \nfarm bill at 10 a.m., on Thursday, there be 5 minutes for closing \ndebate in relation to the Durbin-Lugar amendment, followed by a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; further, that following the vote, regardless \nof the outcome, Senator Dorgan, for himself and Senator Grassley, be \nrecognized to offer an amendment regarding payment limitation; that \nthere be 105 minutes for debate in relation to this amendment, equally \ndivided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote; \nfurther, that following the vote, regardless of the outcome, Senator \nLugar be recognized to offer an amendment regarding payment mechanism, \nthat there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided in the usual form, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to a vote on the Lugar \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Record should be clear that on the Lugar \namendment, the unanimous consent agreement should read: ``On or in \nrelation to the Lugar amendment,'' rather than ``on the Lugar \namendment.'' I ask unanimous consent for that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I advise all Members, we are trying to work on a finite \nlist of amendments. We are whittling ours down significantly. The staff \nis going to exchange those shortly. Maybe tonight we can enter into an \nagreement as to a finite list of amendments on both sides.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his unanimous consent request he \npropounded. I do not believe I am going to use the 30 minutes allotted \nto me, but I would like to have the opportunity to yield, during the \ncourse of that time, to the Senator from Michigan, who has asked for a \nbrief period of time to speak.\n  If there is no objection, I would like to have that included in the \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. It is certainly appropriate. The Senator has been waiting \nall afternoon to make this statement. She can do so whenever it is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, it is my understanding that \nSenators Durbin and Lugar have worked out their modification on this \namendment.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Responding to the Senator from Nevada, Senator Gramm is \nworking on language which is coming during the course of this debate. I \nhave agreed to accept his second-degree amendment, and I will speak to \nit during the course of my remarks.\n  Mr. REID. If, for some reason, you cannot work this out, we would \nhave to come back later and revisit this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I respond briefly to the leader's \ncomment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding, as Senator Durbin has represented it, is \nthat Senator Gramm has offered language that has been accepted. The \nlanguage is being written even as we speak. The presumption is that it \nwill be acceptable. In the event, for some reason, it should not be, \nthen, at that point--I suppose tomorrow morning--we would have to deal \nwith a second-degree amendment. But, obviously, we hope we have dealt \nwith it this evening. And I believe we have.\n  On a second point, I understand staff will be working--even as we \ndebate this amendment--on the overall list. There has not been \nagreement, as I understand it, but, nevertheless, constructive work has \noccurred in defining the issues that still remain.\n  Mr. REID. I am confident that Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator \nDurbin will work this out. They have already agreed. You always have to \nbe careful when people start putting things in writing; there could be \na problem.\n  I say to the distinguished manager of the bill, the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, in his usual, deliberate manner, with the background of \nbeing a Rhodes scholar, he has explained it better than I did.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Indiana yield?\n  Since I have not seen the language from Senator Gramm, and I want to \nhave a chance to reflect on it this evening, could we leave open the \npossibility, if there is any disagreement--I want to make it clear on \nthe floor, I will protect Senator Gramm's right to offer and debate the \nsecond-degree amendment without any objection-- then I would have a \nchance, after his second-degree amendment has been considered, to offer \nmy amendment.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is our understanding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Any disagreement would have to be reflected on the \ncontents.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2821\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Graham, Mr. Wellstone, \n     Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2821.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who are cosponsoring \nthis amendment, Senators Harkin and Lugar, who come to this floor in \ntheir capacities as chair and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, both of whom have joined me in cosponsorship of this \namendment, together with several of my other colleagues.\n  What we are trying to do in this amendment is twofold. In the first \ninstance, we are trying to avoid overproduction on farmland in America \nthat would be encouraged by the farm bill--not by the market, not by \nany other consideration. We don't want to create a farm bill which \npushes farmers into overproduction, bringing prices down. What we are \ntrying to do is to increase production but only in a way that is at a \nprice level, a cost level so that a farmer can make a fair living. And \nso we are trying with this amendment to protect from that possibility.\n  The second part of the amendment sounds so totally unrelated, people \nmay wonder why it is in the farm bill. The second part relates to the \nFood Stamp Program. If my colleagues are aware of the Department of \nAgriculture, they know that it administers the Food Stamp Program. A \ndecision was made some years ago--I will address it in my remarks--that \nthose who are legal immigrants to the United States would not qualify \nfor food stamps. On reflection, we have seen that the victims of that \npolicy have primarily been poor children in America. I am heartened by \nthe fact that President Bush, in his budget message, has decided to \nchange this policy. He has said that we will allow legal immigrants to \nreceive food stamps. That is the right and humane thing to do. It is \nthe right thing to do to make certain children are healthy. If we are \ngoing to have a strong Nation, we need healthy kids. So the second part \nof my amendment addresses the restoration of eligibility for food \nstamps for legal immigrants.\n  Senator Gramm of Texas has his own opinion as to what we should \ninclude in the food stamp portion of the amendment. He is preparing \nthat now. We have discussed it briefly. I will repeat what I said \nearlier: If the second-degree amendment that he has proposed ends up \nbeing something I cannot personally accept, I promise that I will \nprotect his right to offer and debate that amendment and bring it to a \nvote before there is a vote on my amendment. So there will be no \ndisadvantage to Senator Gramm, even if there is some disagreement in \nterms of the content of his amendment.\n  Let me speak briefly to what my overall amendment does. This \namendment has one basic purpose, and that is to provide a safety net \nfor farmers\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nwithout distorting the marketplace. Everybody in this debate on the \nfarm bill wants to protect farmers. I hope we can agree that we don't \nwant to do it at the expense of the supply and demand laws which govern \nour economy.\n  This amendment will help to meet both goals. It simply states: Crop \nsupport payments will not be made for crops that are grown on land that \nis not already being used for agricultural production. It only applies \nto land that has not been cropped even 1 year in the past 5 years or 3 \nyears in the past 10. So if I am a farmer in downstate Illinois and I \nhave acreage that has not been used for agricultural production, even 1 \nyear out of the last 5 or 3 out of the last 10, I cannot bring that \ninto the program and say: Now that you have a farm bill that may \ncompensate me, I am going to produce on this land and I am going to get \npayments from the Federal Government.\n  That land was taken out of production for market reasons or other \nreasons. And we believe that no farm bill should drag it back into \nproduction.\n  If I am a farmer, though, and want to produce on the land, that is my \nright; I own the land. But I can't go to the Federal Government, having \nmade that decision, if I haven't put a crop on that land for 1 out of 5 \nyears, 3 out of 10 to support this effort.\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Stabenow are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. My goal is to make certain that farmers make decisions \nbased on the marketplace, not based on the farm bill, particularly when \nit comes to that land that has not been in production. That is what \nthis amendment seeks to achieve.\n  It is in no way a restriction on a farmer's freedom. A farmer is \nstill free to plant any new ground he wishes. What we are talking about \nis eligibility for Federal payments. The amendment uses an extremely \nbroad definition of agricultural commodity. Farmers can switch crops on \nland and, despite that switching of crops, not lose eligibility under \nthis amendment. That is only fair because in many good farming \npractices, that is done on a regular basis. It allows long-term crop \nrotation, permits an exception for that. There are some lands primarily \nused for hay but that may be cropped 1 or 2 years between hay \nplantings. This amendment would not deny support payments to the crops \nduring that period. However, it is intended to be a narrow amendment, \nonly for those who can demonstrate that they have both established and \nare maintaining such long-term rotation.\n  The amendment does not interfere with the CRP program in any way. The \nConservation Reserve Program is an important program. It conserves \nAmerica's natural resources. This amendment simply provides that when \nfarmers decide to plant on new ground, they will do it because of the \nmarket, not because of Government subsidy.\n  Prior to the 1996 farm bill, the farm policy of our country \nrecognized that our support programs could drive up supply. So for \ndecades, farm policy attempted to limit subsidies in one form or \nanother.\n  This was done through various definitions of base acres. I remember \nas a Member of Congress for many years in the House, and now in the \nSenate, dealing with farmers who were trying to establish their base \nacreage and qualifications eligibility for Government payment. In 1996, \nCongress did away with all these rules on the theory that it was going \nto phase out support payments.\n  We now know that, at least today, we can't phase out support payments \nwithout jeopardizing our farms. However, we need to be careful that we \ndon't inadvertently encourage farming of new land when market \nconditions don't warrant it.\n  In essence, under prior farm policy, support payments had a foot on \nthe pedal driving new production, but also with a foot on the brake. \nNew policy, as currently envisioned, fails to add in the brake. That is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  This amendment will not reinstate it completely, but it will ease up \non the pedal. The farmers can still drive themselves into new cropland, \nbut the Government would no longer drive them there.\n  What is the environmental impact of this amendment? The facts show \nthat this amendment is needed. According to the USDA, the United States \nlost 22 million acres of grassland between 1982 and 1997. The vast \nmajority of that became new croplands.\n  This occurred even while the Federal Government was laying out \nroughly $30 billion over the same period to take more than 30 million \nacres of cropland from production through the Conservation Reserve \nProgram, the twofold purpose of which was to increase conservation \nefforts and limit supplies so as to boost prices.\n  What this means is that while our Government was trying to limit \nsupplies in order to boost prices on the one hand, it was effectively \nencouraging farmers to convert new land into cropland on the other. \nThis has undoubtedly contributed to the current situation in which \nfarmers have faced record low prices in recent years.\n  This loss of grassland as an environmental impact throughout the \ncountry contributed to the decline of many bird species that nest in \ngrasslands. Grassland birds as a whole are the most threatened category \nof birds in our country. This amendment makes environmental sense as \nwell as economic sense.\n  This amendment has the added benefit of saving money. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the Durbin amendment would \nreduce crop overproduction which will result in $1.4 billion in savings \nover the next 10 years.\n  Let me tell you that the second half of the amendment takes the \nsavings and uses it for the Food Stamp Program. The savings generated \nby this bill will further strengthen the nutrition title of this same \nfarm bill. This is really a farm and nutrition bill. I think addressing \nthe Food Stamp Program along with the farm program is appropriate \nbecause both are under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Food stamps are a part of our Nation's first line of defense in \nAmerica to protect families in a recession. Now, as we reauthorize the \nFood Stamp Program, we should make sure to effectively put into place \nprotections against economic downturns.\n  This farm bill passed by the Agriculture Committee makes some \nimportant changes in the Food Stamp program. I join in thanking the \ncommittee's ranking Republican for the hard work he has put into this \nsection of the bill.\n  Here is what my amendment does. It restores eligibility for the Food \nStamp Program to legal immigrants who have lived in the United States \nfor 5 years or longer. I will repeat, it restores eligibility for legal \nimmigrants living in the United States for 5 years or longer.\n\n  This amendment will be an addition to the immigrant restoration \nprovisions already in the farm bill, including the immediate \nrestoration of eligibility to all poor children. I salute Senators \nLugar and Harkin for that provision. I will not go into a long story \nabout how important immigrants have been to the United States. Suffice \nit to say that my mother was an immigrant to this country. I am proud \nof that fact, and I am happy to be a first-generation American and to \nhave this chance to serve as a Senator from the State of Illinois. I \nkeep in my office, very near my desk, the framed copy of my mother's \nnaturalization certificate. I am very proud of it. I look at it every \nday as a reminder of my family and a reminder of from where I came. I \nthink it is a reminder to all of America how many of us are close to \nnew immigrants in this country.\n  At the turn of the century, many of our relatives arrived from all \nover the world. They were poor and didn't speak the language, and they \ncame looking for a better life. At that time, survival meant sending \nall members of the family to work. Young children worked in factories \nand sweatshops instead of going to school.\n  Eventually, we realized that families should not have to send their \n7-year-old to work just to be able to put food on the table. Jane \nAddams of Illinois, quite a well-known figure in Chicago with her \nsettlement houses, was one of the great American social reformers. She \ninspired us to lobby for child labor laws because of her experiences \nwith the working men, women, and children in the immigrant \nneighborhoods of the city of Chicago.\n  Those arriving in the United States today are no different than our \ngreat\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\ngrandparents. And we continue to rely on immigrants to fill jobs at all \nlevels of the workforce.\n  Legal immigrants here not only work, they pay taxes. The National \nAcademy of Sciences and the National Research Council conducted studies \nthat show that, overall, immigrants pay more in taxes than they use in \ngovernment benefits.\n  Allow me to digress and tell you that a little over 2 weeks ago I was \nat an air base near Kabul in Afghanistan. I ran into a soldier from \nIllinois. He told me of his high school in the suburbs of the city of \nChicago, and he said: When I get through with my Army experience here, \ncan I come to your office and will you help me to apply to become a \ncitizen? He is a member of the U.S. Army, a soldier risking his life \nfighting terrorism in Afghanistan, but he is from Panama. He is legal \nhere, and he volunteered to serve this Nation, but he is not a citizen. \nI said of course I would help him. He is a legal immigrant to America \nwho would be denied, under many circumstances, food stamps. Yet he has \nvolunteered and is serving our Nation in uniform. How do you make any \nsense out of that kind of policy? This amendment tries to do that. It \nsays immigrant families with children, who tend to have lower income \nlevels than native-born families with children, need a helping hand \nwith food stamps.\n  Most low-income children of immigrants live in working families with \ntwo parents who are married. The vast majority of legal immigrants are \nnot permitted to receive food stamp benefits.\n  In 1996, as a result of changes in the law, the Physicians for Human \nRights interviewed 700 legal immigrant families and found that adults \nin one out of three households had skipped meals in the previous 6 \nmonths. One in ten recalled missing a meal, not being able to eat for \nat least a whole day. One in four reported cutting the size of a \nchild's meals due to inadequate resources.\n\n  The Urban Institute reports that, nationwide, 37 percent of all \nchildren of immigrants live in families that worry about providing food \nfor the table. In California, Illinois, and Texas, legal immigrants' \nfood insecurity rates were seven times worse than the general \npopulation in our country.\n  These harsh eligibility rules today translate into future citizens \nnot getting the benefits for which they are eligible. The vast majority \nof immigrant families are mixed-status families that include at least \none U.S. citizen. That citizen is typically a child. When legal \nimmigrant parents are not aware that their children are eligible for \nfood stamps, the kids don't get enough to eat.\n  Participation in the Food Stamp Program among children with legal \npermanent resident parents dropped 40 percent from 1994 to 1999, \nwithout a corresponding decrease in need.\n  Can America be a better place if these children who are legally in \nthe United States don't receive the proper nutrition? If they suffer \ndisease and illness, if they are not prepared to learn, and if they \ncome to a classroom and can't stay awake and are listless because of \nnot having enough to eat, how can we be a better Nation?\n  Since 1996, many States have worked to pick up the slack. Seventeen \nStates, including mine, provide State-funded food stamps to some or all \nlegal immigrants who are ineligible for the Food Stamp Program--because \nof the changes in the law. In most of the States, eligibility is \nlimited to very narrow categories of immigrants.\n  On Monday, President Bush released his fiscal year 2003 budget \nproposal. I am certain there will be many items I will disagree with in \nthat proposal. But I congratulate him for including a restoration of \nbenefits for legal immigrants identical to that in my amendment.\n  When this provision was first made public in January, a senior \nadministration official was quoted as saying:\n\n       We believe this will go a long way to meeting the needs of \n     children and adults who need additional benefits. It will \n     allow them to have access to nutritious food and will improve \n     their well-being.\n\n  Applause to the President and to the White House. Congratulations for \na good idea, a bipartisan idea.\n  The author of this idea of limiting food stamps to legal immigrants \nwas the former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, who was also the \nauthor of the Contract with America. He said this in the New York Times \nlast month about that decision in 1996:\n\n       In a law that reduced welfare by more than 50 percent, this \n     is one of the provisions that went too far. In retrospect, it \n     was wrong.\n\n  Even Speaker Gingrich can have this epiphany and realize that a \nmistake was made. I acknowledge and congratulate him for publicly \nsaying this and saying why this amendment is so important.\n  What we have learned from the 1996 cuts is that making food stamp \nbenefits available to legal immigrants doesn't open the floodgates at \nour borders. The average food stamp benefit is $74 a person monthly--\nnot exactly a fortune. It is difficult to imagine families flocking to \nthe United States because they could be eligible for food stamps if \nthey just wait legally for 5 years.\n  Food stamps do not bring families to the United States who would not \notherwise come here. It is a vital support for low-income families.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan opportunity to support farmers \nthroughout America with a sensible limitation so there will not be \noverproduction, and to take the savings from that limitation to provide \nfood for needy children of legal immigrant families.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. It is one that does the right thing. \nI am pleased my colleagues, Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin, and \nPresident Bush have joined in supporting this concept. I hope all my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Senator from Illinois if he has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of the \nDurbin amendment which makes legal immigrants who have lived in this \ncountry 5 years eligible for food stamps.\n  My colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, has been a strong advocate \nas well, and a number of Senators voted for Senator Lugar's amendments \nwhich work to improve the nutrition programs.\n  First a disclaimer. On this whole question of illegal immigrants, we \nare all products of our personal experience. I remember during the \ndebate on the welfare bill in 1996, one of the things I said was that \nto vote for the bill would be to me like cutting off my hand because I \nam a son of immigrants. I am first-generation American. My father fled \npersecution from Ukraine and Russia.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned the former Speaker saying we went \ntoo far, and I felt that way. I had a number of objections; I never \nunderstood what we were doing. I thought it was too harsh, too \npunitive.\n  Then in 1998, Congress restored some of the benefits to categories of \nimmigrants. It was children, elderly, and disabled, but only if they \nwere here prior to 1996.\n  The Food Stamp Program is a critical safety net program and, by the \nway, an astounding success. This is a program that has made a huge \ndifference.\n  One of the problems is, even if the children are eligible and the \nparent or parents are not eligible, it does not work. Quite frankly, it \ndoes not work. One of the reasons we have seen this huge decline, which \nshould concern us--since the bill passed, there has been maybe a 25- to \n35-percent decline in food stamp participation--is because of these \ncuts. Even when the children are supposed to be helped, if the parents \nare not eligible, they do not know about it, they do not know where to \ngo, and they are not able to help their kids.\n\n  This amendment is about helping a lot of people. Altogether, 360,000 \nlegal immigrants would be helped--men, women, some elderly, some middle \naged, some children. It is the right thing to do. It corrects a huge \ninjustice.\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\n  I also give credit to the White House for taking a strong lead on \nthis. I give credit to my colleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator Lugar, \nand I know Senator Harkin supports this effort. There is bipartisan, \nstrong support.\n  I wish to say one other thing which is a little bit different, and it \nis not inconsistent with what I just said but is interesting to me. \nThis is a social justice amendment. I thank Senator Durbin for it. It \nis the right thing to do. It is extremely important to get this \nassistance to families who need this assistance.\n  The other thing that has happened, as opposed to 1996--and I think of \nMinnesota--is in a way we have new politics in Minnesota and new \npolitics in the country. The immigrant populations--my mother, father, \nand grandparents did this as well--are finding a voice. They are \nbecoming active in their communities. They are becoming their own \nleaders. They are speaking for themselves. They are becoming a \npolitical force, and there is much more recognition of who they are, \nwhat their needs are, and how we can support them.\n  There are so many activities going on in the country right now that \nare so important and positive for these immigrant communities.\n  Unfortunately, in my opinion, these cuts were not the only harsh \nfeature of the welfare bill, but this was one of them. This amendment \nimproves on the Agriculture Committee's work. That work in the \ncommittee vastly improved on the mistakes we made in 1996. This is a \nhugely important amendment, and I am very proud to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, although I will speak in favor of the \nDurbin amendment, I note there are no Senators present who are prepared \nto speak in opposition to it. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe able to yield myself 30 minutes from the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield myself as much time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the advocacy of Senator Durbin \nin bringing forward this amendment. I believe he has rescued a \nsituation that has been well described by my colleague, Senator \nWellstone, a valued member of the Agriculture Committee, and Senator \nHarkin, our chairman.\n  We worked together to try to provide a much stronger safety net for \nnutrition in this country. As it turned out, in some of our \ndeliberations--and the distinguished Presiding Officer was there for \nthose--there were many Senators who during that period of time \nquestioned when we were going to get to the commodity section and what \nmoney would be left at the end of the trail as we dealt with very vital \nissues of community development, research, loans for young farmers--\nmany issues that have been resolved in a very strong bipartisan \nfashion.\n  As a result, the amendments I offered at that time were a bridge too \nfar. I have been rescued by Senator Durbin and by the President of the \nUnited States in a bipartisan way because as it now turns out, it may \nbe possible through this amendment to find resources that, in fact, \nrestore us to a situation we might have attained during our \ndeliberations.\n  Let me follow through on many of the arguments the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois has made. Simply, the amendment generally \nprohibits taxpayer-provided crop insurance and farm program benefits on \nacreage which has not been cropped at least once in the last 5 years or \n3 of the last 10 years from the time of the enactment of the farm bill.\n  Exceptions to this general prohibition are made for acreage idle in \nthe Conservation Reserve Program. That has been a major objective of \nthe committee and the Senate and for long-term crop rotations as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The amendment does not change the structure of farm commodity \nprograms as they have been designed in the underlying bill.\n  The bill would still have higher marketing loan rates, a new \ncommodity-specific countercyclical payment program for major crops, and \nall the other commodity provisions we previously discussed.\n  As I mentioned earlier in the debate this afternoon, I will be \noffering an amendment tomorrow that will radically change the whole \ncommodity payment system, but this amendment does not. It is benign \nwith regard to everything that has preceded and should be debated on \nits own merits.\n  In this respect, the Durbin amendment offers much less commodity \ntitle reform than I would like, and I admitted as much as a preview of \nwhat may be coming. Nevertheless, it makes an attempt to lessen the \noverproduction problem that will surely only worsen if we approve the \nunderlying farm bill without change.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has scored the Durbin amendment as \nsaving $1.4 billion over 10 years in the commodity title of the \nunderlying farm bill, and that is not an immodest saving. I appreciate \nand support my colleague's proposal to improve the Food Stamp Program \nwith the savings, and his allocation of that, it seems to me, is highly \nmerited.\n  With the amendment, the Senate farm bill will now incorporate \nproposals I made originally and President Bush's budget proposal. It \ndoes both. The President and I are grateful to have found this \npartnership with Senator Durbin and with our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Harkin, as Senator Durbin mentioned. These new rules restore \nthe extension of regular food stamp eligibility criteria to legal \nimmigrants, and Senator Durbin has stressed that, as I do.\n  A question has been raised in previous debates on food stamp \neligibility, and let me be unambiguous. We are talking about legal \nimmigrants who meet either a 5-year U.S. residency or 4-year work \nrequirement. Those are fairly strong thresholds. Combining these with \nSenator Harkin's proposal to extend eligibility to all immigrant \nchildren will improve the Food Stamp Program's capacity to serve the \nvulnerable, but we do not offer a free ride. The criteria I have \nillustrated again, as Senator Durbin has, are substantial.\n  Currently, most legal aliens are ineligible for food stamp benefits \neven if they meet that program's strict asset and income criteria. An \nestimated 500,000 legal immigrants who meet the financial rules remain \ncategorically ineligible under current law. In addition, these rules \nhave had the unintended effect on citizen children living in immigrant \nfamilies. Because of confusion, fear, or a combination of these \nfactors, there has been a 70-percent decline in food stamp \nparticipation among this group of children. That is an awesome change \nas to children who clearly were eligible.\n  Although immigrant restrictions apply to participation in other \nFederal assistance programs, the Food Stamp Program has particularly \nstrict rules. For example, in Medicaid and cash assistance, also known \nas TANF, legal immigrants in the United States before August 22, 1996, \nare eligible, at State option, under the same rules that apply to all \nothers.\n  In contrast, most adult legal immigrants here before that date are \ncategorically ineligible for food stamps until they meet the 10-year \nwork requirement. Further, children who emigrated after 1996 remain \nineligible until their parents meet the work requirements or become \ncitizens.\n  Considering the fact many legal immigrants work in low-paying service \njobs, they are among the first affected during economic downturns such \nas the one we are now enduring. The current immigrant work requirement \nthus penalizes those who have little or no control over their \nemployment situation. The food stamp immigrant provisions that would \nresult from the Durbin amendment do not open the door to those who come \nto the United States looking for a handout. Rather, they help children \nwho are unable to support themselves, individuals who came to escape \npersecution in their native countries, and adults who have a documented \nwork history or support from their U.S. sponsors.\n  There is genuine need among this population. Studies of both local \nand national scope indicate serious food insecurity and hunger occur. \nFor example, the Physicians for Human Rights reported that among 700 \nimmigrant families, adults in one-third of them skip meals; one-fourth \ncut meal size\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\ndue to inadequate resources; one-tenth reported not eating for an \nentire day at least once in the last 6 months.\n  States are vocal about the problems created by current eligibility \nrestrictions for immigrants. Sixteen of them provide food stamp \nreplacement benefits with their own funds. Many others, according to \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, have appropriated \nadditional resources for food banks and a variety of charitable \nprograms serving the immigrant population.\n  The Food Stamp Program is the foundation of our country's nutrition \nsafety net for vulnerable people. Until 1996, eligibility was based \nonly on a family's financial need. Many, including President Bush, now \nvoice the opinion that the food stamp immigrant policies legislated at \nthat time were too harsh. I congratulate the President for his advocacy \nand the publicity that has surrounded that. It was a high-profile \nadvocacy.\n  I ask that each of us in the Senate endorse the Bush administration's \nfood stamp policy by voting for Senator Durbin's amendment, which the \nSenator has pointed out encompasses exactly the same goals. It is our \nopportunity, in a bipartisan way, hopefully in a unanimous way, to \nimprove the capacity of the Food Stamp Program to operate as a genuine \nnutrition safety net for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S423-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise to invite Members and staff to \njoin me and my staff as we celebrate and thank this evening, in the \nMansfield Room, Jean Marie Neal, who has been my chief of staff for the \nlast year, my first year in the Senate. While I understand the rules of \nthe Senate do not allow me to acknowledge her presence in the gallery, \nI do want to indicate that I believe it is important to recognize the \nservice of this wonderful woman who has spent 21 years in the service \nof the Congress, the majority of that in the Senate, working for \nSenator Dick Bryan.\n  It is important to note that when we have someone who is dedicated to \nthe Senate, to helping us achieve our goals, to be able to put forward \nthose matters that allow us to represent our constituents and make our \nStates and our country better places, that when that person decides to \nretire from their position and move on to other challenges, it is \nimportant that we recognize them and say thank you. That is what I want \nto make sure we are doing officially this evening in the Record of the \nSenate.\n  We have enjoyed in the last year the wonderful leadership of Jean \nMarie Neal in my office. As you know, I came from the House of \nRepresentatives and, while bringing some outstanding people with me, we \nhad to put together a team of staff. It was under Jean Marie's \nleadership that we were able to find outstanding people who had been in \nservice both in the Senate as well as in other places and who have come \nnow to be a part of my office and my team.\n  As we come into our second year, we are building on a foundation and \na gift that she gave me of putting together a wonderful team that is \ncommitted and intelligent and loyal and hard working. We in our office \nare going to miss her greatly, and we are very grateful for all of her \nhard work.\n  I know her previous employers, Senator Bryan and Congressman John \nSpratt, and all of those who have come in contact and have benefited \nfrom Jean Marie's intelligence and hard work and loyalty and ability to \nsee and create a vision in terms of the office, as well as issues and \nadvocacy for our States, are really happy for her.\n  Again, I invite anyone who is within earshot to come by until 7 \no'clock this evening and join us to have an opportunity to celebrate \nJean Marie's service to the Senate and to thank her for that and to \nwish her well as she moves on to, I am sure, many more successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S423-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA'S UNINSURED\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I come to the floor once again \nto talk about the uninsured in America. I think it is important that, \nas we sink our teeth into this year's budget, we remember the men, \nwomen, and children who live, work, and go to school every day without \nhealth insurance, knowing that any illness could threaten their \nlivelihood and even their lives.\n  I have spent a great deal of time in recent months learning about the \nuninsured--who they are, why they have no health coverage, the effects \non individuals and their families, and what can be done to resolve this \ncrisis.\n  This year, the president's budget contains $89 billion to help the \nuninsured. This is no small number, to be sure, and it demonstrates the \npresident's commitment to providing health coverage for all Americans; \nhowever, this proposal is only projected to provide coverage for up to \nsix million of the forty million uninsured--leaving thirty-four million \nmen, women, and children without health insurance. Therefore, I see the \npresident's proposal as a starting point from which to make insurance \nboth more accessible and more affordable for all working families.\n  Yesterday I pressed Office of Management and Budget Director Daniels \nto explain how the uninsured would fare under the president's new \nbudget proposal. I also met with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices Administrator Tom Scully to urge him to assist in improving \nupon President Bush's proposal to provide health coverage to more low-\nincome Americans.\n  In my visits to community health centers across Oregon, it has become \nclear to me that the uninsured--working mothers, fathers, children, \nsingle adults, students--are not interested in budget battles that may \nprevent action on this important matter. What Americans need is access \nto high quality, affordable health insurance. There are a lot of good \nideas out there to help the uninsured, but no single proposal is going \nto help or please everybody. We need to take the best these plans have \nto offer and come up with a comprehensive solution as soon as possible.\n  There has never been a better, or more important, time to act with \nrespect to the uninsured. I understand the demands on our treasury are \ngreat as we fight the war on terrorism both at home and abroad; \nhowever, the demands on our health care system are also increasing. \nWith a recession and rapidly rising health care costs, more and more \nAmericans will find themselves without health insurance. This is no \ntime to ignore them. I look forward to working with my colleagues and \nthe Administration to find a way to make room for as many of them as we \ncan in this year's budget, as we work toward a day when every American \nhas access to high quality health care coverage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S423-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S423-S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I submit for the Record an article that \nran in The Washington Post yesterday about the discrimination that \nindividuals with a history of mental illness face in our current health \ninsurance market. The story documents the dilemma of Michelle Witte who \nwas denied health insurance coverage because she was successfully \ntreated for depression during her adolescence. In fact, more than 50 \nmillion Americans each year suffer from mental illness. About 19 \npercent of the Nation's adults and 21 percent of the youths aged 9 to \n17 have a mental disorder at some time during a one-year period.\n  Last Congress I introduced legislation to address the barriers faced \nby Michelle Witte and thousands like her who have been treated for a \nmental condition. I plan to reintroduce this legislation this spring, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act limits the ability of health \nplans\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nto redline individuals with a preexisting mental health condition. I \nundertook this initiative when I learned that some of my constituents \nwere being turned away from health plans in the private non-group \nmarket due solely to a past history of treatment for mental conditions. \nUnfortunately, under the current system of care in the United States, \nindividuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of treatment \nfor mental illness may find it difficult to obtain private health \ninsurance, especially if they must purchase it on their own and do not \nhave an employer-sponsored group plan available to them. In part this \nis because while the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, HIPAA, protects millions of Americans in the group health \ninsurance market, it affords few protections for individuals who apply \nfor private non-group insurance. While the majority of Americans under \nage 65 have employer-sponsored group coverage, a significant minority, \napproximately 12.6 million individuals, rely on private, individual \nhealth insurance.\n  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act closes this loophole by \nlimiting any preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental \nhealth condition to not more than 12 months and reducing this exclusion \nperiod by the total amount of previous continuous coverage. It \nprohibits any health insurer that offers health coverage in the \nindividual insurance market from imposing a preexisting condition \nexclusion relating to a mental health condition unless a diagnosis, \nmedical advice or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 \nmonths prior to the enrollment date. And it prohibits health plans in \nthe individual market from charging higher premiums to individuals \nbased solely on the determination that the individual has had a \npreexisting mental health condition. These provisions apply to all \nhealth plans in the individual market, regardless of whether a state \nhas enacted an alternative mechanism, such as a risk pool, to cover \nindividuals with preexisting health conditions.\n  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act complements ongoing efforts to \nenhance parity between mental health services and other health \nbenefits. This is because parity alone will not help individuals who do \nnot have access to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting \nmental illness discrimination. The Patients' Rights Act does not \nmandate that insurers provide mental health services if they are not \nalready offering such coverage. It simply prohibits plans in the \nprivate non-group market from redlining individuals who apply for \ngeneral health insurance based solely on a past history of treatment \nfor a mental condition.\n  I have also asked the General Accounting Office to examine the types \nof mental health conditions for which individual health insurers \ntypically underwrite; the degree to which there is an actuarial basis \nfor these carrier practices; the prevalence of medical underwriting for \nmental health conditions that results in denying coverage or raising \npremiums; and the extent of state laws that prevent or constrain \ninsurers from denying coverage or raising premiums due to a history of \nmental health conditions, including consumer protections such as \nappeals procedures and access to information. This report is due out \nnext month.\n  It simply does not make sense that a person is rendered uninsurable \nfor all health needs simply because he or she seeks treatment for \nmental illness. I invite my colleagues to enlist in this important \ninitiative to ensure that such individuals are not discriminated \nagainst when applying for health insurance coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2002]\n\n               Second Opinion: The Perils of Doing Right\n\n                         (By Abigail Trafford)\n\n       Michelle Witte did everything right. She graduated from the \n     University of Maryland last June with a degree in English. \n     She got a job she loves with a Washington communications firm \n     that is too small to qualify for a group health plan. But her \n     employer will pay for an an individual policy, so she applied \n     to CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. In answer to questions on \n     the form, she stated that she has chronic asthma and had been \n     prescribed antidepressant medication for a short period when \n     she was in high school.\n       The health plan rejected her.\n       ``Upon review of the Individual Health Evaluation \n     Questionnaire, you have documented that you have been or are \n     currently being treated for depressive disorder,'' stated the \n     letter from the health plan. ``Based upon our medical \n     underwriting criteria, we are unable to approve this coverage \n     for you.''\n       ``I just think it's shocking,'' said Witte, 23. CareFirst \n     has refused to comment on the case. But in its official reply \n     to her application, the plan expressed no concern over her \n     ongoing problem of asthma. It was one episode of successfully \n     treated depression in adolescence that turned Witte into a \n     health plan pariah. ``It didn't occur to me that it could be \n     such a liability,'' she said.\n       This is how discrimination works against people with mental \n     diseases. For all the rhetoric about removing the stigma of \n     mental illness and treating disorders of the brain the same \n     way as disorders of the body, the bias persists. A physical \n     disease like asthma is okay; a mental disorder like \n     depression is not.\n       If anything, Witte ought to be a prized health plan client. \n     She has demonstrated that she knows how to take care of \n     herself. Six years ago, when she was in high school, she \n     developed anorexia, an eating disorder. Her parents promptly \n     took her to a psychiatrist at Children's National Medical \n     Center who diagnosed depression and prescribed a six-month \n     course of the antidepressant Zoloft. Witte responded well. \n     She overcame her eating problems. She has had no problems \n     with depression since that time.\n       How many teenage girls try to keep their destructive eating \n     habits secret? How many go for years without proper \n     treatment? They can end up needing hospitalization and may \n     suffer long-term complications. In the end, that is much more \n     expensive to a health plan than covering outpatient \n     psychotherapy and medications for six months.\n       In short, Witte and her parents--her father works for the \n     federal government, her mother for a health maintenance \n     organization--did everything right in getting prompt \n     treatment. ``It was a success story,'' said Witte. ``I'm a \n     proponent of drugs when they're used properly. They can \n     really help.''\n       Why should she be penalized for being a success story?\n       It's legal for health insurers to consider a person's \n     health status when they offer individual policies. Otherwise \n     some people might not buy insurance until they were diagnosed \n     with a major medical problem and needed coverage to get care.\n       But this is obviously not the case with Witte, a healthy \n     young woman who runs regularly and likes to take day-long \n     hikes. As a health insurance reject, she is eligible for \n     programs designed for high-risk individuals, but the costs of \n     coverage are generally higher and the benefits more limited \n     compared to a regular plan. That's a steep price to pay for \n     having had a six-month prescription for Zoloft.\n       In many parts of the country, the infrastructure of mental \n     health services is unraveling. Headlines have rightly focused \n     on the collapse of public programs for people who need \n     government-funded treatment.\n       But a much larger population with mental disorders remains \n     in the private sector. They are holding jobs and raising \n     families. They rely on private insurance and private \n     therapists for treatment. Support for them is eroding, too, \n     as insurance agencies stint on payment for mental health \n     services, managed care plans place limits on benefits, and \n     the burden of co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses \n     continues to increase.\n       Even people with good jobs and supposedly good health \n     coverage are hurting. One man who works for the federal \n     government has been treated for major depression since his \n     first episode at age 38. He has seen the same psychiatrist, \n     who monitors his medications and provides psychotherapy, \n     every week for 15 years.\n       This year his insurance plan has eliminated the more \n     generous high-option policy that covered 50 visits to the \n     doctor. His current plan, with a premium that is a few \n     dollars cheaper every month, covers only 25 sessions. His \n     psychiatrist charges $165 an hour; the plan now covers about \n     half the hourly fee, and only half the time. Bottom line: His \n     doctor bills come to $8,250 a year. His plan pays $1,800; he \n     pays the rest.\n       ``It's not fair,'' he said, ``it has to cost us so much \n     money when there's supposed to be parity'' in coverage of \n     mental and physical illnesses. ``Parity keeps slipping \n     away.''\n       The president last week came out in favor of patients' \n     rights. That ought to include the millions of Americans with \n     mental illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S424-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S424-S425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 17, \n1993 in Portland, ME. Two men assaulted a father and son they mistook \nfor a gay couple. The assailants, James G. Miezin, 23, of Parma, and \nThomas J.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stroke Treatment and Ongoing \n     Prevention Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND GOAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the \n     United States. Each year over 750,000 Americans suffer a new \n     or recurrent stroke and 160,000 Americans die from stroke.\n       (2) Stroke costs the United States $28,000,000,000 in \n     direct costs and $17,400,000,000 in indirect costs, each \n     year.\n       (3) Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability \n     in the United States. Between 15 percent and 30 percent of \n     stroke survivors are permanently disabled. Presently, there \n     are 4,400,000 stroke survivors living in the United States.\n       (4) Members of the general public have difficulty \n     recognizing the symptoms of stroke and are unaware that \n     stroke is a medical emergency. Fifty-eight percent of all \n     stroke patients wait 24 hours or more before presenting at \n     the emergency room. Forty-two percent of individuals over the \n     age of 50 do not recognize numbness or paralysis in the face, \n     arm, or leg as a sign of stroke and 17 percent of them cannot \n     name a single stroke symptom.\n       (5) Recent advances in stroke treatment can significantly \n     improve the outcome for stroke patients, but these therapies \n     must be administered properly and promptly. Only 3 percent of \n     stroke patients who are candidates for acute stroke \n     intravenous thrombolytic drug therapy receive the appropriate \n     medication.\n       (6) New technologies, therapies, and diagnostic approaches \n     are currently being developed that will extend the \n     therapeutic timeframe and result in greater treatment \n     efficacy for stroke patients.\n       (7) Few States and communities have developed and \n     implemented stroke awareness programs, prevention programs, \n     or comprehensive stroke care systems.\n       (8) The degree of disability resulting from stroke can be \n     reduced substantially by educating the general public about \n     stroke and by improving the systems for the provision of \n     stroke care in the United States.\n       (b) Goal.--It is the goal of this Act to improve the \n     provision of stroke care in every State and territory and in \n     the District of Columbia, and to increase public awareness \n     about the prevention, detection, and treatment of stroke.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, the Senate has today approved important \nbipartisan legislation to improve the treatment of two afflictions that \ntake the lives and blight the health of millions of Americans. The \nStroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act establishes important new \ninitiatives to improve the quality of stroke care for patients across \nAmerica. The Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act will make \nthese lifesaving medical devices much more widely available in public \nplaces throughout the country.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Bill Frist, for joining me in \nsponsoring these two measures. Senator Frist and I have worked closely \non this legislation to establish new initiatives to reduce the grim \ntoll of injury and death taken by stroke and cardiac arrest, and I \ncommend him for his leadership. We are also grateful to the many \ncolleagues on our committee and throughout the Senate who have worked \nwith us so effectively on these two proposals.\n  Stroke is a national tragedy that leaves no American community \nunscarred. It is the third leading cause of death in the United States. \nEvery minute of every day, somewhere in America, a person suffers a \nstroke. Every three minutes, a person dies from a stroke. Strokes take \nthe lives of nearly 160,000 Americans each year. Even for those who \nsurvive, it can have devastating consequences. Over half of all \nsurvivors are left with a disability.\n  Since few Americans recognize the symptoms of stroke, crucial hours \nare often lost before patients receive medical care. The average time \nbetween the onset of symptoms and medical treatment is a shocking 13 \nhours. Emergency medical technicians are often not taught how to \nrecognize and manage the symptoms of stroke. Rapid administration of \nclot-dissolving drugs can dramatically improve the outcome of stroke, \nyet fewer than 3 percent of stroke patients now receive such \nmedication. If this lifesaving medication were delivered promptly to \nall stroke patients, as many as 90,000 Americans could be spared the \ndisabling consequences of stroke.\n  Even in hospitals, stroke patients often do not receive the care that \ncould save their lives. Treatment by specially trained health care \nproviders increases survival and reduces disability due to stroke, but \na neurologist is the attending physician for only about one in ten \nstroke patients. To save lives, reduce disability and improve the \nquality of stroke care, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act \nauthorizes needed new public health initiatives to enable patients with \nsymptoms of stroke to receive timely and effective care.\n  The Act establishes a grant program for States to implement systems \nof stroke care that will give health professionals the equipment and \ntraining they need to treat this disorder. The initial point of contact \nbetween a stroke patient and medical care is usually an emergency \nmedical technician. Grants under the Act may be used to train these \npersonnel to provide more effective care to stroke patients in the \ncrucial first few moments after an attack.\n  The Act provides new resources for States to improve the standard of \ncare\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\nfor stroke patients in hospitals, and to increase the quality of stroke \ncare in rural hospitals through improvements in telemedicine.\n  The Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \na national media campaign to inform the public about the symptoms of \nstroke, so that patients receive prompt medical care. The bill also \ncreates the Paul Coverdell Stroke Registry and Clearinghouse, which \nwill collect data about the care of stroke patients and assist in the \ndevelopment of more effective treatments.\n  The Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act will increase \nthe availability of lifesaving cardiac defibrillators in communities \nthroughout the nation. We could save thousands of lives every year if \ndefibrillators were more widely available, yet few communities are able \nto make this technology widely accessible.\n  The measure approved by the Senate today will establish new \ninitiatives to increase access to defibrillators. It will assist \ncommunities in placing these lifesaving medical devices in public areas \nlike schools, workplaces, community centers, and other locations where \npeople gather. It will help communities provide training to use and \nmaintain the devices, and to coordinate planning with emergency medical \npersonnel. The legislation will also assist in placing defibrillators \nin schools so that cardiac arrest can be effectively treated when it \nstrikes the youngest and most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  Sudden cardiac arrest is a tragedy for families all across America. \nCommunities that have already implemented programs to increase public \naccess to defibrillators like the extremely successful ``First \nResponder Defibrillator Program'' in Boston have been able to increase \nsurvival rates by 50 percent. More than 50,000 lives could be saved \neach year if more communities implemented programs such as Boston's.\n  The two measures approved by the Senate today can make a significant \ndifference in the lives of the thousands of Americans who suffer a \nstroke or cardiac arrest every year. For such patients, even a few \nminutes' delay in receiving treatment can make the difference between \nhealthy survival and disability or death. We need to do all we can to \nsee that those precious minutes are not wasted. This legislation is \nimportant to every community in America. I commend my colleagues for \nhaving approved these measures, and I urge our colleagues in the House \nof Representatives to act on them promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/06/senate-section/article/S436-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S436-S437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMUNITY ACCESS TO EMERGENCY DEFIBRILLATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Access to \n     Emergency Defibrillation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 220,000 Americans die each year from cardiac \n     arrest. Every 2 minutes, an individual goes into cardiac \n     arrest in the United States.\n       (2) The chance of successfully returning to a normal heart \n     rhythm diminishes by 10 percent each minute following sudden \n     cardiac arrest.\n       (3) Eighty percent of cardiac arrests are caused by \n     ventricular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the \n     only effective treatment.\n       (4) Sixty percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the \n     hospital. The average national survival rate for out-of-\n     hospital cardiac arrest is only 5 percent.\n       (5) Communities that have established and implemented \n     public access defibrillation programs have achieved average \n     survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as high as \n     50 percent.\n       (6) According to the American Heart Association, wide use \n     of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives \n     nationally each year.\n       (7) Successful public access defibrillation programs ensure \n     that cardiac arrest victims have access to early 911 \n     notification, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early \n     defibrillation, and early advanced care.\n\n     SEC. 3.
