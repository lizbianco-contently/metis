Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 40 minutes for closing debate on the Santorum amendment No. 799 and \nthe Hollings amendment numbered 798.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we resume consideration of the \neducation authorization bill, we have 40 minutes of debate on the \nSantorum and Hollings amendments concurrently, with two rollcall votes \nat approximately 9:40 this morning, and votes throughout the day, as \nwell into the evening, as the Senate works to complete action on the \neducation bill this week. If the bill is completed on Thursday, there \nwill be no rollcall votes on Friday.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 798 and 799\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about my amendment which \nwill be voted on in roughly 40 minutes. This is an amendment that is a \nsense of the Senate. It is a sense of the Senate that deals with the \nsubject of intellectual freedom with respect to the teaching of science \nin the classroom, in primary and secondary education. It is a sense of \nthe Senate that does not try to dictate curriculum to anybody; quite \nthe contrary, it says there should be freedom to discuss and air good \nscientific debate within the classroom. In fact, students will do \nbetter and will learn more if there is this intellectual freedom to \ndiscuss.\n  I will read this sense of the Senate. It is simply two sentences--\nfrankly, two rather innocuous sentences--that hopefully this Senate \nwill embrace:\n\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       ``(1) good science education should prepare students to \n     distinguish the data or testable\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\n     theories of science from philosophical or religious claims \n     that are made in the name of science; and\n       ``(2) where biological evolution is taught, the curriculum \n     should help students to understand why this subject generates \n     so much continuing controversy, and should prepare the \n     students to be informed participants in public discussions \n     regarding the subject.\n\n  It simply says there are disagreements in scientific theories out \nthere that are continually tested. Our knowledge of science is not \nabsolute, obviously. We continue to test theories. Over the centuries, \nthere were theories that were once assumed to be true and have been \nproven, through further revelation of scientific investigation and \ntesting, to be not true.\n  One of the things I thought was important in putting this forward was \nto make sure the Senate of this country, obviously one of the greatest, \nif not the greatest, deliberative bodies on the face of the Earth, was \non record saying we are for this kind of intellectual freedom; we are \nfor this kind of discussion going on; it will enhance the quality of \nscience education for our students.\n  I will read three points made by one of the advocates of this \nthought, a man named David DeWolf, as to the advantages of teaching \nthis controversy that exists. He says:\n\n       Several benefits will accrue from a more open discussion of \n     biological origins in the science classroom. First, this \n     approach will do a better job of teaching the issue itself, \n     both because it presents more accurate information about the \n     state of scientific thinking and evidence, and because it \n     presents the subject in a more lively and less dogmatic way. \n     Second, this approach gives students greater appreciation for \n     how science is actually practiced. Science necessarily \n     involves the interpretation of data; yet scientists often \n     disagree about how to interpret their data. By presenting \n     this scientific controversy realistically, students will \n     learn how to evaluate competing interpretations in light of \n     evidence--a skill they will need as citizens, whether they \n     choose careers in science or other fields. Third, this \n     approach will model for students how to address differences \n     of opinion through reasoned discussion within the context of \n     a pluralistic society.\n\n  I think there are many benefits to this discussion that we hope to \nencourage in science classrooms across this country. I frankly don't \nsee any down side to this discussion--that we are standing here as the \nSenate in favor of intellectual freedom and open and fair discussion of \nusing science--not philosophy and religion within the context, within \nthe context of science but science--as the basis for this \ndetermination.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time. I have a couple of other \nspeakers I anticipate will come down and talk about this amendment, and \nI want to leave adequate time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I understand correctly the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has the time from Senator Hollings?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So Senator Hollings has the 10 minutes. In his absence, \nthe control of the time should be with the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Chair whether or not we have \n10 minutes altogether on our side or 10 minutes for each of us. What is \nthe understanding from last night?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 10 \nminutes, and the Senator from South Carolina controls 10 minutes, which \nhas now been----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes of my time if the \nSenator wants it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has been tendered \n10 minutes from the time allotted to Mr. Hollings.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 798\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my hope is the Senator from South \nCarolina will be able to be here. He spoke last night on his amendment, \nand he can do it with more eloquence and more persuasively than can I. \nBut I told him, since I support his amendment, I would be pleased to \ntry to be a fill-in for him.\n  I see my colleague is now here. I say to the Senator from South \nCarolina that I will be delighted to follow him, if he is ready to \nspeak.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina. I will \nfollow my colleague.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from South Carolina seek \nrecognition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, this Senate, and I say it advisedly and respectfully, \nin a sense, we are the best off-Broadway show. We engage in these \ncharades, set up these straw men and then knock them down, taking the \ncredit for being so effective politically.\n  We say we have a surplus; we don't have a surplus. The CBO projected \nin March a $23 billion surplus for this fiscal year. Mark it down, it \nwill be between a $50 billion and $70 billion deficit. We haven't even \npassed an appropriations bill. We have not passed any kind of \nsupplemental and already we can foresee, less than a week after the \nsigning of the so-called tax cut--where we had no taxes to cut--a \ndeficit of $50 billion to $70 billion.\n  Now here is what we set up. We say: Wait a minute. In education there \nis no accountability; there is no testing. The people back home do not \nknow what they need. If we can get some accountability and testing, we \nwill learn what they need.\n  Such fanciful nonsense. We have testing coming out of our ears. You \nmention the State, and I will give you the millions they are spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this schedule printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Amount spent                                                                                                                     Revenue\n                       State                          on testing       Grade 3       Grade 4       Grade 5       Grade 6       Grade 7       Grade 8     Number of    New tests       sharing\n                                                      (in thous)                                                                                         3-8 tests     required      proceeds\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama...........................................          $4,000            B             B             B             B             B             B            12            0     $24,915,437\nAlaska............................................           3,500            B             B   ............

Mr. President, we are spending $422 million this \npresent year in testing back home. We have been testing since you were \na little boy and I was a little boy. The folks back home know what is \nreally needed. But here we come and say they don't know what they need \nand they never have had any accountability. We want to discover for \nthem what schools are flunking and close those schools down, and in the \nmeantime hurt the students who have never even had the course, so to \nspeak.\n  If you did not benefit, as a poor child, from the Women Infants and \nChildren Program, you don't have a strong mind coming into this world. \nIf your school did not receive Title I funding, if you didn't have \naccess to a Head Start program, if you didn't get a good teacher, if \nyour class was so big that you were unable to listen and learn, you are \nunprepared. All these programs figure into giving students the course \nand they are less than 50-percent funded. Now we are going to test \nstudents because we know from the debate they have not had the course. \nWe haven't really gotten to the crux of the matter. Congress has \ndecided what is needed. So we have had testing.\n  Right to the point, if you really believe in harming students, as my \ndistinguished colleague from Minnesota points out so vividly and \nforcefully, and you are merely trying to give yourself political \ncredit, then vote against the amendment. That crowd that has been \ntrying to abolish the Department of Education now comes in saying they \nare going to get responsibility in education, accountability, and set \nup a straw man and knock it over with a 7-year bureaucracy of $2.7 \nbillion to $7 billion. That is what it costs.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I had printed in the Record this particular \nsurvey by the National Association of State Boards Of Education.\n  If you believe in bureaucracy at the cost of some $7 billion, if you \nbelieve that Washington knows best, that the people back home don't \nknow what they need--while we have heard on the floor about needs \nranging from libraries to curricula to teachers to reducing class sizes \nto school construction to after-school programs--then don't vote for \nthis amendment. Every Senator over the 7 weeks has put out the needs. \nBut what we need to do is take that money, like revenue sharing, send \nit back to the local folks, and say: If you want to have testing, test. \nIf you want to have further testing, do that. If you really think you \nneed to increase the teachers' pay, if you need to hire more teachers, \nthose kinds of things, then do it. But that is really assisting; not \nspending extra money.\n  This is not an increase, this is giving flexibility to the money \nunder the bill to address the needs back home. It is playing as if, \nfast forward 3 or 4 years, we have had the testing, we know what is \nneeded, and we know what schools are flunking. I could flunk 30 or 40 \nin South Carolina this afternoon with this so-called quality test, and \nstudents do not have another school to go to and you cannot close their \nschool down. So we spend billions, and we are in the same place as we \nare this minute.\n  If you believe in that bureaucracy, if you believe in unfunded \nmandates, if you believe in one size fits all, if you believe in \nharming the children just to get political credit on the floor of the \nSenate, then vote against this amendment.\n  But if you want to help the children back home and help the local \nschool boards, if you want to help America advance education, then take \nthis same program money and send it back on a revenue-sharing basis so \nthat schools can address their needs, whether those needs be testing or \notherwise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Hollings \namendment. Hearing the Senator from South Carolina makes me think that, \nour motto should be, perhaps: We should invest before we test.\n  I think of what the American people said about Dr. King when he left \nthe pulpit and went out into the community: He went out and walked his \ntalk. I don't think we are walking our talk. If we were walking our \ntalk, we would not only be demanding our tests, but we would be \ndemanding that every child have an opportunity to do well on the tests. \nWe have not done that, and I think Senator Hollings raises what I think \nis the most important question.\n  I believe I am one of the few Senators who is troubled by this and \nagonizing over the question of whether or not the Federal Government \nshould be telling the school board, the school district, which \nepitomizes the grassroots political culture of America: `You do not get \nto decide what is best.' We are telling them, every school district in \nAmerica: You are going to test every child, grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 \nevery year, with consequences for your school and your school district \ndepending on how these children do in these tests.\n  What this amendment says is we should maybe have a little more faith \nin people at the school board level.\n  We should have maybe a little more faith in people back in our States \nto decide what they think is best, and they should have the option on \nwhether they want to do the testing or use the resources to help \nchildren. That is what this amendment says.\n  I am all for national community standards for civil rights and human \nrights and for the first amendment and in making sure there is a floor \nfor a educational commitment below which no poor child falls. I think \nthat is what we are about as a nation. But I think when it comes to \nthis kind of decision, is it right for the Federal Government literally \nto tell every school district what to do to test every child? I think \nwe might rue the day we have voted for this. I struggle over the \nquestion right now. That is why I think this is such an important \namendment. I fully support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, on the Santorum amendment, \nI hope all of our colleagues will vote in support of it. It talks about \nusing good science to consider the teaching of biological evolution. I \nthink the way the Senator described it, as well as the language itself, \nis completely consistent with what represents the central values of \nthis body. We want children to be able to speak and examine various \nscientific theories on the basis of all of the information that is \navailable to them so they can talk about different concepts and do it \nintelligently with the best information that is before them.\n  I think the Senator has expressed his views in support of the \namendment and the reasons for it. I think they make eminently good \nsense. I intend to support that proposal.\n  On the Hollings-Wellstone amendment, I listened, as I always try to \ndo, to my friend and colleague from South Carolina. There is so much he \nsays that makes very good sense, but I have to oppose the amendment.\n  When he talks about the preparation of children, he makes a great \ndeal of sense. In fact, if the children are denied the Women's, \nInfants', and Children's Program--the WIC Program--if they are denied \nthe early nutrition, which is so important for the development of the \nmind, if they are denied the early learning experiences, which are \nabsolutely instrumental in developing and shaping the mind, they lose \nopportunities.\n  If we are only funding the Head Start Program at 40 percent, we are \nleaving 60 percent out. The Early Head Start Program is only funded at \nabout 10 or 12 percent.\n\n  If we take children who are denied all of those kinds of \nopportunities, unless they are enormously fortunate to have other kinds \nof sustained enforcement of educational experience and stimulating \nexperience in terms of their home life, or other circumstances, we can \nask whether children are arriving in school ready to learn. Some may be \nbut many others may not.\n  One of the most important developments over the period of the last 10 \nyears has been the knowledge of what happens in the development of the \nbrain. We had ``The Year of The Brain.'' It was on the front pages of \nmagazines and newspapers and on television programs. We found that the \nearly development aspects of the brain are absolutely essential where \nthe neurons connect with the synapses and we have the development of \nthe mind.\n  One of the key aspects, that at least many of us have believed, is \nthat not only is it important to leave no child behind in terms of the \nsupport of this bill to reach all 10 million children who will be \neligible but also the investment in children at the early age, to which \nSenator Hollings spoke. But if we are going to continue to make that \nbattle and struggle, we are going to have to, on the floor in the \nSenate and in appropriations, try to invest for the children so they \nare ready to learn.\n  A number of States responded to the requirements of the title I \nprogram in 1994. We require testing in the elementary schools, middle \nschools, and in the high schools. Fifteen States are meeting that \nrequirement at the present time. But most of the tests which exist in \nthe States are more attuned to national standards rather than State \nstandards. Forty-nine States have established their own standards.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to try to develop a curriculum \nthat will reflect those standards and have well-trained teachers who \nwill use that curriculum and then examination of the students with well \nthought out tests that are really going to test not only what the child \nlearns but the ability of the child to use concepts. That is why the \naverage test that is being used at the State level is $6 or $7. The \ntest we are trying to develop here, the provisions which are \nstrengthened with the Wellstone amendment and the other requirements, \naverages $68 a test versus $6.\n  Money doesn't answer everything in terms of being sure you are going \nto get a quality test, but part of the requirements we have for the use \nof the test is to be able to disaggregate it. At the current time, \nthere are only three States that use disaggregated information. So you \nknow in the class that there are various groups of students who aren't \nmaking it rather than just the test that uses the whole classroom.\n  It is also important to disaggregate information so that you know \nmore completely where the challenges are in terms of the students \nthemselves in order to make progress and tie the curriculum into these \ntypes of features, and also to make sure we are going to have the \ndevelopment of the test developed by the States, in the States, for the \nStates' standards.\n  That is our purpose--not that they take off-the-shelf tests. Most of \nthe States using the tests now are using the off-shelf-tests that are \nfocused on national standards rather than State standards. That happens \nto be the reality.\n  I don't question that in a number of States there are superintendents \nand school boards who think they are getting adequate information. But \nthis is a much more comprehensive way of finding out what the children \nknow and then hopefully developing the kinds of methodologies to equip \nthe children to move ahead. That is really our purpose. We may not get \nit right, but that is certainly the purpose we intend.\n  Finally, if the States are developing their own tests, and if they \nmeet the standards which are included in this legislation and they \nconform with them, then they obviously meet those requirements. Then \nthere is nothing further they have to do.\n  Three States, as I said, disaggregate information and have a number \nof the items that are included in this bill. But by and large they are \nnot in existence in other areas.\n  If that is the case, and we believe assessments are a key aspect of \nall of the efforts we are trying to develop in this legislation--I know \nthere are those who don't agree with that as a concept--we know that \nchildren are tested frequently.\n  I can give you some cases in Lancaster, PA, where they test actually \nevery 9 weeks in terms of what the children are learning during that \nperiod of time; and they alter and change the curriculum to try to give \nfocus and attention to groups of students in those classes who are not \nmaking measurable progress. They have seen the absolutely extraordinary \nprogress the schools have made in Lancaster as a result of it.\n  If it is done right, done well, done effectively, it is a very \nimportant, positive instrument in terms of children's development. If \nit is not, then it can have the kind of unfortunate results that have \nbeen mentioned in this Chamber. It is our intention to try to do it \nright. We have built in enough legislation to do it. I think this is \nthe way to go.\n  I think we have a good bill. We have had good authorization. We are \ngoing to have the difficulty and challenge of getting the funding. That \nis an essential aspect of the continuing process as we move through the \nlegislative process. We want to make sure that we are going to do it \nright.\n  But I do not believe the Hollings-Wellstone amendment is consistent \nwith the whole central thrust of this legislation. I, regretfully, \noppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nnow ask for the yeas and nays. And then I will ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the remaining time, \n15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If there is no one who wants to address the Senate, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum--I am sorry.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to use some of the time that is \navailable for our side to talk a little about the bill. I have not said \nmuch in relation to this bill, but it certainly is one of the most \nimportant issues that we will talk about.\n  We have a great opportunity to help make education stronger in our \ncountry. That is, of course, what we ought to be seeking to do. This \ndiscussion has gone on for a very long time. I hope we are nearing the \nend of the debate. I think we have spent nearly 4 weeks, off and on, on \nthis proposition. It is time to bring it to a close.\n\n  In my view, we have had an excessive amount of amendments; \nnevertheless, that is where we are. But now if we are really going to \ndo our part, and if we are really going to be able to cause this to be \nsomething that is effective, then we need to focus a little bit, as we \nevaluate where we are, on what our goals are, what it is we are really \nseeking to do.\n  I guess too often I get the notion that we get wrapped up around here \nin all the details, little items that mean something to someone, and we \nlose track of where it is we really want to go.\n  What we ought to do is have a vision--hopefully, a fairly common \nvision--of what our goals are in terms of education, in terms of the \nrole of the Federal Government in education, and to be able to measure \nwhat we are doing each day in terms of how we meet those goals.\n  I think one of them that is quite important is, what is the role of \nthe Federal Government in education? It has been my view, and continues \nto be my view, that the major responsibility for elementary and \nsecondary education lies at the local level, lies with the community, \nlies with the school boards, and lies with the States.\n  One of the reasons I think that is so important is there are very \ndifferent needs in very different places because what you need in \nChugwater, WY, is quite different than what you need in Pittsburgh, PA. \nThey ought to be able to make those kinds of unique decisions locally.\n  What is really needed to bring about change? We are all in favor of \nchange, although I am not as pessimistic about schools as many people \nare. I think most of our schools do a pretty good job. One of the \nreasons I think that--and I realize this is not a broad sampling--is \nbecause of the young people who come to the Senate. They are evidence, \nit seems to me, that our schools are doing a pretty darn good job.\n  We need to do better, and there are some schools that do better than \nothers, but that ought to be part of our goal, to establish what is \nreally needed to bring about change. Then we ought to measure it. I \nthink too often when we get into these issues, much of our conversation \nbegins to border on political rhetoric: Boy, if you are for education, \nthen that's a great thing. But you have to kind of decide what it is \nthat you are for. Everybody is for education.\n  We have to talk a little bit about spending. This bill authorizes \nspending far beyond anything that we have ever thought about. \nObviously, most of us would agree dollars alone don't bring about \nquality education. You can't have it without the dollars, but dollars \nalone don't do that. So I think there has to be some limit.\n  With that, inevitably, goes a certain amount of direction and control \nfrom Washington. How much of that do you want? I think there are some \nthings that we ought to think and talk about.\n  As I understand it, the real purpose, as we started out with this S. \n1, was to increase accountability for student performance. We do that \nsome by testing. There has to be some accountability. We have to put \nout there funding, funding that really works and is not wasted, is not \nused up in bureaucracies. We have to have increased flexibility and \nlocal control if we really want to be able to deal with the problems \nthat exist in our school systems.\n  We need to empower parents to have a role in schools. We need there \nto be opportunities for students such as in charter schools. We need \nsome changes in that respect. We need to provide options for students \nwho are consistently failing or who are in danger at schools. We need \nto do something about that.\n\n  But the responsibility really lies at the local level. That is why we \nelect school boards. That is why we have legislatures. We need to help, \nbut there needs to be local flexibility. I think it is pretty clear \nfrom the debate that the bureaucracy and redtape have been real \nproblems.\n  My wife happens to be a special ed teacher. I can tell you, she \nspends more time with reports than is really necessary. When she ought \nto be working with the kids, she is having to fill out all these \nreports that come in and are required. There ought to be a limit to \nthat.\n  We ought to try to reduce the duplicative educational programs that \nare out there. Now over 50 percent of the Federal education dollars are \nspent on bureaucracy and overhead. That is unacceptable. The money \nneeds to be there to help the kids.\n  Burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates--talk to anybody who is an \nadministrator at a school and see what they think about unfunded \nmandates and the burdens of regulation. We do not talk about that very \nmuch. We have had 150 amendments that bring about more regulations. We \nought to make sure we avoid that.\n  I think, again, we have to work to give the States and the locals \nunprecedented flexibility. The Federal Government has provided only \nabout 6 or 7 percent of the funding for elementary and secondary \neducation. We ought to do better than that. But keep in mind, the basic \nthrust is in the local community with the local dollars, the local \ndecisions, the local leaders. That is where it belongs.\n  We talk about schools failing. We ought to put a little \nresponsibility on those who are responsible for those schools that are \nfailing. Help them, yes, of course. But the idea that we are suddenly \ngoing to take over this whole educational system and change it, I don't \nthink that is consistent with our notions of Government.\n  So I just think we have a great opportunity. I think there are some \nvery good things in this bill. I hope that we conclude it soon so we \ncan get it moving and so we can get on to some other issues as well. \nBut I hope we evaluate, as we go: What do we think the role of the \nFederal Government is? How should money be used that is sent to the \nlocal and State governments? How do we have accountability? And how, \nindeed, do we make sure this effort of ours is one that produces the \nbest dividends and moves us towards our vision of what education in \nthis country ought to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his support of my amendment. I hope the Senate will \noverwhelmingly vote for and support the amendment that I have offered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming was just talking about the role of the \nFederal Government in education. I was just thinking about the many \nvisits I have made to school districts around my State. I have been to \nabout 160 or 170 school districts in my State. We have about 500 school \ndistricts. I talked about education in many of those visits.\n  Maybe other Senators have experienced the same thing, but when I talk \nabout education in schools, when I talk about educational reform, \nsuperintendents and teachers tend to get a little stiff in front of me, \ntend to get a little tense, because they are living it. And here we \nare, on the outside, trying to tell them how to do it better. One of \nthe reasons I go to those schools is to listen to the schoolteachers \nand to principals and superintendents, parents, and students.\n  One of the things I hear more and more from people and parents and \nteachers in particular is, yes, we need to improve education, but we \nalso need to look at what is coming into the educational system, the \nchildren coming into our system, particularly in our lowest performing \nschools, where children are coming in with many more profound problems \nthan they did 20, 30,\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n40, even 50 years ago, when we thought we had a pretty good educational \nsystem in the country.\n  To sit here and say all the problems in our society, all the problems \nwith our children are because they don't have a good education or there \nis not a good school, whatever the case may be, sort of laying all the \nblame on the schools for not producing educated children, in some \nrespects, I believe, misses the mark or certainly doesn't tell the \nwhole story of the problems that we are confronting as a culture and as \na nation.\n  We have a couple minutes before the vote, and I wanted to put my two \ncents in. For those teachers and administrators, people who work very \nhard in the school system, particularly the poor schools and schools \nthat are in difficult neighborhoods, you are right; the schools are not \nthe sole source of blame for having children who can't read coming out \nof them. I even argue in many cases they aren't the principal sources \nof blame or even a particularly big share of the blame.\n  When we talk about educational reform, particularly leaving no child \nbehind--and I support that--we need to look not just within the school \nsystem; we have to look outside the school system. We have to look at \nour culture. We have to look at the American family, our neighborhoods, \nat our popular culture, and the message being sent to the young \nchildren. We have to look at neighborhoods. And whether it is crime or \nthe breakdown of the family or the breakdown of the community, the lack \nof economic opportunities, whatever the case may be--in most cases, it \nis all of those things--we need to recognize that education is just a \npiece of solving this puzzle for a child growing up in these very poor \nneighborhoods.\n  I hope we don't walk away from here flexing our muscles, raising our \nhands, saying: We have now solved the problem; We have fixed the \neducational system and that alone is going to solve the problems we \nface in our poor and downtrodden communities. It will not, no matter \nhow good our schools are.\n  I always share this story of going to a high school in north \nPhiladelphia, a very poor high school, a very poor neighborhood, a \ncrime ridden neighborhood. I walked through that school. First I walked \nthrough the metal detectors. And I finally got to a classroom where, of \nthe students going to the school, less than 5 percent were going to go \non to some education beyond high school. I went into the classroom \nwhere those 5 percent were, and they were being talked to about their \nopportunities. They were all from public housing, poor neighborhoods. \nThey could get a free ride to any school they wanted to go to.\n  I remember talking to them about the opportunities they had and sort \nof seeing somewhat blank stares back at me. We got into a discussion. I \nsaid: What is your biggest fear? What is your biggest concern about the \nschool you go to and your education? And the consensus developed was \nthis: Getting to school alive every day. When you are an achiever in a \ngroup of people who do not achieve academically, you are a target. You \ncan throw more money at that school, you can improve the quality of the \nteachers, you can have smaller class size, but if your concern is \ngetting to school alive, we are missing the boat somewhere.\n  I want to step back, as we hopefully will celebrate passage of this \nbill and say that we have done great things to help children. If we \ndon't get to the issues outside of the school, throwing more money into \nthe school is whistling through the graveyard at night. It isn't going \nto solve the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been interested in the debate \nsurrounding the teaching of evolution in our schools. I think that \nSenator Santorum's amendment will lead to a more thoughtful treatment \nof this topic in the classroom. It is important that students be \nexposed not only to the theory of evolution, but also to the context in \nwhich it is viewed by many in our society.\n  I think, too often, we limit the best of our educators by directing \nthem to avoid controversy and to try to remain politically correct. If \nstudents cannot learn to debate different viewpoints and to explore a \nrange of theories in the classroom, what hope have we for civil \ndiscourse beyond the schoolhouse doors?\n  Scientists today have numerous theories about our world and its \nbeginnings. I, personally, have been greatly impressed by the many \nscientists who have probed and dissected scientific theory and \nconcluded that some Divine force had to have played a role in the birth \nof our magnificent universe. These ideas align with my way of thinking. \nBut I understand that they might not align with someone else's. That is \nthe very point of this amendment--to support an airing of varying \nopinions, ideas, concepts, and theories. if education is truly a \nvehicle to broaden horizons and enhance thinking, varying viewpoints \nshould be welcome as part of the school experience.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as my friend from Pennsylvania, and \nperhaps every one in the free world, knows the issue he brings up with \nregard to how to teach scientific theory and philosophy was recently an \nissue in my home State of Kansas. For this reason, many of my \nconstituents are particularly sensitive to this issue.\n  I would like to take the opportunity of this amendment to clear the \nrecord about the controversy in Kansas.\n  In August of 1999 the Kansas State School Board fired a shot heard \n'round the world. Press reports began to surface that evolution would \nnot longer be taught. The specter of a theocratic school board entering \nthe class to ensure that no student would be taught the prevailing \nwisdom of biology was envisioned. Political cartoons and editorials \nwere drafted by the hundreds. To hear the furor, one might think that \nthe teachers would be charged with sorting through their student's \ntexts with an Exacto knife carving out pictures of Darwin.\n  However, the prevailing impression, as is often the case was not \nquite accurate. Here are the facts about what happened in Kansas. The \nschool board did not ban the teaching of evolution. They did not forbid \nthe mention of Darwin in the classroom. They didn't even remove all \nmention of evolution from the State assessment test. Rather, the school \nboard voted against including questions on macro-evolution--the theory \nthat new species can evolve from existing species over time--from the \nState assessment. The assessment did include questions on micro-\nevolution--the observed change over time within an existing species.\n  Why did they do this? Why go so far as to decipher between micro and \nmacro-evolution on the State exam? How would that serve the theocratic \nschool board's purpose that we read so much about? Well, the truth is . \n. . their was no theocratic end to the actions of the school board. In \nfact, their vote was cast based on the most basic scientific principal \nthat science is about what we observe, not what we assume. The great \nand bold statement that the Kansas School Board made was that simply \nthat we observe micro-evolution and therefore it is scientific fact; \nand that it is impossible to observe macro-evolution, it is scientific \nassumption.\n  The response to this relatively minor and eminently scientific move \nby the Kansas school board was shocking. The actions and intentions of \nthe school board were routinely misrepresented in the global press. \nMany in the global scientific community, who presumably knew the facts, \nspread misinformation as to what happened in Kansas. College admissions \nboards, who most certainly knew the facts, threatened Kansas students. \nThe State Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the State universities \nwere threatened based on the actions of school board. All of these \neffects caused by a school board trying to decipher between scientific \nfact and scientific assumption. The response to the actions of the \nboard, appeared to many as a response to the commission of heresy.\n  For this reason, I am very pleased that my friend from Pennsylvania \noffered this amendment. He clarifies the opinion of the Senate that the \ndebate of scientific fact versus scientific assumption is an important \ndebate to embrace. I plan to support the amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that between the two \nvotes, prior to the second vote in order, there be 2 minutes on each \nside for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield back the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As I understand, we have 2 minutes on each side. There \nwill be 2 minutes for the Senator from South Carolina and 2 minutes for \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, dear colleagues, the fundamental flaw \nis the approach that we do not, at the local level, have \naccountability, that we do not have testing. The truth is, and I have \npreviously printed it in the Record, we have testing coming out of our \nears: $422 million this year. We know what works.\n  I say, rather than go through a 7-year exercise at $7 billion, along \nwith the bureaucracy from Washington, to develop what Washington thinks \nis the standard, what Washington thinks is quality, use that money to \naddress local concerns, whether they be further testing or additional \nneeds. We know what the needs are. Senators have stated them over 7 \nweeks: Curriculum, better teachers, more teachers, smaller class size, \nand on down the line.\n  This is, in a sense, revenue sharing with the same amount of money.\n  If Members believe in one size fits all, that Washington--and not the \nlocal folks--has the answers, if Members believe in unfunded mandates, \nif Members believe students should be tested on courses that they have \nyet to receive--Title I, Head Start, and the others--if Members believe \nwe ought to institute this 7-year bureaucracy at a cost of $7 billion, \nvote against the amendment.\n  If Members believe in local control, and if Members believe they know \nwhat is best, and what schools in their states need is help for \ncurriculum, for class size, and everything else, then vote with us. I \ndon't see my distinguished colleague, Senator Wellstone, but I have his \nsupport, and I think I might be able to get the support of Senator \nKennedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, with all respect to my friend and \ncolleague from South Carolina, I rise to oppose the amendment. This \namendment, if passed, will cut out the heart of the bipartisan \nagreement on educational reform in this underlying bill. The heart of \nit is that we are going to demand results; we are going to ask for \nevidence that we can present to educators, to parents, indeed to \nstudents and public officials, that the vast amounts of money that we \nat the Federal level and those at the State and local level are \ninvesting in the education of our children is actually working. The \nimportant thing to say is that in the requirement that the underlying \nbipartisan agreement makes for testing of schoolchildren from grades 3-\n8, we set the rules, but we leave it to the States to determine the \nstandards. It is the States that will decide each year what is adequate \nyearly progress. It is the States that will determine how well their \nstudents are doing. So this is a national set of rules, but it is the \nStates that will decide how each of them goes forward in implementing \nthe rules.\n  Second, we require an arcane term, but it means a lot, disaggregation \nof data, so that people in the State, in the local area, parents, can \nsee how each group of children is doing so we will be sure in that \nevidence that we will not overlook the educational needs of the \nneediest of our children.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment and thereby stand by the \nbipartisan agreement for educational reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 420.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit \n       certain youth to perform certain work with wood products)\n\n       On page 893, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EXEMPTION.\n\n       Section 13(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 213(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in the administration \n     and enforcement of the child labor provisions of this Act, it \n     shall not be considered oppressive child labor for an \n     individual who--\n       ``(i) is under the age of 18 and over the age of 14, and\n       ``(ii) by statute or judicial order is exempt from \n     compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade,\n\n     to be employed inside or outside places of business where \n     machinery is used to process wood products.\n       ``(B) The employment of an individual under subparagraph \n     (A) shall be permitted--\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\n       ``(i) if the individual is supervised by an adult relative \n     of the individual or is supervised by an adult member of the \n     same religious sect or division as the individual;\n       ``(ii) if the individual does not operate or assist in the \n     operation of power-driven woodworking machines;\n       ``(iii) if the individual is protected from wood particles \n     or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier \n     appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or \n     flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from \n     machinery in operation; and\n       ``(iv) if the individual is required to use personal \n     protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels \n     of noise and saw dust.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition to discuss my \namendment, which briefly stated, would simply permit Amish youths, aged \n14 to 18, to be able to work in sawmills. The issue has arisen as to \nthe safety of these sawmills. The Appropriations subcommittee which has \njurisdiction over the Department of Labor which I had chaired held a \nhearing on this subject. It is appropriate and necessary that the full \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions have a hearing.\n  We have consulted with experts who have given us a formula to provide \nfor what we think is the requisite safety. I have had a brief \ndiscussion with the Senator from Massachusetts about my withdrawing \nthis amendment and having a hearing so that due consideration could be \ngiven to this issue by his committee.\n  This amendment is designed to permit certain youths--those exempt \nfrom attending school--between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in \nsawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I \nintroduced identical measures in the 105th and 106th Congresses. \nSimilar legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague, \nRepresentative Joseph R. Pitts, has already passed in the House twice \nbefore. I am hopeful the Senate will also seriously consider this \nimportant issue.\n  As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased \nfunding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections \ncontained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, \nthat accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from \ncompulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is \nextremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be \nprovided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer \nemployment where they live.\n  The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish \ncommunity. In 1998, I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, PA, \nand had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. In \nDecember 2000, Representative Pitts and I held a meeting in Gap, PA, \nwith over 20 members of the Amish community to hear their concerns on \nthis issue. Most recently, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to examine \nthese issues.\n  At the hearing the Amish explained that while they once made their \nliving almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand \ninto other occupations as farmland has disappeared in many areas due to \npressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to \nrely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish \nculture expects youth, upon the completion of their education at the \nage of 14, to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become \nproductive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one \nof the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system \nlimits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are \ncurrently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they \nreach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and \nlifestyle of the Amish.\n  Under my amendment, youths would not be allowed to operate power \nmachinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as \nsweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My amendment requires that \nthe youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris and \nwear protective equipment, all while under strict adult supervision. \nThe Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to insure that \nthey are enforced.\n  The Department of Justice has raised serious concerns under the \nestablishment clause with the House legislation. The House measure \nconferred benefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious \nsect or division thereof whose established teachings do not permit \nformal education beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the \n``benefit'' of working in a sawmill only the adherents of certain \nreligions, the Department argues that the bill appears to impermissibly \nfavor religion to ``irreligion.'' In drafting my amendment, I attempted \nto overcome such an objection by conferring permission to work in \nsawmills to all youths who ``are exempted from compulsory education \nlaws after the eighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader focus is \nnecessary to create a sufficient range of vocational opportunities for \nall youth who are legally out of school and in need of vocational \nopportunities.\n  I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in \nWisconsin versus Yoder supports my bill. In Yoder, the Court held that \nWisconsin's compulsory school attendance law requiring children to \nattend school until the age of 16 violated the free exercise clause. \nThe Court found that the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on \nthe free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school \nbeyond the eighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and \npractices of the Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be \nmade with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their \npopulation grows and their subsistence through an agricultural way of \nlife decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to \nthe continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills \ndenies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-\nreliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish \ndo not need the final two years of public education.\n  This is a matter of great importance and I urge my colleagues to work \nwith me to provide relief for the Amish community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator is correct. The Senator has \nspoken to me about this issue. It is a very important issue because it \ndoes involve children and involves a dangerous industry. But there are \nother factors to be considered.\n  The Senator has given us some recommendations from very noteworthy \nOSHA experts who believe a way can be found to ensure the safety of \nthese children and also achieve the objective. I think it would be \nvaluable to have that in an open hearing, and we will do so in our \nLabor Committee and give due notice to the Senator when that hearing \nwill be held, and welcome any of the people from whom he thinks it \nwould be useful for us to hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  I just add one note. There are very serious issues of religious \nfreedom involved here with the Amish having the right under the \nConstitution not to have education beyond the age of 14, and those will \nbe considered in due course.\n  Let me thank my distinguished colleague from Louisiana for yielding \nso that we could have this brief colloquy.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have a very brief quorum call. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 420 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in the last colloquy I stated my \nintention to withdraw the amendment. I did not use the magic words, \nwhich I now use. I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ndisposition of the Dodd amendment No. 382, the Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Nelson, be recognized to call up amendment No. 533; that there be 5 \nminutes for debate on the amendment equally divided in the usual form; \nthat upon the use of the time, the amendment be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no second-degree \namendment in order thereto.\n  Further, that upon the disposition of amendment No. 533, Senator \nKerry be recognized to call up amendments Nos. 423 and 455, that there \nbe 40 minutes total for debate on the two amendments with time divided \nas follows: 10 minutes each, Senators Kerry, Smith of Oregon, Kennedy, \nand Gregg, with no second-degree amendments; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the amendments be agreed to and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Provided further that, upon the disposition of the Kerry/Smith \namendments, the Senate resume consideration of the Cantwell amendment \nNo. 630, as modified, with a total of 15 minutes for debate divided as \nfollows: 5 minutes each, Senators Cantwell, Kennedy, and Gregg; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Cantwell amendment, with no second-degree amendment in \norder thereto, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Louisiana is recognized to \ncall up amendment No. 474 on which there will be 30 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 474 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 474.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes \n     amendment numbered 474.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To improve the formulas for teacher quality grants)\n\n       Beginning on page 312, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 313, line 4, and insert the following:\n\n       ``(I) an amount that bears the same relationship to 35 \n     percent of the excess amount as the number of individuals age \n     5 through 17 in the State, as determined by the Secretary on \n     the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, bears to the \n     number of those individuals in all such States, as so \n     determined; and\n       ``(II) an amount that bears the same relationship to 65 \n     percent of the\n\n       On page 320, strike lines 16 through 26 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) an amount that bears the same relationship to 20 \n     percent of the total amount as the number of individuals age \n     5 through 17 in the geographic area served by the agency, as \n     determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent \n     satisfactory data, bears to the number of those individuals \n     in the geographic areas served by all the local educational \n     agencies in the State, as so determined; and\n       ``(2) an amount that bears the same relationship to 80 \n     percent of the total amount as the num-''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, the amendment that I offer today is \nsimilar in some ways to the amendment I offered and we adopted 2 days \nago. With an overwhelming and bipartisan show of support, we again made \na commitment to better target the somewhat scarce education resources \noffered by the Federal Government under this bill--I use the word \nscarce judiciously; to some it is an awful lot of money, but to others, \nrelative to what we need, it is not enough towards the communities with \nthe greatest need.\n  Whatever moneys we are able to place, I believe, and many of my \ncolleagues on the Republican and Democratic side and, to his credit, \nPresident Bush must be targeted toward helping the children and the \nschools that need the most help. Particularly when, as Senator Kennedy \nhas so eloquently expressed many times on the floor, this is really a \nnew day for education from the Federal Government. We are initiating \nsweeping reforms, not mandating local governments but supporting them \nin their efforts to reform their schools, to increase standards, to \nimplement accountability. We must work with the states and locals in \npartnership, to help fulfill our promise to leave no child behind.\n  This amendment would target more tightly title II dollars. On Monday, \n57 Members of this body helped us to target the title I dollars, the \nlargest title of the elementary and secondary education bill. There are \nseven general titles in the BEST bill. Title I has always been the \nlargest Federal title. Some would argue the most important. Yet, when \nyou are talking about providing an quality education, it is hard to \nargue that a Title which is focused on quality teachers is any less \nimportant. In my mind and in the minds of many in the Senate, there \nreally is no more important element of an education than a good, \nqualified teacher.\n  William Arthur Ward once said: The mediocre teacher tells; the good \nteacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates; the great teacher \ninspires.\n  We need a lot more great teachers in America. We have many, but we \nneed more. No doubt there is a crisis in our Nation today. From the \nEast Coast to the West Coast, from the North to the South, from \nCalifornia, to Louisiana, to New Hampshire, to Illinois, communities \nare faced with a struggle to find qualified people to teach their \nchildren.\n  Every major newspaper and magazine in our Nation has covered this \nstory--not on the back page, not on the middle page, but on the cover \npage. Here is an excerpt from Newsweek published earlier this fall. \n``Who Will Teach Our Kids?'' That is the question parents are asking. \n``What Schools And Parents Can Do. Half Of All Teachers Will Retire By \nThe Year 2010.''\n  The picture is of a child waiting for a teacher and these subtitles \nonly scratch the surface of the real crisis facing us today. Let me \nread briefly from a story that says ``Teachers Wanted.'' I noticed this \nbecause Frank, my husband, and I have our 9-year-old Connor in school \nhere. He finished third grade this year. One of the joys of my day is \nto know every day that Connor is in a school with a wonderful teacher--\nHolly Garland, and that he is being well educated in a school that is \nsafe. I can come to work in the Senate and do my job. My husband can go \ndo his job because we have that security.\n  But that is not the case of a family from Georgia. Their names are \nJill and Larry Jackson of Conyers, GA. The article says:\n\n       It should have been a season of hopeful beginnings, but for \n     Jill and Larry Jackson of Conyers, Ga., the opening of school \n     this fall has meant only anger and frustration. Their 11-\n     year-old son, Nicholas--\n\n  Only 2 years older than Connor--\n\n     is in a sixth-grade special-ed class taught by an assistant \n     and a substitute. The regular teacher quit after three weeks \n     of school, and the class of 13 is out of control. ``We can \n     move Nicholas to a special-ed class in another school that \n     has just five kids,'' says Jill, ``but the teacher is leaving \n     in December. I phoned the district, and they told me that \n     they have five special-ed positions to fill. And I asked them \n     if they think they'll have a certified special-ed teacher in \n     that class by December, and they said: `That's the least of \n     our problems right now.' ''\n\n  Jill, the mother, much as I am with my children, said: ``Well, it's \nthe biggest problem in my life right now.''\n  To millions of parents, from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to \nLouisiana to Mississippi, the biggest problem in their lives is their \nkids, 90 percent of whom are in the public schools of this Nation. They \nsend them to schools and classrooms without certified teachers, without \nany teachers, with substitute teachers, teachers who come in and out of \nthe classroom every few weeks. How is it possible for a child to begin \nto learn when the teacher doesn't even know a child's name? This is a \nparent's worst nightmare.\n  My amendment does not attempt to fix this terrible situation because \nI am not certain any amendment could actually deal with a problem this \nlarge. It is so large and so tough. What my amendment does is say, we \nknow we have a problem; we need to set goals\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nand strategies for fixing that problem; and most importantly, we must \nprovide the resources to address the problem.\n  In short, my amendment attempts to move what money we have into the \nareas and to the schools that need the most help. This bill requires \nthat all schools with 50% or more of their children in poverty must \nhave all highly qualified teachers by 2005. What would that mean to \nstates?\n  Let me cite some statistics that were actually shocking to me, and \nhopefully they will be to the Members of the Senate. Let me start with \nsome examples of some States right now that are in pretty good shape. I \nwill cite three or four.\n  Connecticut has a total of 1,069 schools. Yet only 189 of those \nschools are 50 percent poverty. So out of over 1,000 schools, they have \nfewer than 200 schools in the whole State that have 50 percent of \npoverty or more. To meet the requirements under this bill, 6,670 in \nConnecticut's poorest schools would have to be highly qualified by \n2005. That is a manageable amount. Connecticut is in pretty good shape \nbecause under the bill, it is going to have to make sure that these 189 \nschools have the resources to meet this requirement. Based on what I \nknow about the resources in Connecticut and the great work of Senator \nDodd and Senator Lieberman and other elected officials in that State, I \nhave no doubt that with the extra muscle they can probably manage to \nfind 6,000 highly qualified teachers in 3 years.\n  Let me share the good news about another State, New Hampshire. It has \n516 schools. Only 7 in the whole State of New Hampshire--it is a small \nState--have a poverty rate of 50 percent. That means that they have \nthree years to make sure that the 103 teachers who currently teach in \nthose schools are highly qualified. Again, I am confident that with the \ngood work of the Senators here from New Hampshire and their Governor, \nJean Shaheen, and their elected officials , they can find the 103 \nteachers qualified, get them in those classrooms, and meet the goals of \nthis bill.\n  Let me give you one other example of a State in pretty good shape. It \nis a larger State, and people might not expect that a large State such \nas New Jersey would be in good shape, but they are. They have 2,317 \nschools. Only 400 of those schools have 50 percent poverty rates or \ngreater. They must ensure that 16,000 teachers are highly qualified. \nSixteen thousand is a lot, but New Jersey is a big State with a lot of \nresources. There is substantial wealth in New Jersey. Lots of \ncorporations are there. Their property taxes are pretty high. If they \nwould distribute them a little more evenly, which they are probably in \nthe process of doing, they can perhaps find 16,000 teachers in 3 years.\n  Let me tell you a sad story. Let me talk to you about 3 States. As \nyou may expect, one of them is Louisiana. One of them is Mississippi. \nAnd the third is Texas. Let me talk about Louisiana for just a minute. \nWe have--Senator Breaux and I--in our State 1,500 schools. Of the 1,500 \nschools, 1,013 have more than 50 percent of the children in those \nschools in poverty. Let me repeat that. We have 1,500 schools in \nLouisiana. Out of that number, we have 1,013 schools that have 50 \npercent of poverty, or higher. That means we would have to find 30,000 \nhighly qualified teachers for these classrooms. There are only 49,000 \nfull time teachers in the whole state, so we would have 3 years to make \nsure that 3 out of every 5 teachers meet the qualification requirements \noutlined in this bill. I don't know how, if we worked 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, between now and the deadline which is in this bill, with \nthe limited resources we have, if we could meet that deadline.\n  Let me go into a little bit more detail about Louisiana. I want to \nshow you what the challenge is. I think Senator Kennedy and Senator \nGregg, who are very knowledgeable about this, must certainly understand \nthis challenge.\n  In Louisiana, every year we have 8,000 students enrolled in colleges \nand universities. The students who graduate are 1,600 every year. We \nwill lose 160 in the test because the tests for teachers will weed out \nsome who are not ready and qualified. That is most important. So we \nwill graduate with degrees 1,440. These are last year's statistics. And \n33 percent of these, which the taxpayers in Louisiana paid taxes--\nincome taxes, sales taxes, fees, license taxes--to educate will leave \nour State. For the most part, they will leave Louisiana because almost \nevery State around us has higher salaries. So we will lose 33 percent \nof those teachers who come out, leaving us basically with 964 teachers. \nThese teachers will start, and in 5 years 30 percent of them will leave \nthe system, leaving us--out of this graduating class of 1,600--675.\n\n  This is not right. This is not efficient. This is a waste of taxpayer \ndollars. Most important, it is what is contributing to the crisis of us \ntrying to get good teachers in our classrooms.\n  Now a lot of things can be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time of the Senator from \nLouisiana has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes to complete. I \nask unanimous consent that I may do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate the extra time.\n  What's more, 66% of the teachers in Louisiana have bachelors degrees. \nOnly 13 of our teachers were Nationally Board Certified in the year \n2000. And over 15% of those teaching in our state have not successfully \ncompleted their certification.\n  This is true of Louisiana, but it is going to be true in almost every \nState you look at. The numbers of people choosing to teach are just not \nthere to meet the requirements. So lots of things can be done. This \nbill encourages alternative certification, being creative, getting \nretirees who have had a successful first career into the schools. For \ninstance, a great program Troops to Teachers, which uses our military \nto fill these slots. We can no longer rely on 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds. \nWe must broaden our thinking.\n  There are positive things that can be done, and there are success \nstories, but they are not free. I contend today, and I will continue to \nfight in this debate, that there are simply not enough resources at the \nlocal and Federal levels to meet the new demands of this bill and to \ngive a promise to our parents and students that they will be taught by \na qualified, good teacher.\n  Let me share some facts about Mississippi. Mississippi is a State \nthat is in a very tough situation. Mississippi has 874 schools. Of the \n874 schools, 700 have 50 percent of poverty--students from households \nrepresented by an income that hits the poverty level. They need 23,274 \nhighly qualified teachers. Under this bill, they are going to have 3 \nyears to find 23,274 teachers.\n  Mississippi and Louisiana need help. That is what this amendment is \nabout. It is about saying whatever dollars we can muster, whatever we \ncan scratch out of this budget to make an investment in this Nation's \nfuture and our kids, let's get it to the States and the children who \nhave been without qualified teachers for too long. We have examples \nthroughout our history of that special teacher with that special touch \nwho can work miracles for a child, any child, regardless of their race \nor family income. Let's help get teachers to Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  Let me end with Texas. Texas is a big State, and they have a big \nproblem because they have 7,228 schools.\n  Of those schools, 3,190 have student populations with 50 percent of \npoverty or more. They need a whopping 107,779 qualified teachers in 3 \nyears.\n  Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi are examples of States that do not \nhave the same resources other States might have, particularly \nMississippi and Louisiana.\n  This amendment is an attempt to bring the resources that will support \nthis reform, that will help meet the goals of this new education bill \nto the States and to the areas that could use the most help.\n  Some people on the other side have said this is a local issue. This \nmight be where the local issue in terms of decisions are made, but if \nthis Federal Government does not step up to the plate and provide some \nadditional resources to help parishes in Louisiana, such as Red River, \nOrleans Parish, St. Martin Parish, and Iberia Parish and even Jefferson \nParish, they cannot reach their full potential. If we do not step up to \nthe plate, they will never be able to find the thousands of qualified \nteachers\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nwith creativity, with a new approach to education because there are so \nmany barriers.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention to the issue of targeting \nfederal resources to our areas of greatest need. It is a very important \nand fundamental principle of this bill. We have set new high standards. \nWe have left the control at the local level. We have given local \ngovernments, as you did, Mr. President, when you were Governor of your \nwonderful State of Delaware, more resources with which to work, but \nthose resources are not adequate.\n  I hope as this moves forward that we can increase our investment in \nour children's education so that the family I referred to in Georgia or \nmy family or any other family does not have to live through the \nnightmare of having high hopes for a child, sending them off to school \nonly to be in a classroom out of control because we have not provided \nthe resources and the parameters necessary to succeed.\n  Today, research is confirming what common sense has suggested all \nalong. A skilled and knowledgeable teacher can make an enormous \ndifference in how well students learn. Is the home environment \nimportant? Absolutely. Can children learn without their parents or a \nparent or a grandparent or a guardian encouraging them? No. But can a \ngood teacher make a difference? Absolutely.\n  Again to quote:\n\n       The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The \n     superior teacher demonstrates. But the great teacher \n     inspires.\n\n  We have a nation that was built on hope and inspiration. Our Nation \nwas founded on the belief that tomorrow could be a better day; that men \nand women would live in liberty and that value is taught through our \nschool system. If we do not commit the resources to help our teachers \ndo the job, if we do not find ways to get more and better teachers in \nthe classroom, we have not only failed our schools, we have failed our \ncountry.\n  I am pleased to say I understand it is going to be accepted. Again, I \nwish it was broader in its scope because we need to do more, but this \namendment targeting our resources will help. I will be back many times \nto speak about this subject. I thank you, and I believe my time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe I have time, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Apparently those opposing the amendment have \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu from Louisiana \nfor this amendment. As she has mentioned, this is completely consistent \nwith her previous amendment, which was overwhelmingly accepted, in that \nit provides greater targeted resources for teachers.\n  For my money, the most important ingredient in the educational \nprocess is having a well-trained teacher in the classroom. There are \nother components, but this is absolutely essential.\n  The greatest challenge we face is the neediest and the poorest \nschools where we need the best teachers have the most unqualified \nteachers. The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana sharpens the \ndirection of this legislation to ensure, to the extent we can, we get \nwell-qualified teachers to teach the neediest students. It is a very \nimportant amendment, and it is a very useful and helpful amendment. I \nurge the Senate to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Tennessee seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield back the remainder of our time, and we can have a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 474.\n  The amendment (No. 474) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand we will now proceed to the Dodd amendment, \nand that we will have 2 hours equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 382 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, is recognized to call up amendment No. 382 on \nwhich there will be 2 hours of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask that the Chair notify me when 15 minutes of my time \nhave expired. I will then ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, be recognized for 15 minutes, and at the \nexpiration of his 15 minutes, I be rerecognized to complete my opening \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, the chairman of the committee; Senator \nGregg, and other Members, my friend from Tennessee with whom I have \nworked on many issues and for whom I have the highest regard and \nrespect. I appreciate their efforts. I have enjoyed working with them \non the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  This is not a surprise amendment. My colleagues have known for some \ntime I have been deeply interested in afterschool programs. Going back, \nin fact, I offered some of the earliest amendments to support \nafterschool programs as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Children \nand Families, and then as the ranking member, working very closely with \nmy good friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Barbara Boxer from California has been very interested in \nafterschool programs. Most Senators have been interested in afterschool \nprograms.\n  Afterschool programs--in a sense, I am preaching to the choir \naddressing the Presiding Officer as a former Governor of the State of \nDelaware. He understands the tremendous value of having good, strong \nafterschool programs and how important they are. In a sense, I am \noffering this amendment not just on my behalf and those who support \nthis, but I do so on behalf of Fight Crime Invest in Kids, which \nrepresents a thousand police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, leaders, \npolice organizations, crime survivors; on behalf of the YMCA and YWCA, \nwhich are the largest afterschool providers in the United States--\nliterally there are some 2,500 YMCA and YWCA programs that provide \nafterschool programs--National PTA, National Network for Youth, \nAfterschool Alliance, National Community Education Association. I will \nprovide a list.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the long list of education groups, \npolice groups, prosecutors, and others supporting this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Fight Crime Invest in KIDS\n     YMCA\n     NABYC\n     National PTA\n     National Network for Youth\n     Afterschool Alliance\n     National Community Education Association\n     National Education Association\n     School Social Work Association of America\n     National Association of School Psychologists\n     Council for Exceptional Children\n     National Association of Social Workers\n     Association for Career and Technical Education\n     American Counseling Association\n     American Federation of Teachers\n     National Alliance of Black School Educators\n     American Association of University Women\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, their endorsement is not fainthearted. They \nbelieve this may be the single most important issue of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Because we are leaving out under the pilot \nprogram--and I want to make this argument so people can understand it; \nthis bill can get a little confusing with all the various pieces of it.\n  One of the major pieces of this bill is called the Straight A's \nProgram which is called a pilot program.\n\n  When we think of pilot programs or demonstration programs, our mind \nimmediately draws on a number that represents a relatively small \nfraction of\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nthe larger group. It will be a pilot program or a demonstration \nprogram. Certainly, this program, when it was announced, sounded \nrelatively small. It is a pilot program that would be in 7 States out \nof 50, in 25 school districts. That sounds pretty small. One cannot \nimagine that being any great threat as a pilot program. I am not sure \nwhether it is a pilot program for 1 year, 4 years, 5 years, or 7 years.\n  This bill is a 7-year bill. I am not sure how long the pilot programs \non the grants are supposed to run during the life of this bill. That is \nrather vague in the underlying bill. It could end up being 14 States or \n21 States over the 7-year life of the bill, or is it just 7 States in 7 \nyears? I am not sure of the answer.\n  In seven States and 25 districts, exclude the 25 districts, I can get \nyou to 44 percent of the entire student population of the United \nStates. If this pilot program that is going to be awarded by the \nSecretary of Education goes to the 7 largest States and the 25 largest \nschool districts in America, you are at 51 percent of the entire \nstudent population of the United States--hardly a pilot program or a \ndemonstration program. I don't think it is a leap of faith to suggest \nthat may be the case.\n  I expect every State in the United States to apply for the Straight \nA's Program. Why? Because it eliminates all the categorical programs. \nIt says to the States, you can basically do anything you want with this \nmoney. It says you have to serve the neediest kids, but we know under \ntitle I how broad a definition that is already under law for 36 years. \nI cannot imagine a jurisdiction not saying: I would like one of those; \nI will take Federal money without any strings attached. It is not any \ngreat leap of logic to assume that all 50 States and virtually every \nschool district will probably apply for the Straight A's Program.\n  I don't think it is any great leap if, in fact, you believe this \nprogram ought to be national policy and not a pilot program--which is \nthe view of the administration; they only call it a pilot program for \nthe purpose of this bill because if they said they want this to be the \nnational program, there would be a lot of resistance to it. If they \ncall it a pilot program, a lot of people are willing to say they will \ntry a pilot program.\n  The fact is, this could affect a lot of children for a long time. \nSeven years may not seem like much in the life of a bill in Congress, \nbut if you have a child in kindergarten, the first grade, the second or \nthird grade, that is the entire elementary education your child will \nget. So afterschool--I will get to the particular program--is \nimportant. This could affect a lot of children. It is why the YMCAs, it \nis why police chiefs, it is why all the other organizations are \nconcerned about this: because of the potential exposure it could mean \nto an awful lot of children around the country.\n  There are reasons why this particular program is important. Let me \nexplain it in context. What happens under the Straight A's Program, all \nof a sudden community-based, local-based grant applications get \neliminated in these 7 States and 25 districts. It would now come from \nthe State education authority or the Governor as to whether or not \nthere would be an afterschool program. This is why people are \nconcerned. We are moving away from local decisionmaking. We are saying \nin these States: You are out. That YMCA, the community-based \norganization, and some of the church-based organizations, you are out. \nIt depends on what happens at the State level. They watch the program \ngrow because of the value. There has never been, in the history of the \nDepartment of Education, a grant program that has been sought after as \nmuch as this grant.\n\n  Let me demonstrate the point with this chart. In this year alone \nthere have been 2,762 grant applications. Of that nearly 3,000, only \n300 will be funded under existing resources. There have been an average \nof 2,000 applications a year since the program started, and the numbers \nare going up. So we are looking at a tremendously popular program. \nPeople see afterschool care as critically important primarily to the \nsafety of their children. There is an academic achievement element to \nthis, but it is primarily an issue of safety. In the history of the \nDepartment this has been the most sought after grant of any in the \nUnited States. That is how popular it is with people all across the \ncountry.\n  We increased the funding for this over the years, but not very much. \nAccording to the most recent Mott/J.C. Penney poll, nearly two-thirds \nof voters report difficulty funding quality, affordable afterschool \nprograms. The Census Bureau reports that nearly 7 million children \nbetween the ages of 5 and 14 go home alone unsupervised each week.\n  Let me show a graph with the number of children, showing the growing \nnumbers of grade-school-age children in self-care in the United States: \n2 percent of 5-year-olds have no afterschool care and are home alone; 3 \npercent of 6-year-olds; 4 percent of 8-year-olds; and 11-year-olds--\nthese are children, not teenagers--10- and 11-year-olds, 1 in every 4 \nis home alone.\n  The second chart points out what police chiefs say about the program, \nand why dumping it into a block grant and eliminating community \norganizations from asking for help is wrongheaded. Police chiefs were \nasked in a survey: Which of these strategies do police chiefs choose as \nthe most effective for reducing youth violence in the country? \n``Afterschool,'' almost 70 percent chose that. Then it drops way down \nfor ``try juveniles as adults,'' ``hire more police,'' with ``metal \ndetectors'' at 1 percent. Is there any doubt where those people, who \ndeal with these issues every day believe this program has value? Is \nthere any doubt whether or not it ought to be taken out of this block \ngrant and left to local community organizations such as the YMCAs, such \nas our community organizations that find these programs worthwhile, to \napply for these dollars?\n  I can only, with the money, grant 300 out of almost 3,000 a year that \napply. But eliminate this, and these 7 States and 25 districts for 7 \nyears, left totally to the discretion of a State agency or a Governor, \nmay cut a lot of these programs. Why? Because a lot of the kids come \nfrom some of the poorest rural and urban districts and don't have the \nlocal clout to be applying for this assistance and carrying it off.\n  This is very important. If you talk about basic safety, it is \ncritical. Again, listening to me is one thing, but listen to people who \nwork every day in this area. They are the ones behind this.\n  Listen to the police chiefs across the country. Let me read their \nletter:\n\n       As an organization led by more than 1,000 police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, prosecutors, leaders of police organizations, and \n     crime survivors, we urge you to support a Senate floor \n     amendment to S. 1 to remove 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers (21st CCLC) from the Straight A's Block Grant.\n       We are concerned that if 21st CCLC is folded into a block \n     grant with many other educational programs the investment \n     that the Federal government has finally begun to make in \n     expanding after-school programs will wither. After-school \n     programs are different than many of the other programs \n     included in the block grant. They support and enhance \n     academic performance but they are not necessarily direct \n     academic programs. Therefore, in a block grant where the \n     accountability provisions measure only academic performance, \n     after-school programs will likely lose out to regular school-\n     day academic programs.\n       In addition, as law enforcement leaders and crime survivors \n     we feel strongly that one of the most important aspects of \n     after-school programs is the crime-prevention impact. The \n     Straight A's block grant accountability provisions do not \n     measure crime-prevention outcomes and therefore do not \n     completely recognize the unique nature and importance of \n     after-school programs such as 21st CCLC.\n       In the hour after the school bell rings, violent juvenile \n     crime soars and the prime time for juvenile crime begins. The \n     peak hours for such crime are from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. These \n     are also the hours when children are most likely to become \n     victims of crime, be in an automobile accident, have sex, \n     smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.\n       After-school programs that connect children to caring \n     adults and provide constructive activities during these \n     critical hours are among our most powerful tools for \n     preventing violent juvenile crime. For example, in a five-\n     city study, half of a group of at-risk high-school kids were \n     randomly assigned to participate in the Quantum Opportunities \n     after-school program. The boys left out of that program had \n     six times more criminal convictions in their high-school \n     years than the boys who attended the after-school program.\n       Yet roughly 11 million children go home from school \n     regularly to an empty house. With such a large unmet need, \n     now is the time to be strengthening the Federal government's \n     commitment to after-school programs, not weakening it.\n\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\n\n  That is 1,000 police chiefs talking about this. Forget about the \nSenator from Connecticut talking; will we listen to the people who work \non these issues every day?\n  Let me read a letter from the YMCA. This is the largest program, \ncelebrating its 150th year of existence this year. These people know \nwhat they are talking about. These are some of the best programs in the \ncountry.\n  This is a letter from Ken Gladish, national executive director:\n\n       A recent survey conducted for the YMCA of the USA shows how \n     important afterschool programs are. Among other findings, the \n     survey showed that young people who do not participate in \n     afterschool programs are five times more likely to be D \n     students, twice as likely to get into a fight at school and \n     far more likely to skip a day of school than youth engaged in \n     stimulating, productive activities in the hours after school. \n     According to census figures, more than seven million school-\n     age children are left home alone and on the streets, \n     unsupervised after school. This is far too many of our youth \n     to place in danger of academic failure and much worse.\n       As the largest private provider of afterschool programs in \n     the country, YMCAs have 150 years of experience providing \n     programs to young people during non-school hours. More than \n     2,500 YMCAs serve over 9 million children and youth in over \n     10,000 communities through partnerships with schools, \n     businesses, police, juvenile courts and housing authorities. \n     Many other community-based organizations in this country also \n     have decades of experience operating quality afterschool \n     programs, and Congress is making the 21st Century program \n     better by making sure funding is available for programs \n     operated by these organizations. However, by not requiring \n     the Straight A's states to spend this money on afterschool \n     programs and to make it available to community organizations, \n     Congress will effectively and dramatically limit the overall \n     positive impact afterschool programs can have on local \n     communities.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Thee being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                              YMCA of the USA,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the YMCA of the USA, I \n     would like to thank you for offering your amendment to the \n     reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     to remove the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program \n     from the ``Straight As'' demonstration provision. Dedicated \n     funding for afterschool programs and the ability of \n     community-based organizations to compete fairly for this \n     funding would be severely restricted without passage of your \n     amendment.\n       A recent survey conducted for the YMCA of the USA shows how \n     important afterschool programs are. Among other findings, the \n     survey showed that young people who do not participate in \n     afterschool programs are five times more likely to be D \n     students, twice as likely to get into a fight at school and \n     far more likely to skip a day of school than youth engaged in \n     stimulating, productive activities in the hours after school. \n     According to census figures, more than seven million school-\n     age children are left home alone and on the streets, \n     unsupervised after school.

Gladish, Ph.D.,\n                                      National Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Can there be any more eloquent argument that whatever else \nwe do with Straight A's and academic performance, we should not take a \nprogram for which there is such need in this country, where the \noverwhelming evidence is that police officers and people who provide \nafterschool programs are begging us not to jeopardize the millions of \nkids who could be in a pilot program affecting literally millions of \nchildren--we should not exclude this valuable tool for keeping kids \nsafe and providing some safe harbor for them in the afterschool hours.\n  With that, I promised my good friend from Tennessee, because of other \nobligations he has, to provide him with whatever time I have remaining \nto respond to these eloquent, persuasive arguments--maybe he will \nendorse the amendment at this point--and then I have unanimous consent \nto reclaim my time.\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut outlining the \ndebate in which we will be engaged for the next 2 hours. He raised many \nimportant points.\n  I do rise in opposition to the Dodd amendment. Over the next 13 or 14 \nminutes, I hope to explain to my colleagues why I am opposed to this \namendment. I will address two issues. No. 1, I will address problems \nwith the substance of the amendment itself and its impact on the \nunderlying bill. No. 2, I hope to reveal how this particular amendment, \nin stripping out part of the bipartisan education bill, violates the \nprinciples behind this bipartisan agreement. I mention this right \nupfront because if this amendment were agreed to, it would potentially \nthreaten the entire education bill.\n  Most important, in response to the eloquent words of the Senator from \nConnecticut, we should focus on the substance of the amendment itself. \nFirst of all, you will hear several terms. One is ``Straight A's''; one \nis ``21st Century School.'' Let me back up a little bit and paint the \nbig picture.\n  ``Straight A's'' is the title that is given for the program entitled \nAcademic Achievement for All. This is a program that is a part of the \nunderlying bill. It functions as a pilot program. Its purpose is to \ndemonstrate, not on a nationwide scale, but for up to 7 States and 25 \ndistricts which can apply to qualify for this pilot program. The reason \nthe program itself is so important to our side of the aisle is that it \ndoes crystallize and underscore the important principle of flexibility \nand--and this is where I disagree with my colleague--local control. \nLocal control is coupled with higher standards of accountability.\n  The BEST bill requires all students meet standards of achievement. \nHowever, if you participate in this voluntary pilot program, you are \ngiven greater flexibility to make decisions at the local level, and you \nwill be required to deliver higher standards than are required in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Again, I mention it because people think this is a block grant with \nno strings attached, and that is simply not true. The strings are \nattached in the form of high academic standards and accountability. If \nyou don't meet the standards, you cannot participate; again, if you \ndon't qualify in the evaluations that are built into the underlying \nbill, your privileges of flexibility are taken away.\n  What funding are we talking about? We are not talking about enormous \nFederal block grants which are taken from education funding. Many are \nconcerned about the approximately $8 billion title I funds that are \naimed at disadvantaged children. No, we are talking about the other \nprograms, non-title I funds. I do not want people to misunderstand \nwhere these funds will come from. I can't emphasize this enough.\n  After a lot of negotiation with the White House, with the Democrats, \nwith the Republicans, we brought everyone to the table, and we agreed \non certain programs. That is why Straight A's is in the underlying \nbill. But this amendment is trying to strip it out. We agreed to choose \nthose categorical programs which conform to the ideas in the underlying \nbill: Increased flexibility and strong accountability. The pilot \nprogram links greater flexibility to accountability for higher student \nachievement. Not all 18 categorical programs incorporate these two \ncomponents. However, I believe about 9 do. Nine categorical programs \nhave been included, one of which is the 21st Century program. This is \nan afterschool program. It is a program which I believe, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut does, is a very positive, important program which is \nintegral to strengthening the entire underlying education bill.\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n  The program may be worthwhile. I am not going to argue that it is \nnot, because the program is a worthwhile program. I will argue, \nhowever, that there are situations where local districts should be able \nto use that money for afterschool programs, or for more tutoring, or \nfor more teachers, or for class size reduction, or for teacher \ntraining, or for school construction. They ought to have the freedom to \nchoose how best to use those funds, and this pilot program gives local \nand State officials the authority to do this.\n  It captures innovation through increased accountability with local \ncontrol. Those concepts are terribly important to the Republicans.\n  We started negotiating with all 50 States to agree to more \nflexibility if they guarantee high accountability. But, in the \nnegotiations, it went from 50 States to 40, to 30, to 20, to 10 and now \nwe are down to 7 States. Indeed, we had 9 categorical programs with \ntitle 1 funds. We started with many more. But after negotiations with \nthe White House, Democrats and Republicans, we narrowed it down 9 \nprograms which made sense to be a part of this consolidation as we go \nforward.\n  Clearly, President Bush feels strongly about flexibility and local \ncontrol. It is part of his larger agenda. And so much of the underlying \nbill itself has moved away from the flexibility that I and many others \nhad hoped would be in this bill. This is the only thing left in this \noverall education bill that really captures high accountability, \nmaximum flexibility, and local control.\n  It is important for our colleagues to understand that negotiations \nand compromise brought us to the point where we agreed in a bipartisan \nway to narrow the scope of this program from 50 to 7 States. We also \nincluded fewer categorical programs to raise the academic standards. It \nwas a bipartisan compromise. Therefore, I have to mention that if this \namendment passes, it will strip away the heart and soul of Straight \nA's, which is in the underlying bill. In fact, it jeopardizes the \nentire education bill.\n  Let me elaborate on flexibility. Seven States will participate. They \ncan still have the Safe School Programs, but they will make that \ndecision for themselves. We allow for diversity at the local level. One \ndistrict might take a lot of steps toward an afterschool program. In \nanother district, they may already have an afterschool program funded \nin some other way. They may want to use those funds for more teachers \nor improving technology or for more computers in classrooms. All of \nthese initiatives can improve education, but only the local schools \nknow which programs will most effectively improve education. Again, \nthis can only be done when they are given maximum flexibility and local \ncontrol.\n  What does the Dodd amendment do? It destroys the program. The Dodd \namendment destroys the pilot program because it takes away from the \noverall funding that is available. If a State is accepted into the \nprogram, the Dodd amendment takes away about 40 percent of that \nfunding, leaving only about 60 percent of the funding for flexibility \nprograms.\n  We know, based on the negotiations with States and districts, that if \nthe Straight A's program only provided the little amount of funding \nwhich the Dodd amendment allows for, it wouldn't be worthwhile for a \nState or a district to participate.\n  This amendment takes 40 percent of the funding out of a very \nimportant program that we negotiated through compromise. We simply \ncannot strip more out of it because nobody will take advantage of it. \nIt destroys Straight A's. It destroys what is left in the education \nbill that we feel strongly about, and that the President of the United \nStates feels strongly about. It is one of the few things left in the \nbill that captures innovation, captures creativity, and focuses on \nlocal decisionmaking coupled with high standards of accountability.\n\n  There were several questions that the Senator from Connecticut \nbrought up. I will go through them again.\n  He mentioned the pilot program which requires a review of the State's \nperformance. If a State fails to meet what is agreed to in terms of the \naverage yearly program for 2 years, or if the State fails to exceed the \naverage yearly process for 3 years, the agreement is terminated right \nthen.\n  He mentioned that the Straight A's program will eliminate all of the \ncategorically targeted programs. It does not eliminate all of them. I \nthink as we observe which programs local schools choose, we will \nunderstand which programs are most effective and more frequently \nimplemented, but it doesn't eliminate all of them.\n  I started with 50 States. That is where we were. That is what our \nRepublican caucus wants. We don't want to impose the program on any \nState, but if a State wants more flexibility in exchange for higher \nstandards, they should be able to choose this path. We whittled it down \nfrom 50 to 7 states, but we just can't take away anymore and still have \nan effective program. I hope as many States as possible will take \nadvantage of this program.\n  The Senator from Connecticut made a point about losing local control. \nThis is an important principle because larger principle behind this \nprogram is: local people can make better decisions. They will make \nbetter decisions, if they are held accountable to improve education.\n  That is what this elementary and secondary education bill is all \nabout--reauthorization of education for those children. Local districts \nget the same amount of funds, but they decide what their priorities \nare. This includes afterschool programs; we are not taking that away. \nThey get the exact same amount of money. But they can decide where to \nspend the funds. Maybe in rural Tennessee all of the kids are out \nplaying football in the afternoon and don't need an afterschool \nprogram.\n  Under our plan, they can take that same amount of money and put it in \ntutoring for those students who are not doing as well academically. \nToday, they don't have that flexibility. The money has to go straight \ninto the 21st century afterschool program whether they want it to or \nnot.\n  The Senator from Connecticut said the programs would eliminate \nafterschool programs. We don't eliminate them. We believe that local \ndistricts should use that money for afterschool programs, if they like, \nor for teachers, or for technology, or for tutoring, or for textbooks.\n  Are there strings attached? Absolutely. This is not a block grant \nprogram where they can take the money and use it however they want. \nAgain, this is not a block grant.\n  That is why, again, it came from the negotiations. We put the \nstandards pretty high in the underlying bill--but raised them even \nhigher for the straight A's program. These are the highest standards \nanywhere in the bill. If a district participates, they will operate \nunder higher standards, or they will not qualify to continue to \nparticipate in the program.\n  We do not eliminate all categorical grant programs. For example, we \ndidn't touch the reading program. We didn't touch homeless or Indian or \nemigrants or vocational education. Are all categorical grant programs \nwithin bipartisan negotiations? Yes, it was narrowed down 17 to 9.\n  I will close. Again, I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut \nallowing me the opportunity to respond to some of the points he made. I \nappreciate the support of my colleagues on this bill. I hope to be able \nto speak a little bit later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by my friend \nfrom Tennessee.\n  I am unclear--I don't expect this to be resolved in this amendment--\nas to how long these actual block grant applications will be in \nexistence. It is unclear in the bill. That is why I said it could be 7. \nIt could be 14. It could be 21 States, if the grants are for shorter \nperiods of time. That is an open-ended question.\n  But the important point I want to make and the distinction here is \nthat the decisions within the State are not made locally. That is a big \ndifference. They are made by the State education authority, or the \nGovernor. We had that debate the other day as to who would dominate in \nthat discussion.\n\n  But the idea that the local town or some community in Delaware or \nConnecticut can make the decision about an afterschool program is not \nthe case. I wish it were. That decision, and whether or not you are \ngoing to get any afterschool programs, will be made\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nby a higher authority. They are the ones who will make that decision.\n  Under the existing program, the town or the county can apply, and \nthey can receive it or not. But it is a local decision. If you have \nfootball programs locally and you don't need it, you don't apply for \nit. There are many communities who need the help, so they apply \ndirectly. Some are not communities, they are community-based \norganizations, which are expanding tremendously. That is why YMCAs and \nother organizations, even some that involve churches and synagogues, \nare allowed to apply here, which does not mean the State has to make \nthat decision.\n  So all I am saying under the Straight A's Program is, just on those \nafterschool programs, leave it to the local communities to decide \nwhether or not they think afterschool programs are worthwhile. I do not \nbelieve that is that great a difficulty.\n  By the way, on the percentages taken out--this has been said over and \nover again--I asked the Congressional Research Service to give me their \nfinancial interpretation of what my afterschool program would mean in \nthe context of the Straight A's Program. If you exclude title I, yes, \nmy colleague from Tennessee is right, it is 40 percent. But I do not \nthink you can pick and choose here.\n  Under all of the Straight A's Programs, the afterschool program \namounts to 5.7 percent. That leaves roughly 94 percent of the dollars \nunder Straight A's that is still there to do all the other things for \nacademic performance.\n  So if you are going to define Straight A's as eliminating all non-\ntitle I funds, of course you get a higher percentage. But that is not \nwhat this is. Under Straight A's, it the entire pot of money, it is 5.7 \npercent, not 40 percent or 50 percent, as has been argued by some. So I \nmake those two points particularly.\n  The rest, as my colleague has said very candidly, would like to have \nall 50 States under this, with no strings attached, to just go out and \ndo what they want to do. That is why there is an Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Why did the Federal Government, 36 years ago, pass this law? It \npassed the law because there was a growing concern that the neediest of \nchildren in the United States--28 million of them who grow up in \npoverty, and 12 million working families in poverty, and others--that \nthere was a need to step in and try to do more to see to it that the \nneediest children would be served. That is why there is a Federal \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, because there was a concern \nacross the country that these neediest kids' needs were not being met.\n  Over the years, we have contributed about 6 cents. It has gone up \nfrom 4 cents to 6 cents of an education dollar; that is, 94 cents comes \nfrom the State and local property taxpayers, and 4 cents or 5 cents or \n6 cents of the education dollar comes from the Federal Government.\n  So what we are trying to do in that 6 cents is just to make sure that \nin certain areas the neediest of our children are going to get served, \nnot that we have a right to guarantee anyone's success. We do not. \nThere is no obligation to say to Americans: You ought to count on your \nGovernment guaranteeing you success. That is out. What we try to do--\nall people at all levels in our society--is to create equal opportunity \nfor people. That is the beauty of America. That has been such an \nattraction to people all over the globe and why people every morning \nget up around the world and line up around U.S. Embassies to try to \ncome here, either as citizens or as green card holders.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons why they come, but I think the most \nimportant one is that this is a place of equal opportunity. We are not \nperfect. We have not arrived at perfection, but we try very hard to see \nto it that, regardless of where you come from, if you are a citizen of \nthis country, regardless of ethnicity or background or religion, you \nhave an equal opportunity to succeed. That is America. There is no \nguarantee of success, but an equal opportunity to succeed.\n  That is what this is all about. That is the beauty of America, more \nso than our wonderful natural landscape or the economic wealth of our \ncountry. As important as those things are, I have always believed that \nthe great beauty of America, the great magic of it, is this notion of \nequal opportunity.\n  How equal can the opportunity be if your education isn't equal? I \nhave told the story in this Chamber, when my great grandmother came to \nAmerica, at age 14 or 15, with her husband--Thomas and Catherine \nMurphy--from the west coast of Ireland, she could not read or write. \nThat was not uncommon for immigrants in the 19th century and early part \nof the 20th century. The first thing she did was she got herself \nelected to the Voluntown, CT, school board. She understood that \neducation was going to be the key for the nine children she was about \nto have--my grandfather being the ninth--and that was the way you were \ngoing to get ahead. No guarantee of it, but if you had a decent \neducation, you had an opportunity to get ahead.\n  We are at the beginning of the 21st century, not at the end of the \n19th century, and I happen to believe that principle my great \ngrandmother intuitively applied to her own family. It is something we \nought to apply to all families. At least give people a good education \nin this country, a good starting block--that is what this is really all \nabout--and see to it that kids can be safe.\n  As you can see from the chart, when you have between 7 million and 11 \nmillion children home alone--if you take 5-, 6-, and 7-year-olds, and \nyou have 9 percent of 5-, 6-, and 7-year-olds alone for hours after \nschool, and you have\n10-, 11-, and 12-year-olds, where about 60 percent of those kids are \nhome alone, you have a problem on your hands. You do not need a Ph.D. \nin child psychology to tell you that.\n  You ask any parent who is working what they worry about at 2 or 3 \no'clock in the afternoon. Sometimes in rural communities--not so much \ntoday with cellular phones, but before the arrival of cellular phones, \nit was sometimes hard to get a call through because parents who were \nworking were calling their houses at 2:30, 3, 3:30 to see whether or \nnot their child was home safely.\n  There isn't a parent in America who does not worry about where their \nkids are when school lets out. That is why there are almost 3,000 \napplications for afterschool programs. That is why 1,000 police chiefs \nhave begged us to adopt this amendment. Because they understand it as \nthe most important issue when it comes to preventing crime and juvenile \nproblems, and kids who become victims.\n  This isn't about liberals and conservatives, Republicans and \nDemocrats. That is not what this is about. You go ahead and ask these \npeople. Ask the YMCAs what party they belong to. Ask those 1,000 police \nchiefs what party they belong to. Ask crime survivors, are you a \nDemocrat or Republican? That is not what they said in the letter. They \nsaid: We are people who know what we are talking about, and we think \nafterschool programs make sense.\n\n  Academic achievement is important. I have said I would support this \npilot program. I have my concerns about it. I am not the first to admit \nthat. But I am willing to try it, provided there is adequate funding. I \ndoubt the funding may be there, but if the funding is there, let's try \nthis over the next 7 years. If your child ends up in one these States \nand is a guinea pig for the next 7 years, that may be another matter. \nBut that is not the case. So we will try the pilot program.\n  But why would you throw afterschool programs into the guinea pig area \nwhen we know it works? When every community in the country will tell \nyou they need it? When you have people who have dedicated their lives \nto this, who understand it, why are you going to throw this into that \nsituation where some State authority is going to decide whether some \nrural county or some urban community ought to have some money for after \nschool? That is what this bill does. You take away local authority when \nit comes to applying for the grant applications. They have no authority \nto apply for them. It will be a decision made at the State level.\n  The local authority is gone. So that local YMCA, that local Boys Club \nor Girls Club out there, they will not have the right to apply to the \nDepartment of Education to ask for an afterschool program and \nassistance. They are going to have to rely on someone in their State \ncapital to decide whether it is OK.\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as a former Governor, you understand \nas well as anyone how difficult that can be. We all know it. It is hard \nto work the different battles that go on, and so forth. Sometimes it \nisn't just how this works. For the 3,000 who apply and the 300 who get \nsome help--if you want to help them, increase the funding for it \ninstead of throwing it into a block grant where it is a jump ball over \nwhether or not this program is going to be funded.\n  We heard my colleague from Tennessee say this is a great program, the \n21st Century Community Learning Centers. Everybody who stands up says \nthis is a great program. Then why are you throwing it into a roulette \nwheel for the next 7 years to see whether or not communities might get \nsome help? If it is such a great program, if the communities are \ntelling us it is a great program--and I will repeat what I said at the \noutset, there has never been a grant program that has been sought after \nas widely in the history of the Department of Education as the 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers. We are about to take it and dump it \ninto a Las Vegas environment where you are shooting craps on whether or \nnot you may end up with a good afterschool program, despite the fact \nevery organization you can think of that works in this area is asking \nus to do otherwise.\n  I am not suggesting that Straight A's eliminates all categorical \nprograms. I realize that. There was some negotiation that went on, and \nso some made it, some didn't. I accept that. That is politics. That is \nhow it works. Don't try to convince me it was done on the merits. It \nwas done on who could get in the room, who couldn't, what deal was \ngoing on. Afterschool got left out. That is all.\n  I am here today to say: Look this does not directly relate to \nacademic performance. It has some impact. As we heard, kids who are in \nafterschool programs do better academically. Those who are not do \nworse. A lot of other things happen to them.\n  Academic performance is very important. I don't question that at all. \nBut it is not the most important or the only thing. There are other \nthings that are important as well.\n  A kid's safety is important. Ask a parent whether or not they think \ntheir child is safe after school has any value or any importance. I \nthink we know the answer. If you ask them if academic performance is \nimportant, of course, they will say it is. But they don't believe you \nought to make it a choice between academic performance and a kid being \nunsafe.\n  I am suggesting we can do both. You can test academic performance \nthrough this pilot program, but you can also, as part of the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to education, provide some small resources to \ncommunity-based organizations that desire them. It is their decision to \napply. I am not dumping the money out to them. They have to apply. They \nhave about a 1 in 10 chance of getting it, even if they do apply. Of \nthe 3,000 that apply, 300 make it. So even if you have a strong desire \nfor one, under present funding levels, you have a very small chance of \ngetting it. But why eliminate any chance at all or leave it to the \nwhims of what happens at the State level where a lot of other issues \nare going to be in play?\n  I apologize for getting wound up. Obviously, I care about this. I see \nmy colleagues from New Jersey and Rhode Island here. I also see my \ncolleague from Arkansas who I presume wants to be heard on this. I will \nyield some time to my two colleagues if they are interested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has consumed 31 \nminutes; 29 minutes remain. The opposition side has 45 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Rhode Island, and \nthen I will go to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senator from \nConnecticut for his amendment and for his passion. He is exactly right. \nHe is focusing on a very important program, the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers.\n  I speak not theoretically but from experience. About 2 weeks ago I \nwent to Central Falls, RI, the poorest community in my State, a \ncommunity so poor that the school system has been taken over by the \nState of Rhode Island. I was there because they were announcing the \nopening of a support center that would integrate all the services \nnecessary today to effectively deal with the education of a child. It \nwas located right next to one of the elementary schools. It would be \nopen to parents and provide the resources and services necessary, \nhealth care services, screening services.\n  This initiative was sponsored by the United Way of Rhode Island. The \ngood news, it is spreading from Central Falls to other communities in \nRhode Island, starting next with Providence, our biggest city. At the \ncore of this initiative: A grant for the 21st century learning program \nfrom Federal education. This grant helped the United Way move forward \nand provided additional momentum, the thrust to go forward with this.\n  That is an example of how this program has materially affected the \neducation of students in Rhode Island. Central Falls is the poorest \ncommunity, heavily Latino, with new Americans coming in. It needs all \nsorts of services that you don't typically find the extra dollars in \nthe budget to deal with. And the 21st century grant provided the \nadditional necessary resources. That is an example of how we can make a \nreal difference.\n  This 21st century learning program has made that real difference. The \nSenator from Connecticut is so right, we are sacrificing this ability \nto go ahead and make these critical differences, inspiring local \nparticipation of the United Way, combined activities, doing what we all \nsay we want to do--bring the whole community into the education of \nchildren.\n  The risk of a block grant is that these priorities will fall by the \nwayside. A school district that is faced with paying salaries, fixing \nbuildings, everything else, will say: I would love to do this. This is \nexactly what we have to do, but we don't have the resources to do it.\n  I commend the Senator.\n  Let me suggest two other areas with respect to the Straight A's \nprogram that I think are very important. First, the program is being \npresented as a pilot program. The reality is, if you do the \nmathematics, and if you take seven States, such as California, Texas, \nNew York, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and then you take \nthe 25 largest school districts outside of those states, Straight A's \ncould potentially apply to about 51 percent of the students in the \ncountry. That is a rather significant amount of children subject to \nthis pilot program. We have to be very clear that this program could be \nfar from a pilot, that within a year or so we could see 51 percent of \nthe students of America subject to this block grant program, magnifying \nall of the concerns expressed by Senator Dodd of Connecticut and \nothers.\n  Let's be very clear, this is a pilot, but the pilot is flying a \nstealth aircraft. We could find ourselves not with a pilot program to \nevaluate, but in the midst of a widespread, significant change in \npublic policy in the United States.\n  I originally filed amendment No. 537 to try to truly restrict this to \na pilot program, but I think, because of many factors, this is a \ndiscussion that will probably take place in conference, as the House \nversion comes over without the widespread application that is \npotentially in this bill.\n\n  One other point about Straight A's: I have been insistent on getting \nparental involvement in this legislation. With the cooperation of \nSenator Gregg and Senator Hutchinson and everyone on the committee, we \nhave made real strides. But unfortunately, some of those parental \ninvolvement protections would not have to be followed in Straight A's \nstates and districts. I filed amendment No. 399 to ensure that those \nother parental involvement requirements of S. 1 would have to be \nfollowed, such as various provisions of section 1118, and other \nprovisions throughout S. 1 which require parental involvement, \nincluding teacher quality and safe and drug free schools. I would hate \nto see the parental involvement provisions go by the wayside because of \na block grant approach. I don't want to get involved in an extended \ndebate over each of the parental involvement provisions right now, and \nwill not offer\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nthis amendment, but will continue to address these issues as S. 1 moves \nto Conference.\n  Let me return to the issue at hand and conclude. Senator Dodd's \namendment is well placed, well stated. This is about practical \nimprovement of schools. I have seen this improvement in Rhode Island. \nWe will lose it if we go to a block grant. If you ask yourself what is \nwrong with American education, one of the things that has been wrong is \nthat the governance of education for too many years has ignored \nproblems that have festered--poor professional development, poor \ninfrastructure, many things such as that. Who are these people? They \nare the Governors, the school committees, and the Congress. But what we \npropose to do in a block grant is to reinforce this lack of \nperformance, this turning over of the keys and keep doing what you are \ndoing.\n  I suggest there is a middle ground between a block grant program and \nmicromanagement. One example of how that works successfully is the 21st \ncentury learning centers. I hope we can maintain that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired. So far \nSenator Dodd and those speaking in favor of the amendment have consumed \n37 minutes; 23 minutes remain. Those in opposition have consumed 15 \nminutes; 45 minutes remain. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume in opposition to the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as we hear the debate on removing the \n21st century program from the Straight A's demonstration project, I am \nreminded very much of the fierce debate that occurred in the early and \nmid-1990s over welfare reform. I was in the House at the time and there \nwere those of us who believed that the great reforms that were taking \nplace in welfare were occurring at the State level--there were a number \nof Governors around the country who were in the forefront of reforming, \nand the Presiding Officer was one of those Governors--and that the best \nthing we could do on the Federal level after a generation of trying to \nmicromanage welfare, and having done a miserable job at it and, in \nfact, having seen welfare dependence only increase in our country, many \nof us believed, on a bipartisan basis, that the best possible thing we \ncould do was to give the States broad new flexibility in the reforms \nthey would enact at the State level.\n\n  There was a fierce debate over whether that was a good direction in \nwhich to go. The opponents continually raised the issue that you can't \nreally trust the States and we dare not give them that kind of \nflexibility; if we give them that flexibility, they will misuse it and \nthey will abuse the poor and they will not take care of the most \nvulnerable in our society. And there was the hue and cry about block \ngranting being the great evil; that only those of us in Washington knew \nhow to care for those who were in need. Many campaigns were run on the \nissue of how callous and heartless it was to pass welfare reform.\n  Well, history demonstrated that that was one of the greatest things \nwe could do for the working poor and for the welfare-dependent in this \ncountry--the welfare reform that Congress passed and President Clinton \nultimately signed into law. As a result, welfare rolls nationwide have \nfallen. Tens of thousands have gone from a life of dependence to a life \nof productive work and have begun to realize and to live out the \nAmerican dream.\n  As we bring forth a very small demonstration program that has been \ncompromised and compromised, whittled and whittled, until it is but a \nshadow of its former self, we hear the same arguments raised against \nthis small demonstration program that we heard against welfare reform \nyears ago. I know there are differences, but there are a lot of \nsimilarities; the argument is basically the same: You can't trust that \nthe States are going to do the right thing. Never mind that they are \nelected by the same people who elected us. It doesn't matter that they \nare accountable to the same constituents to whom we are accountable. We \ncan't trust them. Only we can ensure that these programs are conducted \nin the right way.\n  There have been good faith negotiations that went on, bipartisan \nnegotiations, about a bill and about a program--the Straight A's--that \nat least there could be a little effort, a little opportunity for \nStates--no State would be compelled to--and for 25 school districts--\nbut no school district would be compelled--to enter into not a block \ngrant in the purest sense but a program in which they would be given \ngreater flexibility than ever before in exchange for a very tight \ncommitment on performance improvement.\n  But if a State is going to make that kind of commitment, there has to \nbe some incentive. And the more we pull out of the Straight A's \ndemonstration program, the less incentive there is. I think most who \nhave looked at what is left of Straight A's would agree that if the \nDodd amendment passes, there will be little if any incentive. There \nwill not be a Straight A's. This will destroy it, take out the very \nheart of it, and there will not be one State or one school district \nthat would see it worthwhile to make the kind of commitments required \nunder Straight A's for the limited flexibility that would remain.\n\n  Let me just say, as we think about where this program has gone, the \nPresident campaigned on this and he called it charter States. He saw it \nas a national program. He wanted to make it an opportunity for all \nStates. This is where we are now. We have gone from 50 States and \n14,000 school districts to a demonstration project for 7 States and 25 \nschool districts. For those who would argue that we have not given, not \ncompromised, I say we have compromised to the point that there is \nnothing left if this amendment passes. So we have gone from a national \nprogram of 50 States to 7 States and 25 school districts.\n  Additionally, there must be geographic distribution if more than that \nnumber applies. We have gone from no targeting of Federal dollars to \nmaintaining the title I targeting to schools unless an alternative \nmethod better targets. We have made that compromise from the original \nprogram. We have gone from no limitations on non-title I dollars to \nproviding that non-title I must target as well--additional targeting. \nThat is a compromise that the authors of this legislation have made in \nthe course of the negotiations. We have agreed to take out reading--a \n$1 billion program--from the list of eligible programs.\n  We also agreed to take out the following programs in the \nnegotiations, as the Senator from Connecticut well knows. We agreed to \nremove the migrant program, the homeless program, the immigrant \nprogram, and the Indian program. We have agreed to maintenance of \neffort language--another compromise made from the original proposal \nthat the President ran on and that so many of us believe in and have \nsought. We have agreed to restrict the amendment process so SEAs or \nLEAs cannot game the process. We have agreed to allow an LEA to opt out \nof the performance agreement upon permission from the SEA. We have \nagreed to require parental involvement to be required in the \nperformance agreement. That is something that Senator Reid sought as a \nconcession in the process of negotiations that were made. We have \nagreed to requiring parental participation and that it be reported. We \nhave agreed to prevent a State from becoming a charter State if an LEA \nbecomes one until the end of the term of the LEA performance agreement.\n  We agreed to make the sections of title I apply, and there are six \ndifferent sections that we agreed to make apply. None of those sections \nwere originally applied to Straight A's. We have agreed to include \nteacher quality and bilingual education goals as part of the \nperformance agreements--another concession and compromise made. We have \nagreed to strict private school equitable participation language. We \nhave tightened the approval requirements for the performance agreements \nso it will be subject to peer review and based on quality, not first \ncome/first served as was done with the Ed-Flex legislation. We have \ntightened the amendment procedure for amendments to performance \nagreements. We have agreed\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nthat a State or district may not get an Ed-Flex waiver for any program \nit consolidates under the performance agreement.\n  On and on goes the list of concessions that have been made, in trying \nto preserve an important part of this education legislation. And now \nthe last remnant is sought to be pulled out as well. Basically, when we \nvote on this amendment, the question is: Do we want to have a Straight \nA's demonstration program or not? To vote for the Dodd amendment is to \nsay we should not have this at all. If that is the position, it is \nhonest, but let's just say that not just whittle it down until there is \nnothing but a few fragments of sawdust left of what was a concept and \nan idea that had great merit. So we are clinging to that which is left, \nafter all of the concessions that have been made.\n  To pull this program will pull so much of the remaining funding \nresources in the Straight A's demonstration program that there will be \nvirtually no incentive for school districts or for States to \nparticipate. It will be but a figleaf. It will be that we can say, \nwell, it is in the bill, but what is there isn't--we really would not \neven get an idea of whether it was a workable concept in the first \nplace if this much is pulled out.\n  I plead with my colleagues. I don't question the sincerity of those \nwho are devoted to this. There are devotees to every program in \nStraight A's. I am certain that there are worthwhile qualities to most \nof those programs. But if the concept is we consolidate spending \nstreams, provide flexibility to the States and local school districts, \nin exchange for a guarantee that they are going to increase \nperformance, then we must set aside those very parochial, programmatic \nloyalties to say at least in these few States and few school districts \nwe will give them the opportunity to experiment and see if they have a \nbetter way.\n  I ask my colleagues to defeat the Dodd amendment, to preserve what is \nleft of the Straight A's Program in this demonstration, and allow those \nfew States and those few school districts that will be given an \nopportunity under the language in the bill to have a chance, given the \nnew flexibility they will have, to demonstrate that the reforms and the \nleadership they can provide at the local level will, in fact, reward \nthe children. That is where our great interest should be, not in \npreserving a program but in doing what is best for the children.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding the \ntime.\n  I believe these have been a very productive few weeks in the Senate. \nI am very proud of the institution and how, on a bipartisan basis, it \nhas put differences aside and found common ground in dealing with the \neducational problems of our country.\n  In adopting the Dodd amendment on title I, for the first time we are \nguaranteeing that poor school districts will receive 100 percent of \ntheir title I funding. What a remarkable statement by this institution.\n  Currently, there are districts in our country that are receiving a \nthird or a quarter of that to which they are entitled, imposing an \nenormous burden on local school districts.\n  We adopted the Harkin amendment to meet our Federal commitment to \nspecial education by guaranteeing $181 billion over the next 10 years. \nIn 1975, when IDEA was created, the Federal Government promised to pay \n40 percent of the special education needs. Last year, it paid 13 \npercent.\n  These are two remarkable positions by this institution in which every \nSenator should take great pride.\n  Blocking school voucher amendments stated our commitment to the \npublic school system on an uncompromised basis. In fact, we will be \nfunding reading programs at the $900 million level next year and voted \nto authorize $3 billion for professional development programs.\n  All of these things, including the President's proposal for \naccountability and testing and those programs Democrats have supported \nfor a long time, enhance the quality of performance and teaching.\n  With this amendment, Senator Dodd takes us into a new area, not \nsimply accountability, not only instruction, but the lives of the \nstudents themselves, recognizing that education involves all of these \naspects of a student's life, including the quality of their lives and \nwhat they do after school, recognizing it is all part of preparing a \nstudent for life.\n\n  That is why I support the Dodd amendment. That is why I believe this \nis not a matter of discretion for some people who believe they should \ndo it or should not do it. This is a national commitment to recognize \nthat education is a part of the entire student day. It may be a \nGovernor's responsibility. It may be a local school board's \nresponsibility. It is also our responsibility. This makes sense.\n  I know something about this subject. In the 1950s, it was unusual for \na young woman to work outside the home. In the community in which I \nlived in suburban New Jersey, I believe I may have been the only \nstudent who came home after school to an empty home, not simply because \nmy mother chose to work but because she had to work. I remember those \nhours. School let out at 2:30 p.m. or 3 p.m. My mother and father would \nwork until 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m., and for 3 and 4 hours sometimes I would \nsit in my home alone.\n  My community was without some of the temptations of modern life. I \nencountered few problems, but I remember that stage of life. That is \nwhy when police chiefs were asked, as Senator Dodd has demonstrated, \nwhat would you do to deal with school violence, the problems of \nstudents, 69 percent said exactly what Senator Dodd is doing: \nAfterschool programs.\n  We have done every one of these other things. Metal detectors in \nschools: We did that and should do that. One percent of police chiefs \nsaid that was the answer.\n  Hire more police officers: We did that for years and we should. That \nis 13 percent.\n  Try juveniles as adults: Many of our States have done that. The \nFederal Government is doing that. That is 17 percent.\n  The Senator from Arkansas said: Why don't we listen to those of our \nconstituents at other levels of government who have more experience? \nExactly, I say to the Senator.\n  Look at Senator Dodd's chart. Of the police chiefs involved in this \nevery day, 69 percent of them said afterschool programs. That is what \nwe are doing, and it is the right money in the right place.\n  What may have been unusual in my suburban community in New Jersey is \nnow common to millions of Americans. Twenty-eight million school age \nchildren have parents who work outside the home.\n  Maybe I was the only child in my town, but 15 million American \nchildren in the afternoon now return to an empty home, and my \ncolleagues know what that means. Juvenile crime peaks between the hours \nof 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. All of those police officers looking in the middle \nof the night for kids who are committing crimes, causing problems, are \nlooking at the wrong time. That is not the problem. It is after school: \nNo parents, no teachers, no supervision, no options. Senator Dodd is \noffering the option.\n  Violent crime: The greatest risk to our children being hurt \nthemselves is not in school. We are putting in metal detectors and \npolice officers. But it is after school: No options, no supervision. \nSenator Dodd has the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield me an additional 3 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, a few weeks ago we adopted the Boxer \namendment to authorize $2 billion for afterschool programs, but under \nthe current bill States can opt out of providing afterschool care for \nthose who need it. This is not something on which people should opt \nout, not recognize the problem. It is not a local problem; it is a \nnational problem.\n  There is not a study I have ever seen where it is not clear that not \nonly is\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nthis the source of juvenile violence, it is the principal time of the \nday and the time in life when young people experiment with narcotics. \nIt is a principal reason and a problem for teenage pregnancy.\n  Many things in America change. Some do not. Young people without \nsupervision and time on their hands are mischievous, are led to \ntemptations and wrong influences. This, I say to my colleagues, is an \nopportunity to address the problem, and the evidence could not be more \noverwhelming. A national study of five housing projects with \nafterschool programs and five without shows us the difference. Those \nwithout had 50 percent more vandalism and 30 percent more drug activity \nthan those with afterschool programs.\n  This Senate has met its responsibility with IDEA. We have taken a \nstand on special education. We are putting resources into reading. We \nhave answered the President's call for accountability and testing. We \nhave resisted abandonment of the public schools on school vouchers. \nEvery Member of the Senate can be proud of this education bill.\n  Senator Dodd now writes the last word, and what we did during the \nschool day we now provide for afterschool programs. I am proud of his \namendment, proud of Senator Dodd, and I urge my colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to support his amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he leaves, let me thank my \ncolleague from New Jersey. He always brings a new level of eloquence to \nany debate in which he is involved. While we all from time to time \nbring our own natural experiences to these discussions and debate, his \ndiscussion of growing up in New Jersey in the home where both his \nparents worked is certainly a poignant remainder of what happens today \nwith a lot of children throughout America.\n  There are 28 million children in 12 million families struggling to \nmake ends meet, and of that number a staggering number of these kids \nare home alone, or if not home, someplace else unsupervised. For those \nreasons, over 1,000 chiefs of police have written and beseeched in the \nstrongest language one can imagine that this amendment be adopted, \nalong with the 2,500 YMCAs across the country, an organization that has \nthe longest record in history in providing afterschool programs.\n  I underscore they did a survey on their own and the Senator from New \nJersey pointed it out, but I repeat it because their findings \ncorroborate what the Senator from New Jersey pointed out. Among the \nfindings, the survey showed that young people who do not participate in \nafterschool programs are five times more likely to be D students. So \nthere is an academic relationship here. They are twice as likely to get \ninto a fight at school and are far more likely to miss school than \nyoung people engaged in stimulating, productive activities in \nafterschool hours.\n  Every study and survey we have seen shows this. That is why the \nchiefs of police, who work with this problem every day, want this. If \nyou want to know what local people think, obviously, afterschool is \ndesired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. As we debate this issue, we understand the forces in \neducation that will fight for more money for special education. And \nthey should. I understand the constituency that wants school \nconstruction. I support that.\n  My concern is there is not a constituency, other than us, \nrepresenting the interests of law enforcement and our own experience \nwith these children who are fighting for money to deal with this \nviolence and afterschool activities. Senators, on a well-reasoned \nbasis, come to the floor and say, make this all discretionary; throw it \ninto a pot and let the States do what they want. But, I don't know who \nis coming to Trenton, to my State capital, to fight for afterschool \nprograms.\n  I know the people who want construction. I know the people who want \nmore teachers. I support them. But I don't know who is going there \nrepresenting the mothers and the fathers who are not home in the \nafternoon or the police chiefs who are concerned about drug use or \nteenage pregnancy. They only have us. That is why I am not for taking \naway anyone's discretion. I believe in the judgment of the State and \nlocal governments, but this is an instance where the Congress has to \ncompensate for the fact that we know from experience, we have looked at \nthe empirical data, and we have heard from the police chiefs, and we \nknow what is happening with the students on their performance when they \ndon't have afterschool programs. We know what happens with teenage \npregnancy and drug use. We know the evidence. This is a case where our \njudgment is required. That is why I think the amendment is so \nworthwhile.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for those comments.\n  I have heard this repeatedly over this debate in the last hour, that \nif this amendment is adopted, this destroys the straight A's program. \nThis amounts to 5.7 percent, according to the Congressional Research \nService, of the funding in the pilot Straight A's Program, title I, \nnon-title I funds under that title I program. Not 40 percent. To say \nyou cannot fund the block grant program with 94 percent of the money \ndoes not make any sense to me. Rather than stripping the program, we \nare taking the pilot program and setting aside afterschool in that \npilot program.\n\n  As we said earlier, we are talking about a program that includes 7 \nStates and 25 districts. It could be more than 7 States over the 7 \nyears of this entire bill. We don't debate this bill again for 7 years. \nObviously, for children who are starting elementary school, they will \nhave completed elementary school by the time we come back and revisit \nthe issue. To say in a pilot program we will block grant everything \nmade at the State level, and if a local school district wants to apply \nfor funds for afterschool, they will depend upon a State educational \nauthority or a Governor to say, yes or no, is totally up to the \ndiscretion of the State authority. There is no review process at all. \nThey can apply, and for whatever reason, they can say no.\n  Afterschool programs are the most highly sought after grants in the \nhistory of the Department of Education. This year alone there were \nalmost 3,000 applications. They are going up each year. We only grant \n300. There is only 1 chance in 10 of getting your grant approved. They \nare so popular because local community-based organizations see the \nvalue.\n  I am saying, keep the Straight A's Program. We will have the pilot \nprogram for the block grants. It will be there for the 7 States and 25 \ndistricts--or maybe more--to try over the next 7 years. Don't make \nafterschool become a jump ball in that regard.\n  What Straight A's is about is academic performance, trying to get \nbetter scores in math and reading. I don't argue that afterschool has \nsome relationship to academic performance, whether or not kids are in \ntrouble or not in trouble. This is primarily a safety issue. It is \nprimarily a crime issue, as the chiefs of police have pointed out in \noverwhelming numbers when they look at the difficulties kids get into \nand the time of day the difficulties occur. They state with \noverwhelming numbers it is between 3 in the afternoon and 6 or 7 at \nnight.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield. My colleague is a great champion for \nafterschool programs and has an amendment adopted, a sense of the \nSenate, saying we ought to do this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In fact, I decided not to do the sense of the Senate. We \ndid the real thing. This Senate voted with about 60 votes to increase \nthe funding for afterschool. We actually did a real amendment, not just \na sense of the Senate, and for the first time in history this Senate \nactually voted to increase the funding.\n  The reason I asked my friend to yield, if he would be willing to give \nme a minute of his time, I will pose a question. It has been a \nstruggle, as he knows, because he has led the fight. When I came here, \nI joined him in this fight. We knew it did not take rocket science to \nunderstand that our kids are getting into trouble after school. We now \nhave the exact percentages. That is why the police all over the \ncountry, as was pointed out, support this. We know it does help kids \nwith their academic performance, although that is not the main reason \nwe have afterschool. We know, as has been pointed\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nout, there is an overwhelming number of applications for these grants.\n  Now, finally, under President Clinton, we have seen this program go \nfrom $10 million to $600 million; and now with the amendment my friend \nhelped me with, it is over $1 billion, and we will be able to help \nmillions of kids.\n  My question is, On the one hand, how can we vote to support real \nfunding for this program and then turn around and vote to take it away \nand put it into some nebulous experiment which may turn out to be \ngreat--I have my problems with it--or may not?\n  By the way, John Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, my primary \ncosponsor, told a moving story about how he used to get in trouble as a \nkid. He had no place to go. He had a single mom.\n  We take this stand, make a wonderful statement, and put real dollars \nbehind it. Is it not the case we turn around and pull some of that \nmoney out; and isn't that just a contradiction in how we feel about \nafterschool?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for raising the point. It is a very \ngood point she raised.\n  Before my friend from California arrived, we heard our good friend \nfrom Tennessee talk about how much he supports, as most Members do, the \n21st Century Learning Centers. Senator Jeffords of Vermont is the \nprincipal author. I joined him with that several years ago. This is an \noverwhelmingly popular program at a local level. Now grant applications \nare made at a local level for funds which leverage, by the way, United \nWay, funds for nonprofits, churches and so forth. Without this seed \nmoney and what we do in the grants, it is difficult to get the other \norganizations to support it.\n  Now for those 7 States and 25 school districts, which, by the way, I \nhappen to believe are probably going to comprise a significant \npercentage of the 50 million kids who go to school each day, if you \ntake the 7 most populous States and 25 school districts, I can get you \nto over 50 percent of the student population of the country. I presume \nevery State is going to apply because what Governor--and I am looking \nat our Presiding Officer, who knows more about Governors, I suppose, \nthan either my good friend from California or I do--when States get a \nchance to get Federal money with no strings attached would not take \nthat deal. I presume every State will apply.\n  The Secretary of Education wants to get the maximum number of \nstudents under this pilot program. Obviously, they will choose one of \nthe largest States and largest school districts, which means for the \nnext 7 years we will take a significant percentage of kids into a pilot \nprogram, a demonstration program, and we will say that afterschool is \npart of that. We are not going to provide a separate pot of resources \nfor which localities can apply.\n  We are going to say, no, now as a locality if you are within those 7 \nStates or 25 districts, you have to go up to the State education \nauthority or the Governor, whichever it is, and they may or may not \naccept it. They can reject it out of hand. When you are competing for \nscarce dollars in poor areas, in many cases, of course, where the \nworking poor live, how well do they do in that competition? The \nPresiding Officer knows how difficult those decisions can be. Her late \nhusband was a great Governor of the State of Missouri. How difficult \nthose decisions may be.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator raises an important point. Now we have a \nsituation where, instead of being able to apply for these funds, these \nlocal school districts--and I thought my colleagues on the other side \nloved local control--now have to go through the States.\n  Am I correct, I ask my friend, this will take a piece off for \nadministration? In other words, if they decide to say to a local \ndistrict, OK, we will allow you to use some of this, they are going to \ntake some money off the top. This is inefficient.\n  I say to some colleagues who may be listening from their offices--\nmaybe a few are--if you are a fan of afterschool programs, if you think \nthey are important, if you think they are a silver bullet that we have \nto keep our kids out of trouble, don't disrupt this program just when \nit is starting to reach kids. You have not done it with Head Start. You \nshould not do it with afterschool.\n  Isn't this a point that should be considered that the State will pull \nsome money off the top for administration whereas under our normal \nprogram the money goes straight to the local districts?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. Again, here it is not a question of sort \nof dumping the money out there. Localities have to apply for it. You \nhave to ask for it. If you ask for it, there is only a small chance you \nmay actually get it.\n  I would like to see us put in more resources. As my colleague from \nCalifornia points out, this program started as a $10 million program, \nbut because of local mayors and county executives, the YMCAs, the Boys \nand Girls Clubs, the church-based organizations, the police, they said: \nLook, this works so well, we went from $10 million to $600 million. We \nare flattening that line out, and for 25 States and 7 districts we are \ndumping it all out on a roulette wheel.\n  All I am saying is, in those pilot areas, carve this one out and let \nthe localities apply directly. It reduces the amount of money in the \npilot program by 5.7 percent. That is all.\n  Those are not my numbers, those are numbers determined by the \nCongressional Research Service, a nonpartisan organization that makes \nthose calculations.\n  So on the notion somehow that I am destroying the Straight A's \nProgram, I am destroying this delicately balanced coalition here, I \nmerely point out: I do not think 1,000 police chiefs, I don't think \n2,500 YMCAs, I do not think Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs all across \nAmerica are in the business of destroying here.\n  I am looking at my good friend from Ohio over here, with whom I \ndrafted Safe and Drug Free Schools. He knows the numbers I put up; 70 \npercent of the police chiefs say this works. As the Senator from New \nJersey pointed out, we have done metal detectors, hiring more police, \ntrying juveniles as adults in some areas--that is controversial--but in \nthese 7 States and 25 districts we are reducing the number by 5.7 \npercent. That is not gutting Straight A's, that is just saying don't \ndeprive these local communities for the next 7 years of the opportunity \nto do something that every community in this country believes has great \nvalue.\n\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I have a lot of time here. I reserve those 30 seconds for \nclosing argument, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me talk for a moment, if I may, \nabout a part of the bill that is not very controversial but I think is \nvery significant. It is that part of the bill that Senator Dodd just \nmentioned, and that is the drug-free school component of the bill.\n  Let me congratulate Senator Dodd. I really enjoyed working with him, \nwith his team, to get language in this bill that will really improve \nthe current Drug Free Schools Program. I believe we have done that. I \nsalute him for that very excellent work. I also thank Senator Murray \nand Senator Grassley for their work on this language as well.\n  I think we all understand when we talk about our drug problem, we \nhave to have a coordinated, consistent, and a balanced approach. A \nbalanced approach means drug treatment, drug education, prevention. It \nmeans international interdiction of drugs. It also means domestic law \nenforcement. Those are the four basic components. We have to do them \nall. We have to consistently do them all.\n  The drug-free schools provision in this bill and the money it \nrepresents is really virtually the only thing the Federal Government \ndoes in the area of education.\n  This bill authorizes $925 million which will go down to the local \nschool districts across this country. The current Drug Free Schools \nProgram is in virtually every school district in the country. \nInterestingly and sadly, in many school districts it is the only\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nmoney that is being spent on drug education. So it is important to do \nwhat we have done in this bill, and that is continue the program. But \nit is also important to improve the program.\n  I had the opportunity, when I was in the House of Representatives \nover a decade ago, to serve on the National Commission on Drug Free \nSchools. We issued a report in 1990. We talked about how this program \nneeded to be improved. Some improvements have been made in the last \ndecade, but unfortunately not all the recommendations have been \nfollowed.\n\n  What we do with the language in this bill is take that decade-old \nreport and, frankly, bring it to life, use some of the recommendations, \nand improve the current law. One thing we determined at that time was \nif antidrug efforts in our schools are to be effective at all, they \nmust be coordinated, they must be consistent, and they must be \ncommunity oriented. We recommended a number of things including the \nfollowing four items:\n  No. 1, every school district should develop and conduct drug \neradication and prevention programs for all students from kindergarten \nthrough grade 12, every single year.\n  No. 2, parent and community groups should take a more active role in \ndeveloping and selecting drug prevention programs.\n  No. 3, the Department of Education should ensure that schools conduct \nperiodic evaluations of all drug education and prevention programs.\n  No. 4, Federal and State governments should fund only those education \nand prevention program efforts that are likely to be effective. There \nshould be scientific data behind the decision to use a particular \nprogram.\n  The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program that is contained in this bill \nincorporates these recommendations. This program helps prevent our \nchildren from ever becoming involved with drugs and supports efforts to \ncreate violence-free learning environments.\n  The language we have written into the education bill that is before \nus today further improves this program. It gives States greater \nflexibility to target assistance to schools in need, and it increases \naccountability measures to ensure that this assistance actually goes \ntowards programs that really work.\n  Furthermore, the language we have written in the bill would improve \ncoordination of Safe and Drug Free Schools Programs with other \ncommunity-based antidrug programs by requiring schools to work directly \nwith parents, with local law enforcement agencies, with local \ngovernment agencies, with faith-based organizations, and other \ncommunity groups in the development and implementation of antidrug and \nviolence strategies. That community coordination is absolutely \nessential. It has, tragically and unfortunately, in the past, sometimes \nbeen missing from local communities. This bill says we have to have \nthat coordination.\n  Drug abuse and violence against young people is a community problem, \na national problem. It requires a community-based solution. That is why \nwe need the entire community to be involved in the creation and in the \nexecution of programs to fight youth drug abuse and violence.\n  Our language would allow afterschool programs to apply for Safe and \nDrug Free School grants as long as they meet the same standards as any \nother applicant. If afterschool programs use research-based drug and \nviolence prevention programs, and if they prove they reduce drug and \nviolence in schools, then they will have fair access to Safe and Drug \nFree School funding.\n  I really cannot talk about the Safe and Drug Free Schools Programs \nwithout mentioning one of the most tough and effective fighters against \nyouth drug abuse and school violence, and that is the first lady of my \nhome State of Ohio, Hope Taft. Hope Taft has dedicated years of her \nlife to help make our schools safer and drug free, and she was \ninstrumental in the development of this language that is in front of us \ntoday, language we have written into the education bill. She is really \nthe voice for community-based organizations. I commend her for the \ngreat contribution she made to this bill. Through her efforts, she has \nraised awareness of the dangers of youth drug abuse and violence in our \nschools.\n  Let me also applaud President Bush for his support of this program. \nDuring the campaign, President Bush promised to increase funding for \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools Program by over $100 million over 5 \nyears. I commend him for that commitment. It is truly the kind of \ncommitment we need to continue to improve this very vital program.\n  The Safe and Drug Free Schools program is a critical part of \nrestoring effectiveness and balance in our national drug policy. And \nultimately, if we don't restore effectiveness, more and more children \nwill use drugs, leading to greater levels of violence, criminal \nactivity, and delinquency. Unless we take action--unless we take the \nnecessary steps to reverse these disturbing trends--we will be \nsacrificing today's youth and our country's future.\n  Quite frankly, children simply cannot learn when they are under the \ninfluence of drugs or alcohol. Children cannot learn when they more \nworried about their safety than their homework. Children cannot learn \nwhen they are scared. That's why we must ensure that children and the \nadults who work in our schools are safe--that they are free from drugs \nand violence.\n  As we continue to debate education reforms in this nation, we need to \nremember that improvements to our school buildings, increased \nprofessional development efforts for our teachers and administrators, \nand changes in education policies will not help our young people \nrealize their true potential as long as drugs and violence are in their \nschools. It's that simple.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Ohio. He no \nlonger serves on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \nBut he did serve on it. I have enjoyed my work in the Senate over the \nyears, but never as much as I have enjoyed working with the Senator \nfrom Ohio on a number of different issues, and this one in particular \nwhich he just addressed, and that is the problem of substance abuse and \nchildren.\n  We managed to put together a pretty good bill a few years ago on safe \nand drug free schools, largely because of the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Ohio. I commend him publicly for his present work and over the \nyears. He brings a lot of personal experience as well. He has a pretty \ngood size clan in his own right. I think it is almost a baseball team.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We are one short of a baseball team.\n  Mr. DODD. He brings a great deal of passion and understanding. So \nmuch of what he is talking about bears directly on the subject matter \nto which he has dedicated a good part of his service. I thank him for \nit and look forward to working with him in the future.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague. Again, I compliment him for the \ngreat deal of work he did. It was a great pleasure to work with him and \nhis staff. I think the language in the bill improves the current law \nand is a significant improvement. I think it is going to make a \ndifference. I appreciate his great work.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, my time has about expired. I wonder if my \nfriend from New Hampshire will offer to yield me time, and I ask \nunanimous consent that just prior to the vote, which I think is going \nto occur around 2 o'clock, that I be given a couple of minutes to make \na final summation of my argument.\n  Mr. GREGG. Two minutes on both sides.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I withhold that for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I have listened with interest and have \nbeen impressed by the enthusiasm, energy, and commitment of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut to the 21st century program, which is something I \nstrongly support myself. In fact, during my prior life when I was \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee on Commerce, State, Justice \nand working with Senator Hollings, we essentially funded what amounted \nto the afterschool program initiatives in different areas, especially \nin the Boys and Girls Clubs and programs with Big Brothers and Big \nSisters.\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n  I was able to put into this bill language which I am very excited \nabout because I think it will significantly improve the 21st century \nprogram, which allows community-based organizations to participate in \nthe program for the first time, instead of having programs which are \ntotally managed by the local educational organization. The schools \nbasically weren't working all that well, quite honestly, in many areas \nbecause basically at the end of the schoolday, teachers were tired, and \ndeveloping programs that kept teachers around the school building after \nthe schoolday was hard to do, and understandably so.\n  Now we are going to infuse the afterschool programs with community-\nbased organizations. Some of them can be faith-based organizations, \nwhich is very exciting. You will get, I am sure, Boys and Girls Clubs, \nand again Big Brothers and Big Sisters, that will actually physically \nbe on site for the afterschool programs.\n\n  There is a major educational component in that amendment which was \nadopted in committee. I think you will also get groups such as the CYO \nthat might be involved in things like this, or other faith-based groups \nthat basically won't be in the school teaching religious values--that \nwould be inappropriate--but will be in the school teaching life-needed \nskills or organizing sports programs perhaps in the school period.\n  After-the-schoolday is something I have worked very hard on as a \nMember of the Senate on the committee and admire and appreciate the \ncommitment of the Senator from Connecticut to the after-the-schoolday \nprograms. We all understand that the period from 3 to 6 is a period \nwhere youth are at risk, unfortunately, in many of our communities. And \nfor them to have some place constructive to go is very important.\n  This amendment doesn't really address that issue because, in my \nhumble opinion, this amendment goes to the question of management. Who \nmakes the decision as to how the after-the-schoolday is controlled, \nwhether it is going to be a categorical program coming from the Federal \nGovernment that says you must have an afterschool program or the \nalternative, which I think makes much more sense--whether a State or a \ncommunity decides to take all the educational formula funding programs, \nmerge them together, and set them up as a program, the purpose of which \nis to make sure the children participating in those programs actually \nexceed the academic success of the children who are not in those \nprograms.\n  As a result, we get a better return for the dollars spent in these \nvarious areas. We get better students who are better prepared for life. \nWe get students who are coming through the school year with a better \nacademic achievement level.\n  That should be, of course, our goal in this bill. It is the goal of \nthe Straight A's Program.\n  The question as to how the day is structured would be left at the \nlocal community level, or the State level, and wouldn't be directed \nfrom within the Federal Government.\n  This is the difference. It is not a question of whether there will be \nan afterschool program. It is a question of who will make the decision \nas to how funds are allocated within the formula grant program for \ndesigning the afterschool program and the schoolday program.\n  To step back, I think it is important to understand the basic concept \nof Straight A's. The concept of Straight A's is that we give the local \nschool districts and the States, or those who wish to apply anyway, the \nopportunity--it is only a limited number--to set up a program where \nthey actually commit that the low-income child will do better--this is \nthe important point--than the other children in the school district in \nacademic achievement, and, therefore, getting prepared for life and \nbeing competitive in our society and having a chance to participate in \nthe American dream.\n  In exchange for making that commitment to the kids who are from low-\nincome families to actually exceed the average yearly progress in the \ncommunity generally for students, we will allow the local school \ndistricts and the States to design the program free of stress on the \ninput side.\n  The 21st century program, along with the other 16 formula programs \nthat are put into this proposal for the development of Straight A's, \nare all strong, oriented programs. It has significant restrictions. \nThey are very categorical and very directive. They are very top-down \ncommand and control programs. They all have specific purposes, but the \nfundamental goal of all of them is to get a child up to speed \nacademically and at a level where they are actually going to be \nconstructive and productive citizens in our society.\n\n  We have said, with the Straight A's experiment--in a few States; in a \nvery few States, potentially 7 States and 25 school districts--let's \ntry an experiment. Let's say to the local communities, rather than \nhaving the top-down command and control, the traditional Federal \ncontrol of strings-attached dollars, we will take all those dollars, \nput them in a basket and give them to the local communities, but the \ncondition of you taking those dollars is that you are going to have to \ncommit to prove that the children those dollars are directed towards \nare going to do better than the other children in the community.\n  So it is not as if the States and the local school districts are \ngetting some huge influx of dollars with no restrictions or no \nresponsibilities. The responsibility is even greater, but it is at the \nend of the system versus at the beginning. Instead of saying how they \nwill do it, we expect results; and then we are going to test them to \nmake sure those results are actually being achieved.\n  It is a very creative approach. It really is part of the essence of \nthe underlying agreement and bill which we negotiated and which was the \nresult of the impetus that came from the President. The President's \nconcept on education is really pretty simple. It is that we should \nfocus on the child, and that we should expect the child to obtain \nacademic achievement, and that we should do that by giving flexibility \nto the local school districts; in exchange for the flexibility, we are \ngoing to have strict accountability to see that the children have \nattained academic achievement.\n  So the concept is to create an initiative and demonstration programs \nwhich will, at least with these 16 categorical programs, put them in a \nbasket and give those dollars to the States with great flexibility, or \ngive those dollars to the communities with great flexibility, but in \nexchange expect academic achievement subject to strict accountability, \nfocused on the child.\n  This program, this Straight A's Program, meets all the conditions and \nall the ideas that have been put forward by the President as one of the \nkey purposes of his educational initiatives. That is why there is such \nan intense discussion about it today.\n  If you listen to the Senator from Connecticut, you obviously have to \nbe drawn to his ability to present his case well, but the point is, if \nwe go back to the approach offered by the Senator from Connecticut, \nthen we will have fundamentally undermined what is one of the primary \nthrusts of the President's initiatives in trying to break out of this \nmold into which we have put education for the last 25 years, where for \ngeneration after generation we have seen low-income kids being left \nbehind, which isn't acceptable.\n  So the President has come up with this idea. Actually, it is an idea \nthat was developed by the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, a couple \nof years ago. The President adopted it. He has taken this idea and put \nit into his package. That is why it is so critical that this amendment \nbe defeated. Because if it is adopted, it basically takes the heart out \nof the Straight A's Program and as a result undermines one of the key \nthrusts of the President's initiatives to try to bring low-income kids \nnot only up to speed but, in this case, actually putting them ahead of \ntheir peers in education.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada is trying to get my attention. \nObviously, he wishes to make a point. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire yielding for a \nbrief unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 518, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n518, as modified, and previously agreed to, be further modified with \nthe language at the desk.\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 5126J. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     chapter $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent \n     fiscal year.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the consent \nwith respect to the Dodd amendment be modified to provide that the vote \nin relation to the Dodd amendment occur upon disposition of the \nCantwell amendment No. 630, provided that the previous consent with \nrespect to the Nelson amendment No. 533, and other amendments within \nthat consent agreement, reflect this change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to clarify for Members exactly where we are \nnow, the Senate will debate the other amendments in a previous order, \nand the Senate will vote in relation to the Dodd amendment at about \n2:15.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that, prior to the \nvote on the Dodd amendment, the Senator from New Hampshire be \nrecognized for 2 minutes and the Senator from Connecticut be recognized \nfor 2 minutes in the appropriate order. Senator Dodd would go last. \nThat vote would occur at about 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to ask the Senate's \nsupport for the Mentoring for Success Act, the amendment that is before \nthe Senate today.\n  This amendment concerns the welfare of our Nation's most precious \nasset, our children. Children comprise only 20 percent of our \npopulation, but they are 100 percent of our future. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will carefully consider their significance. This amendment \ngives us the opportunity to support our children and the future of our \ncountry at the same time.\n  The environment in which many of our children are raised looks \nnothing like the one in which I and many of my colleagues grew up. \nClose to 50 percent of our children are raised in single-parent \nhouseholds. In most cases, single parents work long hours. Their energy \nand resources are stretched thin. While there are many successful \nsingle parents, there are some cases where a single parent simply \ncannot and does not, for a variety of reasons, adequately serve as the \nrole model a child might need. As a consequence, many of these children \nreplace that void with drugs, alcohol, and violence. Other children who \nmay not come from single families are faced with a home life that may \nbe particularly difficult because of an abusive parent or maybe a \nparent incapacitated due to illness. This amendment is for these \nchildren.\n  Of course, it can't fix family problems or bring broken families back \ntogether, but it can help change these children's lives and brighten \ntheir future.\n  I am proud to say that this amendment is inspired by the success of a \nmentoring program in my State which was originally started by \nCongressman Tom Osborne, the sponsor of companion legislation adopted \nby the House.\n  As many know, before my friend and fellow Nebraskan Tom Osborne \nbecame a Congressman this last year, he was coach of the beloved \nUniversity of Nebraska Huskers football team. This man knows a thing or \ntwo about winning strategies and how to implement them, not just on the \nfield but in the community as well.\n  In 1991, he and his wife Nancy began the Team Mates Program in \nLincoln, NE, which paired members of the University of Nebraska \nfootball team with middle school students. He had such great success \nwith the program that he expanded it across the State of Nebraska in \n1998. I was proud to assist him in that effort as Governor at that \ntime, and I joined the Team Mates board of directors so I could \ncontinue my involvement with such an effective and important mission.\n  Now Congressman Osborne has taken his experience and turned it into \nworthwhile legislation. This amendment would authorize $50 million for \na new competitive grant program to award local school districts, \ncommunity-based organizations, or a partnership between the two to find \nmentoring initiatives. Each State would receive\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nat least one grant under this program. I am pleased to be here today \nand to continue my support for mentoring programs.\n  Mentoring programs funded by grants made available through this \nlegislation would pair children with role models who could provide \nstable emotional support, academic assistance, and exposure to positive \nexperiences that they may not otherwise receive.\n  The mentors are not parental replacements. Rather, they are helping \nhands who offer a glimmer of hope to kids who are forced, through no \nfault of their own, to contend with tough situations and bleak \nprospects.\n  Priority would be given to programs that serve children with the \ngreatest need in rural areas, high crime areas, or troubled home or \nschool environments, and only programs that require thorough background \nscreening of participating adults would be eligible to receive funding.\n  Mentoring for Success is intended to provide guidance to children in \nneed, to promote personal and social responsibility, to improve \nacademic achievement, to discourage use of illegal drugs, alcohol, \nviolence, gang involvement, or other harmful behavior, and to encourage \nchildren to set goals for themselves, including postsecondary training \nor education.\n  Young people today are confronted on a daily basis with situations \nthat my generation simply didn't know could exist. I was fortunate \nenough to be raised in a loving and caring household. My generation \nneeded support, encouragement, and stability. Today our kids need it, \ntoo. That is one thing that simply has not changed. Mentors can provide \nthat support. I know it works. It has in Nebraska. I am convinced that \nMentoring for Success will prove it will work everywhere.\n  What began as a spark in Nebraska has the potential to become a flame \nof optimism for at-risk children all across the country. I am proud \ntoday to be able to convey that this measure will in fact help our \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I thank the good Senator for bringing this issue to our attention. I \nmight mention, I was with their superintendent of schools in Boston a \nweek ago during our break, Tom Payzant. He was talking about eight \nkinds of mentors working in schools there and the positive impact they \nare having in terms of the discipline in the schools and helping to \nresolve some of the tensions in the schools.\n  He said that 10 years ago he never would have thought this kind of \nneed would be there, but it is there. He said he could use eight more \nvery quickly and easily. It is a good idea. It is a good suggestion. \nObviously, it will be voluntary. Communities will have to apply but it \nis another way of trying to help resolve some of the tensions that \nexist in many of the schools and provide a safer environment. There are \na lot of different ways of trying to do it. This is a very positive and \nconstructive way.\n  We welcome the amendment and urge the passage of it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 533), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the bipartisan leadership that has brought this \neducation bill to us in a most timely manner, at a most important time \nin the history of public education in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, was to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has spoken to me \nfor 2 days about being able to address the Senate on the importance of \neducation. I mentioned that during the lunch hour there is not as much \nof a clamor for floor time. He has a short speech. Would it be \nagreeable to my colleague from Massachusetts if he is able to complete \nhis statement for a brief time, 4 or 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection if the definition of ``brief'' is 4 or \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida may continue.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank both of the Senators from \nMassachusetts. Indeed, as a new Senator, I am learning that the \ndefinition of ``brief'' is generally not understood in this Chamber. \nYet I will adhere to the common understanding in Webster's Dictionary \nof the term ``brief'' and keep it to less than 5 minutes. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  As a product of public education, I am very privileged to be a part \nof the debate and what I think is going to be part of the solution. One \nof the major components of the future quality of that is now being \nconsidered before this body. This legislation that we are now \nconsidering marks a victory for many and, most especially, for the \nAmerican people who have overwhelmingly said that the education of \ntheir children is their No. 1 priority.\n  I have been guided through this debate by the experiences that I \nbring to this Chamber by my own educational upbringing, and what I \nexperienced in the public schools of Brevard County, FL, was due in \nlarge part to having highly qualified teachers.\n  Who among us does not have some significant life-changing or life-\nsteering experience by the interaction with a quality teacher? Those \nteachers, in my case, were in schools that were in good repair and in \nan environment that was conducive to learning. So during debate on this \nbill many of us have pushed for those same goals--reducing class size \nby putting more teachers in our classrooms, funding to help build and \nrepair our schools, accountability to monitor the progress of each of \nour schools, and accountability to monitor the progress of every child \nin those schools.\n  Those principles have been incorporated in the many amendments that \nhave now strengthened this bill, such as increased funding to put a \nhighly qualified teacher in every classroom and to support teacher \nrecruitment; full funding for special education; full funding for title \nI for disadvantaged students; modernization of school libraries; and \nalso targeting of funds to low-income children. Another example of \nan amendment that we have is an incentive for schools to adopt high-\nquality assessments to chart student progress.\n\n  Today, in this country, some 90 percent of our children attend public \nschools. To continue that strong and important legacy of our public \nschools, and now to strengthen them for the many challenges ahead, we \nmust ensure that our public schools are safe and conducive to learning \nfor all students from all walks of life.\n  I believe this bill creates a framework through which we can reach \nevery student, be it an inner-city student, a rural student, a \nphysically challenged student, a low-income student, a suburban \nstudent, or a learning impaired student.\n  Our goal is to provide each of those students with the opportunity to \nachieve. In the end, reaching every student and improving every school \nis our goal, and I believe this bill is a step in the right direction--\nan important step.\n  But as we complete action on this bill, we must ensure that our \ncommitment to better education is backed by the appropriations needed \nto make it happen. That part of the debate won't end this week, or even \nthis year. So at every step of the way I intend to stand up for the \nFederal assistance needed to ensure a high-quality education for all of \nour children.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to share my heart on this \nsubject that is of most importance to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a second, I thank the good \nSenator for his comments. Senator Nelson has been very much involved in \nthe debate on education and has taken a great interest. We have \nbenefited from this involvement. We welcome his continued ideas and \nrecommendations, and we hope he will be even more active as we are \ndealing with additional educational issues. I am very grateful to him \nfor all his good work and for his\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nexcellent statement. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 423 and 455 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me begin by expressing not just my \ngratitude, but the gratitude of everybody in the Senate who understands \nthe dynamics of this process, and to my senior colleague from \nMassachusetts; there is no stronger, more forceful, more committed \nadvocate for the schools of our country than my colleague, Ted Kennedy. \nI think his work in leading this for weeks now on the floor will speak \nfor itself in the end when we will pass a bill that this country will \nbe proud of--providing, of course, that we ultimately provide the \nresources necessary to empower this framework to take hold. I salute my \ncolleague for his leadership and thank him for what he has been doing.\n  I also thank my friend from Florida for his gracious comments and for \nhis strict adherence to the common understanding of Webster's \nDictionary.\n  These are two amendments which I have offered today with my good \nfriend from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith. One deals with the quality \nand supply of our Nation's principals, and one deals with the provision \nof alternative educational opportunities for chronically violent and \ndisruptive students.\n  I am pleased to have Senator Carper, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, \nand Senator Levin joining us as original cosponsors of the principals \namendment.\n  The fact is very straightforward. In the next year, we are going to \nbe faced with a leadership crisis in our schools. Many of today's \nprincipals are reaching the age of retirement, and there is clear \nevidence that reveals a decline in the number of candidates for each \nopening. For example, by the end of this school year, more than 400 New \nYork City principals will have retired. In Washington State, nearly 300 \nprincipals, or 15 percent of the total, left their jobs at the end of \nthe last school year. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas is \nabout to face the greatest shortage of principals it has ever \nencountered, with some studies predicting a 50-percent turnover rate \namong the State's 8,500 principals and assistant principals within the \nnext 10 years.\n  Schools all over the country are faced with the question of who will \nreplace these retiring principals, who will provide the critical \nleadership for our educational system.\n  Qualified candidates are becoming increasingly hard to find. In the \n1998 survey of school districts, half of the districts reported a \nshortage of qualified candidates. The attrition rate for elementary \nschool principals now stands at 42 percent for the decade from 1988 to \n1998, and it is expected to remain at least as high through this \ndecade.\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n  Indeed, some predictions are it could reach as high as 60 percent as \nprincipals of the baby boom generation reach retirement age.\n  This is happening at a time when the U.S. Department of Labor \nestimates that the need for principals in our country will grow with \nrising school enrollments through at least 2005. If we do not stem the \nflow of retirees and buoy up the number of aspiring principals, we will \nface a critical school leadership crisis, one that could debilitate any \nof the other reform efforts we are making today.\n  Not only, however, is the supply of principals vital to the success \nof education reform, but obviously the quality of our principals is \nalso critical. A good principal can create the climate that fosters \nexcellence in teaching and learning while an ineffective one can \nquickly thwart the progress of the most dedicated reformers.\n  I think any of us who has been to any school in this country, \nparticularly when we walk into a blue ribbon school, we will \nacknowledge that if the school is working, if the school is \nparticularly a blue ribbon school, that school has a blue ribbon \nprincipal.\n  Every school in this country that works begins with the leadership in \nthe school itself. Without a good leader, it is hard to instigate or \nsustain any meaningful change, and schools will not be transformed, \nrestructured, or reconstituted absent that leadership.\n  Education reform policies, such as the ones we hope will be \ninstituted as a result of the BEST Act, are meaningless without strong \nleadership to implement them in school. Today we all know principals \nface a whole different set of challenges than their predecessors. One \nof the greatest challenges is providing a positive learning environment \nfor a highly diverse student population. By the middle of the new \ncentury, more than half of the population will be made up of those \nwhose families originated in Africa, Asia, or Latin America.\n  Principals will certainly need to understand and be prepared to \nintegrate into their schools a new generation of sophisticated \ntechnology which, in turn, will require them to place a high priority \non staff development for teachers and for themselves. I do not believe \nit is possible to underestimate the impact technology will continue to \nhave on teaching and administration.\n  Increased responsibilities without increased support will continue to \nhamper school districts' abilities to attract qualified principals. It \nis another reason the resource issue is so critical ultimately to the \nsuccess of the legislation we will pass.\n  The amendment the Senator from Oregon and I are offering addresses \nthis critical problem by giving States greater flexibility in the use \nof their title II dollars so that funding can be used to retain high-\nquality principals and improve principal quality.\n  I point out that with respect to the second amendment we are \noffering, Senator Smith and I and others share a twofold concern. The \nquality of teaching and learning suffers significantly when one or two \ndisruptive students or violent students monopolize a classroom and the \nattention of a teacher, and that violent and disruptive student is \noften in desperate need of services, supports, and greater levels of \nattention than are provided in the traditional classroom.\n\n  We have a choice: We can either deal with the problems of these young \npeople while they are in school, while we know where to find them, \nwhile we have them under our control, while we have the opportunity to \nprovide them services, or we can wait for them to drop out or turn to \nthe streets or encounter them later in the juvenile justice system of \nthe country.\n  The intent of this amendment is to ensure that our classrooms are \nsafe, drug free, and that all students are provided with a meaningful \nopportunity to learn.\n  The amendment we are offering amends the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nProgram and expands its purpose to include the provision of alternative \neducation opportunities. This amendment will allow the list of \nallowable Federal, State, and local uses of funds under the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools Program to include the option of providing \nalternative education, supports to chronically disruptive, drug \nabusing, and violent students.\n  One option to ensure that classrooms and schools are safe and \nmanageable has been to require removal of disruptive and dangerous \nstudents. Typically this is accomplished through expulsions and long-\nterm suspensions. However, while expelling and suspending may make \nschools safer and more manageable, students' problems do not go away \nwhen they are removed from the classroom--the problems just go \nsomewhere else.\n  School districts across the country report experiencing significant \nincreases in both the number of students expelled and the length of \ntime they are excluded from their schools. The consensus among \neducators and others concerned with at-risk youth is that it is vital \nfor expelled students to receive educational counseling or other \nservices to help modify their behavior while they are away from school.\n  Without such services, students generally return to school no better \ndisciplined and no better able to manage their anger or peaceably \nresolve disputes. They will also have fallen behind in their education, \nand any underlying causes of their violent behavior may be unresolved. \nResearch has shown a link between suspension/expulsion and later \ndropping out of school, with resulting personal and social costs.\n  Alternative education works. My home State of Massachusetts has some \nexcellent alternative education programs. The superintendent of the \nBoston Public Schools created an Alternative Education Task Force in \nOcteober, 1998. A recent report of this Task Force found that \nalternative education programs have helped to reduce the dropout rate \nboth in Boston Public Schools and in other community-based programs.\n  One Boston Public Schools alternative education program, the \nCommunity Academy, has been recognized by the U.S. Department of \nEducation as one of the top nine exemplary programs in the country. The \nstudents enrolled in the Community Academy are from grades 6-12 and are \nreferred by principals, guidance counselors, and parents. The Community \nAcademy's small, highly structured and closely monitored program \nprovides a setting where these students can receive the attention and \nservices they need to get their lives on track and enable them to focus \non learning. All students of Community Academy are monitored through \nintervention stragtegies by the program's staff, including case \nmanagers, clinicians, instructors, and parents.\n  The school system in Springfield, MA, has established six alternative \nschools. And since they began their alternative sites, the dropout rate \nin Springfield has declined from 11.8 percent to 4.9 percent. The \nsuperintendent of the Springfield schools made a commitment that all \nstudents in Springfield will receive an education, including suspended \nor expelled students, he has stood by that commitment, and in \nSpringfield they are seeing real results.\n\n  An example of alternative education is Springfield Academy, \nSpringfield, MA. The principal is Alex Gillat.\n  Gertrude is a teenager who does not have contact with her parents and \nresides with her older sister and two younger siblings. While enrolled \nin a local high school, Gertrude had many difficulties both in and out \nof school and ultimately was expelled because she attacked another \nstudent with a hammer. Gertrude spent a little over a year at the \nSpringfield Academy. I am very happy to report that Gertrude graduated \nlast year and is currently enrolled in a university. She is supported \nin her studies by a number of scholarships.\n  Daniev came from a family with a history of drug abuse. His father \ndied of a heroin overdose and he too became a heavy user of drugs and \nalcohol. Chronically truant, Daniev one day witnessed a friend get \nkilled as they walked along the railroad tracks in Springfield. After \nthat incident, Daniev suffered post traumatic stress disorder. Around \nthis time, Daniev was enrolled at Springfield Academy. With the aid of \nthe staff, counselors, and a Navy recruiter, Daniev quit using drugs \nand alcohol, successfully completed high school, and is now enlisted in \nthe Navy.\n  Another example is Bridge Academy, Springfield, MA. The principal is \nAllen Menkell.\n  Cyrus is a senior in high school and is literally on the cusp of \ngraduation, but Cyrus almost didn't make it. In addition to problems \nwith substance\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nabuse, Cyrus' father passed away, and soon thereafter, his younger \nbrother died of leukemia. Cyrus was about to drop out of his ``last \nchance school,'' but teachers at Bridge Academy rallied around him, and \nhelped him to see how much he had accomplished. Cyrus will graduate \nthis month, and may go on to community college.\n  It is shocking to think where these young people would be without the \nopportunities that alternative schools like those in Springfield and \nBoston provided them with. But what is all too common is that these \nalternative learning environments do not exist. What is all too common \nis that these young people would not have anywhere to turn.\n  I call attention to the fact that the superintendent of Boston Public \nSchools created an alternative education task force in October of 1998. \nA recent report of the task force found it has helped reduce the \ndropout rate both in the Boston public schools and in other community-\nbased programs.\n  One alternative program has been recognized by the Department of \nEducation as one of the exemplary programs in the country.\n  In addition, in Springfield, MA, they have established six \nalternative schools, and since they began their alternative sites, the \ndropout rate in Springfield has declined from 11.8 percent to 4.9 \npercent.\n  An alternative education opportunity makes a difference--a difference \nto the child who needs it and a difference to the children who are \noften trapped in a classroom that will not work because of the \ndisruptive student.\n  I urge my colleagues to embrace both of these amendments as \nsupportive of the intentions and goals of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. May I have 8 of those 19 seconds?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for an additional minute for my colleague. I \napologize.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am grateful to both Senators.\n  Senator Kerry offered two wonderful amendments. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of both of them. I thank him for his leadership.\n  We have spent a fair amount of time talking about academic standards \nwe have set in our schools and other States have set in their schools. \nWe have spent a fair amount of time acknowledging tests are being taken \nto measure student progress and we need to hold folks accountable--\nschools, school districts, and teachers.\n  It has been acknowledged again and again how important having a good \nteacher in a classroom is to enable all students to reach the standards \nthat are being set in their respective States.\n  Professional development of teachers is critical in my State of \nDelaware, obviously Massachusetts, and other places. Senator Kerry put \nhis finger on it. It is not enough just to work on the professional \ndevelopment of the teachers or to make sure we have teachers who know \ntheir business, know their stuff, love to teach, love kids in our \nclassrooms, but it is critically important that the men and women \nleading those schools, the principals and assistant principals, learn \nhow to do their jobs well.\n  One of the toughest jobs going these days is not as a Member of the \nSenate, not even President of the United States. I think one of the \ntoughest jobs in America today is trying to be principal of a school \nand run the school with all of its challenges--the kids, the \ncurriculum, Federal and State regulations coming at them, dealing with \nthe parents, many of whom are not present in the lives of their \nchildren, passing referendums. It is a tough job.\n  The idea that we acknowledge not just that it is a tough job but say \nto States, you can use some of this Federal money to make sure more of \nthe people leading our schools know how to do their tough job well, is \njust a wonderful step we are taking.\n  The second thing I want to say with respect to funding, providing the \npossibility for Federal funds for alternative schools for chronically \ndisruptive students, is that every child can learn. Children who are \nchronically disruptive came to school behind, started behind, and fell \nfurther behind. In many cases they did not have parents engaged in \ntheir lives and may not have had the right teachers. Even those kids \ncan learn. They may need to be in a classroom other than the one they \nare sitting in today or this year. They may need to be in a different \nschool, but they can learn in a different school. If we include in the \nalternative for disruptive students trained educators and leaders who \nknow how to work with those students who come from tough backgrounds, \nthose kids can learn and can meet the standards, as well.\n\n  Our role is not to say to States that they have to use this money to \ntrain school leaders and principals; our job is not to say they have to \nuse this to provide for alternative schools for disruptive students; \nbut with the amendments we make it an option.\n  I commend Senator Kerry and Senator Smith from Oregon for joining in \noffering this amendment. I am pleased to stand in support.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership as a \nGovernor. He did a superb job in the State of Delaware, leading in some \nof the reforms incorporated herein. We appreciate and respect that and \nthank him for his support and comments with respect to these \namendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I urge the acceptance of these amendments.\n  The amendment, as my friend and colleague has pointed out, using the \nSafe and Drug Free Schools for the development of alternative \neducational opportunities for these students causing problems in school \nmakes a great deal of sense. This is a problem.\n  One of the things we understand is that children do not learn when \nthey are distracted and there is violence. Even though schools are one \nof the safest places to be at any time, we know there are incidents \nwhich occur. The Senator has made an excellent recommendation.\n  On the issue of the principals, as we have learned very well with the \nJeremiah Burke School, a principal took a school that lost \naccreditation and within 6 years, this last year--and it is the only \nhigh school in Boston that is eligible for title I funds, which means \nit has to have 70 percent eligibility which, in economic terms, are the \nneediest children probably in the city --this year, 100 percent of the \ngraduates were accepted into college. I think it was as much the \nprincipal's leadership in that as anything else.\n  The Senator has for a long time talked about the importance of the \nquality of principals. This is a particular area he has spent a great \ndeal of time on and has visited a lot of the schools and spoken \neloquently and effectively on the issue.\n  These are two very good amendments. I thank the Senator for the good \nwork he does on education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor \nwith Senator Kerry today and am grateful that the manager of this bill \nhas accepted our amendments. I will speak to No. 423. This is something \nSenator Kerry and I worked on for some time because of our fundamental \nbelief that principals shape the environment in which teachers and \nstudents ultimately succeed or fail. We believe improving the quality \nof school is the most effective way to make systematic improvements in \nour educational system.\n  The school principal of today is more than a manager. Today's \nprincipal needs to be an effective instructional leader. Instructional \nleaders develop and implement strategies for improving teaching and \nlearning; they develop a vision and establish clear goals for student \nperformance.\n  School principals provide direction in achieving state goals; \nencourage others to contribute to goal achievement; secure commitment \nto a course of action from individuals and groups in the school and \ncommunity. They are instrumental to the success of a school, and we \nhave a responsibility to help them succeed in this role.\n  To be effective, principals need more than workshops or other one-\ntime professional development ``events.'' They need high quality, \nongoing professional development focused on student achievement.\n  There is no doubt that teacher quality is important, but it is the \ncollection of teachers working with a unified\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\npurpose that transforms a school. That critical development comes only \nwith a skilled effective leader at the helm.\n   A 1999 report issued by the National Association of State Boards of \nEducation characterized effective principals as the ``lynchpins of \nschool improvement'' and the ``gatekeepers of change.'' The National \nAssociation of State Boards of Education views principals as impacting \nboth the implementation and sustainability of reforms focused on \nstudent achievement.\n  Principals have a powerful effect on the culture of a school: \nTeachers will model the behavior of a principal whom they trust and who \nhas knowledge about good instruction.\n  Currently, professional development funding is available to teachers, \nbut far too few principals receive similar professional development \noptions because school districts often decide to devote limited funding \nto teacher programs first. That is why this amendment allows principals \nto access federal professional development funds.\n  Not only do we need to help our current principals be more effective, \nwe also need to address the critical shortage of school administrators.\n  Too many schools opened this fall without a principal. Although the \nteacher shortage is well known, discussions about the lack of qualified \nschool leaders to fill the position of principal have just begun, and \nthey have begun with this amendment.\n  In Vermont, one of every five principals has retired or resigned \nsince the end of the last school year.\n  In Washington State, 15 percent of principals did the same last year.\n  In 1999, New York City had 200 schools that opened with temporary \nleaders.\n  School districts face a monumental task of finding effective leaders \nfor our nation's schools. Cities and states nationwide report principal \nvacancies and only a trickle of qualified applicants, if any, willing \nto fill the positions.\n  A recent study by the Educational Research Service estimates that \nmore than 40 percent of public school principals will retire over the \nnext ten years. Our school leaders are graying and we are not replacing \nthem with enough qualified candidates.\n  Leadership plays a pivotal role in all spheres of our national life, \nbut we have not yet made it a priority in schools. The business and \ncorporate community has long considered enlightened leadership a \nprerequisite for successful change. It cultivates young leaders and \nprovides extraordinary resources for their development. The commitment \nto developing and ensuring strong leadership extends to the armed \nforces, where we provide officer-training programs and service \nacademies for preparing leaders for all military services.\n  We need to do the same for the potential leaders of our schools. This \namendment does exactly that, by allowing funds to be used for mentoring \naspiring principals and recruiting leadership candidates.\n  There are excellent programs around the country, like Portland State \nUniversity's Graduate School of Education, ready to help train \nadministrators, if necessary funds are made available.\n  The role of the principal must be recognized if schools are going to \nimprove on a national level. The new policies being implemented here in \nCongress will, for the most part, have to be implemented at the school \nlevel by principals.\n  We have a responsibility to equip principals to carry out the \nachievement goals we have set for them.\n  I am asking my colleagues along with Senator Kennedy and others to \nsupport our Principals amendment. This amendment will allow states to \nuse Teacher Quality funds to improve the quality of elementary and \nsecondary principals and assistant principals.\n  This could include such state options as reforming principal \ncertification, ensuring that principals have the instructional skills \nto help educators teach, and mentoring principals. These functions \ncould help states ensure that enough high quality principals are ready \nto lead our children and our schools into the 21st century.\n  I would also like to address the need for alternative education in \nour children's schools. Senator Kerry and I have been working together \nfor several years to address the problem of educating troubled and \nchronically disruptive children in schools.\n  Today we offer an amendment, number 455, which will allow states to \nuse Title VI Safe and Drug Free Schools money for alternative \neducation, when it relates to drug and violence prevention, and to try \nto prevent these students from dropping out of school.\n  Alternative education options need to exist for the benefit of all \nstudents--both the disruptive students and their classmates.\n  Removing potentially violent or chronically disruptive children from \nthe classroom can leave other students free to learn.\n  But more than that, just removing these difficult students from the \nclassroom without providing alternative placements simply leaves them \nunsupervised. It also leaves them without opportunities to learn the \nskills they will need in life. This puts the students at even higher \nrisk for failure later in life.\n  What these children need is appropriate, intensive assistance that \ncan only be provided outside the regular classroom. Alternative \neducation can meet their needs for supervision, remediation of \nbehavior, maintenance of academic progress, and it can help prevent \nthem from dropping out.\n  Clearly, alternative education will not be a ``magic bullet''; \nhowever, it can serve a number of very important purposes. First, it \ncan improve safety in schools, by working with students who may be a \ndanger to themselves, other children, and staff.\n  Second, alternative education can also prevent disruptions to \nlearning for the overwhelming majority of students who come to school \nto learn.\n  Third, as I have already mentioned, it can provide appropriate help \nto chronically disruptive and violent students. According to \nadministrators in Multnomah County's Department of Community Justice, \nhalf the youth who are on probation or parole are also enrolled in \nalternative schools. Just think of the implications for society and \nthese individuals and their families later in life if these troubled \nyoungsters are denied the support they need to grow both academically \nand behaviorally.\n  Finally, alternative education options can prevent high risk students \nfrom dropping out of school. This gives them a much better chance of \nbecoming contributing members of society.\n  Research from the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory, based in \nmy home state of Oregon, has shown that at least two thirds of the \nstudents in community based alternative schools--all former dropouts--\nhave found academic and social success after being enrolled in the \nprogram.\n  Last winter, I talked with 150 Oregon educators about the best ways \nto prevent students from dropping out. Among the solutions, they \nrecommended alternative education as a critical tool for keeping kids \nin school.\n  Despite the fact that we know that alternative education is so \ncritical, there are simply not enough dollars available to reach all \nthe students who need it.\n  I am holding letters from educators in my home state telling me of \ntheir great need for federal help to fund alternative school options. I \nknow this need for funds exists across the country as well.\n  Therefore, I ask you to join my distinguished colleague, Senator \nKerry, and me in support of our alternative education amendment. \nAllowing states to use Safe and Drug Free Schools funds for alternative \neducation will help ensure that no children, even the ones at highest \nrisk, are left behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has all time been yielded?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are prepared to yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc, No. 423, as modified, and No. 455, as modified.\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 423 and 455), as modified) were agreed to, en \nbloc.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider and lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 630, As Modified\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent to call up previously proposed \namendment No. 630, as modified.\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bipartisan \namendment that was made possible with the help of my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and I also express my \nappreciation to Senators Kennedy and Gregg for their help on this \namendment. They have done a terrific job of moving this education bill \nthrough the process this year.\n  We have all experienced going home and hearing from teachers that too \noften technology is simply not well integrated into the classrooms. \nWhile we spend billions on technology in schools, too often these funds \ndo not have the full potential impact because the technology dollars \noften are focused just on equipment itself.\n  This bipartisan amendment simply requires that school districts which \nseek to use Federal technology dollars do so in a way that explicitly \ndetails how they are going to integrate teacher training and \nprofessional development, curriculum development, and proper system \nresources.\n  Furthermore, the amendment will ask the Department of Education to \nreport on these strategies to identify the BEST practices on bringing \ntechnology and training into the classroom so schools that are \nsuccessful can be used as a model to scale BEST education practices and \ntechnology at the national level.\n  This amendment has been supported by a number of national teaching \norganizations as well as many of the technology industry, such as AOL-\nTime Warner, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Computer and Communications \nIndustry Alliance, and many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent their letters in support of this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Computer & Communications\n\n\n                                         Industry Association,\n\n                                     Washignton, DC, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell, On behalf of the Computer & \n     Communications Industry Association (CCIA), I write to \n     express support for the Developing Best Practices for \n     technology in Education Amendment to S. 1, the Better \n     Education for Students and Teachers Act. CCIA applauds your \n     leadership efforts in introducing this amendment.\n       The Cantwell-Enzi bipartisan education technology amendment \n     to ESEA is a positive step forward in ongoing efforts to \n     bring technology to the classroom in a comprehensive and \n     effective way. This amendment will enable schools across the \n     country to integrate technology into classrooms to give all \n     our children the opportunity to take advantage of the many \n     benefits that technology and the Internet can provide.\n       Our schools will most benefit by the development of \n     programs that employ technology effectively and can be \n     implemented by any school or district. This amendment \n     recognizes that to be successful we must integrate \n     technological resources with two other crucial elements: \n     teacher training and professional development and curriculum \n     development.\n       We are pleased to support the Cantwell-Enzi amendment and \n     believe it will encourage the development of best practices \n     for the use of scalable technology in states and local \n     districts around the country and assessment and evaluation of \n     the effectiveness of those strategies. we are delighted to \n     support this amendment as one important step in bringing \n     technology to the classroom and will pledge to work for its \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         EJ Black,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                      Washingon, DC, June 7, 2001.\n     Senator Maria Cantwell\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing to commend you on your \n     initiative to ensure that teachers and students can take full \n     advantage of the opportunities presented to them by having \n     computers and Internet connections available as an integral \n     part of teaching. You have correctly identified a critical \n     need: it is not enough to make computers available in the \n     classroom, teachers must integrate them into their everyday \n     instructional activities.\n       As you are well aware, technology companies often have a \n     hard time finding new employees that have the needed levels \n     of math and science training, as well as computer literacy. \n     In a survey conducted last year, BSA CEOs projected that, on \n     average, 9 percent of the openings for skilled workers went \n     unfilled in 2000. We believe a long-term approach is needed \n     that takes into account education policy, particularly in \n     regard to providing incentives for and increasing the \n     interest of our nation's youth to study math and science.\n       We support your proposed amendment to the education bill \n     because it would promote more specific and rigorous use of \n     technology in the classroom. Today, while many classrooms \n     have a computer, too few of our teachers make use of it on a \n     systematic basis. We believe the Cantwell-Enzi amendment will \n     address these issues, changing the way our students improve \n     their computer skills.\n       As we understand it, your proposal would require local and \n     state agencies to include in their education plans three \n     criteria: 1) teacher training and development in the use of \n     technology; 2) curricular development that incorporates \n     computers and the internet; and 3) a plan to rationally \n     allocate technology resources. Additionally, your proposal \n     would direct the Department of Education to develop plans and \n     programs on best ways to use technology in teaching.\n       We applaud your leadership in this critical area, and we \n     stand ready to work with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Robert W. Holleyman,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Superintendent\n\n\n                                        of Public Instruction,\n\n                                        Olympia, WA, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: Thank you for your efforts to \n     improve the delivery of technology funding under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act by offering amendment \n     #630 regarding ``Developing Best Practices for Technology in \n     Education.''\n       The federal government has been the largest single investor \n     in education technology in this nation over the past decade. \n     To further improve the effective integration of technology, \n     training, and research-based best practices will ensure that \n     our national investment continues to be prudent and targeted \n     to efforts that improve student learning.\n       For state and local technology plans to miss connections to \n     the development of educator's skills, the development of the \n     curriculum they will use, or the development of best \n     practices in technology resources and systems, would be to \n     miss a tremendous opportunity to build student success. \n     Requiring these elements in plans makes eminent sense. In \n     addition, the national evaluation of technology plans will \n     allow the nation as a whole to learn from and to build on the \n     success of those, such as the many entrepreneurial educators \n     in Washington state, who have solved thorny problems of \n     technology integration with creativity, wisdom, and vision. I \n     do not want to suggest that in any way schools are not making \n     progress in effectively using technology. We have examples of \n     effective uses of technology from around the country, and \n     particularly in the state of Washington, through the use of \n     our K-20 Network (dozens of examples are described at http://\nwww.wa.gov/k20/).\n       Washington state, as a leader in technology innovation and \n     in the integration of technology into effective use in the \n     classroom, has much to gain by the passage of the Cantwell-\n     Enzi amendment to ESEA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Terry Bergeson,\n     State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              AOL Time Warner,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing to voice AOL-Time \n     Warner's enthusiastic support for your National Digital \n     School District Amendment to S. 1, the BEST Act. We believe \n     that your amendment furthers the goals of this bill as well \n     as those of Congress and the Administration by encouraging \n     innovative education strategies and public/private \n     partnerships, and mandating program effectiveness \n     assessments. We applaud your understanding of the importance \n     of the use of technology to educate America's youth.\n       As you know, AOL-Time Warner has a deep and abiding \n     interest in ensuring that all students receive an education \n     that not only grounds them in the basics--reading, writing, \n     and arithmetic--but simultaneously prepares them for \n     employment in the global, high-technology economy. To achieve \n     these goals, we believe that all students must gain access to \n     21st Century learning tools and skills, and that teachers \n     must receive training in how to use new technologies and \n     integrate them into their classrooms. Through our \n     establishment of AOL@School, a free online learning tool that \n     helps administrators, teachers, and students gain quick and \n     easy access to the best educational content available on the \n     Web, and our support of PowerUP, a non-profit organization \n     that provides underserved youth with access to technology and \n     mentoring, AOL-TW has made 21st Century technology literacy a \n     cornerstone of our business and philanthropic efforts.\n       We believe that your amendment will not only complement \n     these and other education technology projects in which AOL-\n     Time Warner has been involved, but will leave a legacy of \n     best practices for states and school districts to emulate.\n       Thank you again for your demonstrated leadership on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jill A.

S.A. 630 is a worthy \n     addition to S.1, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \n     and we fully endorse your efforts. We believe that S.A. 630 \n     is a logical and much needed step that will help schools, \n     school districts, teachers, and students all achieve \n     significant gains in performance and efficiency by requiring \n     the development of comprehensive strategies for technology.\n       As schools move towards a greater dependence on computer \n     technology, they are continually faced with expensive \n     hardware and software expenditures, continual upgrades, \n     expensive technical support, and a constant need for teacher \n     re-training. By encouraging the adoption of ``best \n     practices,'' we believe more schools will move toward a web-\n     based learning model, allowing anytime, anywhere access to \n     educational resources. Through web-based learning, our \n     schools can achieve greater efficiency, increase access to \n     educational resources and allow teachers to spend time doing \n     what they do best--teach.\n       Therefore, we specifically support the Cantwell-Enzi \n     Amendment because it meets the challenges of brining \n     education to the classroom by:\n       1. Requiring that local and state agencies develop \n     strategies that include teacher development and training; \n     curriculum development; and technology system resources to be \n     eligible for over $1 billion in federal technology funds;\n       2. Encouraging the development of best practices for the \n     use of technology in schools that can be scalable in states \n     and local districts around the country.\n       The single most important thing the federal government can \n     do to promote real educational reform is to encourage a shift \n     towards web-based learning. We believe this amendment is an \n     important step, and are proud to support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kim Jones,          \n     Vice President, Global Education and       Research.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          SchoolTone Alliance,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of the members of the \n     SchoolTone Alliance, I write to express support for the \n     National Digital School Districts Amendment to S. 1, the \n     Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, SchoolTone \n     Alliance applauds your leadership efforts in introducing this \n     amendment.\n       The amendment addresses the very real challenges faced in \n     effectively using technology in our nation's classrooms by \n     strengthening teacher training, improving curricular \n     development, allocating scarce resources and identifying best \n     practices. Last year the bipartisan Congressional Web-based \n     Education Commission released its report, The Power of the \n     Internet for Learning, and called upon policymakers to enact \n     an ``e-learning agenda.'' Your amendment implements the \n     vision articulated in that report and will act as a catalyst \n     in moving the power of the Internet for learning from promise \n     to practice.\n       The SchoolTone Alliance is a not-for-profit, independent \n     consortium of companies promoting the benefits of Internet-\n     based computing in schools. SchoolTone Alliance member \n     companies include: ACTV HyperTV Networks, Inc.; AOL@School; \n     bigchalk,com; Blackboard, Inc.; BritannicaSchool.com; \n     Broadware Technologies; HighWired.com; Isis Communications \n     Limited; JASON Foundation; Lucent Technologies; National \n     Semiconductor; Power School; SaskTel; SchoolCity.com; \n     SchoolCruiser/Timecruiser Computing; Simplexis.com; SRI \n     International; Sun Microsystems, Inc. and VIP Tone, Inc.\n       SchoolTone Alliance and its members look forward to working \n     with you on a mutual agenda of bringing technology to all \n     students and in making it a more effective and efficient tool \n     for learning.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Irene K. Spero,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     University of Washington,\n\n                                        Seattle, WA, June 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Maria: We commend you for your leadership on the \n     Cantwell-Enzi Amendment of S.1, S.A. 630: ``Developing Best \n     Practices for Technology in Education.''\n       There is widespread agreement that technology has the \n     potential to dramatically enhance teaching and learning.\n       In the past few years, we have made great progress in \n     providing computers and connectivity in our classrooms, both \n     nationally and in Washington State. In Washington State, for \n     example, the proportion of K-12 classrooms with Internet \n     access increased from 64% to 87% between 1998 and 2000.\n       However, just providing computers and connectivity is not \n     sufficient. In Washington State, nearly half of all schools \n     have no equipment replacement plan within a five-year cycle. \n     Three-fourths of all schools cannot meet an equipment \n     downtime goal of two days or less. The average time spent on \n     staff/teacher in-service technology training is one hour per \n     year. Per-student expenditures on all aspects of technology \n     range from an average of $22/student in the bottom 10% of \n     Washington's 297 school districts, to an average of $357/\n     student in the top 10%. Curriculum lags tremendously. So does \n     research on educational outcomes--measured as a fraction of \n     total expenditures, computer chip manufacturers spend 200 \n     times as much on R, and potato chip manufacturers spend 20 \n     times as much!\n       Your amendment will encourage the thoughtful and effective \n     integration of technology into the classroom, in a way that \n     truly does enhance teaching and learning. Again, thank you \n     for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward D. Lazowska,\n       Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science, Department \n     of Computer Science & Engineering.\n     Patricia M. Wasley,\n       Dean and Professor, College of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Microsoft Corporation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of Microsoft Corporation, \n     I would like to commend you on the introduction of your \n     amendment, ``Developing Best Practices for Technology in \n     Education,'' to S.1, the ``Better Education for Students and \n     Teachers Act.'' As strong supporters of bipartisan education \n     reform, Microsoft applauds your leadership and vision on this \n     important issue, and we share your commitment to providing \n     educators with the tools and training they need to integrate \n     technology effectively into their classrooms.\n       Using technology to raise student achievement and improve \n     professional development is vital as we seek to reform our \n     education system. Our own initiative to promote professional \n     development, the Microsoft Classroom Teacher Network, has \n     helped provide technology training to nearly 1.5 million \n     teachers annually. In addition, Microsoft has developed a \n     suite of software tools, particularly the Encarta Class \n     Server, Web-based curriculum development platform designed to \n     aid teachers in classroom management. Microsoft also supports \n     the Boys & Girls Club of America Club Tech program which \n     gives students access to technology after school thereby \n     providing particularly low-income children, with access to a \n     wide array of educational technology experiences and \n     opportunities.\n       By helping to provide teachers with the resources necessary \n     to succeed, and by ensuring that educators nationwide will \n     have access to information regarding the most effective uses \n     of technology in raising student achievement, your amendment \n     will help promote creativity and innovation in our education \n     system and ensure that no child is left behind.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Jack Krumholtz,          \n     Director, Federal Government Affairs,       Associate General \n                                                          Counsel.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I also ask the support of my colleagues in passing this \nlegislation to make sure our technology dollars at the national level \nare used efficiently and effectively, that some of the models being \nestablished even in the private sector be considered as we move forward \non getting the best for education under this amendment. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it, and again thank Senator Enzi, my staff and \nSenator Enzi's staff on their bipartisan effort in passing this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Washington for this proposal. \nShe brings enormous experience in this area as one who has \ndemonstrated, in another life, great perception about the possibilities \nof the computer world and what it can mean for enhancing education. Her \nrecommendations in the form of this amendment are something we value. \nWe have provisions reflected in the legislation, as the Senator has \nnoted, but I think this perception that she has brought with this \namendment will be enormously useful and valuable.\n  We had a good description of the proposal earlier last evening. She \nhas given us additional comments today. We are prepared to recommend \nthe amendment be accepted. I do so at this time. I think we are \nprepared to accept it.\n  I thank the Senator for her diligence in pursuing this matter. She \nhas been enormously cooperative with the floor managers in arranging to \nbring this to the attention of the Senate. We are grateful to her for \nher accommodation but most importantly for the substance of this \nproposal, which will add to the\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nenhancement of children's knowledge in the area of computer technology.\n  We are prepared to accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 630) as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are expecting a vote in a few moments \non the Dodd amendment. Sometime after that, we will be dealing with the \nHutchinson amendment and then the Schumer proposal. There will be the \nSchumer proposal and then there will be another first-degree amendment. \nThen later in the afternoon, after those, we hope to consider the \nClinton amendments.\n  This gives an idea on how we are going to be spending the early \nafternoon, midafternoon. That ought to bring us into mid-late \nafternoon. We are making very important progress. We still have some \nimportant measures yet to address. But we are making good progress. We \nare very grateful for the cooperation of our colleagues.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will vote in about 7 minutes. I \nunderstand the Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes reserved prior to \nthe vote. I will use several minutes in opposition to the amendment \nthat has been put forth by the Senator from Connecticut. I have had the \nopportunity to make some main points and speak in opposition to this \namendment.\n  It really boils down to two things. The first is the area of \nprocedure. The Dodd amendment strips out what has been agreed to in a \nbipartisan way, Democrats, Republicans, and the White House, in \nnegotiations that went on for days and weeks. Our colleagues absolutely \nmust understand that this reaches into the agreement we have and strips \nout and really destroys a program called Straight A's, a program we \nfeel very strongly about, a program that captures many of the \nfundamental reforms and principles that I believe will strongly change \nthe nature of education so that we will no longer have this increasing \nachievement gap. Those principles are flexibility, accountability, and \nlocal control.\n  The substance of what is in the underlying bill is that we have \nbasically taken about nine categorical programs, non-title I, money for \nthe low-income, non-title I funds. There are about 18 to 20 categorical \nprograms. We took nine of those programs and basically said a State can \napply, or a district can actually apply, and basically say we will use \nthat money in such a way that we can identify locally with the \nflexibility and local control--which is so important--we will address \nthe needs we see that are putting up a roadblock for us to educate our \nchildren.\n  Linked to that is our agreement that the accountability of student \nachievement we will demand by entering into this arrangement in order \nto obtain those funds with such flexibility is that we are going to \nmeet higher standards than anywhere else in the bill. That was \nnegotiated.\n\n  The other things we have not been talking about very much in terms of \nthis whole concept of being a block grant. Let me just basically say it \nwas negotiated that the standards are high, performance has to be \ndemonstrated, or you drop out of that program.\n  The second point I want to make is that we have come together to \nnegotiate this part of the bill. The fact that you would strip out a \npart of the bill where people say that is just one program, it needs to \nbe understood that of the overall funding that is in this pilot \nprogram--a pilot program we would like to see opened to all States, \nbut, no, we negotiated if from 50 to 40 to 30 to 20 to 10 to 7; so we \nalready negotiated the categorical programs down. We all debated and \ndecreased that from 18 to 9, so it is as small as it can possibly be in \nthis negotiated way. And if you remove a program that accounts for \nabout 40 percent of the funding, that destroys Straight A's, this \ninnovative program that is set before us.\n  Therefore, I would argue that if our goal is to leave no child \nbehind, we should leave at least one element of hope in this bill to \ncapture the flexibility, the local control, and the strong \naccountability in which we, as Republicans, believe so strongly.\n  Adoption of the Dodd amendment guts Straight A's, guts this \nflexibility, guts this local control, and guts this opportunity to \ntruly leave no child behind. Thus, I urge defeat of this amendment by \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with respect to the amendment No. 431, as \nmodified, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 433, 436, 431 As Modified, and 419, en bloc, to \n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are again in a position to clear \namendments by unanimous consent. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be in order for these amendments to be considered en bloc, and \nany modifications, where applicable, be agreed to, the amendments be \nagreed to, en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, en bloc.\n  They are Reed amendment No. 433, Reed amendment No. 436, Reed \namendment No. 431, as modified, and Specter amendment No. 419.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 433\n\n                    (Purpose: To amend a definition)\n\n       On page 307, line 16, strike ``and''.\n       On page 307, line 18, strike the period and insert ``;

Mr. President, let me inquire. I gather we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement to have 4 minutes equally divided to make closing \narguments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. We are done.\n  Mr. DODD. I have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, I had printed in the Record letters \nin support of my afterschool amendment, letters from Fight Crime: \nInvest in Kids, from 1,000 chiefs of police, prosecutors, crime \nsurvivors, and police organizations. Their letters are strong letters \nin terms of the value of afterschool programs.\n  Seventy percent of the chiefs of police have said the best method for \nreducing the problems of afterschool violence is a good afterschool \nprogram.\n  There have been almost 3,000 applications for 21st century learning \ncenters since the concept was introduced a number of years ago. It has \nbeen the largest single request from local communities and community-\nbased organizations in the history of the Department of Education.\n  My point is simply this. I am willing to support, and I support the \nStraight A's block grant program. I want to take out, however, the 5.7 \npercent of funding--that is all it amounts to--for afterschool \nprograms. That program ought not end up subject to the vagaries of what \nhappens to a State education agency.\n  We ought to let local communities decide whether or not they want an \nafterschool program. We are going to say in 7 States, in 25 school \ndistricts--that could comprise as many as 26 million children--for the \nnext 7 years, that afterschool programs will be left to a jump ball, in \neffect.\n  This is a program that is supported by Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs. I \nhave strong letters from the YMCAs, YWCAs--the 2,500 across the \ncountry--that urge--in fact, beg in this letter--that we adopt this \namendment. It isn't me asking for this. This is not D's and R's \nfighting with each other. These are people every day who are out there \ntrying to make sure that kids can be in a safe environment after \nschool. That is really what this amounts to. Chiefs of police say it is \nimportant. School administrators will tell you it is important.\n  This does not destroy the block grant program at all. This idea that \nit does is not based on any independent analysis of it at all. So I \nurge this amendment be adopted. It means a lot to our local \ncommunities. We now have 11 million kids who are home alone at the end \nof each school day. We need to do better by these children.\n  An afterschool program, based on the 21st century concept, certainly \nis deserving of that support. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just 15 seconds. We are going to hold \nMembers accountable on the amount of time for the vote on this \namendment. So I hope all Members will make it their business to be in \nthe Chamber on time because we have to accommodate other Members who \nhave accommodated our schedule. We are making good progress. We are \ngoing to conform to the Senate rules in relation to the time for the \nvote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Dodd amendment \nNo. 382.

Mr. President, I send a further modification to \namendment No. 555 to the desk and ask unanimous consent it be so \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to further \nmodify the amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IX add the following:\n\n     902. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE ACCESS OF \n                   ARMED FORCES RECRUITERS TO STUDENT DIRECTORY \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Service in the Armed Forces of the United States is \n     voluntary.\n       (2) Recruiting quality persons in the numbers necessary to \n     maintain the strengths of the Armed Forces authorized by \n     Congress is vital to the United States national defense.\n       (3) Recruiting quality servicemembers is very challenging, \n     and as a result, Armed Forces recruiters must devote \n     extraordinary time and effort to their work in order to fill \n     monthly requirements for immediate accessions.\n       (4) In meeting goals for recruiting high quality men and \n     women, each of the Armed Forces faces intense competition \n     from the other Armed Forces, from the private sector, and \n     from institutions offering postsecondary education.\n       (5) Despite a variety of innovative approaches taken by \n     recruiters, and the extensive benefits that are available to \n     those who join the Armed Forces, it is becoming increasingly \n     difficult for the Armed Forces to meet recruiting goals.\n       (6) A number of high schools across the country have denied \n     recruiters access to students or to student directory \n     information.\n       (7) In 1999, the Army was denied access on 4,515 occasions, \n     the Navy was denied access on 4,364 occasions, the Marine \n     Corps was denied access on 4,884 occasions, and the Air Force \n     was denied access on 5,465 occasions.\n       (8) As of the beginning of 2000, nearly 25 percent of all \n     high schools in the United States did not release student \n     directory information requested by Armed Forces recruiters.\n       (9) In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate, recruiters stated that the single \n     biggest obstacle to carrying out the recruiting mission was \n     denial of access to student directory information, as the \n     student directory is the basic tool of the recruiter.\n       (10) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information unfairly hurts the youth of the \n     United States, as it prevents students from receiving \n     important information on the education and training benefits \n     offered by the Armed Forces and impairs students' \n     decisionmaking on careers by limiting the information on the \n     options available to them.\n       (11) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information undermines United States \n     national defense, and makes it more difficult to recruit high \n     quality young Americans in numbers sufficient to maintain the \n     readiness of the Armed Forces and to provide for the national \n     security.\n       (12) Section 503 of title 10, United States Code, requires \n     local educational agencies, as of July 1, 2002, to provide \n     recruiters access to secondary schools on the same basis that \n     those agencies provide access to representatives of colleges, \n     universities, and private sector employers.\n       (b) Campaign To Promote Access.--\n       (1) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each State shall transmit to the \n     Secretary of Education a list of each school, if any, in that \n     State that--\n       (A) during the 12 months preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, has denied access to students or to student \n     directory information to a military recruiter; or\n       (B) has in effect a policy to deny access to students or to \n     student directory information to military recruiters.\n       (2) Education program.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall, not later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, make \n     awards to States and schools using funds available under \n     section 6201(d) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     to educate principals, school administrators, and other \n     educators regarding career opportunities in the Armed Forces, \n     and the access standard required under section 503 of title \n     10, United States Code.\n       (B) Targeted schools.--In selecting schools for awards \n     required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give \n     priority to selecting schools that are included on the lists \n     transmitted to Congress under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 903. MILITARY RECRUITING ON CAMPUS.\n\n       (a) Denial of funds.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--No funds available to the Department of \n     Defense may be provided by grant or contract to any \n     institution of higher education (including any school of law, \n     whether or not accredited by the American Bar Association) \n     that has a policy of denying, or which effectively prevents, \n     the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military \n     recruiting purposes--\n       (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or\n       (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.\n       (2) Covered students.--Students referred to in paragraph \n     (1) are individuals who are 17 years of age or older.\n       (b) Procedures for Determination.--The Secretary of \n     Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, \n     shall prescribe regulations that contain procedures for \n     determining if and when an educational institution has denied \n     or prevented access to students or information described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``directory information'' means, with respect to a student, \n     the student's name, address, telephone listing, date and \n     place of birth, level of education, degrees received, and the \n     most recent previous educational institution enrolled in by \n     the student.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to make a brief presentation on \nthis amendment and the need for this amendment. Senator Sessions may \nalso wish to make a brief statement regarding this amendment.\n  I believe in discussions with Senator Kennedy and Senator Reid this \namendment has been agreed to, but I do want to make a brief statement \nabout it and give Senator Sessions an opportunity to do likewise.\n  In my role last year as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee on \nArmed Services, we held two hearings regarding recruitment to our armed \nservices. One of the tragedies I became aware of was there are \nliterally thousands of high schools across the United States that have \ndenied access to our military recruiters. That is a national shame.\n  In fact, we found that in 1999, which is the last year figures are \navailable, the Army was denied access to 4,515 high schools; The Navy \nwas denied access to 4,364 high schools; The Marine Corps was denied \naccess to 4,884 high schools; and the Air Force was denied access to \n5,465 high schools.\n  These same high schools across the country are providing student \ndirectory information to college recruiters. They are providing routine \naccess to employers, to class ring companies. I was very concerned \nabout this. As a result, I put a provision in last year's Defense \nauthorization bill that required\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nthose high schools that want to deny access to go through a process in \nwhich the publicly elected school board members would have to vote \nproactively to deny access on a discriminatory basis to military \nrecruiters.\n  I do not think many are going to do that. The thousands of schools \nthat are denying access are doing so usually at the whim of a principal \nor superintendent who, for one reason or another, does not believe \nrecruiters should come on campus.\n  I believe they should have equal access. To the extent they allow \ncollege recruiters and employers to recruit, then our military \nrecruiters should be able to come on that campus and tell their story, \nand they have a great story to tell. They have a story to tell about \ncareer opportunities in our armed services. They have a story to tell \nabout educational benefits that are offered in the armed services. They \nhave a story to tell about what Congress has done to enhance health \ncare benefits for those who make a career in the armed services. They \nhave a great story to tell young people, and young people need to have \nthis career option laid out before them. The military should not be \ndiscriminated against.\n  We put those provisions in, and Senator Kennedy worked closely with \nus ensuring it was not too heavy handed. In fact, there is a whole \nprocess set up in which schools that are denying access will have \neveryone clear up to the Secretary of Defense notified. The Governor of \nthe State will be notified, and a process is put in place whereby \nwhatever problems may have led to that discriminatory denial of access \ncan be addressed and hopefully amicably addressed so recruiters can get \ninto the schools again.\n  Only when a publicly elected school board votes publicly to deny \naccess will they be able to opt out of the bill. If they ignore the \nlaw, which was passed by the Congress last year and signed into law, \nthey open themselves to a Federal lawsuit.\n  What we are finding out now is we are approaching the 1 year out from \nwhen the law takes effect. Recruiters have told me this year, personnel \nchiefs have told me this year that they are finding principals do not \nknow there has been a change in the law. Superintendents simply do not \nknow that this is the new law of the land.\n  My amendment tells the Secretary of Education that he must begin an \neducational campaign in the course of this next year so superintendents \nand principals are not going to have the excuse that they did not know. \nThey are going to know what the new policy is. They are going to know \nwhat the new law is and begin, hopefully, to prepare for July 1, 2001, \nwhen that law takes effect. I am very pleased that on both sides of the \naisle, in a bipartisan way, there is an agreement. This has been a good \nstep to take. This is a good vehicle for this provision in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n  I am also pleased Senator Sessions of Alabama called to my attention \nanother problem that has developed. I yield to Senator Sessions for a \nstatement about that provision he has added in a modification to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his leadership on \nthis important issue. The U.S. military has been a guardian of liberty \nfor the United States and for freedom-loving people all over the world. \nIt has preserved our freedom. I wish it were not so that we had to have \na military, but we do, and it is critically important the men and women \nin the military have the best education, and they recruit the best \nyoung people in America, urging them to consider a career in the \nmilitary.\n  There is a group that is active in America that sometimes is hostile \nto that. One of the most astounding things I learned a few years ago as \nattorney general of the State of Alabama, a young man I hired to work \nin my office went to law school, and the law school he attended would \nnot allow military recruiters to come on the law school campus to \nsolicit lawyers to join the military. I was astounded. He said the \nstudents got up a petition to protest it. I thought he was kidding. He \nwas not kidding. In fact, that was the circumstance.\n  I talked to the dean and I later drafted legislation to require that \nlaw schools allow recruiters on campus. They told me apparently it is a \nproblem, and it may be a reality all over America. They said the reason \nthis was occurring was because the accrediting agencies for law schools \ntake the position that the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy of the U.S. \nmilitary, approved by former President Bill Clinton, is discriminatory \nand, therefore, law schools cannot allow anybody who discriminates to \ncome on campus. So they have made that an accrediting factor and have \nintimidated law schools.\n  This unelected group--who they are, I am not sure; perhaps they are \nleftover antiwar activists--is dictating this around the country.\n\n  I think this legislation will be a healthy signal that the Senate \nsays, as I told this law school dean: You have freedom. We have a rule \nof law in America today because men and women in uniform have defended \nagainst the Communist totalitarians, the Nazi oppressors, and defeated \nthem and preserved liberty. The very concept, the very idea that a \nlegal arm of the Defense Department, the JAG officers, are not \nrespected and cannot recruit on the campus of the best law schools is \nunacceptable.\n  I appreciate the opportunity that Senator Hutchinson has provided to \nallow this amendment be included as a part of his legislation. I think \nit is good public policy. I think it is wrong to allow this to happen \nin America today. I think this legislation could make a big step in \neliminating the problem. If it does not, we may have to have more \nspecific legislation in the future.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Hutchinson. I thank Senator \nKennedy and Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that the final modification \nmay take a moment or two. There is the question about out of which fund \nthe resources will come. I understand the proponents want it out of the \nSecretary's discretionary fund rather than the initial funding, which \nwas about $125 million that was going to be used for bonuses for States \nand communities that meet their responsibilities in developing their \ntests. We are just checking on the cross-reference number.\n  That aside, I thank Senator Hutchinson and Senator Sessions for their \ncooperation in working this amendment through. We have a procedure in \nplace now so we can focus responsibility if there is a denial for \naccess to the campuses of this country. It does seem to me that the \narmed services ought to have the same ability for access to students as \nother groups that are recruiting at these universities and colleges and \nschools. I think that is a rather basic and fundamental concept and one \nwith which I agree.\n  I think we have a proposal to try to move that process forward. There \nis some existing legislation in place. This is a restatement of that \nlegislation because there has been some question in some minds whether \nthe existing legislation did the job. I thought the member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, the one who had visited this issue \npreviously, thought it did, but we have some additional ways of \nencouraging schools and colleges and law schools to give consideration \nto recruiters. That has been included in this amendment. That is \nacceptable to me, and I hope when it is finalized, which should be in a \nmoment, we will move ahead and accept the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, and I especially \nthank the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Alabama for \nbringing this amendment forward. I think it is absolutely essential \nthat we, as the Senate, put ourselves unalterably on the record, in a \nclear manner, that we believe the armed services have every right, and \nin fact colleges have an obligation to allow them, to recruit on their \ncampuses, whether they be law schools, whether they be graduate \nschools, or whether they be undergraduate schools.\n  The attempt to exclude the military services from different colleges \nis an example of political correctness run to its extreme. As the \nbranch of government which funds the armed services and which has a \ncritical obligation of making sure the armed services is filled with \ntalented citizens, it is our obligation to recruit aggressively. The \nnatural place to recruit is in the higher system of education and in \nour high schools.\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\n  I congratulate the Senator. It is an excellent amendment. I look \nforward to its passage.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Hutchinson \namendment be temporarily laid aside so I may offer an amendment which I \nbelieve will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 456, As Modified, to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. DODD. I send a modification of the early childhood educator \nprofessional development amendment No. 456 to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 456, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 383, after line 21, add the following:\n\n      ``PART E--EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n     ``SEC. 2501.

The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. DODD. I have cleared the modification with the manager and the \nranking member. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nCorzine of New Jersey. It is the early childhood educator professional \ndevelopment amendment.\n  We have been talking a lot in the last few days about raising the \nquality of education for all children. Learning starts, as we all know, \nvery early--earlier than most people imagined a few years ago. If we \nwant to succeed with educational reform, we have to help those \neducators work with very young children.\n  We know from research that quality child care makes a difference in \nchildren's readiness for school, their behavior, and their social and \nemotional development.\n  A study following children in Chicago enrolled in the Child Parent \nProgram and other early childhood programs over a 15 year period, \nreported in the May 9, 2001 Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, shows that low-income children in high-quality, \ncomprehensive early childhood education programs have lower rates of \njuvenile arrests and violent arrests.\n  The National Academy of Sciences' report, Neurons to Neighborhoods, \nalso stressed the importance of quality early childhood education to \nchild development.\n  And, many other studies confirm that children who attend early \nchildhood education programs led by highly qualified educators are more \nlikely to have better behavior skills, more enriched vocabularies and \npre-reading skills, and to succeed in school.\n  Yet we do not give the caregivers and teachers who nurture 13 million \nchildren outside of their homes every day the training that they want \nand need.\n  Many child care and preschool teachers have only a high school \ndiploma. And, often, preschool teachers receive only ten hours of \ntraining each year.\n  Children who can't interact well with other children or their \nteachers are going to have a better chance at learning to read if we \ndevelop their reading skills in conjunction with their other \ndevelopmental needs.\n  For children to be ready for school and to learn to read, their early \nchildhood educators must have the training to help them develop \nintellectually and socially.\n  This amendment would provide for grants to local partnerships to \ntrain early childhood educators in children's social, emotional, \ncognitive, and physical development, including ways to identify and \nprevent behavior problems and children who are victims of abuse.\n  Violence prevention must begin with very young children. With the \nskills and knowledge on how to effectively help young children deal \nwith anger and conflict without violence and to support their learning, \nmany more children will succeed in school and beyond.\n  If we can deal with these issues early in life, we can help prevent \nnegative, even violent, behavioral problems later.\n  We must invest in the teachers of our young children.\n  This amendment is supported by a long list of organizations \nrepresenting the early childhood educator community, including the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the Children's Defense Fund, the \nDepartments of Education in Maryland, New York State, Oregon, Rhode \nIsland, and South Carolina, the National Association for the Education \nof young Children, the National Head Start Association, the YMCA, the \nYWCA, and many others.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in Senator Corzine in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n  I think the amendment is being agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his initiative in this area. He makes a number of good points about \nthe need for high-quality teachers being involved in early childhood \neducation programs. The amendment is acceptable to the managers on this \nside.\n  If there is no other debate, I will urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 456), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Previously Submitted Amendment No. 458\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am not going to offer this amendment. I \nwill ask unanimous consent the amendment be printed in the Record, the \none I was about to offer on equity for Puerto Rico, amendment No. 458. \nI ask unanimous consent this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of May 9, 2001, under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DODD. I do not intend to offer this amendment, but I wanted to \nraise it as a subject matter that has been discussed both in the other \nbody and here. As we all know, Puerto Rico is part of America. They do \nnot have Senators here, so from time to time those of us who have been \ninvolved and care about the hundreds of thousands, millions of people \nwho live on the island of Puerto Rico, and the 600,000 children on that \nisland, and the quality of education they receive, take on the \nresponsibility of trying to raise the issues that are important to \nthese fellow Americans.\n  This amendment I will not offer right now. The House has included \nsome language to deal with title I education in Puerto Rico. I am \nhopeful in conference maybe we can work out some accommodation that \nwill serve these children.\n  Title I is very important to Puerto Rico because of the island's high \nconcentration of low-income children. Mr. President, 93 percent of \nPuerto Rico's public schools participate in title I. More than 600,000 \nchildren benefit from the title I program. The cost of educating \nchildren in Puerto Rico is comparable to the cost of educating children \nin the 50 States. In fact, the cost of living in San Juan, Puerto Rico, \nits capital, is higher than the cost of living in most other major \nAmerican cities. Failure to provide equitable treatment to Puerto Rico \nand its children who are American citizens, American children, \nperpetuates a system that denies those children the access to quality \neducation that every child deserves.\n  The President has articulated in his statements that we should be \nleaving no child behind in this country. The Puerto Rican children, as \nI said, have no Senators to represent them. They do have a very fine \nRepresentative in the other body, Anibal Acevedo-Vila, who represents \nthe island of Puerto Rico in the other body. He does not have a vote, \nbut he has a voice. He votes in committees. He has talked to me and \nother Members about the importance of title I funding in Puerto Rico.\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n  So on behalf of my colleague in the other body, on behalf of the \n600,000 children in Puerto Rico and their families, I put this \namendment in the Record. I raise the issue here to let them know we \nwill continue to pursue this matter when it comes up in conference.\n  Puerto Rico is working very hard to help its children compete. Over \nthe last 5 years, it has increased its per pupil investment in \neducation by 58 percent. That is more than any State in the United \nStates and more than the national average, but because of the unfair \ntreatment we give this group of Americans, Puerto Rican children \nreceive only three-quarters of the resources they would receive were \nthey to move to Connecticut, Rhode Island, or any other State. Even \nthough they are American citizens, we do not provide them the full \nfunding every other State gets under title I under proportionality, so \nthese fellow citizens of ours are not treated as equally as others.\n  On behalf of the people of Puerto Rico, I hope that situation will be \ncorrected. We will fight very hard for it in conference, but \nrecognizing the realities here on the floor, I am fearful such an \namendment might fail. I think there is a better chance of working out \nsomething with the other body in conference that will accommodate these \npeople.\n  The 516,000 poor children in Puerto Rico should know we have not \ngiven up and we will carry on this battle in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut in pointing out to this body the unfairness of the \ntreatment of Puerto Rico.\n  If I am not mistaken, I think they have a greater participation in \nthe military forces of this country than any State or other territory. \nI remember at one time when we were battling on questions of the Food \nStamp Program pointing out the number of Puerto Rican Congressional \nMedal of Honor winners in the conflicts of this Nation. They are, in \nmany instances, the earliest units that get called up to the service of \nthis country. They have served all over the globe and have proudly worn \nthe American uniform. Yet they are being constantly shortchanged in \nthis extraordinarily important area, important to families in our 50 \nStates. But these families in Puerto Rico care as deeply as any \nfamilies do in any part of the United States about their children, and \nthe hopes and dreams of those children are just as real as the hopes \nand dreams of children here.\n  So I give assurance to the Senator. We have talked about this. It was \nraised briefly in the markup of our committee. We will work with our \ncolleagues on the other side and with our friends in Puerto Rico and \nhopefully with the administration to move us in the direction of \ntreating them equitably and fairly. They are not so treated at this \ntime. I think the American people would certainly support that.\n  If we are able to get the additional funding, which I am hopeful we \nare able to do, the opportunities will be even greater. But I thank the \nSenator for bringing up this subject.\n  We want to give full notice to all of our colleagues that we are \ngoing to try to find a way to treat Puerto Rico fairly, as they should \nbe treated and as they are not being treated at the present time.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to our attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts in saluting the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for this outstanding amendment. I think it has been \nsummed up well by both speakers. The funding in Puerto Rico is not what \nit should be. Certainly given that every Puerto Rican is an American \ncitizen, given the fact that we have, particularly with my State and so \nmany of the others, people who are going back and forth, educated in \none, work in the other, and go back home to retire, we want the best \neducated people in Puerto Rico that we can have.\n  Title I said we are going to do that for people who are less \nadvantaged than the rest of us. To exclude Puerto Rico from that \nformula is both unfair to their birthright as citizens, to the fact \nthey fight in the military, to the fact that they do all the things all \nof us do, and at the same time it is also foolish because a better \neducated Puerto Rico makes a stronger America and a stronger American \neconomy.\n  Certainly it affects the State that I represent very directly.\n  This is an excellent amendment. I think the Senator from Connecticut \nhas done the right thing by not forcing the debate. I join him in an \nearnest wish that the conferees will take care of this problem in \nconference so that we will finally do right by the children of Puerto \nRico, American citizens as are we.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSchumer be recognized to offer an amendment regarding funding with 40 \nminutes for debate; further, that when Senator Domenici offers his \namendment regarding funding, which is at the desk, the debate be \nlimited to 40 minutes; further, that the debate on the two amendments \nbe divided as follow: Senators Schumer, Domenici, Gregg, and Kennedy; \nfurther, that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nvote in relation to the Domenici amendment followed by 4 minutes for \nclosing debate, and a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment with no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject. I wonder if we could add ``or their designee.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I so add ``or their designee.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 800 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 800.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \nappropriate all funds authorized for elementary and secondary education \n                          in fiscal year 2002)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON APPROPRIATION OF ALL FUNDS \n                   AUTHORIZED FOR ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) President George W. Bush has said that bipartisan \n     education reform will be the cornerstone of his \n     administration and that no child should be left behind;\n       (2) the Bush administration has said that too many of the \n     neediest students of our Nation are being left behind and \n     that the Federal Government can, and must, help close the \n     achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their \n     peers;\n       (3) more of the children of our Nation are enrolled in \n     public school today than at any time since 1971;\n       (4) math and science skills are increasingly important as \n     the global economy transforms into a high tech economy;\n       (5) last year's Glenn Commission concluded that the most \n     consistent and powerful predictors of student achievement in \n     math and science are whether the student's teacher had full \n     teaching certification and a college major in the field being \n     taught; and\n       (6) Congress increased appropriations for elementary and \n     secondary education by 20 percent in fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should appropriate all funds authorized for \n     elementary and secondary education in fiscal year 2002.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded 10 minutes of the\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\npending time to the Schumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. We have worked \nhard on this amendment. I very much appreciate her efforts and \ninspiration on this amendment.\n  Our amendment is very simple. I am going to read it to the body so \nthere can be no mistake about it. After a bunch of whereas clauses, on \nline 23, page 2, it says:\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should appropriate all funds authorized for \n     elementary and secondary education in fiscal year 2002.\n\n  The amendment is very simple. Basically it says to this body, to the \nother body, and to the White House: Put your money where your mouth is.\n  We have been talking about education, as we should, for the last 2 \nweeks. We have been saying how important education is to the future of \nAmerica. We have been debating--and I think in a rather good debate--\nthe various new programs we wish to add to education. We have talked \nabout modifying other programs. As a result, so that these will not be \nempty promises, we have added over $10.6 billion to the authorization \nlevel if you just count the five major programs: IDEA, title I, teacher \nquality, bilingual immigrant, and afterschool. There are several more \nbillion that have been added as well.\n  What a hollow promise it would be if we passed this bill and then did \nnot appropriate the money. To those who have been listening to this \ndebate in the gallery and elsewhere, an authorization brings no new \nmoney to a program. It is simply an ability to open up a bank account \nup to a certain level. It is the appropriation that actually puts the \nmoney in the bank account. It is only the appropriation that will fund \nthe special education or the teachers for underachieving children or \nthe teachers of high quality throughout America or the afterschool \nprograms.\n  If we were to authorize a beautiful shiny bill and put it in a nice \nbox and put a ribbon on it and send it to the White House, and the \nPresident were to have a big signing ceremony, and then in the summer, \nwhen the appropriations process began, we were to not appropriate even \nclose to the amount of money we have authorized, all our talk the last \nfew weeks would be a hollow promise. We would be saying, yes, we care \nabout education, but we do not care enough about education to fund it.\n  All the things that make the public cynical about this city, and even \nabout this Chamber, would come to be realized in those two \ncontradictory acts: One, great debate and discussion about programs, \nand then later in the summer, no money to fund all the programs we are \ntalking about.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? It is certainly true that we do not \nalways appropriate every dollar we authorize. But it is quite glaring \nin the actions we have taken thus far. The President has run on a \nplatform as an education President. This Senate debates this bill and \nsays we are going to be the education Senate. Yet in the budget we \npassed--in the President's budget--the increase in the amount of money \nactually proposed for education is considerably less than last year and \nthe year before and the year before.\n  So are we serious or are we just fooling the American people? Is this \na real debate or is this just for show to make us feel good and make \nour constituents feel good? That is the fundamental question with which \nthis amendment deals.\n\n  I know there are many in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle who \nbelieve so strongly in this matter that they don't want to allow this \nbill to actually get to the President's desk until we see if there is \ngoing to be money for it.\n  This amendment that I have authored with the Senator from California \nsays that. It says, very simply, that we are going to put our money \nwhere all our verbiage has been. It says, very simply, that we care \nenough, as hard and tight as this budget is, that we are going to find \nroom to pay for quality teachers, to pay for special education.\n  It says we realize that the local property tax, which funds education \nthroughout America, is so high for almost all of our constituents that \nif we do not come to their aid, the quality of our schools will \ncertainly decline.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico has an amendment, but it is a \nmeaningless amendment; I do not know why he even offered it because all \nhis amendment says--let me read it--is: the Senate make funding \nconsistent with the President's budget.\n  I would not advise people to vote for it if they have been voting for \nthese increased programs because the President's budget does not fund \nthem.\n  I say to my colleagues, we just have finished 2 weeks of a debate \nwhere we have debated how this program should be changed, whether this \none should get $500 million or $600 million. That is not much when you \nconsider it is all of America, with the tens of millions of \nschoolchildren we have in this great country. How can we then just go \nahead and vote for the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico which \nsays we are not going to fund it? Because that is what Senator \nDomenici's amendment says. It says, we are not going to fund education \nto the extent that we have just voted in the last 2 weeks we should \nfund education.\n  Are we going to make this the bill of fulfilled dreams for so many \nschoolchildren or the bill of broken promises? That is what the \ncontrast is. The Schumer-Boxer amendment says we are going to try to \nhelp you reach your dream; we are going to help you fund your schools \nto make your schools better. The Domenici amendment says it is already \na broken promise even though we are voting for an authorization for the \nkids in special ed, which consumes such a high percentage of local \nschool budgets; for the kids in title I who need a little help to read \nup to grade level; for teacher quality so that our kids get the best \nteachers, and teaching is an elite profession in the 21st century. The \nSchumer amendment says we are going to deliver. The Domenici amendment \nsays we are not, so don't pay any attention to what we have done over \nthe last 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague and coauthor of this \namendment, the Senator from California, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. As \nusual, he has really cut through a lot of the fussiness surrounding \nthis debate and made the point clear. That is why I was so proud to \nteam up with him.\n  All we are saying in this amendment is, fund the programs you just \nvoted to fund. It is as simple as that. And just so everybody \nunderstands it, I will explain it one more time. In every program that \nwe put forward in the Federal Government, no matter what it is, you \nbasically have an authorization, which is the nod. It says to the \nappropriators: It is OK to fund the military up to this amount; it is \nOK to fund education up to this amount, highways up to this amount. \nThat is the authorization.\n  The next step that makes it all a reality is the funding, the actual \nfunding of those programs. That is called appropriations. So the \nSchumer-Boxer amendment simply says--and I am going to say it in his \nwords because they come from the heart and soul of Brooklyn, NY--put \nyour money where your mouth is.\n  Everyone understands what that means. We can all give the greatest \nspeeches coming out of our mouths--golden words, beautiful words. What \ndoes it mean if you do not back it up with reality, with substance, \nand, in this case, with funding?\n  It doesn't mean anything for amendments to pass and then not to fund \nthem. I guess the senatorial way to say it would be, fulfill your \ncommitments that you made on this ESEA bill. That is all it says.\n  We have been debating this for weeks. Senator Domenici's alternative \nto Schumer-Boxer essentially says: All this was wasted time. We are not \ngoing to fund all of this. We are just going to go back to the \nPresident's budget which shorts all of these programs.\n  The next chart shows what we have voted to fund in this bill. By the \nway, I have not included everything, but Senator Collins will recognize \nthis because she worked hard on some of these items. Senator Cochran \nwill recognize it because he worked hard on this, as well as Senators \nLincoln, Akaka, Mikulski, Reed, and Domenici. I worked\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nwith Senator Ensign. These are quite bipartisan. As a matter of fact, \nthe first one, title I, full funding, is a Dodd-Collins amendment. So \nlook at what we have done.\n  The authorizing level we just passed for the current year is $15 \nbillion, and the Bush budget is $9 billion. So there is a gap we need \nto fill. IDEA, which is for special education, the kids who need the \nhelp, it is funded at $8.8 billion for next year; the President's \nbudget is $7.3 billion. There is a shortfall. Continuing the list: \nTeacher quality, $3 billion compared to $2.6 billion; the Boxer-Ensign \nbill on afterschool, $1.5 billion compared to $846 million; grants for \nenhanced testing, $200 million, a new program; math and science \neducation, Dick Durbin's amendment, up $400 million; bilingual \neducation, up, that was Lincoln Chafee; small programs, Thad Cochran, \nthat is zero in the President's budget, $416 million here; economic \neducation, $10 million, a new program; community technology, $100 \nmillion to zero; school libraries, $500 million to zero in the Bush \nbudget; and mental health grants, I say to my friend, Senator Domenici, \n$50 million, a new program. He doesn't even say we ought to fund his \nown amendment. He says stick to the President's budget. He would not \nfund the program he brought here, and he worked with Senator Kennedy on \nit. It was done by unanimous consent. It was that popular.\n  So here we have it in black and white. This is only $10.4 billion. I \nunderstand the difference now is $12.3 billion because after we made \nthis chart, we approved some other programs.\n  I say to the Senator from New York and to the Senator from \nMassachusetts and to Senator Collins, who is managing the floor for the \nRepublicans: We have to do more than just say nice words. We have to do \nmore than stand here and say ``our children are our future.'' How many \nof us have said that? Probably all of us at one time, that we care \nabout them. We have to say more than just education is our priority. \nWhat we have to do is come behind those words with the resources.\n  This bill is about reform. If you want results, you need the \nresources. It is kind of like the three R's. This next chart is the \nessence of the Schumer-Boxer amendment. On our side of the aisle what \nwe are saying is--and we hope Republicans will join us--we want reform. \nWe have proven that by this bill. We want resources. We have proven \nthat by this amendment. And we expect results. We are going to hold \npeople accountable for results.\n  So far, our Republican friends support reform. But if they back the \nDomenici alternative to Schumer-Boxer, I think we can truly say they \ndon't support resources and they cannot possibly expect results.\n\n  Every one of these programs I have shown you has been brought to the \nSenate by various Senators. Now is the time when the rubber meets the \nroad. Another saying, one we hear a lot: The rubber meets the road. How \nare you going to bring into effect these wonderful programs, such as \nteacher quality, title I, grants for enhanced testing, math and \nscience, bilingual ed, small programs, economic education, community \ntechnology centers, school libraries, mental health clinics, \nafterschool programs, if you don't bring to the fore the resources? Or, \nsaid in a better way in the Schumer-Boxer amendment: It is the sense of \nthe Senate that Congress should appropriate all funds authorized for \nelementary and secondary education in fiscal year 2002.\n  To my colleagues who may be listening in their offices, if you vote \nagainst the Schumer-Boxer amendment, I have to say, I don't understand \nwhy you voted for this wonderful list of enhancements for our children. \nIt just does not make sense. We are saying, you voted for the \nauthorizing of these programs; now vote for the appropriations.\n  As my colleague Senator Schumer has stated: Some Members feel so \nstrongly about it, they did not even want to bring this bill to the \nfloor until we had a meeting of the minds with our Republican friends \nand the President that these programs would be funded or at least some \nof them would be funded.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, and give the thumbs up to this bill. You all say you like it. \nPresident Bush has held meetings. He has had Congressman Miller on one \nside and Ted Kennedy on the other. That is great. Photo ops are great. \nWe all love them. You show you are for the kids and then your budget \nfalls $12 billion short next year of what we need to do to carry out \nall this important work we have done over weeks and weeks on this bill.\n  I thank my colleague from New York. We have joined together, east \ncoast, west coast. We hope all those in the middle will join us and \ndefeat the Domenici amendment. If all we are going to do is appropriate \nthe money in the President's budget, we can't really do this.\n  The most important thing, regardless of what we do with Domenici, is \nto support the Schumer-Boxer amendment. That will show that we mean \nwhat we say and we say what we mean. And we should be a model to our \nchildren. I look up in the galleries and see a lot of kids here. They \nare watching us. We had better mean what we say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know my friend and colleague from Iowa \nwanted some time as well. I do not see him on the floor. Do I \nunderstand now I have up to 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes on the two \namendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The end is in sight in terms of the completion of this legislation \nand this phase of the legislative process. It has been on the floor now \nfor several weeks. We have had good debates on a number of very \nimportant measures. We still have some remaining items through the \nafternoon, hopefully recessing at a reasonable hour this evening. Then \nwe will have a full morning and early afternoon tomorrow with a series \nof amendments by Senators Helms, Murray, and Sessions. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to conclude the legislation by tomorrow at a reasonable \ntime.\n  It is appropriate, as we are coming into the final hours of \nconsideration of the legislation, to take stock of where we are, to \ntake stock of the legislation, and then to look down the road in terms \nof the future.\n  We are going to be completing this legislation. We will move to the \nconference with the House of Representatives, which has a somewhat \ndifferent approach than we have, but we have a fundamental agreement on \nwhat we are going to do. We will have an opportunity to address those \nissues and to find common ground with the House. Then we will come back \nhere with a final product.\n  I am strongly committed and will work very hard to make sure we are \ngoing to come back with a program that is going to, in this instance, \ninclude the funding for the IDEA programs, which make such a difference \nfor children in my State and across the country. By that I mean the \nmandatory spending for the IDEA. We have had bipartisan support to \ninclude that in the legislation. It was reflected here during the \ndiscussion, not only on that amendment but on others, as well, by \nRepublicans and Democrats. It is vitally important. It makes a great \ndeal of difference in terms of the results on this whole program.\n  When you take the funding of IDEA and also the funding in terms of \ntitle I, plus what we have done with other elements in terms of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and if we are going to move \ntoward a real funding and investment in our children, I think we have \nthe most unique opportunity we have had in recent times to make a major \ndifference in terms of the neediest children in our country. We should \nnot miss it.\n  What we have seen over the period of these past several weeks is the \nattempt to try and get it right in terms of working to make sure that \nchildren in local communities are going to have available to them \ntried, tested, and proven programs that can provide academic \nachievement and advancement. That is what this legislation is really \nall about. We know what needs to be done. The question is, do we have \nthe\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\nwillpower to be able to do it? That is what this amendment of Senator \nSchumer and Senator Boxer really is all about--to put the Senate on \nrecord in the final hours of this debate that we believe we need the \nresources made available to the children in this country that otherwise \nwould be denied it.\n  Mr. President, we have to understand that this legislation isn't \ngoing to solve all of the problems. We will be back in another 6 years \ntrying to deal with these issues again. But what the proponents of this \namendment understand is that what is really essential is the investment \nin the early education of the children of this country, to invest in \nEarly Start, Healthy Start, early learning, and children in terms of \nthe Head Start Program. We are strongly committed to that. We are all \nstrongly committed to the concept of having a child ready to learn when \nthey go into school. That is a given. The funding is not there. The \nfunding is not there for those programs.\n  Many of us are greatly disappointed because when we are talking about \nthe children, particularly the very small children and the children who \nwill be affected by this legislation, we are defining the future of \nthis Nation. We are defining the future of our democracy, the future of \nour economy, and the future of the relationships these individuals are \ngoing to have with their families.\n  This is about America's future. For my money, there isn't a more \nimportant investment that we can make. This is about our children and \nabout our future.\n  This chart reflects the progress we have made in recent times in the \nelementary and secondary education budget increases. We have seen that \nover the period of the last 7 years it has gone up by 8.6 percent. We \nhave heard it said that money isn't everything, money doesn't solve all \nthe problems, and let's not just throw money at education. We \nunderstand that. The fact is, though, the investment here is a clear \nreflection about our Nation's priorities.\n\n  As a matter of national priority, do we think investing in the \nneediest children in our country is a priority in which we ought to \ninvest?\n  This amendment says, yes, there is no higher priority. What we have \nhad and what we are looking at is the budget that has been proposed by \nthis administration, by this President, supported by this Republican \nParty and its Republican leadership. When you look at that record, the \nproposed ESEA budget increases that will be incorporated, this concept \nin the Domenici amendment, there is a 2.6 percent increase in 2002. \nThat is a $1 billion addition for IDEA and $700 million for the title I \nprogram--$700 million for the title I program.\n  We are only reaching a third of the children at the present time. And \nthen if you look at this chart for the years 2003, zero; 2004, zero; \n2005, zero; 2006, zero; 2007, zero; 2008, zero; 2009, zero; 2010 zero. \nThe number of children at the end of the next 10 years is going to be \nthe same number that we have at the present time. There will be no \nincrease in the total number of children who will be there, in contrast \nto the amendment of the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nCalifornia, which says we are going to build to make sure that if we do \nhave something in here, and the funding for the IDEA program, we are \ngoing to see an expansion in investing in those children. We are going \nto make sure that all of the children who are eligible--the 10 million \nchildren--will participate in the whole range of programs.\n  Who wants to make the choice today about which child is going to get \nsupplementary services and which will not, or which will get a summer \nschool program and which will not, or which will get the afterschool \nprogram and which one will not? What are we going to say about that? \nThis amendment says that our Nation's priorities are clear and they \nshould be expressed on the floor of the Senate in a bipartisan way.\n  Seventy percent of the Members of this body, Republican and Democrats \nalike, supported the idea for full funding for the title I program. We \nhave brought about the reforms that many of the critics have stated. \nThe real question is, are we going to be true to the concept that we \nare going to leave no child behind? Without this amendment, and without \nthe resources here, we are leaving two out of three children behind, \nmake no mistake about it.\n  Finally, in our elementary and secondary education bill, we \neffectively guarantee that every child that is eligible for the title I \nprogram in the ESEA will reach proficiency by the time this legislation \nexpires. That is an empty promise if we are only going to fund this \nprogram to reach one out of three. We should not represent to the \nAmerican people that we are committed to not leaving children behind if \nwe are not going to back that up with the kinds of American resources \nthat we have available at this time and which should be invested in \nthese children. That is the way I read this amendment.\n  I thank the Senators for bringing this measure up. I hope it is going \nto get strong support because it is really a reflection of the kind of \ncommitment that this body has for the future of our Nation and, most \nimportant, the future of the children of our country.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, with the time not to be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 801, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \namendment I send to the desk be a substitute for the amendment that has \nbeen previously stated to be a Domenici amendment. This is the Domenici \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AUTHORIZATIONS.\n\n       Findings.--\n       (1) This bill currently authorizes at least $30 billion in \n     discretionary spending on elementary and secondary education \n     programs in fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Over the 2002-8 period, this bill authorizes more than \n     $300 billion for these same programs.\n       (3) Congress currently provides $18.4 billion for these \n     same programs.\n       It is therefore the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The Appropriations Committee shall fund the \n     authorizations in this bill to the maximum extent possible.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to read this to everyone so there \nwill be an understanding of where we are.\n  First, I did not have enough time this afternoon or I would have \nsearched the records of legislation we passed that comes out of \ncommittees that have authorizing authority. Clearly, the committee that \nreported this bill that has been debated so mightily on or about May 3, \nwith intervening time used for some other bills, is an authorizing \ncommittee. There is no authority in the committee that my good friend \nSenator Kennedy chairs to appropriate money. I do not think anybody \nwill argue with that point.\n  The appropriators each year appropriate money in various \nappropriations bills, one of which will contain the appropriated money \nfor education.\n  What we have been doing in the meantime on this education bill is \nvery typical of what we do on any new authorization bill.\n  People bring to the floor amendments to the authorizing bill that \nsays we want to authorize a different program with different amounts of \nmoney covering different groups of people so that historically in the \nU.S. Congress, whenever authorizing legislation has been passed, it is, \nfor the most part, substantially higher than the amount appropriated by \nthe Appropriations Committee, which has the single and sole authority \nto appropriate money.\n  I do not believe anyone is going to stand in this Chamber today and \nsay the education committee appropriated this money and each Senator \nwho offered an amendment that was voted on, whether it was adopted 95-0 \nor by 2 votes, whatever the case may be--nobody is going to say that \namendment was appropriating money, making money available to the \nDepartment of Education to do certain things.\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\n  Those amendments and the basic underlying bill create a policy or an \nauthorizing gamut from which the appropriators fund some or all of what \nis in authorizing legislation.\n  We have set about in the Senate to adopt many amendments. I am quite \ncertain that when the appropriations bill comes to the floor, if we \nwant to take every one of these amendments and stand up before the \nSenate and say, ``I want to offer this amendment to the appropriations \nbill because I want to add more money,'' I am sure it will be \nconsidered. The question is, will it be adopted? The question is, will \nit be automatic? I think the answer is, we do not know whether it will \nbe adopted when it comes to appropriating, and certainly there is no \nquestion that it has not yet been appropriated.\n  I say in this amendment--and I think everybody who is concerned about \neducation funding ought to vote for it--the following: This bill before \nus, without the remaining amendments that are still to be adopted, \ncurrently authorizes at least $30 billion in discretionary spending for \nelementary and secondary education programs in fiscal year 2002--$30 \nbillion at least that we voted on in the bill and with the authorizing \namendments.\n  Likewise, if you take the multiple years covered by this \nauthorization bill, 2002 to 2008, the bill authorizes more than $300 \nbillion for these same programs, the ones we are currently funding in \nthe next finding I made. Currently we are funding these programs at \n$18.4 billion a year. We are almost doubling that, and then over a \nnumber of years we are more than doubling the funding that is currently \nbeing applied to these programs.\n  After I make these findings, I conclude very simply:\n\n       It is therefore the Sense of the Senate that: The \n     Appropriations Committee shall fund the authorizations in \n     this bill to the maximum extent possible.\n\n  That means that is exactly what is going to happen, and we ought to \ngo ahead and recognize it and urge the appropriators to do this. It \ndoes not matter what we say in this bill. Unless we choose to take over \nthe reins of appropriating and put it in this bill, it does not matter \nwhat we vote for, it matters what the appropriators give to fund this \nbill.\n  They already know that whatever the budget is, education is given the \nhighest priority. In fact, education of a comparable nature to what I \nhave been speaking of goes up 11.4 percent in the basic budget of the \nPresident and in the basic budget that was adopted by the Congress.\n  Even those numbers are not binding because the appropriators will \ndecide out of all the priorities how much they want to take away from \nother programs or exceed the budget to put more of that in education. \nThat is the prerogative of the committee with the consensus and, in \nsome instances, perhaps a 60-vote majority being required. The Senate \nand the House will decide how much of the authorizing bill that is \ngoing to be adopted either Friday or next week shall be funded by the \nappropriators.\n  I certainly do not come before the Senate saying I know which \nprograms ought to be funded by the appropriators. I happen to be on the \nAppropriations Committee, but in due course they will have their own \nhearings, as we do all the time. This is not a rarity, to pass an \nauthorizing bill that has much more in it than the appropriators pay \nfor, and they are not doing anything wrong by not funding it as much as \nis authorized. That is the prerogative of the appropriators.\n  In simple language, I hope everybody who is interested in maximizing \nthe appropriation of money to the education programs, all of which are \nencapsulated in this bill which Senator Kennedy has been managing since \nthey took the majority and Senator Judd Gregg has managed on our side--\nit is a very good bill, one that for the first time has some major \nchanges. We might, in fact, look back in a few years and say that bill \nthat was debated all those days caused us to do some things very \ndifferently than we have in the past. Who knows, if you listen to the \nPresident, if you listen to some in this Chamber who advocate these new \nideas, it may very well be that we will have improved the results of \nour National Government's money going to States for school systems that \nare either run by the district or by county.\n  I compliment those who have participated in this bill. I voted for a \nnumber of the amendments, but certainly the truth is that the \nAppropriations Committee will decide how much of that they can afford \nunder the budget they will have before them, and the Senate will decide \non an appropriations bill as the matter comes up: How many more of \nthese new programs do you want to fund in the year 2002?\n  I believe the Senate has adopted many provisions that will not be \nfunded. Certainly, I am not talking about title I, but I am talking \nabout many of the amendments, maybe even some that this Senator has \noffered that are part of this very large authorizing bill. But I will \nnot be surprised if some of those I have offered and some of those \nothers have offered will not be funded by the appropriators as we work \nour way through the 13 appropriations bills.\n  It is all right with me if Senators want to say everything else will \nhave to be reduced and changed because we are going to fund in \nappropriations every single amendment that has been offered to this \nbill, we will fund them in their entirety. If one wants to vote for \nthat, that is fine. Perhaps one can vote for that, and perhaps one can \nvote for the Domenici amendment that says, do the maximum \nappropriators; do the maximum amount you can under the budget \nrestraints you will be living under as appropriators.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for the courtesy. The Senator from \nCalifornia and I offered this amendment not for every time the \nauthorization strays from the appropriation--we know it does that a \nlot--but for two reasons: One, we wish to make education a top \npriority. That is what the President has said, that is what some \nMembers in speeches have said. Yet when we look at what has been newly \nauthorized, it brings us to a level of $37 billion.\n  What is in the budget that the then-chair of the Budget Committee \nproposes was $20.1 billion, which is only $1.7 billion higher than last \nyear? So I ask my friend from New Mexico to give a little elaboration \non what the phrase ``to the maximum extent possible'' means. Is only \n$1.7 billion possible? We have walled off military spending in the \nbudget the good Senator has proposed. We have a separate offset for \nagriculture.\n  The Senator from California and I fear, if left on its own, education \nwill get no new funding or very little new funding and this debate will \nbe for naught. I ask my colleague to elaborate, since he is our expert \nfrom that side of the aisle on the budget, what does ``to the maximum \nextent possible'' mean? How much money is left for education? Is it \ncloser to the $37 billion level in this authorization or to what I \nconsider very small and not sufficient $20 billion, a $1.7 billion \nincrease over last year?\n  I thank the Senator for yielding for that question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask the Senator if he has better numbers than I \ndo. The bill currently authorizes at least 30. Are you suggesting that \nis 37? I will live with your numbers. Does the Senator think it is $37 \nbillion we have authorized in this bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to my colleague, it is probably a little more than \n37, but we added up everything we could get our hands on, and it comes \nto 37.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's say it is somewhere between 30 and 37 and perhaps \neven between 30 and 40 is authorized in this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield, I think that number is less \nimportant than the number that we think we will actually appropriate. \nThat is the purpose of the amendment.\n  In the budget we have only appropriated an additional $1.7 billion as \nopposed to $20 billion more that is authorized. I would like to come \ncloser to the $20 billion than the $1.7 billion, particularly if we \nwant to be the ``education Senate,'' particularly if the President \nwants to be the ``education President.''\n  In talking about education, pictures going to school are not going to \neducate our kids. It is the real dollars that do. I ask my colleague, \njust with his\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nknowledge, which far exceeds my knowledge, to give us some ballpark of \nwhat ``to the maximum extent possible,'' might mean.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First of all, I am certainly not trying to avoid that. \nI am very prepared to answer it. If you will relax for a minute and let \nme answer it, we will all have a nice afternoon.\n  First, let me say it may shock everyone to hear this, but frankly the \nAppropriations Committee will decide what that number is. In all \nhonesty, they will decide that. But they won't decide it based on this \nauthorization bill. They will do it based upon what they want to \nestablish as the priorities for expenditures for fiscal year 2002.\n\n  But if the Senator wants to know what numbers were offered by the \nbudget as it cleared the Congress--and these are not binding; these are \nassumptions--then I will tell you that the budget resolution assumed \n$6.2 billion more than the President. So it is $6.2 billion added to \n$18.4 billion which makes it a total of $24.6 billion that is assumed \nin the budget resolution as being fundable.\n  I am not going to stand here and say they will fund that much, nor am \nI going to say they will fund that little. The truth is, unless the \nSenate chose today to pass a statute and it got signed by the President \nand it said the appropriators are going to appropriate and they are \nhereby ordered to appropriate the amount of money contained in this \nbill, then there is nothing we can do about it. They are going to do \nwhat they think is right based upon the available resources and what \nthe Senate at large decides as these appropriations come forward.\n  I did not come to the floor to prejudge what they would do. I came to \nthe floor to make sure everybody understands that an authorizing bill \nis very different than an appropriations bill. It has been different \nforever. I shouldn't say forever, but essentially for about 70 years we \nhave had both appropriations and authorizations. They really are not \nthe same. I regret to say we have even appropriated when there is no \nauthorization for many parts of our Government. We have not authorized \nfor years and the appropriators pay for the function of Government \nanyway.\n  I am comfortable that this Senate and the Appropriations Committee \nwill maximize, as I indicated, the resources they put into education. I \nam confident because it has been the will of this Senate over and over \nas we vote that we put more rather than less in education. So I think \nthat will happen.\n  Having said that, I think it is pretty clear that ``maximum'' is a \ndictionary definition. It is not a number definition. It just says the \nmost you can. Whatever you are looking at, do to the extent possible. \nDo the most for education. That is what I put in my resolve clause \nbecause I think, honestly, to vote for anything other than that is to \ndeny the reality of what is going to happen, prejudged, preordained by \nthe rules we follow in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas yielded to me his 10 minutes. How much time remains on our side, \nwhich I believe is my time plus the time of the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 12 minutes. The \nSenator from New Mexico has 4 minutes 12 seconds. The Senator from New \nHampshire has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask my colleague from New Hampshire if he wants to \ntake some of his time now since we are down on our side and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has the full 20 minutes, unless he desires to yield \nmost of it back. I will take 5 minutes, and I know the Senator from \nCalifornia will take 5 minutes, and that is it. We are finished on our \nside.\n  Mr. GREGG. I say to the Senator from New York, that seems reasonable. \nI will speak for a few minutes and reserve time. I will reserve 10 \nminutes to balance out with that side.\n  We are into a numbers game obviously. I am not sure that will have a \npositive impact on how this bill is perceived because the essence of \nthis bill is the policy. Authorizing bills are about policy. I think \npeople need to understand that. Authorizing committees tend to put \nnumbers on bills but appropriating committees spend the money.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I can state that as much \nas we admire the authorizing committees, sometimes we act independently \nof the authorizing committee. The key to an authorizing bill is the \npolicy that is laid down relative to educational reform.\n  In this bill, there is a lot of very interesting, very significant \npolicy, the purpose of which is to depart from a course that has \nregrettably produced year after year of failure in educating our low-\nincome children, and move on a course which will hopefully give our \nchildren from low-income families a better opportunity to learn and be \ncompetitive with their peers, and therefore participate in America and \nthe prosperity of our Nation.\n  The basic themes of the policy in this bill, as I have outlined a \nnumber of times, is that it is child centered. It involves giving more \nflexibility to local communities and the teachers and the parents and \nthe principals. In exchange for that flexibility, it builds in a desire \nto see much greater academic achievement on the part of low-income kids \nwho today, regrettably, read at two or three grade levels less than \ntheir peers and graduate at a 50-percent rate from high school. It has \nsignificant accountability standards to make sure those academic \nachievements are accomplished.\n  The policy in this bill is strong. It is unique in the sense of the \ntradition of Federal involvement in education in that it takes a new \nroad to a large degree.\n  The authorizing levels in this bill, however, are really not that \nrelevant to what is going to happen, in my humble opinion. The reason I \nsay that is because it has become almost a form of gamesmanship on this \nfloor to constantly throw more money into the number at the authorizing \nlevel. All you have to do is look at what we have done in the last few \nweeks to recognize that.\n  Over the last few weeks we have added into this budget, into this \nbill, literally huge increases in the authorized level. We have \nincreased the authorization level by 47 percent in the mandatory area, \nadding $112 billion. Over the term of the bill, which would be 7 years, \nwe have added $211 billion, for a 101-percent increase.\n  In the year 2000, we have increased the authorizing level by $11 \nbillion, bringing the total to $38.8 billion, or a 120-percent \nincrease. That has all been done in about a week's time, maybe a week \nand a half, as we picked up speed over the last few days.\n  We need to put that in context. This bill has been on this floor \nbefore. We have heard from the other side that we have to authorize and \nthen we have to appropriate to the highest level possible to achieve \nthe most significant results because money translates into achievement. \nOf course we know money doesn't translate into achievement. But even if \nwe were to accept that argument, and we were to go back a few years--\nfor example, the last time this bill was authorized, back in 1994-\n1995--we would find the enthusiasm for bumping up the authorizations \nwhen we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress was not \nquite so high. It could have been at that time they were dealing with \nreality versus politics.\n  At that time, when the authorizing bill came through, the ESEA \nauthorizing bill came through, the actual increase in educational \nspending that resulted from it was .012 percent--.012 percent. In fact, \nthe actual educational funding was cut in that year by $484 million. \nThe increase in title I specifically was less than 6 percent in that \nyear.\n  You might say there was a deficit then so Congress had to be much \nmore restrained in its activity. But I would point out that at that \ntime the Senator from Massachusetts represented that the bill as it was \npassed and authorized--remember the authorization levels were \nessentially no increase at all--he said it was the most important \nreauthorization of ESEA since that landmark act was passed in 1965. So, \nobviously, at that time at least the chairman of the committee thought \nit achieved the goals it was supposed to have achieved. In fact, he \nwent on to hail its academic accountability standards. It would achieve \nthose levels at the levels it was authorized or else he would not have \nsaid it was such a great bill.\n  I do not know what has changed in 6 years, other than we have a \ndifferent\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nPresident and a different Congress. Yes, we do have a surplus. But as a \npractical matter, if the bill was so good and strong when there was \nvirtually no authorization increase, why today do we have to have an \nauthorization increase which has, just in 7 days, jumped so radically? \nRemember when this bill came out of committee the authorization \nincreases in it were already exceeding 100 percent of what the \nunderlying authorized levels were when we started out. So we are \ntalking about 100 percent on top of 100 percent.\n\n  I also note if spending on education has to be so aggressively \npursued in order to accomplish the goals of better education, somebody \nmust not have informed the prior President of that. The prior \nPresident's increases in title I spending, President Clinton's \nincreases, were rather small--not only during the period that we had a \ndeficit but during the period that we had the surplus, from 1998-1999. \nIn the period of surplus, the increased proposal was $36 million; in \n1999 his increased proposal was $219 million; in the year 2000-2001 he \nproposed a $401 million increase in title I funding.\n  In the area of special education, he essentially proposed no increase \nin 1998, 1999, 1999-2000, and then in 2000-2001 he proposed an \nincrease.\n  As a practical matter, President Clinton, who I believe was committed \nto education--in fact, when I was Governor and he was Governor we held \nan education conference down in Charlottesville, as I recall--was one \nof the leaders on the issue. I state he certainly maintained that view \nthroughout his Presidency. He thought he could accomplish his goals on \neducation during a period of surplus with the dollars he outlined.\n  What is President Bush suggesting? I think that brings us sort of \ninto a complete circle. President Bush has suggested a very significant \nincrease in funding. Remember, President Clinton's request was $401 \nmillion. President Bush's funding request in this area is $500 million. \nThat was his request.\n  In negotiations leading up to bringing this bill to the floor, the \nPresident went well beyond that request and, in fact, has offered an \nincrease in title I funding which represents a 50-percent increase in \nfunding in 1 year.\n  In the special education area, President Bush has proposed the \nlargest single increase ever proposed by a President in special \neducation funding. President Bush has proposed a 50-percent increase, \nor offered a 50-percent increase in title 1 funding as part of the \nnegotiations leading up to this bill. He has proposed in his budget a \n$500 million increase, which is $100 million more than President \nClinton proposed, and he has proposed the single largest increase in \nspecial education funding ever proposed by a President.\n  It is reasonably disingenuous to take the position that this \nPresident isn't committed to education on the policy side, and also on \nthe spending side, to support that policy, because he has walked the \nwalk and made the proposals to accomplish it, which brings us to the \nquestion of what is the purpose of this sense of the Senate amendment.\n  It is to ask the appropriating committee to fully fund authorizations \nwhich have come at us on this floor for the last 5 or 7 or 8 days--it \nhas in actuality been 14 days since we really went on the bill in an \nintense way--authorizations which, as I mentioned earlier, represent in \nthose few days an over 120-percent increase in this year's budget, a \n100-percent increase in the 7-year budget representing $211 billion, \nand a 47-percent increase in special education funding. I think you are \ngoing to have trouble with the appropriating committee to accomplish \nthat. We have to be realistic.\n  I suppose when the defense authorizers come to the floor they might \noffer the same type of SOS, and they might say we want defense \nauthorizations fully appropriated also. They would probably have a \npretty good case for that because the obligation of the National \nGovernment is national defense.\n  Then I suspect when the health committee, which I happen to be a \nmember of, and which this committee comes out of, comes forward with \nthe authorization levels for NIH, for which we have significantly \nincreased the appropriations, or for some other health activity which \nis very important, such as prescription drugs, or whatever the item \nmight be, we are going to ask for full appropriations their, too.\n  The list goes on and on. The obligations of the Federal Government \nare significant.\n  But when you increase the authorizations on the floor of the Senate \nby 120 percent in 7 days on a bill that came out which had almost a \n100-percent increase in it to begin with, and you increase the \nauthorization by $200 billion on a bill which came out with already \n$235 billion in it when it hit the floor, which was a significant \nincrease, a dramatic increase over present law, I think you are making \na statement: Yes; that you want a commitment to education, but I think \nyou are also probably acknowledging realistically that you are never \ngoing to hit those goals.\n  It is just not reasonable to expect that the appropriations committee \nis going to have that type of change sitting in its pocket to move into \nthis area. But when the President of the United States comes forward \nand says he is committed to a 50-percent increase in funding for title \nI, that is pretty significant.\n  When the President of the United States comes forward and offers the \nbiggest increase in history that a President has ever asked in special \neducation, I think the Appropriations Committee will take that \nposition.\n  In the end, I believe these accounts will receive the very \nsignificant dramatic increases that they deserve. In fact, it is very \nobvious from the President's proposal that the education accounts are \ngoing to receive the largest rate increase ever by a factor probably of \n100 percent or maybe more--200 or 300 percent--of any accounts in the \nFederal Government. The only agency that will probably be able to \ncompete and the only area where competition will be even close will be \nNIH where we are committed to doubling funding over a period of time. \nBut I don't think even the NIH increases as a percentage are going to \nbe anywhere near the percentage of increases we are going to see coming \nas a result of this President's commitment to education.\n  Once again, I suspect that this amendment, although well-intentioned, \nis going a bit beyond what reality is as far as the Congress functions \nbecause I think we all understand that the appropriating committees do \nnot necessarily listen to authorizing committees when it comes to \nmoney. Authorizing committees define policy. That is our primary \nresponsibility. We have done a good job of it in this bill.\n  Because of the President's commitment in this area, I am pretty \nconfident that the appropriating committee will make a dramatic \nincrease in the spending commitment to education which will allow us to \naccomplish policies that we hopefully are going to pass with this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nHampshire have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 and a \nhalf minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is really where the rubber \nmeets the road. Are we serious about the work we have accomplished? I \nwent over this in great detail. I don't know if the Chair can read this \nfrom his seat. I have listed all the bipartisan programs that we have \nadded to this bill, beautiful programs such as IDEA, increasing \nfunding, teacher quality, some of these my colleague worked very hard \non himself, mental health programs, these were all added in a \nbipartisan fashion. It adds up here to $10 billion more than is in the \nBush budget. We know that we even have done more.\n  The Schumer-Boxer amendment is important because what we say is all \nof this hard work, all of this coming together, all of this \nbipartisanship, all of this work for the children of America should be \nfunded. Very simply put, that is exactly what Senator Schumer and I are \ndoing in this amendment. It is a sense of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\n  What is the argument that the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, \nhas lodged against the Schumer-Boxer amendment? First he looked at the \nSenator from New York, and I guess the Senator will remember, and he \nsaid: I hope the Senator from New York will relax and we will all have \na happy afternoon. Then he went on to say: It is impossible to fund \nthis. That is not a happy afternoon for any of us who care about kids. \nBut I also want to say to my friend from New York, do not relax until \nevery child in New York, every child in New Jersey, every child in \nCalifornia, every child in Mississippi, Louisiana and every other State \nhas a good quality public education.\n  I hope you will not listen to that advice. I hope you will stay \nfocused, as you always do, on these issues and keep giving us these \nkinds of amendments so we make sure we mean what we say and we say what \nwe mean.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said some other things too. He said to \nthe Senator from New York and to the Senator from California: You can't \ntell the Appropriations Committee what to do. That is ridiculous. And \nin your amendment you are saying, fund these programs to the extent of \nthe authorization. We are not telling them what to do. We are passing a \nsense of the Senate.\n  One, we are not telling them what to do. We are asking them to \nconsider the sense of the Senate that these programs should be fully \nfunded.\n  I want to make another point and I wish the Senator from New Mexico \nwas on the floor. His comments were really disingenuous. He was \nchairman of the Budget Committee when the Budget Committee came out \nwith the budget. Do you know what he did? My friend from New York knows \nit well. He not only set the size of the tax cut, which the Finance \nCommittee has jurisdiction over, but he also made that whole debate \nfilibuster-proof. Did he tell us what to do? Oh, yes, he did. Did he \nalso make sure that agriculture spending would be protected? He sure \ndid. Do you know that the chairman of the Budget Committee had the \nauthority to decide the increases in agriculture, not the \nAppropriations Committee, and do you know that the chairman of the \nBudget Committee--it is no longer Senator Domenici; it is now Senator \nConrad, a sort of twist of fate--said that the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is now going to decide how much we are going to spend on the \nmilitary. So when the Senator from New Mexico chastises the Senator \nfrom New York and the Senator from California and says----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the Senator from California one additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when the Senator from New Mexico tells \nthese two Senators--who have a simple sense of the Senate that we agree \nonly carries moral authority, doesn't tell them exactly what to do--we \nare overstepping our bounds, I have to say that is amazing to me \nbecause that is coming from my friend--I served with him on the Budget \nCommittee for many years--who actually gave power to the chairmen of \nthe committees to say what the appropriate level should be for military \nspending and ag expending. I do not see it.\n  You will note, that committee did not stand up for education. They \nsaid we could have a piece of the extra $6 billion that may be lying \naround. All we are saying is, give education a chance to be fully \nfunded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope my colleagues will support the Schumer amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my friend and \ncolleague, our leader on education, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair tell me when there are 30 seconds \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what this debate is really about is \nwhether we, as a body, are going to be satisfied with the budget that \nhas been proposed by the President and the Republicans that gives a $1 \nbillion increase in IDEA and a $700 million increase for the title I \nprogram, or whether we are going to try to fund ESEA, the title I \nprogram, for the full funding, whether we are going to fund ESEA the \nway bipartisan votes over the last 3 days have indicated is the desire \nof this body.\n  I hear a great deal about the budget, but the budget isn't law. Do we \nunderstand that? The budget isn't law. In this body, we have the \nability and the power--if we believe in something--to pass legislation \nthat is going to fund the programs the way they should be funded. That \nis what this battle is about.\n  With all respect to my good friend from New Mexico, his proposal is a \ncop-out. It says: As much as possible. We know what is possible. He was \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. They are going to follow the \nBudget Committee, and that is going to be peanuts for educating the \nchildren of this country. You cannot educate children with a tin cup. \nYou cannot do it on the cheap. You have to invest in them.\n  That is what the Schumer amendment is all about. That is why, if we \nbelieve that education is important, and that we want to reach all of \nthe children--not just a third--if you want to reach just a third in \nfiscal year 2008, you vote with Senator Domenici. That is exactly what \nyou are going to do. But don't make any more speeches about ``we are \nnot going to leave any child behind.'' Put those speeches away. Put \nthose speeches away forever. That is what this vote is about.\n  We have the opportunity of funding it so no child is left behind. It \nis as simple as that. One is just a cop-out. The other is a \nreaffirmation and statement of what has happened in the Senate Chamber \nover the period of these past weeks. And it is a statement and a \ncomment that we are going to commit ourselves to work every single day \nfor the remaining time of this session, and during the appropriations \nbattles, and after that every single time, to invest in the children \nand the future of this Nation. That is what the Schumer amendment is \nall about. That is why it should be supported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. One day, if I am here a long time, I might be able to \nreach 10 percent of his eloquence. And I would be happy with that. He \nsums it up just perfectly.\n  Let me say, first, in reference to my good friend from New Mexico, he \nsays the budget does not have room to appropriate all that is \nauthorized. In the budget he put together, they walled off military \nspending, they walled off transportation spending, they walled off \nagriculture spending. They said they are going to get what they need.\n  What is really wounding to those of us who believe so much in \neducation is not simply that education was not walled off but the \ndoublespeak that is going on in this Capitol.\n  The President did not campaign as the military President. He did not \ncampaign as the agriculture President. He is not busy taking pictures \nwith big trucks as the transportation President. He campaigned as the \neducation President.\n  Then they hand up a budget whose increase in actual spending is \nmiserly. To say this is doublespeak is kind. This is why the American \npeople despise Washington, because there are all the photo \nopportunities and all the slogans, and then when it comes to actually \nputting the money on the table to help keep our country No. 1--by \neducating it--we come up with 100 excuses.\n  Where are the excuses for the military? Where are the excuses for \nagriculture? Where are the excuses for transportation? This is just not \nright. This is just not fair.\n  We spent 2 weeks debating education in a bipartisan way. We talked \nabout how we are coming together. And then we find that the amount of \nmoney the budget will allow is a $1.7 billion increase. That is what \nthe President proposed? Less than President Clinton, much less than \nPresident Clinton's increase in the previous 3 years when we had a \nsurplus.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\n  If you don't want to fund education, don't say you are the \n``education President.'' If you don't want to fund education, don't say \nyou are the ``education Senate.'' Don't talk about leaving no child \nbehind when you are leaving 80 percent of the children behind with this \nbudget.\n  Is this amendment that the Senator from California and I have put \ntogether a foolproof amendment? Is it foolproof? No. It is a sense of \nthe Senate. It is saying: Let's live up to our promises, our promises \nnot to ourselves but our promises to the children of America and the \npeople of America who we said we were going to help.\n  This amendment simply says: Put your money where your mouth is. Don't \ngive a lot of speeches, don't do a lot of photo opportunities unless \nyou spend it. We know they can do it if they want. The Domenici \namendment, which says ``do as much as possible,'' is the most elastic \ncheck I have ever seen. No one will cash it.\n  So, my colleagues, I urge a ``no'' vote on the Domenici amendment, \nwhich will not provide the necessary funding for our kids, and a \n``yes'' vote on the Schumer-Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is that all the time remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is all the time remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the energy of the Senator from \nNew York, but I cannot agree with his position. The fact is, we finally \nhave a President who is focused on education, who is focused on the \nfact that we, as a nation, and as a federal government, have totally \nfailed in our responsibility to low-income children. We have spent over \n$120 billion of taxpayers' money, and we have still left the low-income \nchild behind in America.\n  We finally have a President who has said: No longer are we going to \ntolerate this. We are not going to tolerate taking taxpayers' money and \nallegedly using it to benefit the low-income child, and finding out \nthat generation after generation of low-income children have not been \nable to realize the American dream because they have not been able to \nget an education. We have a President who has finally stood up for the \nlow-income child and his or her right to receive a decent education in \nour country.\n  We brought a bill to this Chamber. It isn't exactly what I wanted, I \nknow it isn't exactly what the other side wanted, but it has, as its \nessence, the elements that will bring about some significant changes in \nthe way we deliver education in this country, especially on behalf of \nlow-income children. And, more importantly--or equally as important--\nthe President has said: I am going to support that policy with dollars. \nHe has put on the table more dollars than the prior President ever put \non the table, by a factor, in the area of title I, of about, by my \ncalculations, 10. In the area of special ed, he has proposed the single \nlargest increase ever proposed by a President.\n  The simple fact is, this President has backed up his commitment to \neducation with a commitment of dollars. What we have seen on the floor \nfor the last 12 days is a lot of Members who want to put out a press \nrelease saying they have increased it even more. And so they know when \nwe are using authorization money, that we are using funny money to some \ndegree. The real money comes out of the Appropriations Committee. We \nknow that when the Appropriations Committee meets, it is going to make \nits decisions no matter what the authorization committee says because \nthat is the way it has worked around here since time immemorial, or at \nleast in this century.\n  As a practical matter, what we can do that is constructive is pass a \ngood bill that has good policy and also make it clear to the \nAppropriations Committee that we expect them to fund education to the \nfullest extent possible, which is what the Domenici amendment requests \nand what is reasonable.\n  We have somebody backing us up on this, and that is the President, \nwho has already said that the number proposed in the budget is \nsomething he is going to exceed, again by a factor of potentially 10, \nor somewhere in that range, in the area of title I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico had an additional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from New Mexico has yielded his time to me, so \nI claim the Senator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the time and ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDomenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nSchumer-Boxer amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, 4 minutes is evenly \ndivided between the Senators from New York and the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I assume I have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 1 minute to my colleague on this amendment, the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have been working for 7 or 8 weeks on \nthis bill. What is wonderful about it is we have worked on it under the \nRepublican leadership and now under the Democratic leadership. What we \nhave done is quite extraordinary. We have truly made education a \npriority in this Nation.\n  This chart lists all of the good things we have added to this bill \nover and above the Bush budget. Members from both sides of the aisle \nhave added these amendments, whether afterschool, IDEA, title I, \nteacher quality. I don't even have time to go through the whole list in \na minute.\n  In our amendment, the Schumer-Boxer amendment, we are saying we \nshould fund this bill. We should fund these programs. We should lift \nthese kids up and deliver on the rhetoric and the promises we have \nmade.\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\n  It is a very simple amendment. I urge the support of Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It says we \nought to do what we say we are going to do. We have made and the \nPresident has made education a hallmark of this election campaign and \nthis new Congress, beginning in Washington. It would be the cruelest of \nbroken promises to have a debate for weeks and then not actually \nappropriate the money we say we are going to appropriate.\n  The present budget resolution cannot do it. It has a paltry $1.7 \nbillion increase, not enough to even do one-quarter of what we say we \nare going to do on title I, let alone all the other priorities.\n  If Members want to put their money where their mouth is, if Members \nwant to give the people in America faith in the system, that we do not \njust debate things but we do things, Members will vote for this \namendment that says it is the sense of the Senate that we ought to \nappropriate what we are authorizing. This is for the kids of America. I \nurge a bipartisan vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it has been the history of the Senate \nthat we authorize legislation and we appropriate or pay for legislation \nthat has been adopted. In this case, this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution stands that on its head and says, whatever it is we voted on \nto be authorized, we shall fund. The appropriators shall pay for it.\n  Now, historically we always authorize more than we can afford. We are \ndoing the same thing in this bill. As a matter of fact, if that sense \nof the Senate were adopted, we would increase education 100 percent in \nthe first year--not 10, not 20, not 30, but 100 percent. Over the next \n7 years, we would increase it by $300 billion. This has nothing to do \nwith the President's commitments. It has to do with the Senate taking a \ntypical authorization bill and adding all kinds of nice, good, \nwholesome, wonderful amendments that we are not going to pay for \nbecause we don't have the money. The appropriators will pay for what \nthey can afford. We cannot tell the appropriators in advance; they have \na myriad of programs to look at in terms of priorities, and we would be \ntelling them it is the sense of the majority of Members saying: \nAppropriators, you will; you shall; there is no escape; you will pay \nfor every amendment that has been adopted as if it were appropriated.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed, I am pleased to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while I support many of the provisions in \nthis bill, and I support increased Federal aid for education, I think \nthis amendment is premature. I did not vote for the previous amendment \nupon which the Senate just acted. At this time, appropriators have no \nidea what the conference report on this bill will resemble. We have no \nidea what the final dollar amount for this bill will be. We may not \nknow that final amount for several weeks. It would be misleading to \ncommit to any particular dollar figure before we see where the \nconference report on this bill shows us to be. To do otherwise is to \nask the Appropriations Committee to buy a pig in a poke.\n  I will not support this amendment. I did not support the previous \namendment.\n  To jump in now and to commit to an unknown funding level, I think, as \nan appropriator, is irresponsible. As an appropriator, I cannot do \nthat. I will not do that. And if this continues, we will see more and \nmore of these amendments that try to put the Senate on record and \ncommitting the Appropriations Committee to bind itself to a money \nfigure before we really know all the facts.\n  Resources are scarce this year and we will have to stretch and strain \nto meet this Nation's needs. Premature commitments will only make the \ndifficult job of appropriating more difficult. To use an old West \nVirginia expression: I'll roll up my britches when I get to the creek. \nWe will do the best we can when we have more information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 800. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand, if there is going to be \na little lull in the routine right now, I thought I would take \nadvantage of this opportunity to advise the Senate that, at my request, \nthe managers' amendment, No. 585, to this bill includes a new provision \nin the Early Reading First Program. The Early Reading First Program is \ndesigned to improve the language and early literacy development of \nchildren ages 3 through 5. Reading, as we all know, is the most \nimportant and fundamental skill for children to learn.\n  This new provision in the bill will allow the use of Federal funds \nand authorize the appropriation of funds for dissemination of a reading \nreadiness screening tool that is based on top quality research for \nchildren in this age group.\n  The National Council on Learning Disabilities has developed such a \ntool which is based on the report and research that was reviewed by the \nNational Reading Panel.\n  To acquaint the Senate with the work that has been done in this area, \nthe National Reading Panel was created at our suggestion as a result of \nlegislation that was introduced back in 1997. Subsequently, the report \naccompanying the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor-HHS and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act called on the National Institute of Child Health and \nHuman Development and the Department of Education to form a panel to \nevaluate existing research on the teaching of reading to children, to \nidentify proven methodologies, and suggest ways for dissemination of \nthis information to teachers, parents, universities, and others.\n  As a result of that initiative and the work that was done, there has \nbeen published one example of this initiative. It is prepared by the \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities.\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\n  With this legislation that is identified by me in this amendment in \nthe managers' package, this is the kind of material that will be \ndisseminated with the use of Federal funds to schools, to universities, \nto departments of education at universities, and others who are \ninterested in the latest and best information about how to teach young \nchildren who have reading difficulties, and new techniques for teaching \nthose who will acquire developmental skills at a faster rate and more \nefficiently, to equip them to be successful in the early grades of \nschool.\n\n  So I bring this to the attention of the Senate to let everyone know \nthat there has been, over time, a very successful effort, first by the \nresearch institutes at the National Institutes of Health, to do some \nfundamental research into why children have difficulties learning to \nread, and things that can be done to help overcome those difficulties.\n  That research has now been used by the Department of Education \nbecause of legislation we adopted in the past, and now we have come to \nthe point where there are some specific programs and practices that are \nbeing recommended throughout the country as a result of the work of the \nNational Reading Panel whom we charged with the job of translating \nthose research findings into teaching practices and techniques.\n  What this research has told us--just as an example--is that 75 \npercent of children with reading difficulties who are not identified by \nthe time they reach age 9 will still have poor reading skills at the \nend of high school; 80 to 90 percent of children identified with \nlearning disabilities have their primary deficits in reading and \nlanguage-based processes; research provides reliable ways to determine \nwhether children as young as age 4 are developing the fundamental \nskills necessary to learn to read; and last, early identification and \neffective, early intervention can dramatically reduce the numbers of \nstudents failing in reading.\n  Back in April of last year, the panel submitted its report to \nCongress at a hearing of our Senate Appropriations subcommittee chaired \nby Senator Specter of Pennsylvania. Some of the most important research \nthat I hoped could be made available to teachers and parents is the \ninformation about the skills young children need to have in order to be \nready to read and, beyond that, how to help them attain those skills. \nThis dissemination of a user-friendly predictor of reading readiness \nwill ensure that more children arrive at school with the skills they \nneed, and early identification of those children who need extra help \nwill be possible.\n  This amendment will finally ensure that parents and teachers have \navailable the first tool they need to begin the important steps to \nlearning to read.\n  The Department of Education's monthly publication ``Community \nUpdate'' for April 2001 features an article by Dr. Reid Lyon, chief of \nthe Child Development and Behavior Branch at the National Institute of \nChild Health and Human Development. He says in the article:\n\n       Today's teachers have a number of resources that can help \n     them discriminate between research that can be trusted and \n     research that cannot be. One such resource is The Report of \n     the National Reading Panel.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Reid Lyon's \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Solid Research, Solid Teaching\n\n                           (By G. Reid Lyon)\n\n       Teachers frequently tell me that they see little value in \n     basing their teaching practices on the results of \n     ``educational research.'' They point out that the research \n     reports are difficult to understand, frequently do not apply \n     to the specific children they are teaching, and often reflect \n     ``turf battles'' between academics espousing different \n     research philosophies.\n       I know firsthand the devastating effect that poor quality \n     research has on teaching practices and the trust teachers \n     have in educational research. As a brand new third-grade \n     teacher in the mid-1970s, I was responsible for teaching 28 \n     students of varying abilities and backgrounds. Unfortunately, \n     many of my students had not yet learned basic reading skills \n     and were clearly floundering in almost every aspect of their \n     academic work.\n       However, the university courses that I had taken to become \n     certified as an elementary school teacher led em to believe \n     these youngsters would learn to read when they were ready. \n     Likewise, my school's reading curriculum was based on the \n     assumption that learning to read was a natural process, \n     similar to learning to listen and speak. Thus children did \n     not need to be taught basic reading skills in a systematic or \n     direct manner.\n       At the beginning of the year, a third of my students read \n     so slowly and inaccurately that they could not comprehend \n     what they read. Their spelling was also nothing to write home \n     about. Unfortunately, by the end of the year, these same \n     students continued to read slowly and inaccurately. The only \n     change I could discern was that their motivation to read had \n     waned--they would actually avoid reading--and their self-\n     esteem had suffered considerably. Likewise, I felt like a \n     failure as a teacher.\n       It wasn't until later in my research career that I learned \n     that the way I was trained to teach reading, and the way that \n     the reading series recommended that literacy concepts should \n     be taught, were based upon research that was questionable at \n     best. Indeed, I came to learn later that the assumptions upon \n     which the instructional philosophy and methods rested had \n     never been adequately tested through well-designed studies.\n       Today's teachers have a number of resources that can help \n     them discriminate between research that can be trusted and \n     research that cannot be. Now, when almost every reading \n     program and set of instructional materials are said to be \n     ``research-based,'' teachers need to know that many of these \n     products are based upon beliefs and dogma rather than on \n     scientific data.\n       One such resource is the The Report of the National Panel--\n     An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research \n     Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading \n     Instruction, available free by request at \n     www.nationalreadingpanel.org. The report is published jointly \n     by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development, the U.S. Department of Education, and the \n     National Institute for Literacy (NIFL). NIFL, a government \n     agency that disseminates evidence-based information on \n     reading, is also developing information and tools \n     specifically for teachers.\n       All teachers want to do the best for their students. When \n     our children learn, everyone wins. Solid, research-based \n     approaches can help children do just that!\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I offered this amendment to \naddress two critical concerns faced by our schools that often do not \nrise to the forefront of our education debate but frequently have a \ndirect impact on how well our children can learn and how much it costs \nto run the average school in our country.\n  The first issue is ensuring that our children attend schools that are \nenvironmentally sound in order to protect their health and well-being.\n  The second issue is helping schools save money on their energy bills \nby providing them with resources to become more energy efficient. Our \nschools can then reinvest those energy savings where they belong, into \neducational resources such as books or computers or more training for \nteachers, which can really make a difference in the lives of children.\n  I understand that since the time I offered this amendment, there has \nbeen some concerns that the amendment\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nmight help to fund new school construction or renovation projects. Let \nme be very clear that while I do support a Federal role in school \nmodernization, construction, and renovation, this amendment is not \nintended to address the unmet needs of our Nation's schools when it \ncomes to construction and renovation.\n  I have offered this amendment because I am very concerned that we \nsimply do not have a comprehensive understanding of the problems \nchildren face who attend environmentally unhealthy or dilapidated \nschools. There are no nationwide statistics or in-depth research to \nhelp us know and understand the extent of the problems in our schools.\n  While the majority in this body may not agree that the Federal \nGovernment should have a role in helping States and localities \nconstruct and renovate public schools, I do strongly believe--and \nbelieve there should be broad support for the proposition--that we must \nunderstand better the health and educational impacts children may face \nif they attend schools that have environmentally unhealthy conditions, \nor that the deterioration of the schools are such that it affects a \nchild's health.\n  Every day, in old or poorly maintained school buildings around the \ncountry, students of all ages sit in classrooms where they are forced \nto breathe in stale air or even mold spores that make them sick and \ncould have long-term debilitating effects on their abilities to learn.\n  We know from a 1996 GAO study that 15,000 schools in our country have \nindoor pollution or ventilation problems affecting over 11 million \nchildren and that, furthermore, as many as 25 million children \nnationwide are attending schools with at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental condition. But we often have no idea whatsoever what \neffects these so-called ``sick\" schools have on the students who attend \nthem.\n  At least once a week I read stories in the press such as the one I \nfound in the New York Post this morning. The Post reported that while \ndoing work on subway stations in the Bronx, transit crews chipped lead \npaint into the air, with no protection to catch that paint, which then \nfell into the yard of a public school filled with students from \nkindergarten through to the seventh grade.\n  I also know the Presiding Officer is deeply concerned about something \nwe recently learned, which is that playground equipment is sometimes \ntreated with arsenic and that arsenic-treated playground equipment is \nthen put into the playgrounds of our schools. The Presiding Officer has \nbeen a leader in trying to end this terrible practice so that we \nprotect our children who, based on my experience--being one once a very \nlong time ago, but having raised my own and going to many playgrounds--\nchildren do the strangest things. They roll on the ground. They put the \ndirt in their mouths. They bite the playground equipment. You never \nknow what a child may do. That is my point. We have to be sure the \nenvironment in which our children attend school and the playgrounds on \nwhich they play are not causing them harm.\n  In that 1996 GAO study, we found that two-thirds of the schools that \nwere investigated were not in compliance with requirements to remove or \ncorrect hazardous substances, including asbestos, lead, underground \nstorage tanks, and radon.\n  Experts believe that exposures during the early years, when children \nare developing, can have severe long-term effects. Even more alarming, \na recent study indicates that children exposed to levels of lead now \nconsidered safe may be at risk of lead poisoning from peeling paint.\n  Listen to this new research conducted by the Children's Hospital \nMedical Center of Cincinnati, OH, showing that children who have less \nthan 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood experience a decline \nin their IQs. There was an average of a 5.5-percent drop in a child's \nIQ for every 10-microgram increase in lead. Children in this study \nexperienced hearing loss, speech delay, balance difficulties, and even \ntendencies toward acting out and violent behavior.\n\n  I am also concerned that we are facing a soaring rate of asthma \nacross the country. The epicenter is in New York City and California, \nbut it affects every State in the Union. The indoor air quality of our \nschools must be examined to find out whether or not it is contributing \nto this skyrocketing rate of asthma, which is the leading cause of \nschool absenteeism.\n  These bits and pieces of research, only a few of which I have shared \nin these remarks, paint a picture of a problem that we must learn more \nabout. Groups around the country have done a great job bringing this to \nour attention.\n  I, again, applaud the Healthy Schools Network in Albany, NY, for all \nthe tremendous work it has done to document this problem in New York \nState. Since I introduced this amendment, I have been pleased to \nreceive the endorsement of the American Lung Association, the Asthma \nand Allergy Foundation of America, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the Institute of Children's Environmental Health, the \nMassachusetts Healthy Schools Network, the New York City Board of \nEducation, the Parent Teacher Association, the American Federation of \nTeachers, and the Children's Environmental Health Network.\n  The American Public Health Association recently passed a resolution \ncalling for further research on the extent and impact of children's \nenvironmental health and safety risks and exposures at school and \nprevention measures, including research sponsored by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. This amendment would authorize $2 million for \na study conducted by the Department of Education, in conjunction with \nthe Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection \nAgency, to evaluate the health and learning impacts of environmentally \nunhealthy and dilapidated public school buildings, the impacts on \nchildren who have attended or are attending such schools. We would ask \nthe researchers specifically to determine the characteristics of our \npublic elementary and secondary school buildings that contribute to any \nunhealthy environment.\n  In addition to this study, I have also called for resources to help \nour States and local school districts make their schools healthier and \nmore energy efficient. I am very pleased I was able to work closely \nwith Senator Murkowski to align my amendment with a concept he had \nincluded in his comprehensive energy bill to help our schools become \nmore energy efficient.\n  Both the chair of the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, and the \nranking minority member, Senator Murkowski, have offered their support \nfor this amendment. They recognize the importance of helping our \nschools become more energy efficient and being able to increase our \nenergy supply while paying for the cost of energy.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that schools could save 25 to \n30 percent of the money they spend on energy. That is about $1.5 \nbillion. And they could achieve this through better building design, \nusing energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies, and improving \noperations and maintenance.\n  About 2 weeks ago, I went to Kingston, NY. I visited a school \ndistrict that is ahead of the curve, which got a grant to do exactly \nwhat the grants in this amendment would provide. They have already \nsaved--in this rather small school district--$400,000. Because of that, \nI put out this brochure, ``Smart Schools Save Energy.'' It is to \npromote energy efficiency in New York State schools. We have \ndistributed it to every single superintendent in New York.\n  It talks about what can be done to save energy costs. The catch is, \nas superintendents have told me, there is no money in their current \nbudgets to do this. It is kind of a catch-22 problem. If they could \nsave the money from energy use, then they would have the money to put \ninto other needs, such as better teacher training and the like.\n  This amendment provides the grants that will help schools make their \nbuildings healthier and more energy efficient. By incorporating \nprovisions of legislation I recently introduced, the Healthy and High \nPerformance Schools Act of 2001, we will be able to provide more \ninformation about the materials to be used and to help districts \norganize and conduct programs for school board members and personnel \nand to help provide compliance with Federal and State codes to make \neach of our schools healthier and more energy efficient.\n  I stress that, while these funds could not be used to construct new \nbuildings,\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\nthey would help schools assess how they can become more energy \nefficient when and if they do renovate their schools, which would save \nmoney in the long run.\n  This is the kind of common sense help we could provide to our schools \naround the country. I believe we owe it to our students and certainly \nto the parents who send their children off to school every day to make \nsure there is nothing at all in any schoolroom in any school building \nor on any school playground that could harm their child. If we \nundertake this study, we will be able to give the kind of information \nand help that every parent and every school district needs, and we will \nbe able to provide assistance to make sure schools are energy \nefficient, which will save money.\n  As we have talked now for weeks, trying to provide the resources to \nenable our children to learn is the primary goal of every single one of \nus here.\n  I would be very grateful for support for this amendment to enable \nthis to come about as part of our overall educational reform efforts.\n  I ask for a vote on the amendment, and I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is a real problem in education \ntoday in kindergarten through 12th grade. Anybody who talks to teachers \nat any length, as I have, will realize that discipline is a key problem \nfor teachers, principals, and administrators. It undermines the ability \nof learning in the classroom, and it is not a healthy environment too \noften. It is a real challenge today.\n  Children are always difficult to manage, and in today's world I think \nit is more so than in the past. I have been to quite a number of \nschools in my State over the last year--maybe as many as 20. Each time, \nI spent a good deal of time with teachers and principals and sometimes \nsuperintendents and board members. We talked about what is going on. I \ncan say with absolute certainty that they told me over and over again \nthat the biggest problem they see from the Federal Government is the \ndiscipline rules that have been set forth under the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  I suggest that if anybody is doubtful about that, call a \nschoolteacher they know and talk to them about what is being said and \nwhat is occurring within their schools. I was amazed. It is a Federal \nmandate. It is a law that has the best of all intentions to deal with \ndisabled children, and I support it entirely. But there have been some \nunintended consequences in how children are disciplined in a classroom. \nWe have absolutely created two classes of children for the purpose of \ndiscipline.\n  I have had teachers tell me: Jeff, last year in this very school a \nchild who was a disabled child sold marijuana to two other children. \nThe two who bought it were removed from school. The one who sold it, \nbecause he was disabled, could not be removed from school under Federal \nlaw. I have had circumstances where another teacher told me about two \nchildren who brought a gun to the parking lot. They didn't bring it \ninto the school, but they violated the school rules, and one that was \ndisabled was able to stay in school. The teacher said: Every time I see \nthat other child who was removed from our classroom, I know and he \nknows that another who did the very same act was not removed from the \nschool.\n  In addition to that, there are extraordinary problems within the \nclassroom. I want to share some comments and letters I received from \nteachers in my State. I don't believe it is different from around the \ncountry. At one of our hearings that Senator Jeffords chaired last \nyear, a superintendent from Vermont came and testified that 20 percent \nof his school district's budget goes to IDEA students. It is a matter \nof great importance. We want to give them the highest possible \nopportunity to succeed, but we also want to be sure we aren't creating \na circumstance that makes learning more difficult in the classroom than \nit ought to be.\n  Let me read to you from a special education program coordinator's \nletter. This person works with special ed kids. He said:\n\n       Thank you for your efforts to amend IDEA 97.\n\n  We thought that was going to help when it passed in 1997. Teachers \nand principals are telling me it made the situation worse. It didn't \nhelp.\n\n       The restrictions inherent in this legislation have the \n     potential to cripple a school system beyond repair. Although \n     my job is to advocate for students with disabilities, I also \n     feel a responsibility to protect the rights of all children \n     to an appropriate education.\n\n  An elementary school principal wrote:\n\n       Today, general educators at all grade levels must deal with \n     a large number of students who are challenged. Having to \n     deal with these behavior problems and to constantly change \n     behavior interventions not only takes away from important \n     instructional time, but inadvertently reinforces a \n     disabled child's behavior. All class rules should apply to \n     all students. Therefore, they should have the same \n     disciplinary actions.\n\n  A middle school principal wrote:\n\n       I am a middle school principal of a great school with \n     wonderful children. I have witnessed the evolution of IDEA \n     and am very concerned about the impact these regulations have \n     on public education. This issue is causing many fine teachers \n     to reconsider their choice of professions after a few years \n     in education.\n\n  Most of us know that most teachers who decide to give up the \nprofession do so because of discipline problems and the frustrations of \ntrying to maintain discipline in the classroom.\n  A high school principal wrote:\n\n       I am writing to support your efforts to change some of the \n     current special education laws. The current laws are very \n     frustrating in dealing with disruptive pupils. In order for \n     us to maintain and provide a safe environment for all \n     students, your provisions must be made in the law.\n\n  A city school superintendent wrote this:\n\n       In the short time since these regulations have been in \n     effect, numerous instances have taken place involving special \n     ed students where hardships, disruptions, and chaos have \n     resulted from restraints placed on the administrators by the \n     new regulations.\n\n  Another superintendent wrote:\n\n       We have written to advise you of our frustrations with \n     trying to implement the 1997 amendments to IDEA relating to \n     classroom discipline of disabled students. Classroom teachers \n     must devote a significant amount of time and attention to \n     address behaviors that interfere with the learning of \n     students with disabilities or their required disciplinary \n     action. Often this time and attention is to the detriment of \n     the other students in the classroom and valuable \n     instructional time is lost.\n       It is of a particular concern to me as a superintendent to \n     know that the roles and responsibilities of both our general \n     and special educators have been redefined to the degree that \n     teachers and administrators cannot act immediately when the \n     situation demands it.\n       Our teachers and administrators are committed to serving \n     all children, regardless of needs, in a fair and equitable \n     manner. If we don't teach these children right from wrong at \n     a young age, how can they learn to act as good law-abiding \n     citizens as adults.\n\n  Another one writes:\n\n       There have been several students with disabilities at our \n     school who totally disrupt the learning environment of the \n     regular classroom. They yell out, try to run away, are \n     defiant and create havoc in the classroom. The teachers are \n     required to spend so much time with these disruptive students \n     that the other students are missing out on the quality \n     instruction they need to be successful. I hope that when you \n     consider changes in IDEA, you will not lose sight of those \n     other students who need to be provided with quality \n     education.\n\n  The letters go on. I will add one more:\n\n       I have dealt with several instances over the last 3 years \n     in which special education students have disrupted classrooms \n     and threatened administrators and teachers.\n\n  I have heard that more than once.\n\n       In many cases, their parents use psychologists and lawyers \n     to create a climate of intimidation.\n\n  Another teacher wrote me this letter. I thought it was particularly \npoignant:\n\n       As a special educator of 6 years, I consider myself on the \n     front lines of the ongoing battles that take place on a daily \n     basis in our Nation's schools. I strongly believe that part \n     of the ammunition that fuels these struggles are the rights \n     guaranteed to certain individuals by IDEA 97. The law, though \n     well-intentioned, has become one of the single greatest \n     obstacles that educators face in their fight to provide all \n     our children with a quality environment education delivered \n     in a safe environment.\n       There are examples that I can offer firsthand. However, let \n     me reiterate, I am a special educator. I have dedicated my \n     life to helping children with special needs. It is my job to \n     study and know the abilities and limitations of such \n     children. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and \n     master's degree in special education and a Ph.D. in good old \n     common sense. Nowhere in my educational process have I been \n     taught that a certain few disabled students should have a \n     right to endanger the right to an education of all other \n     disabled children. It's nonsense, it's wrong, it's dangerous, \n     and it must be stopped.\n       There is no telling how many instructional hours are lost \n     by teachers in dealing with behavioral problems. In times of \n     an increasing competitive global society, it is no wonder \n     that American students fall short. Certain students are \n     allowed to remain in the classroom robbing the other children \n     of hours that can never be replaced. There is no need to \n     extend the school day. There is no need to extend the school \n     year.\n       If the politicians would just make it possible for \n     educators to take back the time lost\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\n     on a daily basis, there is no doubt we could have a better \n     educated student. It is even more frustrating when it is a \n     special education child who knows and boasts that ``they \n     can't do anything to me,'' and he is placed back in the \n     classroom to disrupt it day after day, week after week.\n       It is clear that IDEA 97 not only undermines the \n     educational process, it also undermines the authority of \n     educators. In a time when our profession is being called upon \n     to protect our children from increasingly dangerous sources, \n     our credibility is being stripped from us. I am sure you have \n     heard the saying that teachers are scared of the principals, \n     the principals are scared of the superintendents, the \n     superintendents are scared of the parents, the parents are \n     scared of the children, and the children are scared of no \n     one. And why should they be?\n       I have experienced the ramifications of the new and \n     improved law firsthand. I had one child attempt to assault \n     me. He had been successful with two other teachers. He was \n     suspended for 1 day. I had another child make sexual gestures \n     to me in front of the entire class. Despite the fact that \n     every child in my class and a majority of the children in the \n     school knew of it, I was told by my assistant principal that \n     nothing could be done because special-ed kids have rights.\n       I literally got in my car to leave that day, but my \n     financial obligations to my family and my moral \n     responsibility to my children I had in my class kept me \n     there. The particular child I spoke about frequently made \n     vulgar comments and threats to my girls in my class on every \n     opportunity he had when there was no adult present. \n     Fortunately, the girls, also special-ed, could talk to me \n     about it. Unfortunately they had to put up with it because \n     nothing could be done.\n       I know of a learning disabled child who cut a girl in a \n     fight. The child and her parents then attempted to sue the \n     school system because the child was burned when she grabbed a \n     coffee pot to break it over another child's head.\n       I know of another specific incident where three children \n     brought firearms to school. The two regular children were \n     expelled; the special-ed student was back in school the \n     following week.\n       I fully expect that you and your colleagues in Washington \n     will do what it takes to take our schools back from this \n     small group of children who feel it is their right to \n     endanger the education of every other child in the school. As \n     my grandmother said, right is right and wrong is wrong, and \n     to enable this to continue is wrong.\n\n  There are other letters. I want to read one more from a student. It \nmakes the point, I think, very well:\n\n       I am a 14-year-old 8th grader. I have a problem. There is \n     this girl that goes to school with me, and she is an ADD \n     student.\n\n  A disabled student.\n\n       She has been harassing me for no reason. She has pretty \n     much done everything from breaking my glasses to telling me \n     she is going to kill me. This really bothers me because she \n     is an ADD student and the only punishment she ever gets is a \n     slap on the hand. My principal says there is not much he can \n     do because of her status. I asked, what would happen if I \n     threatened her back? And he told me I would be suspended from \n     school and forced to stay away. The most she has ever gotten \n     is 3 days in-school suspension. I think this is wrong. She \n     scares me, and I'm tired of this. It has been going on for 5 \n     months, and it's really getting scary.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a very small percentage of disabled students who \nare behaving in this way, but even a few who would do so make it very \ndifficult for the schoolteachers and principals to conduct a safe \nclass. It is an important issue for us. In terms of all the things we \nare doing here, if you talk to your teachers in your school systems, if \nwe can make some improvement in this situation, they would feel as \nthough Congress has listened to them and has responded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time did I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You asked for an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Originally, when I began.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You had 15 minutes when you began.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sorry, I thought it was 30.\n  I conclude by saying this amendment I offer will say this, and this \nis very important. It is a very modest attempt at improving the \nsituation. If a child is a disabled child and their misbehavior is not \nconnected to their disability, then they can, and I think should, be \ntreated like any other child in the school.\n  If a child has a nervous condition and cannot control himself, then \nthat child ought to be placed in an environment within the school that \nis healthy for him, and this law would require that. They could not be \nremoved from school if their actions or misbehavior were connected to \nthat disability, but if they had perhaps a movement disability and they \nare selling dope, they ought to be treated like any other child in the \nschool. That is what this amendment says.\n  No. 2, it says if a school acts on a child, that they can take them \nout of a mainstream classroom and place them in another classroom until \na hearing has been conducted about an individual educational plan for \nthat child so they can be provided special education. Under current \nlaw, they have to be back in the classroom at least within 45 days, and \nin other circumstances, less than that. They go right back in before a \ndetermination can be made. This will give more flexibility to \nprincipals and teachers.\n  Finally, under current law, if a school believed that a student could \nbe sent to a school for the blind, for example, and this doesn't have \nanything to do with discipline, the State or local school system could \npay the tuition and let that child go to the school for the blind. The \ntrouble is, the special schools often cost a lot of money. The school \nsystem does the best they can with their own programs. My parent would \nexpand options for these parents. If parents think others might be \nbetter, this amendment says if the school agrees and if the parents \nagree, they can take the value of the tuition that child has and go to \na special school that has the ability to deal with that disability.\n  There are some superior schools for the blind, for the deaf, perhaps \nbetter than most public schools. A lot of families sacrifice to send \ntheir children there. This funding could assist them in making that \nchoice, to the benefit of the child. It is purely an option that, I \nthink, is healthy and benefits disabled children. I can't imagine \nanyone not supporting it.\n  I believe this is a modest amendment that will begin to help in some \nway to deal with an unfortunate situation. So many of the children do \nso well. The vast majority of our disabled children do exceedingly \nwell, and we have great programs.\n  This bill we are passing today provides unprecedented new funding for \nIDEA. We are excited about those possibilities, but we ought to deal \nwith this particular problem that is disrupting our schools.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator be good enough to help \nme understand the Senator's amendment? Is it the Senator's position \nthat if the child is disciplined and the discipline is a reflection of \nthe form of disability, does the Senator agree there should be \nalternative educational services available to that child?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do. In fact, to that extent, we continue a double \nstandard for a child. The school would have the option to move the \nchild to an alternative setting, but not remove him from the school or \nnot deny educational services.\n  My amendment does that. It says if the discipline problem is a \nproduct or related to their disability then the child may not be denied \neducational services.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it falls under that category, you are still for \nproviding the services, which I think is very important.\n  As I understood the amendment, would the services be required to be \nprovided in a school that was just for the disabled?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Page 4 of the amendment suggests they have alternative \neducational services and that may be in some other setting, some \nalternative setting.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say it this way: Most school systems are required \nunder Federal law to provide educational services. If they have special \nneeds, they have to provide them. Many children have an individual, one \nsingle individual who goes with that single child all day long to help \nthem.\n\n  Our amendment gives one little option that, I think, would be helpful \nto parents or teachers. It says if the parents came in and believed a \nschool for the blind or a school for the deaf down the street has a \nbetter program than public education, and the school agreed, and it is \na certified school for that disability, they could ask for, if\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\nthe school agreed, funding to go to that other school.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator has included ``is selected by the \nchild's parents,'' so you have parental involvement. It is not the \nconcern that many have, that the child might just be put in a setting \nwhich would be just for special needs children and then it would be the \nresegregation of disabled children. I see in this language you have \n``selected by the child's parents.'' It is designed to serve children \nwith disabilities, and if the place agrees to accept the child and it \ncarries out a program that a local or State educational agency finds is \nappropriate and will benefit the child.\n  The Senator can see the concern about whether that would be a dumbing \ndown kind of a process in education. It would be a quality educational \nopportunity that would be suitable for that child. That is the concern. \nI don't know whether there are ways of addressing that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. First, let me say thank you so much, and to your staff, \nfor giving careful attention to this. Many items have been included \nbecause you have suggested them. You are asking questions that are \nimportant.\n  As a result of our discussions with lawyers who deal with these \nissues, school people, your staff and others, we made this language \ncrystal clear. It says a local educational agency responsible for \neducating a child may transfer the child to an accredited school if it \nis selected by the child's parents and carries out the program and the \nschool determines that program would benefit the child. In other words, \nboth the parents and the school must agree. The parents cannot say: I \nwant to take my money and take my child to this school. The school \nwould have to agree. The parents would have to agree. That provides the \nprotection from abuse that might otherwise occur.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is where the payment comes into effect because you \nwould have to offset the expenses for that child and there would be the \nallocations of resources for offsetting the payment and for education \nfor that institution; is that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. It could not exceed the average daily \nexpenditure cost of the child and it could be only used for the \neducation of the child.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What happens to the child with a disability who has a \nbehavioral problem that is not related to the disability?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If their discipline or behavioral problem is not \nrelated to their misbehavior, then this language will say they would be \ntreated like any other child who misbehaves in school, subject to \ndiscipline, suspension, or other disciplinary action a school would \nnormally impose.\n  I know you would like to say any child, perhaps, could have an \nalternative, but I am not sure we have the funding to do that. But I \ndon't think in this instance if their misbehavior is not connected to \ntheir disability, they should be treated preferentially to another \nchild.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the experience in the Senator's own State as to \nhow school districts deal with the children? Do they provide \nalternative educational experiences or not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think most schools are doing a pretty good job. As \nthe Senator knows, the Federal Government committed to pay 40 percent \nof IDEA costs and never paid much more than 10 percent or 15 percent of \nthat. This bill would fully fund that 40 percent.\n  But under the law--and there are groups of parents who meet, advocacy \ngroups, and lawyers who are active in Alabama and every State--if they \nare emotionally disturbed children and they cannot control themselves, \nthey cannot be removed from school as a result of that. If they are a \ndanger to themselves or others then they can be provided services in an \nalternative setting, perhaps, but they cannot be denied educational \nservices. That is the universal in the United States.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his response to the questions. \nThere are some others maybe I could talk about with the Senator in the \nmorning. There is an alternative to the Sessions amendment. But we will \nlook forward to the presentations in the morning. As I understand it, \nthe Senator will have a half hour, Senator Harkin or his designee will \nhave a half hour to get into the description of the alternative. Then \nwe will make a judgment.\n  I appreciate the response of the Senator to the questions. I thank \nhim.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 369 As Further Modified, 484 As Modified, 441 As \n Modified, 549 As Modified, 446 As Modified, 555 As Further Modified, \n                And 609, en block, to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE ACCESS \n                   OF ARMED FORCES RECRUITERS TO STUDENT DIRECTORY \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Service in the Armed Forces of the United States is \n     voluntary.\n       (2) Recruiting quality persons in the numbers necessary to \n     maintain the strengths of the Armed Forces authorized by \n     Congress is vital to the United States national defense.\n       (3) Recruiting quality servicemembers is very challenging, \n     and as a result, Armed Forces recruiters must devote \n     extraordinary time and effort to their work in order to fill \n     monthly requirements for immediate accessions.\n       (4) In meeting goals for recruiting high quality men and \n     women, each of the Armed Forces faces intense competition \n     from the other Armed Forces, from the private sector, and \n     from institutions offering postsecondary education.\n       (5) Despite a variety of innovative approaches taken by \n     recruiters, and the extensive benefits that are available to \n     those who join the Armed Forces, it is becoming increasingly \n     difficult for the Armed Forces to meet recruiting goals.\n       (6) A number of high schools across the country have denied \n     recruiters access to students or to student directory \n     information.\n       (7) In 1999, the Army was denied access to students or \n     student directories on 4,515 to students or student \n     directories occasions, the Navy was denied access on 4,364 \n     occasions, the Marine Corps was denied access on to students \n     or student directories 4,884 occasions, and the Air Force was \n     denied access to students or students directories on 5,465 \n     occasions.\n       (8) As of the beginning of 2000, nearly 25 percent of all \n     high schools in the United States did not release student \n     directory information requested by Armed Forces recruiters.\n       (9) In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate, recruiters stated that the single \n     biggest obstacle to carrying out the recruiting mission was \n     denial of access to student directory information, as the \n     student directory is the basic tool of the recruiter.\n       (10) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information unfairly hurts the youth of the \n     United States, as it prevents students from receiving \n     important information on the education and training benefits \n     offered by the Armed Forces and impairs students' \n     decisionmaking on careers by limiting the information on the \n     options available to them.\n       (11) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information undermines United States \n     national defense, and makes it more difficult to recruit high \n     quality young Americans in numbers sufficient to maintain the \n     readiness of the Armed Forces and to provide for the national \n     security.\n       (12) Section 503 of title 10, United States Code, requires \n     local educational agencies, as of July 1, 2002, to provide \n     recruiters access to secondary schools on the same basis that \n     those agencies provide access to representatives of colleges, \n     universities, and private sector employers.\n       (b) Campaign to Promote Access.--\n       (1) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each State shall transmit to the \n     Secretary of Education a list of each school, if any, in that \n     State that--\n       (A) during the 12 months preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, has denied access to students or to student \n     directory information to a military recruiter; or\n       (B) has in effect a policy to deny access to students or to \n     student directory information to military recruiters.\n       (2) Education program.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall, not later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, make \n     awards to States and schools using no more than $3 million of \n     funds available under section 6203(c) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act to educate principals, school \n     administrators, and other educators regarding career \n     opportunities in the Armed Forces, and the access standard \n     required under section 503 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (B) Targeted schools.--In selecting schools for awards \n     required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give \n     priority to selecting schools that are included on the lists \n     transmitted to Congress under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 903. MILITARY RECRUITING ON CAMPUS.\n\n       (a) Denial of funds.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--No funds available to the Department of \n     Defense may be provided by grant or contract to any \n     institution of higher education (including any school of law, \n     whether or not accredited by the American Bar Association) \n     that has a policy of denying, or which effectively prevents, \n     the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military \n     recruiting purposes--\n       (2) institutions in paragraph (1) shall be exempt if they \n     have a long-standing policy of pacifism based on historical \n     religious affiliation.\n       (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or\n       (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.\n       (3) Covered students.--Students referred to in paragraph \n     (1) are individuals who are 17 years of age or older.\n       (b) Procedures for Determination.--The Secretary of \n     Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, \n     shall prescribe regulations that contain procedures for \n     determining if and when an educational institution has denied \n     or prevented access to students or information described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``directory information'' means, with respect to a student, \n     the student's name, address, telephone listing, date and \n     place of birth, level of education, degrees received, and the \n     most recent previous educational institution enrolled in by \n     the student.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 609\n\n (Purpose: To require audits of local education agencies to determine \n                     how funds are being expended)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Such audits shall be conducted in 6 local educational \n     agencies that represent the size, ethnic, economic and \n     geographic diversity of local educational agencies and shall \n     examine the extent to which funds have been expended for \n     academic instruction in the core curriculum and activities \n     unrelated to academic instruction in the core curriculum, \n     such as the payment of janitorial, utility and other \n     maintenance services, the purchase and lease of vehicles, and \n     the payment for travel and attendance costs at conferences.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after the completion \n     of the audits under subsection (a) in each year, the Office \n     of the Inspector General of the Department of Education shall \n     submit a report on each audit to the Committee on Education \n     and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see none of my colleagues here to make \nfurther comments and statements on this. We will resume the debates \ntomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. I thank all our colleagues for their \nhelp and their cooperation. We have made good progress and we look \nforward to a final passage sometime tomorrow afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the \nsituation on the floor at the present time?\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Sessions \namendment No. 604, as modified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is there a time agreement on that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is to be recognized to \ncall up an amendment, and he has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nthen at this time. I may ask for a bit more.\n  Mr. President, I looked at this amendment, and all I can say is here \nwe go again. How many times do we have to go down this road of saying \nthat the disciplinary problems in our schools are because of kids with \ndisabilities, and if we only can get ahold of those kids with \ndisabilities and do something about them, then we can straighten out \nthe discipline problem in our schools?\n  We have been down this road many times before. Fortunately, this body \nhas recognized the importance of IDEA's protections in the past, and I \nhope we will do so again.\n  We as a nation decided sometime ago that segregation was wrong. I am \nnot talking about segregation of races. We decided that a long time \nago. That was wrong. I am talking about the segregation of people with \ndisabilities from our society. We as a country said it was wrong to \ntake kids from their families and send them halfway across the State to \nsome alternative setting, when they could have had a decent, adequate \neducation right in their own community, in their own school district, \nin their own neighborhood, if they were just given some appropriate \nsupport.\n  The reason I feel so deeply about this is that it is very personal to \nme. My brother was sent away halfway across the State from our small \nhometown when he was a kid because he was deaf. He was put in an \ninstitution to get his education--segregated from society, from his \nfamily, from his friends, from the town in which he grew up.\n  Well, those were the old days. I thought we as a society had \nprogressed beyond that. When we passed the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act in 1975--my first year here in the \nCongress--we said we are not going to do that anymore; to the maximum \nextent possible, we are going to integrate kids with disabilities into \nour local educational institutions, and we are going to provide the \nsupport services those kids need to get an education.\n  I can remember when my oldest daughter was in grade school and when \nthe first couple of kids with disabilities came into the classroom. \nThere was a bit of a hue and cry. Some of the parents didn't like it. \nThey thought it was going to take attention away from the other kids \nbecause they would have to pay more attention to the kids with \ndisabilities. But because of the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act, the school had to take these kids and provide the \nservices. A wonderfully amazing thing happened. These young kids in \nthat classroom, who perhaps had never associated with anyone their age \nwith a disability, all of a sudden became drawn to these two kids who \nwere in the classroom with their disabilities.\n  They became more sensitive to these kids, and the kids with \ndisabilities found they could associate with kids without disabilities.\n  I saw a wonderful thing happen, and I saw the families who later on \nsaid: This is not a bad deal. It sensitized them to the fact that this \ncould happen to any one of them any day of the week. Any one of us \ncould become disabled--mentally or physically--at any time. It shows \nthe vulnerability of human nature, but it also shows that kids with \ndisabilities can learn and reach their maximum potential.\n  Do we want to turn the clock back? Do we want to go back to those \ndays when we took those kids out of that setting and put them in a \nseparate setting and said: No, you can't be in a classroom with other \nkids.\n  I do not mean to overblow this amendment, but that is exactly what \nthis amendment will do. This amendment, in section 2(A), says:\n\n       A child with a disability who is removed from the child's \n     regular educational placement under paragraph (1) shall \n     receive a free appropriate public education which may be \n     provided in an alternative education setting if the behavior \n     that led to the child's removal is a manifestation of the \n     child's disability as determined under subparagraphs--\n\n  And so on.\n  What that says is that a child with disabilities can be removed. Yes; \nschools must continue to give him a free appropriate public education--\nbut in an alternative education setting. I read that to mean a \nsegregated setting, someplace across town, someplace where they \nsegregate kids with disabilities.\n  Under current law, you have to provide a free appropriate public \neducation but before you remove a child you have to consider certain \nfactors, including whether the behavior was a result of their \ndisability. This would turn the clock back to days when schools could \nsegregate.\n  You say: What if that kid acted up and harmed someone? Don't you want \nhim removed, put in a setting where they cannot harm someone? Yes, I \nwant safety in the classroom, too, but think about this before you vote \non this. This is an example I will tell you that occurs every single \nday in classrooms all over America with kids with disabilities.\n  I will use a young deaf kid again because I am so familiar with that. \nA young deaf kid is in a classroom. They are using a TV monitor to show \nsome educational programs. The classroom teacher inadvertently or \nadvertently did not provide for captioning or the school did not \nprovide for the captioning. The student who is deaf cannot understand \nwhat is going on.\n  This may go on for a couple of days until finally the kid who is deaf \nstarts acting up. He may reach over and hit the kid next to him, may \ngrab the kid next to him, may throw something. So a school takes that \nkid out of the classroom.\n  Under the Sessions amendment, there is no inquiry as to whether or \nnot the kid was provided the adequate appropriate supportive services. \nInstead, this deaf child could be segregated based on the fact that the \nschool failed to provide appropriate services.\n  Under present law, there would be a due process hearing as to why \nthat kid acted up. They might bring in a counselor and a deaf \ninterpreter. Maybe the kid will say: I am mad because I can't \nunderstand what is going on.\n  The Sessions amendment says: We don't care; get him out of here.\n  In addition, I have a great deal of empathy with our elementary and \nsecondary school teachers all over America, many of whom have not been \ntrained and who do not really know how to handle kids with \ndisabilities. They have big classrooms. They have 28, 30 kids in a \nclassroom, and they get a couple of kids with disabilities in their \nclassroom. What are they going to do?\n  The real problem is that teachers aren't getting trained and no one \nis providing supportive services to these kids as is supposed to be \ndone under law. They create a disturbance. They are not provided the \nappropriate supportive services so they can learn in that setting.\n  The teacher is at wits end. He or she would say: I've got to get \nthese kids out of here. I can't teach the rest of these kids.\n  The kids tell the parents: We have kids acting up all the time; they \nare disturbing the classroom; I can't study. The parents call the \nprincipal. The principal says get those kids out of there.\n  I feel sorry for those teachers. The answer is not to segregate the \nkids. The answer is to meet our obligations--our moral obligations and \nour legal obligations--to make sure these kids get the supportive \nservices they need to learn in that environment.\n  It seems to be cost is no objection when they want to segregate kids \nand put them in an institution. We don't care what it costs. But in \norder to provide the kind of supportive services they may need in an \nintegrated classroom, why, well, that costs too much money.\n  It does not cost too much money. It can cost more to segregate those \nkids than to provide the services they need to help them.\n  As I said, I have a lot of empathy with these teachers because I have \nbeen in those classrooms. I feel sorry for those teachers. They do not \nhave the support. But, now they are going to\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nget help because on this bill, under an amendment offered by Senator \nHagel and this Senator, adopted unanimously by the Senate, we are \nfinally going to provide full funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act which we have been talking about since 1975.\n  That amounts, over the next 10 years to about $181 billion that the \nFederal Government has now said to the States: We are now going to give \nthe money out we have been talking about for the last 26 years.\n  Now we can get the supportive services these teachers need, and if we \ncouple that with class size reduction and reducing the number of kids \nin classrooms, then we have the right formula. We have the right \nformula not only for kids with disabilities, but for kids without \ndisabilities.\n  I know people get disturbed. They hear about all the discipline \nproblems in our classrooms, and I am not saying there are not \ndiscipline problems. But I have sat in this Senate Chamber, and I have \nheard Senator after Senator in the past talk about the gun incidents at \nColumbine, San Diego, Pennsylvania--and then they talk about \ndiscipline, and it always comes down to kids with disabilities.\n  I challenge them or anybody else to show me one of those violent \ninstances where a child under an IEP, an Individualized Education \nProgram, a kid with a disability was involved. Why is it when we have \nshootings, we have guns, and we have things that happen in the schools, \nthe first thing that comes on the floor of the Senate is to beat up on \nthe kids with disabilities? The discipline amendments don't go after \nkids without disabilities; they always go after kids with disabilities. \nI ask: Why? Why? They are the most vulnerable in our society.\n\n  We had a tough time reauthorizing IDEA a few years ago. Senator \nJeffords and I, Senator Kennedy and others, worked hard on it. We got \nall sides to agree on what we would do when we finally reauthorized. \nAnd now we have the funds in this bill to pay for it. Before we go \nafter kids with disabilities, let's identify the real problems.\n  The Sessions amendment says to parents with kids with disabilities, \ntough luck, you are out of the picture. We will take those kids and \nkick them out and segregate them and you don't have anything to say \nabout it.\n  Why are we picking on the kids with disabilities? Honest to God, I \njust don't understand this.\n  Do I disagree we have some discipline problems in school? No, we do \nhave discipline problems in school. Of course we do. But it is not \nbecause of kids with disabilities. I challenge someone, please, step \nforward and show me the data that it is kids with disabilities causing \nthese problems.\n  I don't want kids in the classroom who will hurt themselves or hurt \nothers. If a kid is truly violent and can't be controlled, even with \nsupportive services, that kid should not be there. We have set up \nthrough a long history of 26 years processes and procedures to ensure \nthat kids with disabilities have due process, as do their families.\n  IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, allows schools \nto remove those kids. A GAO report released in January concluded that \nspecial education students who are involved in serious misconduct are \nbeing disciplined in generally a similar manner to regular education \nstudents based on information that principals reported to us in our \nreview of the limited extant research. That means IDEA is not limiting \na school's ability to discipline children with disabilities.\n  Again, what does the Sessions amendment do? I repeat, under the guise \nof discipline, it allows us to resegregate these kids, to turn back the \nclock. The second thing it does is allow schools to cease services to \nthese kids. Section C allows the children not only to be taken out but \nto cease services.\n  A kid with a disability needs services, needs support; a kid can be \nnot only segregated but have services cease. That is adding insult to \ninjury. What are you going to do, throw them out on the street? Think \nabout a kid with a serious disability, who is already frustrated by \ntheir disability. And now you will stop the services and throw them out \non the street? Talk about a timebomb waiting to happen.\n  The one thing we have always mandated under discipline procedures for \nkids with disabilities is you have to keep the services going to these \nkids. Nobody is going to throw them out on the streets. But the \nSessions amendment allows services to cease.\n  The Sessions amendment also creates a program that allows parents to \ntake money from the public schools to go into private schools. Under \nthe amendment, the local educational agency could wash its hands of \nresponsibility for that child. Again, the Federal dollars end up in \nprivate schools without any accountability as to how those dollars get \nspent. The local educational agency washes its hands.\n  We have been down this road before. If I had a dollar for every \niteration of this amendment we have had on this floor in 20 years, I \nwould be a rich man. They always say, ``We will tweak it here and tweak \nit there,'' but it always comes down to the same two or three things: \nsegregate them out, cut out the services, and let them go out on the \nstreets. It always comes down to that.\n  I have had my say. I will continue to speak out on this as long as I \nam on this Senate floor. I don't mean tonight; I mean as long as I am \nin the Senate. These families with kids with disabilities, a lot of \ntimes families are at their wit's end. A lot of times the parents are \nworking. A lot of times it is a single parent. They are working hard, \nhave a kid with a disability who requires a lot of attention, a lot of \ncare, a lot of love, and the last thing they need is to get kicked in \nthe teeth by the Senate. The last thing they need is to have to go out \nand try to find a lawyer to fight it in court.\n  I thank the Chair's indulgence, but this is an issue I care very \ndeeply about. There are ways of addressing this issue. This is not the \nway to do it. Don't go after the most vulnerable kids when it cannot be \nproven. You cannot show me the data. That is all I ask. Show me the \ndata where it is kids with disabilities who are causing these problems. \nShow me the data and make me a believer. I have lived with this too \nlong. I have worked on this issue too long. The data is not there. If \nyou can show it to me, I will change my mind.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 802 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  My amendment is at the desk and I ask my amendment be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Kennedy, for \n     himself and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 802.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 802\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n                         regarding discipline)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n               TITLE ____--INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n     SEC. ____01. DISCIPLINE.\n\n       Section 615 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 1415) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(n) Uniform Policies.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a State \n     educational agency or local educational agency may establish \n     and implement uniform policies regarding discipline \n     applicable to all children under the jurisdiction of the \n     agency to ensure the safety of such children and an \n     appropriate educational atmosphere in the schools under the \n     jurisdiction of the agency.\n       ``(2) Limitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A child with a disability who is removed \n     from the child's regular educational placement under \n     paragraph (1) shall receive a free appropriate public \n     education which may be provided in an alternative educational \n     setting pursuant to Sec 615K, if the behavior that led to the \n     child's removal is a manifestation of the child's disability, \n     as determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection \n     (k)(4).\n       ``(B) Manifestation determination.--The manifestation \n     determination shall be made immediately, if possible, but in \n     no case later than 10 school days after school personnel \n     decide to remove the child with a disability from the child's \n     regular educational placement.\n       ``(C) Determination that behavior was not manifestation of \n     disability.--If the result of the manifestation review is a \n     determination that the behavior of the child with a \n     disability was not a manifestation of the child's disability, \n     appropriate school personnel may apply to the child the same \n     relevant disciplinary procedures as would apply to children \n     without a disability.'', except as provided in 612(a)(1).\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\n     SEC. ____02. PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS.\n\n       Section 615 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 1415) (as amended by section ____01) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(o) Discipline Determinations by Local Authority.--\n       ``(1) Individual determinations.--In carrying out any \n     disciplinary policy described in subsection (n)(1), school \n     personnel shall have discretion to consider all germane \n     factors in each individual case and modify any disciplinary \n     action on a case-by-case basis.\n       ``(2) Defense.--Nothing in subsection (n) precludes a child \n     with a disability who is disciplined under such subsection \n     from asserting a defense that the alleged act was \n     unintentional or innocent.\n       ``(3) Limitation.--\n       ``(A) Review of manifestation determination.--If the \n     parents or the local educational agency disagree with a \n     manifestation determination under subsection (n)(2), the \n     parents or the agency may request a review of that \n     determination through the procedures described in subsections \n     (f) through (i).\n       ``(B) Placement during review.--During the course of any \n     review proceedings under subparagraph (A), the child shall \n     receive a free appropriate public education which may be \n     provided in an alternative educational placement.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I want to make it clear what my \namendment does. It basically takes the Sessions amendment, leaves most \nof it the way it is, but it just says, No. 1, you cannot segregate; you \ncannot segregate these kids--unless you follow the law. Under the \npresent law, you can segregate kids if they are violent. But before you \nsegregate you have to follow certain processes and procedures.\n  The second thing my amendment says is you cannot cease services; you \ncannot stop the services to these kids even if they have been removed \nfrom the classroom.\n  Finally, it deletes the last section that would allow local school \ndistricts to hand over federal dollars, without any accountability on \nhow those dollars are being spent.\n  I think it is a reasonable and a logical approach to this problem, as \nI have said many times before. I do not mind people who want to have \nbetter discipline in the classrooms. I sent two kids through public \nschools. Yes, I want discipline in the classrooms. I want a well-\nstructured classroom just as the Presiding Officer does for his kids \nand grandkids, I am sure. But this is not the way to do it. This is not \nthe way to do it.\n  The way to do it is to do it under the procedures and processes that \nwill ensure the kids with disabilities have the services and the \nsupport they need so they will not be segregated ever again in our \nsociety.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.

Mr. President, we are at a critical juncture in the \nMiddle East. If words are followed by deeds, yesterday's acceptance by \nthe Palestinians of a U.S. plan brokered by CIA Director Tenet--which \nIsrael had previously signed off on--may open the door for an end to \nthe violence of the past eight months, a cooling off period, and new \npeace talks.\n  The violence in Israel following the collapse of the Camp David talks \nhas been profoundly disturbing to those of us who are both friends of \nIsrael and strong supporters of Arab-Israeli peacemaking.\n  With a cease-fire now in effect, the Israeli and Palestinian people \nhave an opportunity to start moving back in the right direction, \ntowards peace and security for the region.\n  If the peace process is to gain momentum, both sides must make a \ncommitment to the right of the other to exist, in peace and security.\n  If leaders on both sides are able to muster the political will \nnecessary for this commitment, then I believe that it will be possible \nfor the cease-fire to hold, for a cooling-off period to have effect, \nand for confidence building measures to once again give momentum to a \nnew peace process.\n  I was a supporter of the Oslo process when I first came to the \nSenate, and worked to build peace in the region in the years since, \nbelieving a commitment by both sides existed.\n  I was thus saddened that the unprecedented concessions that former \nPrime Minister Barak offered last summer--which many felt met the needs \nand aspirations of the Palestinian people--was not accepted.\n  Not only was the Palestinian response to that offer ``no,'' but PLO \nChairman Yassar Arafat walked away from the negotiations and the \nPalestinians began a campaign of violence which, in turn, led to Israel \nresorting to violence to try to protect its security and safeguard the \nlives of its people.\n  In walking away from negotiations, Mr. Arafat raised questions about \nhis commitment to peace, and whether there are some in Palestinian \nsociety who are unwilling to accept the existence of Israel under any \ncircumstances.\n  With this cease-fire, these questions are again on the table.\n  As I stated on the floor of the Senate earlier this year, the new \nIntifadah was characterized by a level of hate and violence that I did \nnot believe possible in view of the nature of concessions Israel had \noffered to make.\n  Particularly tragic--coming on top of over 400 Palestinian and 100 \nIsraeli deaths since last September--was the murder of 20 young \nIsraelis at a night club in Tel Aviv on June 1. Israel's restraint in \nresponse to this bombing--looking for the path of peace, not continued \nbloodshed--has been nothing short of heroic.\n  No one--Israeli or Palestinian--should have to worry about the \npossibility of attack as they put their child on a school bus, go to \nwork, go shopping, sit at a cafe, or go to a night club.\n  We can all remember the images from last Fall of the Palestinian \nchild hiding behind his father, caught in the cross-fire--and, just a \nfew days later, the pictures of the Israelis lynched by a Palestinian \nmob, their bloody bodies thrown from the second floor window of the \npolice station.\n  There are countless other such images that each side can point to in \nthe 8 months since.\n  It is easy to understand how passions can run high, and fear and \nfrustration can drive violence in the current environment.\n  It is also easy to see how these feelings can get out of control and \nlead to ever deeper, and never-ending, cycles of violence.\n  The cease-fire and cooling off period that has been agreed to \nprovides both parties the opportunity to end the provocation and \nreaction.\n  Palestinian acceptance of the cease-fire agreement brokered by \nDirector Tenet is a crucial step in the right direction, and carries \nwith it an acknowledgment of the special responsibility incumbent on \nthe Palestinian Authority to end the violence.\n  Much more will need to be done, however, to show the international \ncommunity that Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian people are committed to \npeace and willing to coexist with Israel.\n  Mr. Arafat's call for a halt to the violence will only yield results \nif he follows his words with deeds.\n  With the cease-fire now in effect, Mr. Arafat must follow-up on the \nagreed-to elements of the deal. He must re-arrest those terrorists he \ninexcusably released last fall, stop anti-Israel incitement in the \nPalestinian media, and make sure that the Palestinian police strictly \nenforce his cease-fire orders.\n  He must also follow up on information supplied by Israel about \nimminent terrorist attacks. He must move to confiscate weapons that are \nbeing held by many in the West Bank and Gaza illegally. And he must \ntake action to prevent his aides and other Palestinian officials from \ndefending terrorists.\n  Mr. Arafat must also understand that if he fails the test, again, \nthat there will be very real consequences for him and for the \nPalestinian people.\n  The Government of Israel, for its part, must continue to show its \ncommitment to peace by exercising the admirable restraint it has shown \nin the wake of the June 1 tragedy.\n  Israel must also take steps to ease the restrictions on Palestinians, \nincluding travel, and pull its forces back from Palestinian populations \ncenters.\n  The events of recent days also strengthen the case for more active \nAmerican involvement in the Middle East.\n  I applaud the recent stepped-up role of the Bush administration and \nurge the President and Secretary Powell to continue their engagement at \nthis critical juncture in Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n  I also extend my praise to Director Tenet and Assistant Secretary of \nState Burns, both of whom have been in the region for the past several \ndays shuttling between Israeli and Palestinian offices.\n  Director Tenet, in particular, has played an important role bridging \nIsraeli and Palestinian security concerns, and I am confident that he \nwill continue to do his utmost to bring the sides together--without \njeopardizing Israel's security.\n  Lastly, I believe that we owe a debt to our former colleague, Senator \nMitchell, for his work in developing the Mitchell Commission report and \nrecommendations.\n  The administration's endorsement of the Mitchell Commission report as \nthe basis for restoring peace to the Middle East is a sign it \nunderstands the role it must play in order for the violence in the \nregion to subside and for the parties to eventually return to the \nnegotiating table.\n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\n  If we have learned anything from the history of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict it is that only through diplomacy can the people of the Middle \nEast achieve peace and stability.\n  I also call on my colleagues in the Senate to support active American \nleadership in the region.\n  This is not the time--or the issue--to be engaging in partisan \npolitics. Democrats and Republicans alike must unite in supporting our \nfriends in Israel as well as President Bush and Secretary Powell in \ntheir peace-building efforts.\n  With this cease-fire, the United States must continue to be involved \nas a facilitator of peace and diplomacy in the Middle East.\n  The administration also must continue to follow in the footsteps of \nprevious Republican and Democratic administrations alike, whose \ninvolvement in Arab-Israeli peacemaking led to historic breakthroughs \nsuch as the Camp David Accords, the Madrid Conference and the Wye \nAgreement.\n  Last year, by walking away from the negotiations, Mr. Arafat raised \nserious questions about whether he was truly committed to the cause of \npeace.\n  We are at another critical juncture and Mr. Arafat, now, again, has \nthe opportunity to show he is serious about peace. In the past few days \nhe has said the right things--in both English and Arabic--and now he \nmust do the right things as well.\n  I believe that if the parties are committed to coexistence, and that \nif each continues to demonstrate the necessary leadership--with the \nUnited States playing an active and engaged role--we may soon see an \nend to the violence and a return to negotiations.\n  The events of the last 8 months will make it difficult, but with this \ncease-fire paving the way for a cooling off period and the \nimplementation of confidence building measures, I remain hopeful that \npeace for the peoples of the Middle East is still possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/13/senate-section/article/S6209-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to one of \nthe great cultural treasures of Massachusetts, Victor Rosenbaum. Mr. \nRosenbaum is the President of the esteemed Longy School of Music and \nhas been an important figure in Boston's musical life for more than a \nquarter century, excelling as a pianist, teacher, conductor, composer, \nwriter and administrator.\n  As a pianist, Victor Rosenbaum is critically acclaimed for his \nperformances as a soloist and chamber musician. He has performed \nthroughout the world and has appeared as a soloist with the Boston \nPops, Pro Arte Orchestra, Boston Classical Orchestra and the Boston \nPhilharmonic. His chamber music collaborations have been with such \ndistinguished artists as Leonard Rose, Joseph Silverstein, Roman \nTotenberg, and the Vermeer and Cleveland Quartets.\n  In addition to teaching at Longy, Mr. Rosenbaum is also a member of \nthe faculty at the prestigious New England Conservatory where he was \nthe former chair of the Piano Department, and a current member of the \nfaculty of Musicorda.\n  Since Mr. Rosenbaum's appointment as President in 1985, Longy has \nbecome a major performance center in the greater Boston area, and has \ngreatly expanded its curriculum for children, avocational students, and \naspiring professional musicians and teachers.\n  In 1994, the Schools work with low-income school children from \nCambridge came to the attention of the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest \nFund, the Nation's largest private arts funder. Selecting Longy as one \nof the six non-profit cultural institutions nationwide to expand their \nyouth programs, the Fund awarded the School $355,000, the largest of \nthe six and the largest single gift ever made to the School at that \ntime, to provide private music instruction to students from Boston and \nSomerville as well as Cambridge and to develop an in-school music \nenrichment program.\n  Victor Rosenbaum has had an immeasurable impact on Boston's cultural \nlife. He has elevated the quality of music in our city and expanded its \nreach to new audiences and music-lovers.\n  I commend him for what he has accomplished and extend congratulations \nto him as he retires from Longy at the end of his 16th year as its \nvenerable President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/13/senate-section/article/S6209-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6209-S6210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY FREDERICK\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 1963, the month of May has \nhelped the Nation focus on the contributions and achievements of \nAmerica's older citizens. The image of those over the age of 65 is \ndramatically different than it was just a generation ago. Older \nAmericans increasingly redefine modern maturity, re-shape cultural \nboundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes associated with getting \nolder. They are leaders in our families, in our workplaces and in our \ncommunities.\n  One of these leaders is an 80-year-old woman from Milford, IA. \nDorothy Frederick understands the value of helping others. Through her \ninitiative, concern and commitment, she has touched the lives of many \nin her community.\n  Mrs. Frederick and her husband, Ted, moved to Milford in 1950 where \nthe couple has owned a hardware business for fifty years. After the \ncouple's five children were grown, Mrs. Frederick's desire to stay \nactive led to her increasing involvement in the community.\n  Through her church, Mrs. Frederick helped start meals on wheels in \nMilford more than twenty years ago. Over that time, she has gotten \nother churches in the community involved in the program. Today, meals \non wheels is still going strong in Milford, and Mrs. Frederick \ncontinues to be the program coordinator. She is ``on call'' with the \nprogram each day and is responsible for finding drivers and \ncoordinating their activities. She even fills in as a substitute driver \nwhen needed.\n  Mrs. Frederick's initiative also led to the establishment of the \nDinner Date program in Milford nearly twenty years ago. Every Tuesday, \nMrs. Frederick is responsible for serving meals\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\nat the community meal site to senior citizens and others. Her ongoing \ncommitment to these programs has contributed to their success all of \nthese years.\n  Mrs. Frederick is a woman who likes a challenge. After serving six \nyears on the city council, she was elected Mayor of Milford and served \nthe better part of her six-year tenure while in her sixties.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \nspecial tribute to Ambassador Malcolm Toon, an outstanding American \ndiplomat with a long and impressive record of service to our Nation. \nFor Ambassador Toon this year's July Fourth celebration has particular \nmeaning since it also marks his Eighty-fifth Birthday.\n  In a diplomatic career that spanned more than three decades, he \nserved as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, \nCzechoslovakia, and Israel and held positions within the State \nDepartment as the Director of Soviet Affairs and the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for European Affairs. These assignments provided Ambassador \nToon with a degree of expertise and keen insight that would prove \ninvaluable when, in March 1992, he was selected by President Bush to \nserve as the first U.S. chairman of a newly formed bilateral American-\nRussian commission tasked with determining the fate of missing service \npersonnel.\n  Under his six-year stewardship, the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on \nPOW/MIAs overcame many obstacles in pursuit of its humanitarian work on \nbehalf of missing servicemen and their families. Thanks to his \nleadership and steadfastness, the fates of numerous military personnel \nhave been clarified and a robust archival research program implemented. \nDuring his tenure the Joint Commission visited each of the fifteen \nindependent states that comprised the former Soviet Union and urged \nheads of state and other senior officials to do all within their power \nto assist in the search for American servicemen still unaccounted for. \nSimilar initiatives were directed at the countries of Central and \nEastern Europe. I am personally aware of Ambassador Toon's deep sense \nof commitment to the POW/MIA issue since, as co-chairman of the Joint \nCommisson's Vietnam War Working Group, I had the privilege of serving \nwith Ambassador Toon.\n  Prior to embarking on his diplomatic career in 1946, Ambassador Toon \nserved in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a PT-Boat skipper, \nachieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander and earning the Bronze Star \nfor valor. His academic credentials include a BA degree from Tufts \nUniversity and graduate studies at Middlebury College and Harvard \nUniversity.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me today in recognizing a \ndistinguished diplomat who has contributed greatly to our nation's \ncommitment to the fullest possible accounting for our missing service \npersonnel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/13/senate-section/article/S6210-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MORTON E.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \na public response to the public health crisis of pain, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, pain is our Nation's silent public health \ncrisis. Pain is often left untreated or under-treated, especially among \nolder patients, minorities and children. Forty to 50 percent of dying \npatients experience moderate to severe pain at least half of the time \nin the last days of their lives. A Brown University study published in \nlast month's Journal of the American Medical Association found that 40 \npercent of nursing home patients nationwide with acute or chronic pain \nare not getting treatment that brings them relief. Thousand of \nAmericans die in pain every year, and thousands live in chronic pain.\n  What is truly tragic for these patients is that the medical \ntechnology and know-now exist to make them more comfortable. What does \nnot exist is a medical system that supports clinicians trying to \naddress these issues or a system to support patients and families as \nthey try to find help for pain.\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\n  The primary goal of the Conquering Pain Act, a bipartisan bill that I \nam introducing today with Senators Smith, Rockefeller, and Breaux is to \ncreate a public health framework with on which effective pain \nmanagement policies can be developed. Providing help to patients in \npain, to their health care providers, and to others caring for those \npatients will ensure their access to pain management 24 hours a day, \nseven days a week, 365 days a year.\n  The widespread crisis of failing to adequately address patients in \npain is made crystal clear by the fact that only one State in the \nNation has ever has sanctioned a physician for the under-treatment of \npain. That State is my home State of Oregon, which is now also \nconsidering the creation of a commission on pain management with the \nState health department.\n  The Conquering Pain Act does not seek to tell clinicians how to \npractice medicine. It does not override State regulation and oversight \nof medicine. it does provide information to physicians and families in \nan effort to support them. It also seeks to find answers to the complex \nproblems created by the interplay between State and Federal regulation \nof pain medications.\n  Most importantly, the bill would create six regional Family Support \nNetworks linking patients, families and providers to information and \nservices to assist patients in pain. These networks would also assist \nclinicians who need additional information, mentoring or support to \ndeal with the medically complex cases that patients in pain often \npresent.\n  It would be cruel and callous for this Congress to continue to ignore \nthe overwhelming number of scientific studies that show patient after \npatient failing to get relief from pain. This legislation, which enjoys \nbroad support with the medical and patient community, would start us \ndown the road toward addressing in a bipartisan, positive way one of \nour Nation's most serious and continued health problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) pain is often left untreated or under-treated \n     especially among older patients, African Americans, Hispanics \n     and other minorities, and children;\n       (2) chronic pain is a public health problem affecting at \n     least 50,000,000 Americans through some form of persisting or \n     recurring symptom;\n       (3) 40 to 50 percent of patients experience moderate to \n     severe pain at least half the time in their last days of \n     life;\n       (4) 70 to 80 percent of cancer patients experience \n     significant pain during their illness;\n       (5) one in 7 nursing home residents experience persistent \n     pain that may diminish their quality of life;\n       (6) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses, \n     pharmacists, and other health care professionals, pain is \n     often under-treated because of the inadequate training of \n     clinicians in pain management;\n       (7) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses, \n     pharmacists, mental health professionals, and other health \n     care professionals, pain and symptom management is often \n     suboptimal because the health care system has focused on cure \n     of disease rather than the management of a patient's pain and \n     other symptoms;\n       (8) the technology and scientific basis to adequately \n     manage most pain is known;\n       (9) pain should be considered the fifth vital sign; and\n       (10) coordination of Federal efforts is needed to improve \n     access to high quality effective pain and symptom management \n     in order to assure the needs of chronic pain patients and \n     those who are terminally ill are met.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend \nand colleague from Oregon in reintroducing the Conquering Pain Act. He \nand I have worked long and hard together to expand access to effective \npain and symptom management for chronic pain and terminally ill \npatients, and I believe that this legislation is an important step \ntoward accomplishing that goal. This is an issue of great importance to \nmy home state of Oregon, and a matter of personal significance to me.\n  Prior to my service in elected office, I served as a volunteer for my \nchurch. In this capacity, I found my professional work as a food \nprocessor in a constant, but blessed, state of interruption. On a \nweekly basis and at the oddest of hours, I found myself making \ncontinual rounds at St. Anthony's Hospital in Pendleton, Oregon. On \nmany occasions I shared with parents the unspeakable joy of welcoming \nnewborn babies into this world. On others, I suffered in heartbreaking \nsorrow as I tried to comfort the critically ill, or hold the hands of \nthose who lay at the brink of eternity.\n  On too many of these occasions, patients suffered intense pain and \ndiscomfort during their final hours; sometimes as a result of \ninadequate pain management techniques, and sometimes as a result of our \nmedical focus on curing illness and prolonging life at any cost. I have \nseen many beloved friends suffer unnecessarily and I believe that all \nAmericans have been touched at some point by a friend or family member \nstruggling to cope with chronic or acute pain. We all deserve a health \ncare system committed to adequately addressing the comfort of ailing \npatients.\n  The legislation we reintroduce today, the Conquering Pain Act, is \nconsistent with my belief that the practice of medicine must place \ngreater emphasis on helping people who are experiencing chronic and \nacute pain.\n  The Conquering Pain Act of 2001 will take a number of steps to ensure \nthat patients have greater access to effective pain management. This \nlegislation will commission studies by the Surgeon General's office, \nthe General Accounting Office, the Institute of Medicine, and MedPac to \nexamine the state of pain and symptom management in the United States, \nand to review regulatory obstacles that stifle effective pain \nmanagement in our health care system. The Act will establish \ndemonstration projects at the Department of Health and Human Services \nand other institutions to provide advanced pain management care and to \nresearch effective methods to measure improvement in the skills, \nknowledge, and attitudes of health care personnel in pain and symptom \nmanagement. In addition, this bill will make important and timely \ninformation related to pain management available to patients and health \ncare professionals over the Internet.\n  The Conquering Pain Act of 2001 will do something that should have \nbeen done many years ago; it will finally establish a coordinated \nFederal agenda regarding pain and symptom management. For better or for \nworse, our health care system has focused intensely on curing disease \nbut has never adequately addressed the need to provide effective pain \nmanagement. Americans should expect their health care providers to \nattend to their comfort as well as their health, and I believe that \nthis legislation will go a long way toward addressing this long-\nstanding deficiency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 1025. A bill to provide for savings for working families; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, Senator Joseph Lieberman and I \nare introducing the Savings for Working Families Act, which seeks to \nexpand opportunities through Individual Development Accounts, IDAs, to \nenable the working poor to save for a home, educational expenses, and \nmicro-enterprise and small business efforts. We have already \nreintroduced this provision this year as Title I of bipartisan \nlegislation, S. 592, ``the Savings Opportunity and Charitable Giving \nAct of 2001.'' Rep. Pitts and Rep. Stenholm are also introducing a \nbipartisan companion bill on IDAs in the House of Representatives \ntoday.\n  IDAs have been endorsed by President Bush during the presidential \ncampaign and were included in his budget. IDAs are also included in \nH.R. 7, ``the Community Solutions Act.'' We strongly support the \ncharitable giving incentives in our bill but in the context of this \nlegislation, which includes savings incentives provisions, we are \nseeking to add additional tax relief for those working hard to save.\n  IDAs are matched savings accounts for working Americans restricted to \nthree uses: 1. buying a first home; 2. receiving post-secondary \neducation or training; or 3. starting or expanding a small business. \nIndividual and matching deposits are not co-mingled; all matching \ndollars are kept in a separate, parallel account. When the account \nholder has accumulated enough savings and matching funds to purchase \nthe asset, typically over two to four years, and has completed a \nfinancial education course, payments from the IDA will be made directly \nto the asset provider.\n  Financial institutions, or their contractual affiliates, would be \nreimbursed for all matching funds provided plus a limited amount of the \nprogram and administrative costs incurred, whether directly or through \ncollaborations with other entities. Specifically, the IDA Tax Credit \nwould be the aggregate amount of all dollar-for-dollar matches \nprovided, up to $500 per person per year, plus a one-time $100 per \naccount credit for financial education, recruiting, marketing, \nadministration, withdrawals, etc., plus an annual $30 per account \ncredit for the administrative cost of maintaining the account. To be \neligible for the match, adjusted gross income may not exceed $20,000, \nsingle, $25,000, head of household, or $40,000, married, to prevent the \ncreation of any additional marriage penalties.\n  Our legislation is aimed at fixing our Nation's growing gap in asset \nownership, which keeps millions of low-income workers from achieving \nthe American dream. Most public attention focuses on our growing income \ngap. Though the booming American economy has delivered significant \nincome gains to the Nation's upper-income earners, lower-income workers \nhave been left on the sidelines. This suggests to some that closing \nthis divide between the have-mosts and the have-leasts is simply a \nmatter of raising wages. But the reality is that the income gap is a \nsymptom of a larger, more complicated problem.\n  Success in today's new economy is defined less and less by how much \nyou\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\nearn and more and more by how much you own--your asset base. This is \ngreat news for the millions of middle-class homeowners who are tapped \ninto America's economic success, but it is bad news for those who are \nsimply tapped out--those with no assets and little hope of accumulating \nthe means for upward mobility and real financial security. This \nwidening asset gap was underscored in a report issued earlier this year \nby the Federal Reserve. The Fed found that while the net worth of the \ntypical family has risen substantially in recent years, it has actually \ndropped substantially for low-income families.\n  For families with annual incomes of less than $10,000, the median net \nworth dipped from $4,800 in 1995 to $3,600 in 1998. For families with \nincomes between $10,000 and $25,000, the median net worth fell from \n$31,000 to $24,800 over the same period. The rate of home ownership \namong low-income families has dropped as well. For families making less \nthan $10,000, it went from 36.1 percent to 34.5 percent from 1995 to \n1998; for those making between $10,000 and $25,000, it fell from 54.9 \npercent to 51.7 percent.\n  How do we reverse this troubling trend? IDAs are the unfinished \nbusiness of the Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment \ninitiatives which became law in December of 2000 and will increase job \nopportunities and renew hope in what have been hopeless places. But to \nsustain this hope, we must provide opportunities for individuals and \nfamilies to build tangible assets and acquire stable wealth.\n  How do we do this? We believe that the marketplace can provide such \nopportunity. Non-profit groups around the country have launched \ninnovative private programs that are achieving great success in \ntransforming the ``unbanked''--people who have never had a bank \naccount--into unabashed capitalists. Through IDAs, banks and credit \nunions offer special savings accounts to low-income Americans and match \ntheir deposits dollar-for-dollar. In return, participants take an \neconomic literacy course and commit to using their savings to buy a \nhome, upgrade their education or to start a business.\n  Thousands of people are actively saving today through IDA programs in \nabout 250 neighborhoods nationwide. In one demonstration project \nundertaken by the Corporation for Enterprise Development, CFED, a \nleading IDA promoter, 2,378 participants have already saved $838,443, \nwhich has leveraged an additional $1,644,508.\n  While data have been encouraging, unfortunately IDA programs are \nstill limited and too scattered across the Nation. This amendment will \nexpand IDA access nationwide by providing a significant tax credit to \nfinancial institutions and community groups which they will pass \nthrough to IDA account holders. This credit would reimburse banks for \nthe first $500 of matching funds they contribute, thus significantly \nlowering the cost of offering IDAs. Other State and private funds can \nalso be used to provide additional match to savings. It also benefits \nour economy, the long-term stability of which is threatened by our \npitiful national savings rate. In fact, according to some estimates, \nevery $1 invested in an IDA returns $5 to the national economy.\n  IDAs are supported by a variety of groups including the Credit Union \nNational Association, the Corporation for Enterprise Development, the \nNational Association of Homebuilders, the Financial Services \nRoundtable, and the National Conference of State Legislators.\n  Individual Development Accounts, combined with other community \ndevelopment and wealth creation opportunities, are a first step towards \nrestoring the faith in the longstanding American promise of equal \nopportunity. That faith has been shaken by stark divisions of income \nand wealth in our society. With the leadership of the President and the \nSpeaker, I am hopeful, along with Senator Lieberman and other \nsupporters in the Senate, that Congress will take this significant step \ntoward restoring the long-cherished American ideals of rewarding hard \nwork, encouraging responsibility, and expanding opportunity this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1027. A bill to expand the purposes of the program of block grants \nto States for temporary assistance for needy families to include \npoverty reduction, and to make grants available under the program for \nthat purpose; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Schumer-\nWellstone ``Child Poverty Reduction Act.'' This bill would create a \nfifth goal of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, \nProgram to reduce poverty among families with children in the United \nStates, and it would provide a $150 million annual appropriation for \nhigh performance bonus grants to States who reduce both the depth and \nextent of child poverty.\n  Under current law, TANF has four goals: 1. provide assistance to \nneedy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes; 2. \nend dependency on the welfare system; 3. prevent and reduce the \nincidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and 4. encourage the formation \nand maintenance of two parent families. The bill would add language \nstating that the fifth goal of TANF is ``to reduce poverty of families \nwith children in the United States.''\n  The TANF program currently awards ``high performance'' bonuses to \nStates that rank high on outcome measures related to the program's \ngoals. A total of $1 billion was provided over 5 years, averaging $200 \nmillion per year, for this bonus. The law charges the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with developing the criteria for measuring \nhigh performance in consultation with certain groups representing the \nstates. Bonuses have thus far been awarded for fiscal year 1999 and \nfiscal year 2000. For fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2001, states \nare judged only on measures related to promoting work for the high \nperformance bonus. Beginning in fiscal year 2002, new measures will be \nadded that provide bonus awards to States that increase the percent of \nmarried couple families with children and to States that take steps to \nincrease participation in food stamps, Medicaid/SCHIP and child care. \nThis bill would create an additional $150 million bonus category to \nprovide high performance bonus grants to all States that reduce their \nchild poverty rate from the previous year's poverty rate. The grant is \nauthorized from fiscal year 2003 onward. To ensure continued \nimprovement, States cannot receive a bonus if their child poverty rate \nfor any given year is higher than their lowest child poverty rate from \ncalendar year 2002 onward. In addition, even if a State reduces the \noverall poverty rate, a State cannot receive the bonus if the average \namount of income that the State's poor children needed to get above the \npoverty line, the average depth of child poverty, increased from the \nprevious year. Each State that qualifies for a grant would receive an \naward equal to the number of the children residing in the State as a \npercentage of the number of children living in the United States. A \nqualifying State can receive no less than $1 million per year, and no \nmore than 5 percent of their Basic TANF grant.\n  This bill takes the important first step toward reorienting our \nthinking about the purpose of welfare ``reform.'' Many people have \ntrumpeted the ``success'' of welfare reform, pointing to the enormous \nreduction in the caseload as proof of this success, but such claims \nmiss the point. Reducing the rolls is the easy part--just kick people \noff, close their cases, and wish them well. The more important, and \ninfinitely more difficult, part is the reduction of poverty. When \nadvocates of welfare ``reform'' talk about ending dependency, there is \nclearly a presumption that they are also advocating moving these same \nfamilies toward economic self-sufficiency. But the reality of the \nsituation is that the welfare rolls have declined much more quickly \nthan the poverty rate, and it is not at all clear that those families \nwho have lost their benefits have moved out of poverty. Of particular \nconcern is the fact that too many children in this country continue to \nlive in poverty.\n  What do we know about the well-being of poor children in this \ncountry? We know that the number of children who live in poverty has \ndeclined. In 1998, 18.9 percent of children in the United States lived \nin poverty. In 1999 that figure dropped to 16.9 percent. But before we \nstart celebrating, let's think about what this really represents. In \nthis period of unheralded economic growth, child poverty has decreased \nby\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\ntwo percent. Two percent. Unprecedented, rewrite the economic \ntextbooks, prosperity, and childhood poverty has decreased by only two \npercent.\n  Worse, though, we also know that poor children are on average now \nmore poor than ever before. Their families have incomes further below \nthe poverty level than in any other year that this information has been \ncollected. And researchers point to the decline in cash assistance and \nfood stamps as a primary cause. The percentage of poor children whose \nfamilies received cash assistance fell from 62 percent in 1994 to 43 \npercent in 1998; the percent of poor children who received food stamps \ndropped from 94 percent to 75 percent from 1994 to 1998; and a million \npeople became uninsured in 1998. Our Nation's programs, designed to \nmeet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens, are serving fewer of \nthem. This is what we call success? I've said it before and I'll \ncontinue to say it for as long as we have this debate simply reducing \nthe welfare rolls is not success. Reducing the rolls is not the same \nthing as reducing poverty, our real goal, a goal we have not come close \nto reaching.\n  It is critical that we reframe the public discourse so that welfare \n``reform'' is about ending poverty, not simply reducing the rolls, and \nwe must make it part of a larger discourse about the needs of working \nfamilies in this country. After all, there are about 6 million people \non the welfare rolls, but there are 32 million people 12 million \nchildren living in poverty, 43 million people who are uninsured, 30 \nmillion people who are hungry, more than 13 million children who are \neligible for child care assistance who aren't receiving any, more than \n12 million people teetering on the edge of homelessness, and an \nestimated 6.9 million people in this country earning only the minimum \nwage unable to move their families out of poverty even by working full-\ntime, year-round. As we begin to consider reauthorization of the \nwelfare ``reform'' bill, we need to understand that whatever debate we \nhave won't be just about welfare. We need to understand that what we \nwill really be talking about is poverty, about hunger and homelessness, \nabout whether or not our children are safe, about whether or not they \ncome to school ``ready to learn,'' about whether or not they grow and \nprosper. The debate we will have is not simply about what is good for \nthe 6 million people in this country receiving public assistance, or \neven the 32 million people living in poverty, but it will be a debate \nabout what is good for our country. It will be a debate about our \npriorities.\n  Any investment we make in the needs of low-income families will be \npaid back to us a thousand-fold in the well-being of our children, our \nneighborhoods, and our communities. And the cost of not investing in \nthese families is similarly multiplied when we see our children fall \nbehind in grade school and high school, when we bear witness to \nhorrible acts of violence committed by children against children, and \nwhen we face a cycle of poverty that seems nearly unbreakable. I look \nforward to the day when the needs of all families are met, when we \nensure that every member of our community leads a life of dignity, able \nto provide for themselves and their families. And I have to believe \nthat such a day will come, although I worry that it may not come soon \nenough.\n  We must do more to reduce both the extent and the depth of poverty in \nthis country, and right now is the time to do so. Right now we have the \nresources to ensure that no family, no child, is left behind. The \nSchumer-Wellstone ``Child Poverty Reduction Act'' is a step in this \ndirection. I urge each of my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1028. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre \nCanal Features of the initial stage of Oahe Unit, James Division, South \nDakota, to the Commission of Schools and Public Lands and the \nDepartment of Game, Fish and Parks of the State of South Dakota for the \npurpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, on the condition that the \ncurrent preferential leaseholders shall have an option to purchase the \nparcels from the Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Blunt \nReservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act of 2001. This proposal \nis the culmination of more than 3 years of discussion with local \nlandowners, the South Dakota Water Congress, the U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation, local legislators, representatives of South Dakota \nsportsmen groups and affected citizens. It lays out a plan to convey \ncertain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre \nCanal features of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota to the \nCommission of School and Public Lands of the State of South Dakota for \nthe purpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, and provides the \noption to preferential leaseholders to purchase their original parcels \nfrom the Commission.\n  To more fully understand the issues addressed by the legislation, it \nis necessary to review some of the history related to the Oahe Unit of \nthe Missouri River Basin project in South Dakota.\n  The Oahe Unit was originally approved as part of the overall plan for \nwater development in the Missouri River Basin that was incorporated in \nthe Flood Control Act of 1944. Subsequently, Public Law 90-453 \nauthorized construction and operation of the initial stage of this \nunit. The purposes of the Oahe Unit, as authorized, were to provide for \nthe irrigation of 190,000 acres of farmland, conserve and enhance fish \nand wildlife habitat, promote recreation and meet other important \ngoals.\n  The project came to be known as the Oahe Irrigation Project, and the \nprincipal features of the initial stage of the project included the \nOahe pumping plant, located near Oahe Dam, to pump water from the Oahe \nReservoir, a system of main canals, including the Pierre Canal, running \neast from the Oahe Reservoir, and the establishment of regulating \nreservoirs, including the Blunt Dam and Reservoir, located \napproximately 35 miles east of Pierre, South Dakota.\n  Under the authorizing legislation, 42,155 acres were to be acquired \nby the Federal Government in order to construct and operate the Blunt \nReservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project. Land acquisition for \nthe proposed Blunt Reservoir feature began in 1972 and continued \nthrough 1977. A total of 17,878 acres actually were acquired from \nwilling sellers.\n  The first land for the Pierre Canal feature was purchased in July \n1975 and included the 1.3 miles of Reach lB. An additional 21-mile \nreach was acquired from 1976 through 1977, also from willing sellers.\n  Organized opposition to the Oahe Irrigation Project surfaced in 1973 \nand continued to build until a series of public meetings were held in \n1977 to determine if the project should continue. In late 1977, the \nOahe project was made a part of President Carter's Federal Water \nProject review process.\n  The Oahe project construction was then halted on September 30, 1977, \nwhen Congress did not include funding in the FY 1978 appropriations. \nThus, all major construction contract activities ceased, and land \nacquisition was halted.\n  The Oahe Project remained an authorized water project with a bleak \nfuture and minimal chances of being completed as authorized. \nConsequently, the Department of Interior, through the Bureau of \nReclamation, gave to those persons who willingly had sold their lands \nto the project, and their descendants, the right to lease those lands \nand use them as they had in the past until they were needed by the \nFederal Government for project purposes.\n  During the period from 1978 until the present, the Bureau of \nReclamation has administered these lands on a preference lease basis \nfor those original landowners or their descendants and on a non-\npreferential basis for lands under lease to persons who were not \npreferential leaseholders. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation \nadministers 12,978 acres as preferential leases and 4,304 acres as non-\npreferential leases in the Blunt Reservoir.\n  As I noted previously, the Oahe Irrigation Project is related \ndirectly to the overall project purposes of the Pick-Sloan Missouri \nBasin program authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944. Under \nthis program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed four major \ndams across the Missouri\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nRiver in South Dakota. The two largest reservoirs formed by these dams, \nOahe Reservoir and Sharpe Reservoir, caused the loss of approximately \n221,000 acres of fertile, wooded bottomland that constituted some of \nthe most productive, unique and irreplaceable wildlife habitat in the \nState of South Dakota. This included habitat for both game and non-game \nspecies, including several species now listed as threatened or \nendangered. Meriwhether Lewis, while traveling up the Missouri River in \n1804 on his famous expedition, wrote in his diary, ``Song birds, game \nspecies and furbearing animals abound here in numbers like none of the \nparty has ever seen. The bottomlands and cottonwood trees provide a \nshelter and food for a great variety of species, all laying their claim \nto the river bottom.''\n  Under the provisions of the Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, the \nState of South Dakota has developed a plan to mitigate a part of this \nlost wildlife habitat as authorized by Section 602 of Title VI of \nPublic Law 105-277, October 21, 1998, known as the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and State of South Dakota Terrestrial \nWildlife Habitat Restoration Act. The State's habitat mitigation plan \nhas received the necessary approval and interim funding authorizations \nunder Sections 602 and 609 of Title VI.\n  The State's habitat mitigation plan requires the development of \napproximately 27,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. \nTransferring the 4,304 acres of non-preferential lease lands in the \nBlunt Reservoir feature to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish \nand Parks would constitute a significant step toward satisfying the \nhabitat mitigation obligation owed to the state by the Federal \nGovernment and as agreed upon by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the South Dakota Department of \nGame, Fish and Parks.\n  As we developed this legislation, many meetings occurred among the \nlocal landowners, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, \nbusiness owners, local legislators, the Bureau of Reclamation, as well \nas representatives of sportsmen groups. It became apparent that the \nbest solution for the local economy, tax base and wildlife mitigation \nissues would be to allow the preferential leaseholders (original \nlandowner or descendant or operator of the land at the time of \npurchase) to have an option to purchase the land from the Commission of \nSchool and Public Lands after the preferential lease parcels are \nconveyed to the Commission. This option will be available for a period \nof 5 years after the date of conveyance to the Commission. During the \ninterim period, the preferential leaseholders shall be entitled to \ncontinue to lease from the Commissioner under the same terms and \nconditions they have enjoyed with the Bureau of Reclamation. If the \npreferential leaseholder fails to purchase a parcel within the 5-year \nperiod, that parcel will be conveyed to the South Dakota Department of \nGame, Fish and Parks to be use to implement the 27,000-acre habitat \nmitigation plan.\n  The proceeds from these sales will be used to finance the \nadministration of this bill, support public education in the State of \nSouth Dakota, and will be added to the South Dakota Wildlife Habitat \nMitigation Trust Fund to assist in the payment of local property taxes \non lands transferred from the Federal government to the state of South \nDakota.\n  In summary, the State of South Dakota, the Federal Government, the \noriginal landowners, the sportsmen and wildlife will benefit from this \nbill. It provides for a fair and just resolution to the private \nproperty and environmental problems caused by the Oahe Irrigation \nProject some 25 years ago. We have waited long enough to right some of \nthe wrongs suffered by our landowners and South Dakota's wildlife \nresources.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will act quickly on this legislation. Our \ngoal is to enact a bill that will allow meaningful wildlife habitat \nmitigation to begin, give certainty to local landowners who sacrificed \ntheir lands for a defunct federal project they once supported, ensure \nthe viability of the local land base and tax base, and provide well \nmaintained and managed recreation areas for sportsmen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve health care in rural areas by amending \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act and the Public Health Service \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Rural Health \nImprovement Act of 2001. This proposal is the result of a bipartisan \nand bicameral effort. I am proud to be joined by Senator Thomas the \nlead cosponsor\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nof the bill, along with Senators Daschle, Roberts, Johnson, Lincoln, \nJeffords, Crapo, Rockefeller, Harkin, Dorgan, Wellstone, Bond, Helms, \nCochran, Edwards, Hutchinson, Domenici, Burns, and Bingaman. I would \nalso like to thank our House companions, led by Representatives Moran \nand McIntyre.\n  In addition, I would like to thank the National Rural Health \nAssociation, the Federation of American Hospitals, the National \nAssociation of Rural Health Clinics, the American Hospital Association, \nand the College of American Pathologists for their support of this \neffort.\n  Working together, I believe we are taking important steps toward \nimproving access to health care in our rural communities.\n  Rural health care providers are often forced to operate with \nsignificantly fewer resources than larger, urban facilities. In my \nState of North Dakota, rural hospitals often receive only half the \nMedicare reimbursement of their urban counterparts. For example, a \nrural facility in North Dakota receives approximately $4,200 for \ntreating pneumonia, while Our Lady of Mercy in New York city receives \nmore than $8,500.\n  This funding disparity is simply unfair and has placed many rural \nproviders on shaky ground. And in my State, if these facilities close, \nrural communities will be left without access to needed health care \nservices. We simply cannot allow this to happen.\n  According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, \ncontinued funding shortfalls have resulted in rural providers having \nmuch tighter Medicare margins than their urban counterparts. Today, the \naverage rural hospital operates with a slim 4.1 percent inpatient \nmargin, compared to 13.5 percent for urban providers.\n  When you look at overall Medicare margins, the situation is even more \nbleak, rural providers are working with an average negative 2.9 percent \nMedicare margin compared to 6.9 percent for urban hospitals. Our rural \nfacilities cannot continue to provide high-quality services it they \nlose nearly 3 percent on every Medicare patient they serve.\n  To address these problems, the bill I am introducing today would take \nthree important steps to erase inequities in the Medicare inpatient \nhospital payment system and provide new resources to rural health care \nproviders.\n  As you know, it is nearly impossible for hospitals serving small, \nrural areas to take advantage of economies of scale realized by \nfacilities located in larger communities. This problem is compounded by \nthe fact that Medicare does not adequately account for the higher \ncosts of serving low-volume populations. According to MedPAC, the \nresult of these factors is that the majority of small facilities \noperate in the red.\n\n  To ensure our smallest rural hospitals can keep their doors open, the \nRural Health Care Improvement Act would provide a new, and much needed, \nextra payment to hospitals serving fewer than 800 patients per year. \nThis new low-volume adjustment payment would provide up to 25 percent \nin additional funding to help rural providers cover inpatient hospital \nservices.\n  Second, this proposal would close the gap in payments hospitals \nreceive for serving low-income patients. Today, hospitals are provided \nspecial payments to help cover the costs of serving the uninsured; \nthese supplements are called disproportionate share payments, DSH. The \nproblem is that under current law urban providers can receive unlimited \nDSH payments, while rural providers' add-ons are capped. There is no \nsound policy reason for this disparity. My bill closes this gap by \nallowing rural providers to also receive unlimited DSH payments.\n  Third, this proposal would take steps to equalize another glaring \nMedicare disparity with no policy justification that provides larger \nhospitals a base payment amount 1.6 percent higher than rural \nhospitals. The Rural Health Care Improvement Act would address this \ndisparity by increasing the rural hospital base payment amount to the \nlevel urban providers receive.\n  I am happy to say that these improvements to Medicare's inpatient \nhospital reimbursement, combined with our rural health care efforts \nfrom last year, would significantly reduce the rural/urban payment gap \nby increasing rural providers' Medicare margins to approximately 11.8 \npercent. In total, these changes would place our rural hospitals on \nmuch sounder financial footing.\n  In addition to Medicare changes, the Rural Health Care Improvement \nAct would also establish three new rural health care programs.\n  Our legislation would allow hospitals to apply for up to $5 million \nto help cover the cots of repairing crumbling buildings. It is my hope \nthese resources will help strengthen the infrastructure of our nation's \nrural hospitals.\n  In addition, our proposal would make $100,000 per facility available \nto help rural hospitals update or purchase new technology. Often, with \nlimited budgets, rural hospitals cannot afford to buy quality, up-to-\ndate medical tools. This new program ensures rural citizens have access \nto modern and safe health care services.\n  Third, our bill would provide funding to help establish Telehealth \nResource Centers. Today, larger telehealth networks often work with \nfledgling networks to provide technical assistance. This grant program \nwould provide new resources to support this collaboration and further \nexpand telehealth services into the most remote, rural communities.\n  Finally, the Rural Health Care Improvement Act also takes important \nsteps to strengthen rural health clinics, RHCs. Today, there are more \nthan 3,300 RHCs nationwide that provide health care to thousands of \nrural residents. However, while we recognize the importance of these \nclinics, we also know that more than 50 percent of RHCs are being \nsignificantly underpaid for their services, according to recent data. \nMy bill addresses this funding shortfall by increasing rural health \nclinic payments by 25 percent.\n  Thank you again to my Senate and House colleagues, as well as the \norganizations who worked with us, for your cooperation in developing \nthis important health care proposal. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will help to strengthen and sustain our nation's rural \nhealth care system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 with Senator Conrad and \nfellow Senate Rural Health Caucus members Senators Roberts, Johnson, \nHelms, Dorgan, Domenici, Daschle, Crapo, Bingaman, Bond, Lincoln, \nCochran, Wellstone, Burns, Rockefeller, Hutchinson, Edwards, Harkin, \nand Jeffords. As always, it is important to note that rural health care \nlegislation has a long history of bipartisan collaboration and \ncooperation.\n  I want to thank the National Rural Health Association, the Federation \nof American Hospitals, the National Association of Rural Health \nClinics, the American Hospital Association and the College of American \nPathologists for their work and support in this effort.\n  The Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 will go a long way in \naddressing current inequities in the Medicare payment system that \ncontinually place rural providers at a disadvantage. This legislation \nrecognizes the unique needs of rural hospitals and levels the playing \nfield between rural and urban providers.\n  First, the bill equalizes Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, \nDSH, payments. These add-on payments help hospitals cover the costs of \nserving a high proportion of low-income and uninsured patients. While \nurban facilities can receive unlimited add-ons corresponding with the \namount of these types of patients served, rural add-on payments are \ncapped at 5.25 percent. The ``Rural Health Care Improvement Act of \n2001'' eliminates the rural hospital cap, bringing their payments in \nline with the benefits urban facilities receive.\n  Second, this legislation closes the gap between urban and rural \n``standardized payment'' levels. Inpatient hospital payments are \ncalculated by multiplying several different factors, including a \nstandardized payment amount. Under current law, hospitals located in \ncities with a population over 1 million receive a base payment amount \n1.3 percent higher than those serving smaller populations, $4,130 vs. \n$4,197. This disparity is corrected in our bill by bringing the rural \nbase payment up to the urban payment level.\n  Third, the bill recognizes that low-volume hospitals have a higher \ncost per case, which results in negative operating margins. To address \nthis problem, the Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 establishes \na low-volume inpatient payment adjustment for hospitals that have less \nthan 800 annual discharges per year and are located more than 15 miles \nfrom another\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nhospital. This provision will improve payments for approximately 900 \nrural facilities nationwide, which is just over one-third of all rural \nhospitals.\n  In addition to these Medicare payment reforms, this legislation \nstrengthens the over 3,000 rural health clinics that serve many rural \nAmericans. Under current law, rural health clinics receive an all-\ninclusive payment rate that is capped at approximately $63. This \npayment has not been adjusted, except for inflation, since 1988. To \nrecognize the rising costs of health care this bill raises the rural \nhealth clinic cap to $79.\n  Certain provider services, such as those offered by physicians, nurse \npractitioners, physician assistants, and qualified psychologists are \nexcluded from the consolidated payments made to skilled nursing \nfacilities, SNFs, under the prospective payment system. However, the \nsame services provided to SNFs by physicians and other providers \nemployed by rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers \nare not excluded from the consolidated SNF payment. This bill includes \na provision that ensures skilled nursing services, offered by rural \nhealth clinic and qualified health center providers, will receive the \nsame payment treatment as services offered by providers employed in \nother settings.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to recognize that the ``one \npayment system does not fit all.'' Rural providers care for patients \nunder different circumstances than their urban counterparts and the \nRural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 ensures that rural hospitals, \nrural health clinics and qualified health centers are paid accurately \nand fairly. I strongly encourage all my colleagues with an interest in \nrural health to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to detail my support of the \nRural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001, which was introduced today \nby Senator Conrad and is cosponsored by myself and a number of my \ncolleagues from rural States across this Nation.\n  The Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 will increase payments \nfor low-volume hospitals, equalize Medicare Disproportionate Share, \nDSH, payments, close the gap between urban and rural ``standardized \npayment'' levels, streamline wage index re-classification, ensure rural \ncommunities access to independent lab services, provide grant and loan \nprograms for infrastructure and technology improvement projects, and \nstrengthen rural health clinics.\n  Those of us from rural and frontier areas recognize that rural health \ncare is in a state of crisis. Through mismanagement of Medicare \nreimbursement policies and an unwillingness to truly evaluate the \nobstacles inherent in providing quality health care in rural areas, we \nhave allowed rural health care to reach the brink of complete \nbreakdown. The Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 will go a long \nway towards rectifying this dire situation.\n  The investments through the Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001 \nwill address the kernel problem of health care in America. Next week \nthe Senate will engage in a healthy debate about patients' rights \nlegislation and it is likely that Congress will tackle Medicare reform \nwithin the near future as well. These arguments will be academic for \nmany of my constituents if rural hospitals, clinics, and other \nproviders across my State can no longer afford to serve their \ncommunities.\n  By passing the Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 2001, we can \ndefuse the time bomb which is rural America's health care crisis. I \nurge each of my colleagues to consider this legislation carefully and \nhope for its prompt passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Helms, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 1032. A bill to expand assistance to countries seriously affected \nby HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have spoken several times over the last \nfew months on what many consider to be the most pressing moral, \nhumanitarian and public health crisis of modern times, the worldwide \nepidemic of HIV/AIDS. I have previously gone into great detail about \nthe impact of the disease on families, communities, economies, and \nregional stability.\n  Sometimes we feel overwhelmed by the enormity of insolvable problems. \nWe become inured to the tragedy, and look for problems we can more \neasily solve. But we must not turn away from the world-wide devastation \nof HIV/AIDS. Just consider this: right now, 36 million people are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS a fatal infectious disease, mostly in developing \ncountries. That number is more than the total combined populations of \nVirginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Maryland, Kentucky, Connecticut, \nNew Mexico, Vermont and Nebraska. As of today, AIDS have orphaned 13 \nmillion children, more than the entire population of Illinois.\n  Compounding this burden, over 8 million people acquire tuberculosis \neach year, and 500 million more get malaria, both diseases that \ndisproportionately affect the poorest countries. Frequently forgotten, \nmalaria still kills a child every 40 seconds. Remember the horrific \nlinks between HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. If you have AIDS you are much \nmore likely to contract TB, and TB has become the greatest killer of \nthose with AIDS. Similarly, if a person with HIV/AIDS contracts \nmalaria, that person is more likely to die. And infectious diseases \nsuch as these cause 25 percent of all the deaths in the world today. \nBut as Americans, we have many reasons to be proud of our response to \nthe challenges.\n  The U.S. has been a leader in the global battles against AIDS, \nmalaria and TB. This year, we are spending over $460 million on \ninternational AIDS assistance alone, not including research. This is \napproximately half of all the funds being spent on HIV/AIDS from all \nsources worldwide. In addition, we spend over $250 million on \ninternational TB and malaria programs. But we, and the rest of the \nworld, must do more. The U.N. estimates that for basic HIV/AIDS \nprevention, treatment and care programs in Africa alone, over $3 \nbillion will be required, and at least $5 billion needed if specific \nanti-AIDS drugs are more widely used.\n  In Abuja, Nigeria, on April 26, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan \ncalled for a global ``war chest'' to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB. \nFew thought that his call would so quickly be answered.\n  On May 11, just 2 weeks later, Senator Leahy and I joined Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan and Nigerian President Obasanjo as President Bush \nannounced his intent to contribute $200 million as seed money for a new \nglobal fund designed to provide grants for prevention, infrastructure \ndevelopment, care and treatment for AIDS, malaria and TB. And this is \nto be over and above our already substantial bilateral commitments.\n  Uniquely, it will be financed jointly by governments and the private \nsector, and will focus on integrated approaches to turning back, and \neventually conquering these scourges. While emphasizing prevention, \nthis new initiative will also seek to develop health infrastructures so \nnecessary to deliver services. Importantly, it will also support \nscience-based care and treatment programs, including provision of \ndrugs, and support for those, such as orphans, who are affected by \ndisease, not just infected by it.\n  And because of recent action by the pharmaceutical companies to slash \nprices of AIDS drugs in Africa, for the first time in history, the \ndrugs that revolutionized AIDS care and treatment in the U.S. can \nbecome part of a comprehensive prevention and care strategy in many \nmore countries. This global fund is a new idea, it isn't a U.S. fund, \nor a U.N. fund, or a World Bank fund. However, it builds on last year's \nlandmark work and legislation spearheaded by Congressman Jim Leach, \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee, and Senator John Kerry to establish a \nmultilateral funding mechanism for HIV/AIDS.\n  A key component of the Global Fund will be the full participation of \nthe private sector, including business, NGOs, foundations and \nindividual citizens. The problem is so large that governments cannot do \nthe work alone. Non-governmental organizations, both faith-based and \nsecular will be critical in the delivery of prevention and care \nservices and to quickly converting good intentions into practical \nprograms on the ground. And use of the funds will be closely monitored \nto ensure that good public health and\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\nscience drive the programs and intellectual property rights are \nprotected.\n  The legislation Senators Kerry, Helms, Leahy, Durbin, and I are \nintroducing today authorizes $200 million for fiscal year 2002, and \n$500 million for fiscal year 2003 to be appropriated for payment to the \nglobal trust fund. It will not substitute for, or reduce, resource \nlevels otherwise appropriated for our excellent bilateral and \nmultilateral HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB programs. This will be money well \nspent, it will save lives, and just as important, it will provide hope \nto the millions of people around the world who can do so much if given \nthe prospect of a healthy future for themselves and their children.\n  Since the President was the first to announce our participation in \nthe Global Fund for HIV/AIDS and Other Infectious Diseases, others have \nstepped up. France announced an initial contribution of $128 million, \nthe United Kingdom has promised $106 million, and Japan is considering \na significant commitment in the near future. Of particular interest, \nWinterthur- Credit Swisse has just announced a $1 million contribution, \nand others in the global business community are expected to follow. \nOther companies and foundations are considering financial or in-kind \ncontributions.\n  Kofi Annan himself has offered $100,000 of his own money for the \nfund. I have also been told by U.N. Staff in New York that they have \nreceived many calls from private citizens asking how they can \ncontribute. One gentleman from Virginia wants to send a check for $600. \nI have been assured that he and others like him will not have long to \nwait. A tax-exempt account for donations and toll-free number for \ninformation are being created as I speak. I understand that \nnegotiations are underway with United Way to see if it can use its vast \noutreach to encourage donations. This is terrific news.\n  Every American, and others throughout the world, should join this \nfight against the diseases that have too long threatened our children, \ndestroyed families, and undermined economic development of dozens of \nnations. This is not just government's fight. It is all of our \nresponsibility to conquer HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB and consign them to \nthe waste-bin of history.\n  Last week I had the opportunity of meeting with a remarkable woman \nfrom Atlanta who contracted HIV/AIDS at age 16. Denise Stokes has \nstruggled with the virus for 15 years. She described what it was like \nspending time in hospital intensive care units and what it was like to \nnot have access to available drugs. She prayed that some day there \nwould be a cure and watched, from the depth of her illness, as \npolicymakers seemed unable to grapple with the public health and \npersonal tragedy that was AIDS. She is now sharing her experiences with \nchurches, college students, community and professional organizations--\nchallenging us to follow her example--to embrace our moral obligation \nto reach out beyond our selves, our communities and beyond our own \ncountry borders to fully battle the infectious diseases that are \ndestroying so many lives on our planet. Denise Stokes' message is one \nof rising to a challenge, and bringing hope to the sick and their loved \nones. All America must rise to this historic challenge and join in \nsending a message of hope.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dayton, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 1033.

A bill to establish programs to protect the resources of and \nareas surrounding the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three bills \ncalled the Great Lakes Initiative which are designed to protect the \nfive Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes are one of our Nation's most precious natural \nresources. They contain one-fifth of the world's fresh water supply and \nprovide safe drinking water to millions of people every day.\n  The Great Lakes also play a vital role in the economies of the Great \nLakes States, including recreation, tourism, commercial shipping, \nindustrial and agriculture. That is why I am introducing legislation \ntoday to protect this vital resource for the use, benefit, and \nenjoyment of present and future generations of Americans.\n  Three bills make up this new Great Lakes Initiative: (1) the Great \nLakes Water Protection Act; (2) the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act; \nand (3) the Great Lakes Preservation Act.\n  The first bill, the Great Lakes Water Protection Act, would protect \nthe Great Lakes from environmentally dangerous oil and gas drilling. I \nam pleased that this bill has strong bipartisan support in both the \nHouse and the Senate, with Senators Fitzgerald, Levin, Chafee, Kohl, \nFeingold, Dayton, Clinton, Durbin, Wellstone, Bayh, Corzine, and Boxer \nas original cosponsors.\n  The Great Lakes support many fragile coastlines and wetlands. Lake \nMichigan alone contains over 417 coastal wetlands, the most of any \nGreat Lake. These shorelines are also home to many rare and endangered \nplant and wildlife species, including the rare piping plover, Michigan \nmonkey flower, Pitcher's thistle, and the dwarf lake iris.\n  The Great Lakes also play a vital role in the economies of the Great \nLakes States. In particular, coastal communities rely heavily on the \nGreat Lake's resources and natural beauty to support tourism and \nrecreation activities. The most recent estimate shows that recreational \nfishing totaled $1.5 billion in expenditures in Michigan alone.\n  Drilling in the Great Lakes could expose our valuable fresh water \nsupply to serious contamination, cause serious environmental damage to \nthe water and shoreline of the Great Lakes, and have crippling effects \non Great Lakes communities that depend on tourism and recreation for \ntheir local economies. The Great Lakes Water Protection Act would \nprohibit new oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes.\n  During the ban, the Environmental Protection Agency and National \nAcademy of Sciences would conduct a two-year study examining the \nimpacts on drilling on the environment, public health, the water \nsupply, and local economies. Once the study is completed, Congress can \nanalyze the results of the study and lift the ban on oil and gas \ndrilling if it deems appropriate.\n  This bill would also provide $50 million per year for park and \nshoreline conservation to the Great Lakes States to offset any lost oil \nroyalty revenues during the ban on drilling.\n  The second bill, Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act, seeks to curb \nthe influx of invasive species into the Great Lakes. I am pleased that \nthis bill also has strong bipartisan support with Senators Fitzgerald, \nLevin, Voinovich, Kohl, Feingold, Durbin, DeWine, Dayton, Wellstone, \nSchumer, and Bayh as original cosponsors. The bill would\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\ntry to stop the importation of invasive species by prohibiting ballast \nwater discharges in the Great Lakes and requiring sophisticated \nsterilization of ballast water tanks as well. This is based on a \nbipartisan bill in the House introduced by Congressman Hoekstra and \nCongressman Barcia.\n  Invasive species have already damaged the Great Lakes in a number of \nways. They have destroyed thousands of fish and threatened clean \ndrinking water.\n  For example, Lake Michigan once housed the largest self-reproducing \nlake trout fishery in the entire world. The invasive sea lamprey, which \nwas introduced from ballast water almost 80 years ago, has contributed \ngreatly to the decline of trout and whitefish in the Great Lakes by \nfeeding on and killing native trout species.\n  Today, lake trout must be stocked because they cannot naturally \nreproduce in the lake. Many Great Lakes States have had to place severe \nrestrictions on catching yellow perch because invasive species such as \nthe zebra mussel disrupt the Great Lakes' ecosystem and compete with \nyellow perch for food. The zebra mussel's filtration also increases \nwater clarity, which may be making it easier for predators to prey upon \nthe yellow perch. Moreover, tiny organisms like zooplankton that help \nform the base of the Great Lakes food chain, have declined due to \nconsumption by exploding populations of zebra mussels.\n  The Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act would ban ballast water \ndischarges in the Great Lakes. The bill would require ships to \ndischarge ballast water and sterilize the ballast water tanks before \nentering the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of any non-\nindigenous species. The act also would significantly increase funding \nfor invasive species research and ballast water technology, by \nproviding $100 million in research grants over the next five years.\n  The research grants would encourage collaboration between the \ncolleges and universities, and the shipping industry to help develop \nnew and better ballast water purification technologies.\n  The third bill, the Great Lakes Preservation Act, would ban dangerous \nbulk water diversions while the Great Lakes Compact makes \nrecommendations on how specifically to implement appropriate governing \nstandards. This bill also has strong bipartisan support with Senators \nFitzgerald, Levin, Kohl, Feingold, Dayton, Schumer, and Bayh as \noriginal co-sponsors.\n  Bulk water diversion could become a serious threat to the fresh water \nsupplies of the Great Lakes in the future. We must stop this in our \ncountries and negotiate with Canada to do the same.\n  Global water demand is doubling every 21 years, while only 1 percent \nof the water in the Great Lakes is renewed each year by precipitation \nor runoff. At the same time, scientists predict that by the end of the \ncentury, Great Lakes water levels could decline by 1.5 to 8 feet due to \nincreased evaporation; and within the next three decades we may see a \ndecline by as much as 3 feet. This of course is in addition to the \nhistoric fluctuations in lake levels that can vary by as much as 6.5 \nfeet.\n  The bill also would help provide new funding sources to preserve and \nrestore historic Great Lakes lighthouses. Great Lakes lighthouses have \nhelped mariners navigate the Great Lakes and find safe harbors for \ndecades, and are an important part of the maritime history of the Great \nLakes. Many of these lighthouses have historical or architectural \nsignificance, but are unfortunately in poor condition because of \nneglect and deterioration.\n  The Act would help find new funding sources to preserve the \nlighthouses by directing the National Park Service to Study the Great \nLakes lighthouses and recommend the best course of action for \npreserving and restoring the lighthouses.\n  The Great Lakes are a precious natural resource not just to their \nneighboring States, but to the entire country. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to join me and protect this vital resource for the use, \nbenefit, and enjoyment of present and future generations of Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Water Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Great Lakes contain \\1/5\\ of the world's fresh \n     water supply;\n       (2) the Great Lakes basin is home to over 33,000,000 people \n     and is a vital source of safe drinking water for millions of \n     people;\n       (3) the Great Lakes support many wetlands, sand dunes, and \n     other fragile coastal habitats;\n       (4) those coastal habitats are home to many endangered and \n     threatened wildlife and plant species, including the piping \n     plover, Pitcher's thistle, and the dwarf lake iris;\n       (5) the Great Lakes are crucial to the economies of the \n     Great Lakes States for recreation, commercial shipping, and \n     industrial and agriculture uses; and\n       (6) oil and gas development beneath the water in any of the \n     Great Lakes could--\n       (A) expose a valuable fresh water supply of the United \n     States to serious contamination; and\n       (B) cause serious environmental damage to the water and \n     shoreline of the Great Lakes.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT ON THE GREAT \n                   LAKES.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended by \n     inserting after section 108 (33 U.S.C. 1258) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 108A.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Stabenow, in \nintroducing 3 pieces of legislation to help protect the nation's \nlargest source of fresh water--the Great Lakes.\n  The first bill, The Great Lakes Water Protection Act, will prevent \nnew oil and gas drilling beneath the lakes until the EPA, in \ncooperation with the National Academy of Science, the Great Lakes \nStates, and other interested parties, is able to study the impacts that \ndrilling may have to water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, drinking \nwater, and other coastal land-use activities.\n  It is just not worth taking a chance on harming this critical \nresource for a small amount of oil and natural gas.\n  Slant drilling, while a more environmentally friendly method than the \ntraditional drilling methods, is imperfect. Wells can blow out and \nequipment can be damaged. Because just one quart of oil can contaminate \nup to two million gallons of drinking water, the risk of drilling is \nespecially acute when these wells are located directly next to the \nGreat Lakes which serve as the source of drinking water for so many \ncommunities. According to a recent study by the Lake Michigan \nFederation, the normal slant drilling process could result in ground \nwater contamination, surface water pollution, and the release of \nhazardous gases. If an accident were to occur, an oil or natural gas \nspill could impact Michigan's sensitive wetlands, sand dunes, and \nwildlife habitat. Oil leaked or washed into the Lakes would affect fish \nspecies, especially in the sensitive near-shore spawning and nursery \nareas, detrimentally impacting the Great Lakes commercial and \nrecreational fisheries. We surely need to thoroughly review all \npossible risks before making decisions that could chance these \nirreplaceable natural resources.\n  Additionally, there are existing human activities along the Great \nLakes' coasts, and we need to find out how drilling activities could \nimpact those communities. Even advocates of drilling admit that some \ndamage at shore-line drilling sites is inevitable. Drilling requires \nthe construction of new infrastructure such as drilling rigs and sites, \nstorage tanks, and new pipelines. These facilities can deter tourism \nand hinder local community development.\n  Our pristine Great Lakes coastline is valuable to the tourism \nindustry in Michigan while the Great Lakes' energy potential is very \nsmall. Since the first U.S. well was drilled under Lake Michigan in \n1979, only 438,000 barrels of oil and about 17.5 billion cubic feet of \nnatural gas have been produced. This is not even a drop in the bucket \ncompared to the Nation's annual energy consumption of 20 million \nbarrels of oil per day and 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas per \nday. In contrast, Great Lakes recreational fishers spend $1.4 billion \nannually on gear and lake trips. The thousands of hikers, birdwatchers, \nbeach-goers and other recreational users enjoying the Great Lakes \nshoreline and coastal waters contribute millions of dollars to local \neconomies.\n  I believe that if this country should focus more on advancing \nalternative fuels. In Michigan, we can advance environmental quality \nand economic growth by supporting research into advanced technology \nvehicles.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. \nThere is\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\nsimply too much at stake to risk the Great Lakes and their shoreline.\n  The second piece of legislation, The Great Lakes Water Protection \nAct, prohibits bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes basin to be \nexported from the United States until a conservation standard governing \nwithdrawals, diversion, and use of Great Lakes water is in place. The \nGreat Lakes hold nearly 20% of the world's supply of freshwater.\n  As this legislation clearly states, the Great Lakes Governors \ncurrently have the authority to veto proposals to divert water from the \nGreat Lakes outside the basin. However, the existing process over out-\nof-basin water diversions may be subject to an international trade \ndispute. So as the global water demand doubles every 21 years, we need \na back up conservation strategy.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorizes the National Park Service \nto complete a resource study outlining options for the preservation of \nlighthouses in the Great Lakes. There are 120 Michigan lighthouses, and \napproximately 70 of these structures will be surplus property over the \nnext 10 years. Under legislation that I sponsored last year, these \nhistoric treasures will be smoothly transferred from government \nownership, and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, through \nthe National Park Service, is authorized to establish a historic \nlighthouse preservation program. The bill we are introducing today \nreinforces the government's commitment to preserving these historic \nstructures.\n  Lastly, I am cosponsoring the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act to \nattempt to control one of the most expensive and environmentally \ndangerous problems facing the Great Lakes-aquatic nuisance species.\n  Nearly 150 nonindigenous aquatic species have been accidently \nintroduced into the Great Lakes in the past century. Most of the recent \ninvasive species have been transported to the Lakes in commercial \nships' ballast water. In 1990 and 1996 Congress enacted legislation \nwhich slowed down the introduction of aquatic nuisance species in the \nGreat Lakes, however, approximately 1 new non-native organism enters \nthe Lakes each year.\n  This legislation that I am cosponsoring is designed to prevent these \ninvaders from coming into the Great Lakes and to control the movement \nof organisms once they have been introduced into the Lakes. The Coast \nGuard needs to design a standard for vessels capable of discharging \nballast water in the Great Lakes that ensures that ballast water \ncontaining aquatic species are not discharged in the Great Lakes. The \nCoast Guard needs to establish a Ballast Treatment Performance Standard \nwhich will provide flexibility for industry to utilize and improve \ntechnology in order to meet that standard in whatever manner they want. \nAdditionally, this legislation authorizes up to $100 million for \ninvasive species and ballast water technologies research grants.\n  I encourage the rest of my colleagues to support legislative efforts \nto control aquatic nuisance species. In 2002, the National Invasive \nSpecies Act of 1996 expires, and Congress will be tasked with improving \nand reauthorizing this legislation. I believe that a national \nreauthorization is important to create a unified approach rather than \nforcing the States to enact individual standards for ships in an \nattempt to control aquatic nuisance species. However, if efforts to \nreauthorize a national program should stall, I believe that this \nlegislation will help protect the Great Lakes from aquatic invaders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy Mr. Durbin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1036. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Development and \nAssistance Act of 1954 to establish an international food for education \nand child nutrition program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, together with a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues, I am pleased to be introducing this legislation to address \ntwo of the most glaring problems facing children across the globe: \nmalnutrition and the lack of educational opportunity. I very much \nappreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Leahy and Senator \nLugar, who have so strongly supported nutrition assistance for many \nyears, in developing this legislation.\n  An estimated 300 million poor children around the world either do not \nreceive food at school or do not go to school at all. About 130 million \nof the world's children, 60 percent of them girls, are presently not \nattending school. With the abundance of food here in America and in \nother nations, this reality is absolutely unconscionable.\n  Our bill, the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for \nEducation and Child Nutrition Act of 2001, will provide U.S. \nagricultural commodities and other assistance to boost child nutrition \nin connection with educational programs in developing countries.\n  I salute former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole for their work \nin promoting the Global Food for Education Initiative, and President \nClinton for recognizing its merits early on and beginning a pilot \nproject for this year.\n  The bill permanently adds this new program to existing U.S. foreign \nfood assistance programs, such as P.L. 480 and Food for Progress.\n  Our bill will apply the producing power of American farmers and \nagriculture-related industries to help families, villages and even \nnations escape the treadmill of poverty by supporting both improved \nnutrition and education for children. It also offers nutritious food \nand learning as an alternative to sending children down the dead-end \npath of exploitive work in sweatshops, mines or factories.\n  The International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program \nestablished in this legislation will be carried out through private \nnonprofit groups, cooperatives, and intergovernmental organizations. \nUnder the bill, USDA will purchase U.S. commodities and cover the costs \nof making them available in developing countries to provide nutrition \nfor children in connection with educational programs. Funding would \nbegin at $300 million in fiscal 2002 and increase to $750 million in \nfiscal 2006.\n  The problems of global malnutrition and limited education are so \nlarge that participation by other countries is crucially important. \nAccordingly, this bill specifically encourages other donor countries \nand the private sector to support the program. If concerned nations \nwill come together and make a firm commitment, we can end child hunger, \nchild poverty and exploitive child labor and lift families and nations \nfrom poverty.\n  This bill continues our Nation's proud tradition of helping to build \na better future for children in developing countries and I am proud we \nare introducing it today. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation and ask, unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today we introduce the George McGovern-\nRobert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Act of \n2001.\n  This is a momentous day for needy children around the world. And it \nis America's opportunity to embark on a bold venture that can have \nunexpected benefits, and advance world peace and understanding.\n  The name of our legislation honors two great leaders, and two great \nfriends, Ambassador George McGovern and Senator Bob Dole. It was a \nprivilege for me to serve on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry Committee with both of them for many years. I have known both \nof them for years and they know that each hungry child is an empty \npromise.\n  Nutrition is the key not only to health but to education and economic \nprogress in many developing societies. This initiative taps America's \nagricultural bounty to become a catalyst for real and lasting change in \nmany struggling nations. This bill can literally change the world.\n  I am thrilled that Chairman Tom Harkin will join with ranking member \nDick Lugar and me on this Senate bill. It would be hard to find, in the \nlast 13 years, a nutrition or agriculture bill sponsored by Senator \nLugar, Senator Harkin and me--that is not now the law of the land.\n  We are pleased to have Senator DeWine with us in this effort. I work \nwith him on the Judiciary Committee and I know he is a strong fighter \nfor children. Senators Kohl, Dorgan, Dashle, Kennedy, Durbin, Conrad, \nJohnson, Landrieu, and Dayton are also on the bill. Each, in their own \nright, are leaders in protecting children.\n  This bill will make private voluntary organizations and the World \nFood Program full partners with USDA in implementing this bold \neducation and child nutrition vision. I want to make clear that the \nbill unambiguously provides that PVOs are full partners with USDA, just \nas the WFP will be.\n  Ambassador George McGovern has said about this effort that, ``Dollar \nfor dollar it is the best investment we can make in creating a \nhealthier, better educated and more effective global citizenry.'' He \nspoke of how the program would be of ``enormous benefit'' to the \neducation of girls, since in Third World countries parents will also \nsend girls to school if meals are offered.\n  I want to point out that one Catholic Relief Services project \noffering meals and education in Ghana has seen the ``number of girls \nenrolled in school jump by 88 percent, and their attendance rose by 50 \npercent.'' In Pakistan, the World Food Program offered cooking oil to \nfamilies if they sent their children, especially girls, to school. The \nparents' response was overwhelming and the ``enrollment of girls has \ndoubled.'' In similar projects in Niger ``girls' attendance rose by 75 \npercent, and by 100 percent in Morocco.''\n  This is clearly a great idea for children who otherwise may have no \nhope, and no future.\n  Most beginnings rarely seem momentous at the time, and then, looking \nback, every detail is studied by students and scholars and meaning is \nattached to every step. I want to chronicle some aspects of this \nbeginning when memories are fresh.\n  I will again mention my good friend Ambassador George McGovern. \nFirst, I appreciate that President George W. Bush decided to keep \nGeorge McGovern on as Ambassador to the U.N. food agencies in Rome, \nItaly. This demonstrated a keen bipartisan spirit, and the best choice \nfor the job.\n  Last year, George McGovern authored a paper setting forth a bold \nvision for a multinational effort to provide meals to children in \nschool settings. He is an expert having worked on school lunch issues \nduring his eighteen years on the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, as a Director of the Food for Peace program, and now as U.S. \nAmbassador to the U.N. food agencies.\n  He further explained this bold vision at Senate Agriculture Committee \nhearing on July 27, 2000. What a pleasure it was for me to listen to \nboth Ambassador McGovern and Former Majority Leader Bob Dole at this \nhearing presided over by my friend and colleague, then Chairman Dick \nLugar. The hearing featured two giants in the history of nutrition \nprograms adding another chapter to their legacies, under the watchful \neye of a very decent, intelligent, and understanding Senator, Senator \nLugar, who cares about the state of the world.\n  At the hearing, George McGovern said that ``if we could achieve the \ngoal of reaching 300 million hungry children with one good meal every \nday, that would transform life on this planet.'' He pointed out another \nsignificant benefit in that `'it would raise the income of American \nfarmers and those in other countries that have farm surpluses.''\n  Senator Dole, another giant in the history of nutrition programs, \nsupported this vision and commended the Clinton administration for \nlaunching a $300 million school feeding pilot program to feed hungry \nchildren throughout the world. He said, ``I can think of no better \nsolution to the problem [of agricultural surpluses] than to support a \nprogram that will help our farmers while putting food in the stomachs \nof desperately hungry and malnourished children.''\n  This brings me to another leading player in this bipartisan effort, \nformer President William Clinton. He elevated these issues by raising \nthe idea at the G8 meeting in Okinawa, Japan, in July, 2000. He urged \nthe eight industrialized democracies at the start of the new millennium \nto contribute some of their wealth, natural resources and goodness to \nhelp the next generation of the world. The President announced this \n$300 million Global Food for Education Initiative to feed hungry \nchildren and pledged to work with other nations to seek support and \ncontributions from them. This gave the McGovern-Dole proposal new force \nand captured the interest and attention of other nations. The \nPresident's staff, including Tom Friendman and chief of staff John \nPodesta, worked diligently to get this program off the ground and \ndedicated career staff at USDA, including Richard Fritz and Mary \nChambliss, worked long hours to launch the President's initiative.\n  At that same hearing, then Secretary Dan Glickman noted that \nworldwide 120 million children are not enrolled in school and that tens \nof millions drop out before achieving basic literacy. He explained how \na global school meals program would reduce the incidence of child labor \nand have the potential to raise academic performance and increase \nliteracy rates. He noted what a draw school meals can be, when a school \nfeeding program in the Dominican Republic was temporarily suspended, 25 \npercent of the children dropped out of school.\n  Another tremendous force in the history of this initiative is \nCatherine Bertini, the Executive Director of the World Food Program. I \nhave known Cathy since I first met her when she was being confirmed as \nAssistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and Consumer Service over a \ndecade ago, under President George Bush.\n  She was an outstanding and creative leader in that job and I was \nhappy to support her for the World Food Program position. I treasure \nmemories of a detailed briefing she gave my wife, Marcelle, and me at \nher apartment in\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\nRome, Italy. Her concern for hungry children, her command of the facts \nand her extreme competence and management abilities have made her a \ntruly outstanding director.\n  In an interesting coincidence, my chief advisor and legal counsel on \nnutrition policies since 1987, Ed Barron, has been a friend of Cathy's \nsince high school. He went to school in Homer, NY, and Cathy attended \nneighboring Cortland High School.\n  Cathy explained that in one original idea the WFP offered ``take \nhome'' food to a family for every month that a girl attended school \nregularly. Cathy noted that `'the results have been dramatic'' as \nschool attendance greatly increased. Cathy proposed some great \nprinciples that, I agree, should be followed. Such an international \nfeeding program should be sustainable, it should be mostly school-\nbased, and it should be targeted to the most needy. Of course, we need \nto employ a loose definition of school, since a teacher can teach and \nschool children can learn in practically any setting.\n  In addition, she noted that the United States should use its special \nknowledge and experience to help other countries develop these \nprograms. USDA and US AID experts should make periodic visits to work \nwith national personnel and PVOs and others to build capacity and \nsustainable projects.\n  Joseph Scalise who represents the World Food Program here in \nWashington, D.C. has done a wonderful job keeping me and my staff \ninformed of developments regarding WFP efforts and views.\n  Another major force in international feeding efforts is Ellen \nLevinson. As Executive Director of the Coalition for Food Aid, she has \ndone a very effective job representing many private voluntary \norganizations who provide food and other assistance throughout the \nworld. She is a strong advocate for an integrated approach for physical \nand cognitive child development, with a focus on much more than just a \nmeal or food ration. In addition to food assistance, Ellen wants the \ninitiative to provide quality education and development.\n  Another leader in the area has been my good friend Marshall Matz. He \nhas been a vigorous advocate and friendly adviser in this effort.\n  I also want to mention Elizabeth Darrow of my staff who has played a \nmajor role in helping organize this effort and making sure we kept it \non track.\n  This bill has been greatly advanced by staff of Senators Harkin and \nLuger. Chief of Staff Mark Halverson and chief economist Stephanie \nMercier attended many meetings and helped craft a fine bill. The \nRepublican Chief of Staff for the Committee, Keith Luse, and his staff \nincluding Chris Salisbury, Dave Johnson and Michael Knipe, provided \nextremely useful guidance and advice about how best to structure this \nprogram and help ensure that the benefits get delivered to needy \nchildren. This was truly a team effort.\n  As always, the outstanding drafting skills of Gary Endicott of Senate \nLegislative Counsel are much appreciated. I have many times recognized \nhis tremendous service to the Senate.\n  Congressman Jim McGovern and Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson, along with \nCongressman Tony Hall and others, recognized the bold potential of this \neffort right from the start. Many staff working for the other body \nprovided a great deal of assistance, but Cindy Buhl needs to be \nespecially recognized for her long hours of work, and dedication to the \nproject. Cindy, and her boss Jim McGovern, took command of this effort \nand deserve a lot of credit.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral effort, now looks to the new \nAdministration for assistance. I, and all my colleagues, are eager to \nwork with the Bush White House and Secretary Veneman to make this \ninternational education and child nutrition initiative a success. It \nmay be imperative to have the President extend the current pilot \nprogram for one more year to insure continuity of service, and to \nprovide an opportunity to work out all the kinks in a new project. The \nPresident could provide additional funding out of the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to help us bridge the gap.\n  I also want to thank the GAO team that is working on analyzing the \ncurrent effort. The GAO is helping to provide valuable advice on how to \nimprove this effort.\n  I want to briefly mention some thoughts from Ambassador McGovern's \nbook, ``The Third Freedom.'' He begins with: ``Hunger is a political \ncondition. The earth has enough knowledge and resources to eradicate \nthis ancient scourge.''\n  I completely agree--and because addressing hunger is a moral \nimperative, the U.S. should lead the way. I am very hopeful that many \nnations who we have helped in the past--including economic gains in \nEurope who benefited from our Marshall Plan after WWII--will follow our \nlead and offer food, technical assistance and financial aid.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislative and \nmoral effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join so many of my \ncolleagues in sponsoring the global school lunch legislation proposed \ntoday by Senators Leahy and DeWine. This bill is the product of much \nhard work by our former colleagues Dole and McGovern, and also by \nofficials at all levels of government, the World Food Program, and the \nmany non-governmental agencies that have pioneered international school \nfeeding programs.\n  Much has already been accomplished. Under a trial program, the \nDepartment of Agriculture is preparing to ship 630,000 tons of wheat, \nsoybeans, rice, dry milk, corn, and other food to nine million children \nin 38 nations throughout Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern \nEurope. This legislation will be an important incentive to strengthen \nthe worldwide effort.\n  Bob Dole and George McGovern worked well together in the Senate to \npromote child nutrition in America. The results of their landmark \nNational School Lunch program have been impressive--improved nutrition \nand health, and increased academic performance as well. Their \nsuccessful school lunch idea can benefit children in need throughout \nthe world.\n  Hunger remains a painful reality every day for over 300 million \nchildren across the globe, and we can do more--much more to combat it. \nWe know the cure for hunger, and I hope that Congress will move quickly \nto enact this needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/13/senate-section/article/S6234-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 800.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 1029, introduced earlier today by \nSenators Sarbanes, Gramm, Reed of Rhode Island, Shelby, Schumer, \nAllard, Bayh, Enzi, Johnson, Mikulski, and Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1029) to clarify the authority of the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development with respect to the use of \n     fees during fiscal year 2001 for the manufactured housing \n     program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is a technical correction to last \nyear's Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. I ask for its immediate \napproval. This legislation is being cosponsored by Senators Gramm, \nReed, Shelby, Allard, Bayh, Enzi, Schumer, and Bond.\n  Last year, in a bipartisan effort, Congress passed the ``American \nHomeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000.'' Title VI of that \nlaw is the ``Manufactured Housing Improvement Act'' originally \nintroduced by Senators Shelby, Bayh, Johnson, and others. Unfortunately \ndue to a technical problem with the law, the manufactured housing \nprogram, run by HUD, may be forced to shut down as early as next week.\n  Last year's legislation was the result of extensive bipartisan \nnegotiations, and negotiations with industry and consumer groups, all \nof whom supported the final product. The legislation passed by \nunanimous consent in both the Senate and the House. The new law enacted \nis a long-overdue and significant streamlining and reform of the \nmanufactured housing program. It also provides expanded consumer \nprotections, improved safety requirements, and a process that allows \nfor faster updating of regulations.\n  The manufactured housing program is funded through fees HUD levies on \nthe industry. Prior to the new Act, HUD could spend those funds as \nneeded. However, to maintain better oversight of the program, the new \nlaw made the spending of the fees subject to appropriations.\n  Unfortunately, the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act passed after \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill, so the appropriators could make no \nprovision for the spending of the funds HUD has collected since the \nManufactured Housing Improvement Act passed on December 27, 2000.\n  As a result, HUD has continued to collect the fees, but it is unable \nto spend them without specific authorization in an appropriations bill \nto do so. Clearly it was not our intent for this to happen. The \nlegislation my colleagues and I are introducing today will allow HUD to \ncontinue to run the program until the next VA-HUD Appropriations bill \npasses. I also want to be clear that these funds are subject to all \nother requirements contained in the National Housing Construction and \nSafety Standards Act of 1974.\n  I ask that it be passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthree times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statement relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1029) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

At that time there will \nbe 60 minutes of total debate time on the Harkin and Sessions IDEA \namendments.

However, \nSenator Daschle has indicated we are going to stay here tomorrow until \nwe complete this bill. We have a number of things lined up after the \nSessions and Harkin amendments. We expect we will complete a couple of \ndifficult amendments shortly. But we hope early afternoon we can \ncomplete this legislation.\n  I repeat, Senator Daschle said we are going to stay here tomorrow and \nif we have to work through the night into Friday, we are going to \ncomplete this legislation. We have worked very hard to complete scores \nof amendments this week. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow, but I \nthink if we complete this bill, it is quite clear we will be out on \nFriday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/13/senate-section/article/S6237-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
