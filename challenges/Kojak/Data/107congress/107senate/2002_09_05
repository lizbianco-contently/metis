Now she has \noffered to pick up and accelerate the programs on the Atlantic salmon. \nI ask for its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, the ranking member. This completes the series of amendments \nto which I alluded earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4481\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their fine \nwork. We are now debating an amendment that was laid down by a number \nof Senators. Senator Daschle took the lead and I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor. It deals with the question of disaster relief.\n  I have to say, as the Senator from Minnesota, I take this debate in \nthe next hour, hour and a half, or 2 hours as serious as any debate I \nhave ever been involved in because I think literally this is at least \nan economic life-or-death question for many farmers in Minnesota, \nspecifically northwestern Minnesota.\n  Before I talk about my State, I want to make this appeal to all of my \ncolleagues. There was a front-page story in the Washington Post today--\nand I know Senator Nelson and Senator Hagel have spoken about this--\nabout the drought in Nebraska. It is heartbreaking to read about that. \nIt is just almost unprecedented drought conditions. For these ranchers, \ncattlemen, and farmers, the time is not neutral. Time moves on. If we \ndon't take any action and get help to them, the farm bill becomes \nirrelevant because they don't have any crops and they are not going to \nbe able to produce to get a price.\n  They didn't ask for the drought. It is the same thing in South \nDakota. Then I read about the fires in Colorado and in Arizona. They \ndidn't ask for that. During the years that I have been here in the \nSenate, we have also had Senators come to the floor from different \nStates where there have been hurricanes or tornadoes. Certainly, that \nhas happened in Minnesota. It is devastating, these natural disasters. \nIt has nothing to do with whether people work hard or are good \nmanagers.\n  As I have said, there but for the grace of God go I. Nobody knows, in \nour part of the country, when you could be hit by a tornado. In other \nparts of the country, it could be a hurricane, drought, fire, or \nflooding.\n  So I think this vote is a test of our goodness. I am not going to \nbash away at the administration. I hope the administration is changing \nits view and not working strongly against this amendment. Frankly, I \nwill give all the credit in the world to anybody who helps. It doesn't \nreally matter to me. If the White House is going to show flexibility \nand support, and we pass this amendment on the floor, and it is kept in \nconference, I will applaud everybody and give credit to everybody. I \nhope that is the way it will be because, frankly, I think disaster \nrelief is really--look, people say I have been in a lot of intense \ndebates on the floor and probably will be in one this afternoon about \nthese scoundrel companies that go to Bermuda and set up sham \nheadquarters and don't pay their fair share of taxes.\n  I don't think the whole question of emergency disaster relief has any \nparty label to it. Certainly, the people whose lives are destroyed are \nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents, or none of the above. Certainly, \nthis is about our States and the people we represent and\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\ndoesn't have a lot to do with party identification, period.\n  As I said yesterday--and I will get to the specifics about \nMinnesota--I know I have never voted against disaster assistance moneys \nfor any part of the country because I think it is an example of there \nbut for the grace of God go I. We are grateful that I can help other \nparts of the country, and we are grateful it wasn't our homes or farms \nor that it didn't happen in our State. We are grateful that it didn't \nhappen in our communities. But sometimes it does happen in our State \nand in our communities, in which case we come to the floor and ask \ncolleagues for support.\n  Really, on the whole question of offsets, we haven't done offsets for \ndisaster relief before. This is just something that happens and we know \nwhen it happens that we provide the help. So in the case of Minnesota, \nwe are talking about 17 counties in northwest Minnesota. We are talking \nabout rich farmland and about having been really massively damaged and \ndevastated by the flooding. FEMA does good work. I love the work they \ndo. They have been to Minnesota many times. They are an amazing group \nof men and women. It is an interesting job they have. They come in \ncrisis situations and help with temporary housing, and the Small \nBusiness Administration tries to help with additional funding; and if \nthere is damage of infrastructure, public infrastructure, they have \nhelped us rebuild schools in our State.\n  As my colleague from Montana and all Senators who are from farm \ncountry know, they do not provide assistance to the farmers. We need \nhelp for these farmers--the wheat growers, corn growers, soybean \ngrowers, you name it. Everything that is in the farm bill will be \nirrelevant. We are lucky if it covers 70 percent of the cost. We would \nbe very lucky. The farmers cannot afford a 30-percent loss.\n  I call on our colleagues for their support. The past is the past, and \nthe present is the present. I am interested in the present. We had in \nthe Senate bill farm money for disaster relief assistance. I wish it \nhad been kept in conference. It was not. That is beside the point. It \nis in the past. We tried to put it on the emergency supplemental bill, \nand there was opposition.\n  My hope today is that we will come together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and we will do it because we know this is what we always \ndo. When people are faced with these kinds of crises--this does not \nhave anything to do with low prices; it does not have anything to do \nwith countercyclical payments or dairy payments; it does not have \nanything to do with the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  This has to do with weather-related disasters that have literally \ndevastated so many people in farm country in America today and/or in \nother parts of our country today. I think of the fires again.\n  I come to the Chamber to urge my colleagues, to appeal to my \ncolleagues to please support this amendment. Please support it. This \namendment will provide much needed help to many wonderful, hard-working \npeople in northwestern Minnesota and, for that matter, around the \ncountry.\n  The vote we are going to have, which will probably be sometime before \nnoon, will be a critically important vote. We will need 60 votes. I \nhope we get the 60 votes. I say to the Chair, having been to northwest \nMinnesota several times, these have been some of the toughest meetings \nI have ever attended. The farmers are at their wits end. It is not like \nthey are asking for help. The Presiding Officer knows some of the \npeople about whom I am speaking. They are not comfortable asking for \nhelp. They know they have to have help or there is no tomorrow; they \nwill have no future at all.\n  If they can get the good news today that the Senate said, We are \ngoing to provide you with the help, we are going to provide the \ndisaster relief money, it will make all the difference in the world. If \nwe get over 60 votes, I really believe we will have a good chance of \nkeeping it in conference. I think the White House will support us, and \nwe can do this together.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, having a pretty clear picture about when \nwe talk about $300 million worth or $350 million worth of damage and \nnumber of acres, I translate that all into personal terms. I think of \nall the husbands, wives, children, and families with whom I have met. \nThe farmers are not here, but they are counting on us to represent them \nwell.\n  I say to all Senators, please represent well the people in the \ncountry who have been hit with these natural disasters, and please vote \nfor this amendment. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 5 or 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, as we contemplate military action \nagainst Iraq, I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues the \nrationalization, in the opinion of the junior Senator from Alaska, of \nthe circumstances surrounding the risk to allow Saddam Hussein to \ncontinue to develop weapons of mass destruction. It is no secret that \nover an extended period of time, Saddam Hussein and Iraq have been \ndeveloping this capability. It not only includes chemical weapons and \nbiological weapons, but a delivery system. Clearly, we have seen as a \nconsequence of the Persian Gulf war the capability of a delivery system \nreaching Israel. In addition to that, we have every reason to believe \nhe is developing his nuclear capability.\n  The question to which we have to relate is, of course, the obligation \nas to how to thwart this exposure from the standpoint of the United \nStates' role as not only the peacekeeper of the world but the \nrecognition that if the United States does not do it, it probably will \nnot be done.\n  I bring that reference up to simply highlight a comparison. Had we \nknown in advance of 9/11 the contemplated exposure--not only to the \nUnited States, but the peace of the world, as we knew the world prior \nto that time and the recognition that a number of aircraft was going to \nbe used as weapons and the consequences associated with the aircraft \nthat went into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon, and, \nof course, the exposure in Washington and other areas of the United \nStates associated with the activities at that time--we would have taken \nsome action, Mr. President. There is no question about it because we \nknew the ramifications of not taking such action.\n\n  What I am saying is we have a dilemma in the sense of a recognized \nconcentration of weapons of mass destruction being controlled by an \nindividual who is not only uncontrollable but one who has, over an \nextended period of time, initiated actions such as we have seen during \nthe Persian Gulf war where he saw fit to invade Kuwait with the \nintention of going into Saudi Arabia with the objective of controlling \nthe wealth of the oil provinces of that part of the world. That was his \nobjective, make no mistake about it.\n  If he could have prevailed in Kuwait and gone into Saudi Arabia, he \nwould have controlled a good portion of Mideast oil and, hence, the \nwealth and cashflows of the area.\n  The consequences of that, as we see Saddam Hussein again amassing \nthis threat as a consequence of his development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, brings us to the evaluation of what action we should take. \nIs it inevitable that sooner or later Saddam Hussein will use these \nweapons of mass destruction, and against whom?\n  We have had an opportunity to observe a pattern of Saddam Hussein in \nthe time since the Persian Gulf war. If one can perhaps simplify it, we \nhave initiated a no-fly zone over Iraq since about 1992. In initiating \nthat no-fly zone, we have taken out some of his targets. He has \nattempted to shoot some of our aircraft down that are patrolling the \narea.\n  There is another inconsistency that stands out even more openly, and \nthat\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nis the realization that during this time we have been buying oil from \nSaddam Hussein, hundreds of thousands of barrels a day. In September of \n2001, we set a record by importing nearly 1.2 million barrels of oil \nper day from Saddam.\n  It is almost as if we would take his oil, put it in our airplanes, \nand go take out his targets. That is rather ironic. I think it is \nrather inconsistent, and it shows certainly an inconsistency in our \nforeign policy.\n  What does he do with the money he receives from the United States? \nWhy, he takes care of his Republican Guard, the group that keeps him \nalive, and develops more weapons of mass destruction and perhaps aims \nthem at our ally Israel. Maybe that is an oversimplification of foreign \npolicy. Nevertheless, that is what has been going on over a period of \ntime. So we have become, to some extent, perhaps a partner because we \nare providing Saddam Hussein indirectly, through the purchase of his \noil, with a cashflow that allows him to develop his weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Others might say that is inconsistent logic because someone else \nwould buy his oil if the United States did not. I am not going to \npursue that, other than to state a fact: We are buying hundreds of \nthousands of barrels of oil from Saddam Hussein. He is developing \nweapons of mass destruction. Where does he get the money? A portion of \nit comes from oil sales to the United States.\n  So as we contemplate our decision on initiating an action against \nSaddam Hussein, we have to look back to the circumstances surrounding \n9/11 where, had we known that the threat was what it turned out to be, \nwe would have initiated an action. We did not know. We did not initiate \nan action.\n  We can criticize our security. We can criticize the CIA and the other \nintelligence agencies for inadequate information. Nevertheless, the \nfact remains, we did not know. Had we known, we would have taken \naction.\n  In the case of Saddam Hussein, clearly we know he is developing \nweapons of mass destruction. So the point is, should we take action? If \nwe do not, who will? What is the actual threat? We do not know, but it \nis clearly a choice. We are giving Saddam Hussein a choice of either \nsurrender--in other words, open up your country to the U.N. \ninspectors--or be prepared for the ultimate alternative, and that is \nbasically to be subjected to a conflict that could go on for some time.\n\n  I see my good friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, is \nseeking recognition. I will conclude with one reference: That we need \nto consider again the obligation that the energy conferees have. The \nconference is in order. The issues are being discussed. There is an \nissue, and it is the issue of opening up ANWR that is within the \nauthority of the conference to bring back to the Senate for action. As \nthe President well knows, the House has included ANWR in its bill and \nthe issue is before the conference.\n  At a time when we are contemplating an action against Saddam Hussein, \nwhich certainly would result in an upheaval in the Mideast, it is \nimperative each Member recognize his or her obligation to address this \nwith some finality. It simply makes sense to authorize the opening of \nthis area so we can reduce our dependence on Mideast oil, particularly \nthe sources we currently get our oil from, including Iraq and Saddam \nHussein.\n  There is going to be an invitation by the conference to invite \nMembers to ANWR, to Kaktovik, on September 13. Members should avail \nthemselves of the opportunity to see for themselves that it could be \nopened up safely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for his comments. There will come a time when the Senate should \ndebate this question.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from Alaska on his concerns \nwith respect to Saddam Hussein. I believe he said we have every reason \nto believe Saddam Hussein has developed a nuclear capability. I hope I \nam not misquoting the Senator.\n  In the days ahead, we will want to know what the evidence is. I do \nnot intend to get into any long debate at this point about the matter \nbecause we have a bill before us with a pending amendment. We need to \nget on with that, but no Senator is seeking recognition at this point.\n  Perhaps Saddam Hussein has developed such a nuclear capability. When \nthe able Senator says we have every reason to believe he has, that is \nnot quite the point. Where is the evidence?\n  Of course, it is to be expected that some people in this country will \nassign unpatriotic reasons for the asking of questions by Senators. We \nhave a right to ask questions, we have a duty to ask questions, because \nwe are living in a very perilous time.\n  The war drums are beating all around us. I want to listen to what is \nsaid. I want to listen to what the President has to say. I want to \nlisten to what he is going to say at the United Nations. I hope the \nUnited Nations will respond. I am not saying we in the Congress have to \nhave authorization by the United Nations. Authorization is contained \nright here in this little book I hold in my hand, the Constitution of \nthe United States. This Congress has the power to declare war.\n  I, for one, am not going to hang my vote on an authorization by the \nU.N. for us in this Congress to do thus and so. We should know what the \nUnited Nations has to say. I think the United Nations should take a \nposition. If the straits are as dire as we hear, then the United \nNations ought to be concerned. And the United Nations ought to give the \nworld the benefit of its opinion. I am glad the President is going to \nthe United Nations.\n  I am breaking our own rules here. I ask unanimous consent, although \nthe Pastore rule may not have run its course, I may speak on a \ndifferent subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. The United Nations, I think, has a duty to let the world \nknow where it stands and what its opinion is. If this country is going \nto eventually go into a difficult situation, as may confront us, if war \nis declared by this legislative branch, or if war is approved, \nauthorized, by this legislative branch, then we in the United States \nshould not have to go it alone.\n  But when we say we have every right to believe that Saddam Hussein \nhas developed nuclear capability, well, we have every right in our \nminds to think perhaps he has, and we can easily convince ourselves, \nbut is that enough? Where is the evidence?\n  I, for one, intend to ask questions as we go along. It is not \nunpatriotic to ask questions. I intend to ask questions. I have a right \nto ask questions. Where is the evidence? We might think about that as \nwe go along.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8239-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8239-S8245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope Senators will come to the floor if \nthey have anything to say by way of debate on the pending amendment, if \nthey have an amendment to the amendment. I hope Senators will come to \nthe floor and exercise their right to offer amendments, or to speak. \nBut we do not have the time to waste by just waiting and letting the \nclock run.\n  This afternoon, the Senate will be debating the homeland security \nlegislation. Take a look at the situation we are in. October 1, a new \nfiscal year, is rapidly approaching. It is staring us in the face. Not \none appropriations bill has been sent to the President for his \nsignature. Where is the other House, where is the other body, on this \nmatter? I don't seek to point the finger, but the facts are the facts.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee of the Senate, which I chair, and the \ndistinguished former chairman, just preceding me, Senator Stevens, he \nand I and others on the committee, Republicans and Democrats, have \nreported out 13 appropriations bills. We did that before the recess. We \nin the committee have done our work. Where is the House? Why doesn't \nthe House report? I have to be careful about criticizing the other \nbody. I don't criticize. I simply ask the question, Where is the House \nin this matter?\n  The House has acted on the House floor on, I believe, six bills; I \nbelieve I am correct. The Senate on the floor has acted on, in the \npast, three appropriations bills. One is now pending. But all the \nappropriations bills have been\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nreported by our Appropriations Committee in this Senate. We did that \nbefore the recess. We need other bills from the House. The Constitution \ndoes not say appropriations bills have to start in the House. It says \nthe revenue bills must, the revenue-raising bills, but not \nappropriations. However, by custom, the House over the years has \ngenerally initiated the appropriations bills. I don't have any quarrel \nwith that.\n  So where are the other bills? Our time is fast running. The new \nfiscal year begins on October 1. Here we are, the Nation is confronted \nwith some great questions. The question of homeland security, that is \nhomeland defense. That is the defense of our country, our families, our \nchildren, right here in this country.\n  We have legislation before the Senate that deals with homeland \nsecurity. We need to get on with it or we need to take our time. And \nhere again we need to ask questions--that is what I have been doing--on \nhomeland security. But where are we? Here we are with three Senators on \nthe floor. Now, Senators are busy. There are committee meetings going \non, I know, right now. However, I urge Senators to come to the floor \nand get this bill going and try to pass it.\n  Tomorrow, a good many Senators are going to New York City. I am not, \nbut a good many Senators are going to New York City. I don't believe I \nneed to go to show my concern for what has happened. I have reacted as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I and Senator Stevens, \nRepublicans and Democrats on that committee have reacted, have \nresponded to the needs of New York City. We have done the best we \ncould. We have appropriated $20 billion. So we have responded. I feel \nsorrow and the need for comfort as much as anyone, but I make the point \nhere that I am not going. I think we ought to be right here doing our \nwork. We have plenty of it to do and not much time.\n  Look at the calendar, and you will see how squeezed we are to get our \nremaining work done. We have homeland security. We have nine more \nappropriations bills to pass in this body after this bill that is \nbefore the Senate is acted on. Then we have to go to conference. And \nhere we are, the calendar is running.\n  I have taken a good bit of time on this point to say this. I don't \nwant anyone to misunderstand my remarks. I have my own viewpoint. As \nPopeye used to say: I am what I am, and that's all I am. So I have my \nviewpoint. But it is not my will that should be done. We have work to \ndo, and we ought to be here doing it. We ought to be here right now \nmoving on with it.\n  The distinguished ranking member is here at his post. He and I have \noffered amendments on behalf of the Members on both sides. Where are \nthe other Members who have amendments? Where are they? The first \nquestion that was ever asked in the history of mankind was the \nquestion: Where art thou? And God, walking through the Garden of Eden, \nin the cool of the day, said: Adam, Adam, where art thou? That was the \nfirst question that was ever asked in the history of mankind: Where art \nthou?\n\n  If I might just pick up on those words--that is all that I, this \nhumble piece of mortal clay can do, is ask: Where art thou? Where are \nthe Senators? Where are we?\n  Let me say again with apologies to Senators, I know they are very \nbusy. But those who have amendments ought to come. This floor is open \nand will be. I will take my chair at any time somebody comes in the \ndoor.\n  So: Where art thou? Senators, hear me, come to the floor, offer your \namendments; let's have votes and move on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia makes a good \npoint. We always hear about those who want to come and make their \nstatement regarding any piece of legislation. Then we go at breakneck \nspeed and grind to a halt. That seems to be what we have done.\n  Let me just say a few words on behalf of the drought amendment that \nis before the Senate. We are concerned about the drought as it happened \nin this area that has been expanded. We have been in a drought \nsituation in Montana for about 5 years. We have been, not only in a \nsituation of summer drought and no summer moisture, but also in the \narea of low snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, in the areas that feed the \nirrigation water and stock water and many other amenities that have \nbeen provided by that wonderful element. But this year, that drought \nexpanded. It expanded to our neighbors to the south, Colorado and \nWyoming, the western Dakotas, and Kansas. Some would say that is almost \nthe breadbasket of this country.\n  I had an opportunity to drive through those drought areas in western \nKansas and Colorado and western Nebraska, and I would say the stories I \nheard and the history we have studied of the great drought of the dirty \nthirties--if we were using the same farm way of doing business that we \ndid then, we would probably be back in a dust bowl situation in the \nMidwest. That is how dry it has been--just no rain at all.\n  So this is needed legislation. It is not just legislation that has \ncome as a whim to anybody who lives in the heart of this country.\n  Was all of Montana affected by drought? No. We are a large State. We \nare 148,000 square miles--not quite as big as Texas, not quite as big \nas California or Alaska. Nonetheless, if you measure in air miles from \nthe northwest corner to the southeast corner of my State, it is further \nthan from here to Chicago--from Washington, DC, to Chicago.\n\n  In the northeastern part of the State, we fared pretty well with \ncrops, grass. But as the rangeland has droughted out in the last 5 \nyears, we have seen a decline, also, in the numbers of livestock. That \nnot only affects our farm income but also our tax base. It affects us \nin many more ways than just the loss of the numbers of cattle or the \nloss of a crop.\n  So this is needed legislation.\n  We have tried, now, for better than a year and a half to provide \nrelief for those who have been affected by that weather pattern. We \nhave an opportunity here to pass this legislation. The chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the chairman of the full committee is right on when he \nsays we should be moving on this piece of legislation. In fact, it \nshould be off from the Senate tonight, to be honest, probably, if we \nhad the full days to work on it. But everyone knows we move to homeland \ndefense, homeland security, later and we are paralleling these two \npieces of legislation.\n  This particular appropriations bill always draws a little bit of \nattention because it deals with sensitive areas: Our national public \nlands and our parks. As many people as there are in the world, there \nare that many opinions as to how we should manage those public lands \nand those parks. So it brings diverse ideas, different ideas, and many \nof them come to this floor. However, we have been lacking that debate \nin the last 2 days, and that causes some concern, I suppose. \nNonetheless, we should be moving along.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those on this side of the aisle, \nthat if they have amendments to offer or want to speak on the issue \nthat is before us now, to do it now. It will not be long before we will \nbe to noon, and at that time we go into morning business and then, \nafter that, homeland security.\n  I stand in support of the chairman of the committee in asking our \ncolleagues to please do that. I know we are working feverishly to clear \nmore amendments. We have already done some of those, and the staff has \njust done wonderful work in narrowing down our work on the amendments \nthat were offered by Members of the Senate.\n  Seeing no other Senator standing with a request to speak, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we now have a number of issues pending on \nthis important piece of legislation. But the one issue that is pending \nthat we need to dispose of today is drought assistance. People on both \nsides of the aisle need to move this issue for their constituents. It \nis an important piece\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nof legislation. We have been waiting--yesterday and today--for people \nto come to speak against it. We have had no one come to speak against \nthis piece of legislation.\n  That being the case, I am going to move to waive all points of order \ndealing with this amendment. I think that should be done. I intend to \ndo it very shortly.\n  Some people may not like it, but the fact of legislative life in the \nSenate is that we are going to have to vote on this legislation. We \nshould move forward on it. Once we get it out of the way, we can move \nfurther down the road.\n  The two managers of the bill have acted on a number of amendments \ntoday. We could complete this bill very quickly. We only have an hour \nleft today.\n  The amendment now pending before the Senate is the drought assistance \namendment offered by Senator Daschle.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at this time, I move to waive all points of \norder relating to this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield before he makes that \nmotion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator has the floor and certainly has \nthe right to make that motion. Would he mind, now that he has announced \nhis intention, to go through a quorum call and get consent that once \nthe quorum call is completed he retain his right to the floor? \nCertainly before he makes the motion other Senators may come; they will \nknow. They will know from having heard this that business is moving and \nthat we can't continue with the luxury of waiting until next week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the experience and wisdom of my friend from \nWest Virginia has prevailed in the past and will this time. I think his \nsuggestion is a wiser choice. I withdraw my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I indicate to all assembled here that we \nneed to move this amendment along. I have had a number of people \nindicate to me that they do not like this amendment, but they can come \nand talk about it. This isn't just going to go away. I hope we can do \nthat very shortly.\n  I would also indicate that Senator Harkin is here wishing to offer a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I retain the floor when the quorum is \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are in a Senate kind of situation here. \nWe have both managers of the bill who support the amendment offered by \nthe majority leader. I believe we have a significant majority of \nSenators who support the Daschle amendment. But we are in a posture \nwhere we have people--unknown, unnamed--who do not like this amendment.\n  As I indicated earlier, we are going to move to waive points of order \non this amendment. We are not going to do it now, as Senator Byrd \nsuggested; we will do it at a later time. To get people to come over \nwho oppose this amendment would be the most appropriate thing to do.\n  In the meantime, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes to speak on the underlying legislation and that the Senator \nfrom Montana be recognized for up to 10 minutes to speak on the \nlegislation. Following that, I ask unanimous consent that, after \ncalling off the quorum call, Senator Byrd be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would therefore ask we go forward with \nthe 10 minutes, and the 10 minutes, and then, if there is a quorum \ncall, the Senator gets the floor. I think it might be better if he just \ngot the floor after this. Let's do it that way. After they finish their \nspeeches, Senator Byrd gets the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the amendment before us is critically \nimportant to many parts of the country. It is certainly critically \nimportant to my State.\n  This has been a year of extremes. In southwestern North Dakota, it \nhas been the worst drought since the 1930s. If you went to southwestern \nNorth Dakota, what you would find is it looks like a moonscape. We have \nhad wildfires, the most extensive in my lifetime.\n  We had, in one part of south central North Dakota, a wildfire that \nburned 35,000 acres. That burned an entire town, the little town of \nShields, ND. Hundreds of buildings burned up. The only two buildings \nthat survived were the bar and the church. It is amazing what happens \nin these circumstances.\n  I was there the morning after that dreadful night, and I met with the \nranchers. One rancher had been up fighting fires for 72 hours.\n  As he slumped in a chair, he told me: Senator, if there isn't \nassistance coming, I have to liquidate my herd and I am out of \nbusiness.\n  Of course, he would have to liquidate his herd at the time prices are \nplunging; ranchers all over the region are liquidating their herds \nbecause there is not feed for their cattle. It is happening in Montana, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, right down the \nheartland of the country.\n  At the same time the whole southwestern quarter of my State is hit by \nthe worst drought since the 1930s, in the northeastern quadrant of the \nState, we have had hundreds of thousands of acres that couldn't be \nplanted because it was too wet. What a remarkable set of circumstances.\n  In northeastern North Dakota, in a 24-hour period, we got 12 inches \nof rain--12 inches of rain in a State where we average 18 inches of \nrain in a year.\n  Hundreds of thousands of acres were destroyed, much of it never \nplanted. Some 3 million acres in my State were never planted. This is a \ndisaster by any description.\n  What we do here determines whether or not people go under or survive. \nSome have said: Look to the farm bill for your assistance. There are no \ndisaster provisions in the farm bill. I was one of the conferees on the \nfarm bill, along with the distinguished chairman of our committee, the \nSenator from Iowa. We had disaster provisions in the farm bill that \npassed the Senate, but when we went to conference, those who \nrepresented the House told us there were two issues they could not \ndiscuss in the conference. Those two issues: Opening up Cuba for trade \nand disaster assistance.\n  They said those had to go to the Speaker of the House. And when the \nmajority leader called the Speaker of the House, he said unequivocally: \nNo disaster assistance, period, in the farm bill.\n  The conferees from the House side said that later on in the session \nit would be possible to consider disaster assistance, but it was not \npossible in the farm bill.\n  So when the White House says to farmers in this country, look to the \nfarm bill for disaster assistance, there is no help there for \ndisasters. It was specifically precluded by the speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, supported by the President of the United States. There \nis no disaster assistance in that farm bill.\n  I just held a hearing in my State on this issue. The Governor of the \nState, a Republican Governor, the commissioner of agriculture, a \nDemocrat, the leaders of the farm organizations--some Democrats, some \nRepublicans--were present. What unified them was the dire emergency \nthat exists, the urgent need for aid. Every single witness at the \nhearing, and everyone in the crowd who spoke, delivered the same \nmessage: Unless there is help coming, thousands of farm families are \ngoing to be forced off the land.\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\n  They made it very clear. The commissioner of agriculture said the \nlosses in North Dakota so far are over $800 million. In Washington, \n$800 million is not a lot of money. In North Dakota, $800 million is a \nhuge amount of money. It will condemn to failure thousands of farm \nfamilies if there is not assistance coming from here.\n  Every time there has been a natural disaster in any part of the \ncountry for as long as I have been in the Senate, this Nation has \nresponded. We have declared an emergency. We have provided the money. \nWe should do no less here.\n  It is not just North Dakota. It is the flooding in Minnesota, the \nworst floods in their history. It is disaster in our neighboring State \nof Montana, our neighboring State of South Dakota, and, as I indicated, \nright down the heartland of the country. We have seen the worst \nwildfires in history in Colorado and Arizona--all of this because of \noverly dry conditions. But there are parts of the country that have had \nflooding and, as a result, crop failure.\n  This bill costs over $5 billion. We know that. We acknowledge it. But \nwhat has not been discussed is the substantial savings in the farm bill \nbecause of these same conditions. There are billions of dollars of \nsavings in the farm bill because prices are higher than were \nanticipated at the time the farm bill was written. Why? Because of \nthese disasters, there is less production. Therefore, prices are higher \nthan were anticipated. As a result, there will be substantial savings \nin the farm bill.\n  I have asked the Congressional Budget Office to reestimate the farm \nbill based on these most recent prices. I can tell you, it will mean \nbillions of dollars of savings in the farm program itself. But those \ndollars are not available for the disaster program unless we pass one.\n  This is an emergency. Always we have responded to natural disasters. \nWhether it was hurricanes in Florida, earthquakes in California, \nflooding in Missouri, or drought in other parts of the country, this \nNation has rallied as one to provide assistance.\n  I was very interested to see the President supporting disaster \nassistance for eastern Europe at the very time I was home in North \nDakota going community to community. We saw the President declare his \nsupport for U.S. assistance for disasters, flooding, occurring in \neastern Europe. Well, he has a plan for eastern Europe. He has no plan \nfor the heartland of America.\n  That cannot be the result. That is not fair. It should not be what we \ndo. We ought to declare an emergency just like we always do. We ought \nto understand there are substantial savings under the farm bill because \nprices are higher than were anticipated because of these very \ndisasters. And we ought to reach out a hand of help and hope to the \nhundreds of thousands of families across this country hit by the \nvarious natural disasters. That is the American way. It is what we have \ndone consistently for others. We ought to do no less now.\n  I urge my colleagues to join to pass this urgently needed \nlegislation. We have helped you when you needed assistance. We are \nasking now for the same consideration. At a time of devastating natural \ndisasters, our region of the country needs help. We are not alone.\n  Even with higher prices than were anticipated, it is very important \nto understand that because production is dramatically reduced, USDA, \njust 2 weeks ago, indicated that net farm income would decline by a \nstunning 23 percent. That is what is going to happen because of this \nseries of natural disasters.\n  That is a hit no part of our economy can afford to take. It is time \nto act. It is time to vote. We ought to have that opportunity. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from North \nDakota. He made a very good point that I don't think has been \nemphasized enough; namely, the farm bill that this body passed and \nenacted into law because of the recent disastrous conditions occurring \nin America will result in fewer Federal payments, fewer dollars paid \nout than was anticipated under that bill. As my friend from North \nDakota pointed out, it is billions of dollars in savings which largely \nwill offset the cost of this bill.\n  My good friend further pointed out that farmers will receive payments \nunder this legislation, disaster assistance, but will not receive it \nuntil this legislation is enacted into law. I thank my good friend from \nNorth Dakota for making that valid point. Some think that, gee, if we \npassed a farm bill, why do we have to pass agricultural disaster \nassistance which, for the 2 years--2001 and 2002--crop disaster program \nand the livestock assistance program scores at $5 billion. Crop \nInsurance is an important risk management tool but provides declining \ncoverage in years of successive disasters. Emergency haying and grazing \non CRP acreage is important. These are all pieces to the puzzle. The \npiece that is still missing--that producers are counting on the most--\nis emergency natural disaster assistance. I thank my friend from North \nDakota for pointing that out.\n  Madam President, this is really pretty basic. Without our help, \nwithout passing agricultural disaster assistance for farmers and \nranchers, this body will accomplish change in the future of rural \nAmerica forever. We are at that point. After successive years of \ndisaster, drought in Montana, we are at the breaking point.\n  If agricultural assistance does not pass, I can tell you that my \nState of Montana, and probably other States in the Nation--particularly \nthe high plains States, and perhaps even the State represented by the \noccupant of the Chair--the rural American landscape is going to change \nforever. Small towns are going to die. People are going to leave. There \nis not going to be much left. We are going to be destroying a way of \nlife.\n  It is that basic, that simple. It has been said this is a real \nemergency, a real disaster. That is an understatement. It will be \nchanging the landscape of rural America if this legislation does not \npass.\n  I want to read from a letter from Wells Fargo Bank, a national \nlending institution which has banks in Montana. This is from Alan \nPearson, district manager:\n\n       Wells Fargo has always had a number of tools at its \n     disposal, recognizing that farmers and ranchers have cyclical \n     years. As lenders, we have made all efforts to ensure that \n     credit needs are met by providing operating lines of credit \n     and equipment and real estate financing. In addition, where \n     applicable, Wells Fargo is the principal provider and \n     underwriter of Federal Crop Insurance.\n       However, it is our sense that, without significant Federal \n     assistance for our region, many farmers and ranchers will not \n     make it. Private insurance and easing of credit requirements \n     only go so far.\n       A principal reason why the situation warrants Federal \n     assistance is that surface and groundwater resources \n     have depleted to a level that requires successive above-\n     average periods of precipitation to bring water reserves \n     back to normal levels.\n\n  I will repeat that. The situation has deteriorated so much that only \nwith ``successive above-average periods of precipitation to bring water \nreserves back to normal levels'' will farmers begin to recover.\n  Continuing:\n\n       These conditions have worsened over the last 3 years, and \n     our analysis shows that farm income will suffer unless \n     Government assistance is available.\n       As you are aware, without specific and timely Federal \n     emergency disaster assistance, many producers will face \n     daunting challenges in their operations.\n\n  Unfortunately, a natural disaster is not only a condition in just a \nfew States, as of July 22, 49 States are impacted by drought, and 36 \npercent of our country is currently classified at some level of \ndrought. More than 40 percent of our Nation's rangeland is currently \nrated as poor or very poor. This is an issue that cannot be ignored.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned the problems in conference, \ntrying to get the other body to agree, and the Speaker has basically \nsaid no. I hope very much the Speaker reconsiders, that the White House \nreconsiders and realizes that there is such an emergency that we must \npass this legislation.\n  I am pleased more than a fifth of the Senate has cosponsored this \namendment. I will read some of the organizations that proposed this and \nendorse it: National Farmers Union, American Farm Bureau Federation, \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, American Corn Growers, American \nSheep Industry, American Soybean Association,\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\nNational Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers, and a \nnumber of others.\n  I want to make another point that has not been made enough. There \nhave been many references to the Dust Bowl years in the thirties. Some \nfarmers tell me--very respected farmers whose operations have been in \nfamilies for years--that this is even worse than the thirties for two \nreasons: Basically, in the thirties, there was 1 year with a little \nprecipitation that broke the drought a little bit. But, more important, \nin the thirties, we did not have something called CRP. We did not have \nthe Conservation Reserve Program. Many producers in my State have put \ntheir land in the CRP. What is CRP, for those who don't know? The CRP \nis the program the United States provides for farmers so they can take \ntheir land out of production and put it into grassland, in reserve. \nThat is the Conservation Reserve Program. It helps the environment and \nhelps game and birds and so forth. It is also a way for farmers to cash \nflow during years of drought.\n  Because of better farming practices today, we do not have the Dust \nBowl situation. If we continued to use the same farming practices \ntoday, we would be back to the situation of the thirties. You would see \nwind blowing dust across the Nation. It is because of our better \nfarming practices that we don't have quite the Dust Bowl situation that \nall Americans at that time knew about.\n  That leads me to another point. If a major U.S. company loses 20 \npercent of its income, which is in the quarterly reports, the stock \ngoes down, it is in the newspapers, and everybody knows about it. Or if \nan industry loses a huge percentage of its income, or people go \nbankrupt, such as Enron and WorldCom and others, everybody knows about \nthose bankruptcies because they are in the newspapers. People do not \nknow about the individual farmers and ranchers who have to sell out \nbecause they, in effect, go bankrupt because of Dust Bowl situations, \nbecause of lack of income, and because of successive years of drought. \nProducers in my State have lost more than 20 per cent of their income \nfor 4 consecutive years. There isn't another industry in America that \ncould do that and still be standing. We should all be grateful that \nthey are still in business because they are the ones who ensure that we \nhave food on our plates.\n\n  So it is our responsibility, as representatives of our States, to \nmake this known to the world--particularly to the country and the \nSenate--so that our colleagues have an appreciation of what we are \nexperiencing in Montana and in other Northwestern States. It is that \nserious.\n  As has been pointed out, this body has responded to other \nemergencies--floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, the Trade Towers, and it \nwas more than appropriate; everybody rushed to help. But we have the \nsame emergency, the same disaster conditions today, but it is not as \nwell known because it is a slow disaster. Mother Nature sometimes rains \nin parts of our State and not in others. Drought disaster is not as \nvisible as, say, a WorldCom bankruptcy or an Enron bankruptcy; but it \nis just as important--in fact, even more important to those people who \nhave to leave those communities and to those communities and towns.\n  I plead that Members of this body vote overwhelmingly to help people \nwho are facing disaster. I ask the body to also recognize the disaster \nwe are facing. I ask the President of the United States to reconsider \nand agree and recognize that we have a disaster in the heartland of \nAmerica, and we have a responsibility collectively, as the people's \nrepresentatives, to help the people we represent and support disaster \nassistance. It is the only thing we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be glad to yield to my good friend from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I say to my colleague, we deeply \nappreciate the information he has provided on this issue. It was the \nSenator's amendment that prevailed in the Senate farm bill to provide \ndisaster assistance in the first place. Nobody has understood better \nthan he the consequences and the magnitude of this disaster. Perhaps no \nState has been harder hit than his own.\n  I want to stand and acknowledge the leadership of the Senator from \nMontana on this issue and thank him publicly on behalf of the people I \nrepresent and the other people affected in other States for the \ndiligence of the Senator from Montana. He has been relentless in \ngetting disaster assistance for our people, and I want to thank him for \nit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from North \nDakota. We are all in this together. This is teamwork. By working \ntogether--both sides of the aisle--representatives and the people, we \nare going to get this passed because it is so necessary and so \nimportant. I thank my good friend, as part of the larger team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is to be recognized at this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I do not wish to have the floor at this \nmoment. It may be the distinguished Democratic whip will have need for \nthe floor, or any other Senator for that matter. I yield my time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a number of people who wish to \nspeak this morning. We have some who I understand want to speak against \nthe amendment. They have not shown up yet in 2 days, but I assume they \nwant to speak.\n  I indicated to the staff of the minority that we would like to extend \ntime on this bill until 12:30 p.m. today. I will not put that in the \nform of a unanimous consent request until I hear from the minority. \nThat is what I would like to do.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from North Dakota wishes to speak \non this legislation for up 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from North Dakota be recognized to speak, and that following \nhis statement, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened attentively to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota and my colleague from Montana. Their remarks about \nthis issue describe how important it is for us to enact legislation \ndealing with this disaster.\n  I thought I would bring a poster that shows a picture of two parts of \nNorth Dakota: One State, two extremes. This top picture shows a farmer/\nrancher down in the southern part of our State standing in an area that \nlooks very much like a moonscape. There is no vegetation left. This is \ncompletely dry and pretty well dead. This is a drought area that has \nconsumed a significant portion of the southern part of our State, and \nit has been devastating to those farmers and ranchers trying to make a \nliving down there.\n  This bottom picture was actually taken on the same day in the same \nState, but this is a different part of the State. This is an area that \nreceived 12 inches of rain in 1 day. This is a farmer who lost \neverything.\n  These pictures are representative of a wide group of producers in our \nStates. We call them producers, but they are family farmers. They risk \nall they have to try to raise a crop and have a livestock herd that can \nmake it through good and bad times, and then try to take the crop or \nthe livestock to market and make some money.\n  They are discovering this year, as is much of the country, that \ntrying to tend a herd of livestock or raise a crop is very difficult in \nthe circumstances that exist. We have a disaster that has occurred over \na substantial portion of this country. This is the Palmer Drought \nIndex. One can see over a substantial portion of the country where \nthere is massive drought.\n  Some people say: So what? So what about family farming? Will Rogers \nmany years ago said: If one day in this country all the lawyers and the \naccountants failed to show up for work, it would not be a very big \ndeal. But if on that same day all the cows in America failed to show up \nto be milked, now that would be a problem.\n  He was, in his own way, trying to describe the importance of family \nfarmers, the importance of production agriculture. Production \nagriculture, from our standpoint in North Dakota, is families out there \nliving under a yard light trying to make a go of it by\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\nplanting seed in the spring and having every hope perhaps that seed \nwill grow into something they can harvest and take to the market and be \nable to recapture their living expenses. They live on hope.\n  We have seen now over recent years weather patterns that have \ndevastated large groups of family farmers. These clearly are disasters. \nWhen you have a drought of the type we have had, it is truly a \ndisaster.\n  If tonight 1,000 tornadoes spring up and move relentlessly across the \nprairies or the western part of the United States and destroy all the \nstructures and the vegetation, that is a disaster. Tomorrow we would \nhave FEMA, we would have trucks, we would have armies of people moving \nbecause the headlines would be: This is a disaster, and we have to move \nand deal with it.\n  It does not matter whether it is drought, flood, earthquake, fire, or \ntornado. The devastation and destruction that occurs to the crops of \ntens of thousands of family farmers is a disaster, and we need to \nrespond to it.\n  I am proud to say that in every set of circumstances in my service \nboth in the Senate and the House of Representatives, when there has \nbeen a disaster and a proposal on the floor of the Senate to respond to \nthat disaster, I have said yes. It does not matter to me where it is in \nthis country. If there are cities, counties, States, groups of people \nin this country who have suffered a disaster, then I want to be a part \nof the voice of this Congress that says to them: You are not alone. \nThis country wants to help.\n\n  I want to be, and have always been, a part of a group in this \nCongress who says we want to extend the helping hand of America during \na time of disaster.\n  That needs to be the case now with respect to the disaster that \noccurs on family farms in this country because of this relentless, \ngripping, devastating drought in some parts of the country and, in \nother parts of the country, flooded lands.\n  There are a good many ways to deal with disasters. Some disasters \nmight be just a single farm disaster. When I was a young boy, a good \nfriend of ours named Ernest died. His crop was still in the field. He \ndied of a heart attack one evening. The neighbors gassed up the \ncombines and the trucks and went over and harvested the crop and took \nit to the market for Ernest's widow. That is just the way it works. \nThat is what neighbors are about. That is what communities are for. But \nthat is a disaster of one farm where neighbors can solve the problem.\n  In a disaster of this type where you have this relentless drought \nthat has destroyed so many acres, so many crops, so much pastureland, \nneighbors are in the same shape. They are all devastated by this \ndrought and all losing the opportunity to make a living.\n  Some say: All you do is talk about farmers. This is not just about \nfarmers. It is about those communities and small towns, medium-size \ntowns across the heartland of our country. It is about rural \nbusinesses. It is about the local grain elevator that does not have any \ngrain to handle. The local feedstore that is not going to sell any \nfeed. It is about the machinery dealer who is not going to sell \nmachinery. It is about jobs in the manufacturing plants that produce \nthat machinery to process that feed. So it is much more than just \nfamily farms.\n  This is a circumstance where we need to take action now. I happen to \nthink family farmers are America's economic all-stars. They produce, \nproduce, produce in a prodigious way. It has always baffled me that \nfarmers are accused of being guilty of overproducing. We have a world \nin which a half a billion people go to bed every night with an ache in \ntheir belly because they are hungry, and our farmers produce food and \nare told the food they produce has no value.\n  Are they nuts? Of course, it has value. This is a hungry world. We \nneed to be smart enough to connect it all. Our family farmers are \nenormous producers and have done very well, but they suffer disaster. \nThey are individual, small economic units. They are up against the \nweather. They are up against insects. Once they plant that seed, they \nmight lose their crop to a drought. They might lose it to a flood. They \nmight lose it to insects. They might lose it to disease. They might \nlose it to hail. They might lose it to wind. And if they manage to not \nlose it to any of those things and they get a crop off by harvesting it \nin the fall, they might find out they lose their value by going to a \ncountry elevator and discovering the grain trade has told them their \nfood in a hungry world has no value.\n  So these farmers suffer all of those risks and more, but they cannot \ncope with the kind of relentless drought that exists in this country in \na way that devastates individual producers in State after State.\n  This is an important issue. It is not parochial. It does not deal \nwith just a few problems in a few areas. What has happened in this \ncountry is we have passed a farm bill that tries to help farmers during \ncollapsing prices. That is a significant problem and a significant \nachievement, to pass a farm bill that does that. But if one does not \nraise a crop because of a disaster price protection, it does not help; \nthere is no protection at all. That is why a disaster declaration and a \ndisaster bill dealing with these issues of drought and floods for \npreventive planting and destroyed crops is so very important.\n  We need to do this, not tomorrow, not next month, not next year; we \nneed to do it now. If we fail to do this now, there are a good many \nfamilies who will lose their hopes and dreams for the future. They will \nnot be around next spring. They will not be there because they will not \nbe able to continue farming. This is an important and good investment \nfor this country to make. It invests in the American dream for family \nfarmers, for family entrepreneurs, and I am pleased to be a part of a \ngroup that has brought it to the floor of the Senate, and I am pleased \ntoday to support it.\n  This is an urgent need. Congress needs to pass this, and we need to \npass it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a number of people wishing to \nspeak on this amendment, all of whom are in favor of it. After 2 days, \nwe have not had anybody speak against it, but they will not let us vote \non it.\n  I have a unanimous consent request I will make, but I have to wait \nuntil we get approval from the other side. It is my understanding the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, wishes to speak for 3 minutes. \nFollowing the statement of Senator Breaux, I ask unanimous consent that \nI again have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I say to my colleagues who have spoken \npreviously on this amendment, I join with them as a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. The previous speaker from North Dakota was absolutely \ncorrect when he pointed out this is not a parochial issue.\n  I am not from Montana. I am not from North Dakota. I am not from the \nGreat Plains. In fact, I am as far away from these States as one could \nprobably be and probably still be in the continental United States.\n  Being from Louisiana, we traditionally do not have a lot of problems \nwith drought. As a matter of fact, it is very common for Louisiana to \nhave 8, 9, even 10 inches of rain during the summer months in one \nafternoon. Our problem in many cases is not drought but too much water. \nWe were jokingly talking about how we could be of help by somehow \nreversing the flow of the Mississippi River from north to south and \nchanging it from south to north and sending the excess water we \nfrequently have in Louisiana to our friends and neighbors in farms in \nthe Great Plains, the Midwest. That is a novel idea, but it is not \ngoing to happen.\n  Until something like that happens, it is very important to be able to \ntry to recognize this is a national issue. Whether one is from South \nDakota or from Louisiana, it is very important when farm organizations \nand groups in one part of the country have a problem that is not \nthrough their own making, we in other parts of the country recognize it \nand help to contribute.\n  One of the provisions that is a defect in the farm bill is that when \nsomeone has a disaster, they can receive disaster loans. The last thing \na person\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\nwho has no crop needs is more debt which they would incur by having an \nadditional loan.\n  The program we talked about in the past really does not particularly \naddress the situation where farms are literally wiped out of any \nproduction because of a flood or because of a drought, thus preventing \nthem from harvesting a crop. Having a loan in that circumstance does \nnot help the farmer. They cannot pay back the loan if they do not have \na crop. It is just that simple.\n  Therefore, in the interest of trying to be of help from a national \nperspective, this legislation has been brought to the floor. It is \nabsolutely essential. Because of the way the system works, it will \nultimately save the Government money. By helping now, we avoid greater \ndebt and greater losses in the future. So I strongly support this \neffort.\n  We have our own unique problems right now. In my State of Louisiana, \nparticularly in the rice industry, we are looking for ways to help \nsolve some of the problems our farmers are experiencing because of some \nof the lowest prices in decades.\n  Our farmers are not going to be able to make it, not because of a \ndrought or because of a flood but because of the potential of an \neconomic disaster which Congress should be addressing as well.\n  In the meantime, this is the right thing to do for a disaster that is \nbeing caused by a drought. I strongly support it, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan be \nrecognized to speak for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I retain the floor following \nher statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I urge in the strongest possible terms \nthat we pass this disaster relief package. The years 2001 and 2002 have \nbeen absolutely devastating years for Michigan agriculture. When I was \nhome in August, I had an opportunity to visit from northern Michigan \ndown to southern Michigan. To show the sense of urgency felt, there was \nan ad hoc group that put together petitions and cards. The Michigan \nAgricultural Industry Alliance and others, Lee Lavanway from Eau \nClaire, MI, in the southwestern part of Michigan, put together over a \nthousand petitions and cards desperately calling on us to act on behalf \nof American agriculture. I urge that we do so.\n  In the year 2001, 82 of Michigan's 83 counties were declared a \ndisaster because of drought. Early frosts and then flooding later in \nthe year also contributed to considerable crop damage. Secretary \nVeneman issued another disaster declaration for 2002 covering 50 \ncounties.\n  In 2001, yields for program crops, such as corn and soybeans, \nplummeted. Other crops, such as grapes and beans, had monumental \nlosses. 2001 was the worst year in recorded history for dry beans in \nMichigan. In fact, earlier this year Bob Green of the Michigan Bean \nCommission testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee about this \nissue.\n  The 2001 year drought also devastated sugar beet crops. The grape \ngrowers in Michigan have struggled with not 1 but 2 devastating crop \nyears. The extreme, record-high temperatures during the week of April \n14, followed by freezing temperatures shortly after that, have caused \ngreat damage in our fruit and vegetable crops. I have heard from apple, \ngrape, peach, asparagus, raspberry, and other growers who have had very \nbad results--in fact, devastating results--as a result of the bad \nweather.\n  In July, I visited tart cherry orchards and witnessed with my own \neyes the devastation that followed that bad weather. There is not a \nsingle cherry on any of these trees. We are not talking about less of a \ncrop, we are talking about no crop. One of the farmers told me he did \nnot have enough in his entire orchard to make one cherry pie.\n  When we look at this, it is astounding what has happened to Michigan \nagriculture and to our farmers. The lack of crop in Michigan has a \nripple effect on our entire economy. Processing facilities are laying \noff workers. There is a lower demand for agricultural machinery and \nsupplies.\n  To give an idea of the importance of these lost crops, fruit \nproduction contributes $235 million to the economy of the State of \nMichigan.\n  I call on my colleagues, in the strongest possible words, to join \ntogether to pass, by a strong bipartisan voice, this disaster relief \nmeasure. I ask the President of the United States to join, to stand \nwith us on behalf of our American farmers.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are very close to working out a \nunanimous consent agreement on the Harkin-Craig amendment which deals \nwith Medicare and reimbursement of States. Senator Harkin has been here \nliterally all day trying to get a time agreement. We hope we will have \nthe approval from the minority. They have agreed on the fact we should \ndo this amendment. The only question now is the time that will occur.\n  In the meantime, we have had bipartisan support on the underlying \nDaschle amendment. We have had the manager of the bill, Senator Byrd, \nsupport it; the Republican manager of the bill has supported it, \nSenator Burns. In fact, Senator Burns is a cosponsor of the amendment. \nAt last count, we had 18 or 20 cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The problem we have is under the Senate rules, there can be a couple \nof people who will not allow us to go forward on legislation. That is \nwhat we have here. It is too bad. We have tried everything we could to \nget a vote. It appears to me that probably what we will have to do is \ngo forward with a cloture motion on this amendment. That would be the \nbest thing to do. I hope that can be done. Under the constraints of \ntime we have we need to do that before the noon hour. I am confident we \nwill have the necessary signatures on the petition to do that.\n  As I indicated, there is overwhelming support for this amendment. \nThis is something that all farm State Senators believe is important. \nFor those not in the heavy agricultural areas, it is something we \nbelieve is fair and reasonable that should have, frankly, been done \nsome time ago. It is good that we are in a position to move forward on \nthis.\n  I, therefore, send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle \n     amendment No. 4481.\n         Harry Reid, Byron L. Dorgan, Kent Conrad, Tom Harkin, \n           Jean Carnahan, Max Baucus, John Breaux, Patrick Leahy, \n           Edward M. Kennedy, Herb Kohl, Dianne Feinstein, Richard \n           J. Durbin, Charles Schumer, Maria Cantwell, Deborah \n           Stabenow, Tim Johnson, Arlen Specter, Tom Daschle.\n\n  Mr. REID. The staff is working to make sure we can clear the Harkin-\nCraig amendment. It is my understanding we are very close to that.\n  The unanimous consent agreement I will soon request at an appropriate \ntime--which I will not do now--will ask consent the pending amendments \nbe set aside and Senator Harkin be recognized on behalf of himself and \nSenator Craig to offer an amendment on the sense of the Senate \nregarding Medicare; that there be 10 minutes debate with respect to \nthat amendment, and the time be controlled between Senators Harkin and \nCraig; that upon the use of time, the time be yielded back and there be \na vote.\n  I hope we are in a position to offer that in the Senate at the \nappropriate time.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to speak. We \nhave had a series of Democrats who have spoken. It is certainly fair he \nbe allowed to speak. I ask unanimous consent Senator Specter be \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes and also that the time pending \nfor the bill be extended until the hour of 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8246-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nthe present grave concern in the United States, and for that matter, \naround the world, about the menace posed by Saddam Hussein and Iraq.\n  I am pleased to note that the President has announced his intention \nto come to Congress to seek authorization before there is any military \naction taken by the United States as to Iraq. Senator Harkin and I had \nintroduced a resolution back in July asking that congressional \nauthority be obtained before any military action. The President, as \nCommander in Chief, under the Constitution certainly has the authority \nto act in times of emergency. When there is time for discussion, \ndeliberation, debate, and decision, then under the Constitution, it is \nthe authority of the Congress to act.\n  The events are moving very fast. There have been briefings of Members \nof the Congress by the Administration and there is a great concern, \nwhich I have personally noted in my State, Pennsylvania, on a series of \ntown meetings across the State. Everywhere I traveled there was concern \nas to what action would be taken as to Iraq.\n  There was no doubt that the United States has learned a very bitter \nlesson from 9/11; we should have taken preemptive action against Osama \nbin Laden and al-Qaida. We had evidence against civilians in Mogadishu \nin 1993, and embassy bombings in 1993. In all of those events, bin \nLaden was under indictment. We knew about his involvement in the USS \nCole and his proclamation for a worldwide jihad; preemptive action \nshould have been taken.\n  Taking preemptive action against a nation-state would be a change in \npolicy for the United States. It is my view that we ought to exhaust \nevery alternative before turning to that alternative--economic \nsanctions, inspections, diplomacy.\n  We have seen a number of people very close to President Bush and to \nthe first President Bush, come out and caution against action. We have \nseen General Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, come out and raise a great many \nconcerns about taking action without support from our allies. We have \nseen former Secretary of State James Baker raise an issue about going \nto the United Nations for inspections, which I think is a very sound \npoint.\n  It is my hope that President Bush will go to the United Nations and \nwill press to have inspections of Iraq proceed. The obligation for Iraq \nto submit to those inspections is an obligation which runs to the \nUnited Nations. Iraq's commitments to the UN have been flouted.\n  Former Secretary of State Baker makes the cogent suggestion that the \nUnited Nations ought to be called upon to take military action to \nenforce those inspection rights, if Saddam Hussein does not \nacquiesce. Certainly, if Saddam Hussein continues to stiff the UN, to \nthumb his nose at the UN, and thumb his nose at the international \ncommunity, then there will be a stronger basis for the United States to \nact, if we decide that our national interests compel us to do so.\n\n  There is an obvious difficulty in communicating to the American \npeople all that President Bush and the intelligence agencies know about \nthe threat posed by Iraq and posed by Saddam Hussein. There is a \nproblem, as we have seen from our experience, in telling the Congress, \neven in closed session, even in top secret briefings, where that \ninformation, regrettably, is disclosed to the press. Leaks in \nWashington are epidemic. However, if the Congress is to discharge its \nduty to pass on the question of what is tantamount to a declaration of \nwar, a resolution authorizing the use of force, we have to know the \nbasis on which we are acting.\n  There have been strong suggestions that there is very substantial \nevidence pointing to a clear and present danger now. We do know Saddam \nhas chemical weapons. We do know he has used them on his own people, \nthe Kurds. We do know he has used them in the Iran-Iraq war. There is \nsubstantial evidence about weapons of mass destruction and biological \nweapons. As best we know, Saddam Hussein does not yet have nuclear \nweapons, but how long it would take him to develop them is a question.\n  For the Congress to act, we really have to have this information, and \nthe President has intimated, really suggested, that more information \nwill be coming to the Congress. So far, I do not think we have seen the \nindicators of a clear and present danger, but that is something which \nwill have to be taken up.\n  This is an issue which is now, obviously, on the front burner. There \nare indications that the President will seek a vote by the Congress \nbefore we adjourn. So it is a matter which will require very intensive \nconsideration and analysis. However, it is my hope that when the \nPresident makes his speech at the United Nations next week, he will \ncall on the UN to enforce the UN's inspection rights.\n  Recently, Senator Shelby and I made a trip to Africa. Included in \nthat trip was a visit to the Sudan. I had attempted to go there in the \npast and was advised against it because of the civil war, which has \nbeen raging in that country. We talked to U.S. intelligence personnel \nin the Sudan and found that they have worked out an arrangement with \nthe Government of Sudan to make surprise inspections of weapons \nmanufacturing locations and also on laboratories--going in with no \nnotice, breaking locks, and taking photographs. They have concluded \nthat, as to the installations they had identified and inspected, they \nwere satisfied that there were no weapons of mass destruction being \npursued by the Government of Sudan.\n  That could be a model to go after as to inspections in Iraq. Of \ncourse, it still leaves open the possibility that there are some \nlocations about which we do not know. It leaves open the possibility \nthat some of the weapons of mass destruction could be transported, \ncould be moved around. However, I think it would be a very significant \nstep. Then, if Saddam and Iraq refused to honor their commitments, it \nwould put us on the high ground to take action in our own national \ninterest.\n  I yield the floor. In the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate on the Interior appropriations be extended for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are attempting to work out a time to \nvote on the Harkin amendment which he will shortly offer. We are very \nclose to having that done. I suggest that Senator Harkin go ahead and \ngive his speech. If we can work out a unanimous consent agreement, he \ncan offer the amendment, and then we can vote on it. He would give the \nspeech now, and we would move to the amendment, if we could get the \napproval of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be recognized for 5 minutes to speak on the amendment which \nhe will offer at a subsequent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, over 40 million Americans rely on \nMedicare for their health care security. For these Americans and their \nloved ones Medicare is a lifeline. And because of this Medicare must be \nprotected and secured for today and tomorrow.\n\n  Medicare, however, is not without its problems. Clearly, its benefits \npackage needs to be updated to include prescription drugs. Seniors \nshouldn't have to make the choice between the drugs they need to stay \nhealthy and food or heat. The Senate should once again try to craft a \nprescription drug plan to fill this great need.\n  But there is also another problem with Medicare. And that is the \nprincipal subject of my sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\n  Americans, no matter where they live, whether it is rural Iowa or \nurban Florida, are taxed at the same rate to help pay for Medicare--\n1.45 percent of payroll for both workers and their employers. And \nMedicare beneficiaries--whether in Brooklyn, IA or Brooklyn, NY--pay \nthe same monthly Medicare premium.\n  But while they pay the same taxes and premiums, the level of Medicare \npayments received by Americans often varies greatly from State to \nState.\n  For example, my home State of Iowa receives an average $3,053 per \nbeneficiary, which is 45 percent less than the national average. Some \nStates are much higher than that. But there is a disparity between, \nsay, $3,053 and the top State, which is over $7,000. It is quite \nsubstantial.\n  And while some of the variation may legitimately be due to cost \ndifferences, costs alone clearly do not explain the degree of \ndifferences among the states.\n  Much of this unfair variation is caused by outdated and nonsensical \nreimbursement policies that penalize efficiency and conservative \nmedical practices. Medicare assumes that it costs much less to provide \nhealth care in rural areas, and assumes that we still compete locally \nand regionally for health care professionals. Those of us in under-\nreimbursed states know that neither of these is true. Rural areas don't \nenjoy the economies of scale enjoyed by their urban counterparts, and \nwe are competing in a national and often global market for health care \nprofessionals.\n  The impact is real. For example, if the same hospital in Des Moines \nproviding the same services to the same seniors in Cincinnati, OH, it \nwould receive $5.3 million more per year. If we put it in Ann Arbor, \nMI, it would receive $14.6 million more per year.\n  What is the result of this unfair variation? Well, in Iowa, one \nsubstantial result is that we have a shortage of virtually all types of \nhealth care professionals.\n  Low reimbursement equals low wages, equals health professional \nshortages. Iowa ranks 50th in Medicare reimbursement and we rank 50th \nin nursing pay. So it is no surprise that we have 3,000 unfilled \nregistered nurse positions, another 728 vacancies for licensed \npractical nurses, and 2,700 openings for nonlicensed personnel. Add \nthis to the fact that our nurses are getting older, not enough new \nnurses are entering the field, and Iowa has the largest population of \nany State over age 85, and what you have is a real recipe for disaster.\n\n  It gets worse. Medicare payments influence Medicaid reimbursement and \nprivate payer reimbursement. Because of this, Iowa ranks 49th in the \nratio of general pediatricians per 100,000 children, and 50th in the \nratio of OB/GYNs to 1,000 live births.\n  So it is no wonder we can't recruit and keep health care \nprofessionals. A physician performing a hip replacement in New York \nreceives $1,807.25, while one in Iowa receives $1,304.09, and one in \nSouth Dakota only receives $1,286.46. The same amount of work, time, \nand skill goes into the same procedure. Yet there is a vast difference \nin the reimbursement to each provider.\n  It takes the same amount of education, skill, and time in Iowa as it \ndoes in other States, and these professionals should be reimbursed \naccordingly. So there are changes that must be made to bring greater \nfairness and improve the health care systems across the States.\n  There are many different proposals in the Senate that attempt to \ntackle this issue. I think people on both sides of the aisle can come \ntogether, as we have in the past, on this issue. I know we are very \nbusy with many important pieces of legislation, including the homeland \nsecurity bill and appropriations bills. But the resolution I am \noffering is very simple. Its resolve clause simply reads:\n\n       Congress (acting through the appropriate authorization \n     process) and the President should act promptly to address the \n     disparity among the States in the amount of payments made \n     under the Medicare program; and\n       Legislation should be passed [promptly] that reduces unfair \n     geographic disparity in Medicare payment rates and restores \n     scheduled inappropriate reductions in Medicare payment rates.\n\n  So, Madam President, it is a very simple, straightforward resolution. \nIt just says we in the Congress and the White House, the President, \nought to do something very promptly to address this huge disparity \namong the States.\n  As I said, maybe you can have some disparity based upon rental rates \nand things like that. I understand that. But to say one State would get \n$3,000 and another State $7,000, this is just nonsensical. So the \nStates that fall below the average are the ones that are getting hurt \nthe most.\n  All my resolution says is that we ought to act promptly, in a \nbipartisan fashion, to address this issue and to make Medicare more \neven, more fair across the States. So I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution.\n  I see my colleague in the Chamber. I did not see him on the floor. He \nis my colleague in this endeavor, Senator Craig from Idaho. He and I \nhave worked together on this for a long time. He knows exactly what I \nam talking about because of the great disparity in his State.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for working in a great bipartisan \nfashion to try to get something done to resolve this issue.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I will speak only briefly to the \nresolution. The Senator from Iowa and I share, as I think all Senators \nwho represent rural countrysides must share, a very real frustration in \nthe disparity between urban and rural Medicare payment schedules and \nthe reality that we are dealing with a 20- or 30-year-old concept that \ndoes not make sense anymore.\n  We have a phenomenal nursing shortage in our country today. So if a \nnurse lives on one side of a boundary line created by this law, she or \nhe can well commute to the other side and we cannot afford them.\n  The Presiding Officer represents a city not far from one of my major \ncities: Spokane, WA, versus Coeur d'Alene, ID. Spokane, WA, has a \ndifferent payment schedule than Coeur d'Alene, ID, and they are 20 \nmiles of interstate apart. Many people say that living in Coeur \nd'Alene, ID, because of its beauty, is more desirable than living in \nSpokane, but they work in Spokane because of the wage scale and/or this \nparticular problem.\n  As a result, the Kootenai Medical Center and, as a result, the rural \nmedical communities of northern Idaho cannot, in effect, compete.\n  It is time that we address this issue evenhandedly across all \njurisdictions so that Medicare payments are reflective of current \nhealth care needs; not a 30-year-old model that is just flat obsolete \nand does not make sense anymore, but because we build up these \npolitical barriers or frustrations we do not want to address them. I \nthink we must. I think we should.\n  The resolution speaks to trying to move the Senate, the President, \nand the Congress as a whole in that direction.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, time on this bill is about to expire. I am \ngoing to ask to extend the time for a few more minutes. Let me just say \nto everyone, the reason for this is, in good faith we thought this \nmatter had been cleared by everybody. The fact is, we had not received \na signoff from Senator Grassley and his staff. He is on his way over \nhere, or staff is on their way over. I am sure, when they look at it, \nthey will approve it, but it will take a few more minutes, so I ask \nunanimous consent that the time on the bill be extended until 25 \nminutes to the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas wishes to speak on \nthe underlying amendment. We have had a number of speeches today. \nCertainly we want him to do that. The problem is, within a minute or \ntwo we are off the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate on the Interior bill \nbe extended until the hour of 12:45, and that the Senator from Kansas \nbe recognized for 5 minutes to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I have no objection if by unanimous \nconsent the morning business session, which was to go from 12:30 to 1, \ncould be extended from 12:45 to 1:15 so that I might have an \nopportunity to deliver remarks for which I have been waiting.\n  Mr. REID. I think, in fairness, we should allot the Senators who want \nto speak in morning business the full hour. The Republicans are \nentitled to half an hour and the Democrats are entitled to a half an \nhour. As soon as we get this little dust-off taken care of, I will ask \nunanimous consent at that time that morning business be for 1 hour.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I come before the Senate today to \naddress the majority leader's amendment which is intended to direct \nimmediate financial assistance to farmers around the country who are \nfacing an historic drought. Our Kansas State motto is Ad Astra Per \nAspera--a beautiful saying that means ``To the Stars Through \nDifficulties.'' I have always thought that it captured beautifully the \nspirit of our State. It is part of our character to tackle calamity and \nto smile at threats that have consumed lesser men. During the August \nrecess I spent several weeks touring our State and meeting with farmers \nabout the drought. Its impact on our crops and our rural communities is \nstaggering.\n  The drought in Kansas is one of the worst in a century. It is \ncompared, by folks who know, to the dust bowl of the 1930's. Crops are \nwithering and dying in the fields right under the watchful and woeful \neyes of our farmers--farmers who are helpless to stop the conditions \nand helpless to prevent the circle of crisis from beginning. For what \nwe all must remember is that blackened crops across the States are not \njust ``their'' problem or ``someone else's'' problem--it is our \nproblem. The devastation brought on by persistent drought is in \nevidence all over Kansas. As I toured several affected counties, the \nwidening economic impacts of this drought on our state were mostly \noverwhelmed by the urgency of the emergency. But by the end of my tour, \nI was reminded again and again that the true impact of this drought is \nnot the plight of just farm families. The impact that many Kansans have \nyet to fully comprehend, is the toll this drought is having on our \neconomy.\n  With more than 2 years of lower than average rainfall, it has become \nclear that our towns are feeling the effects of evaporating capital. As \nfewer farmers and ranchers collect on their investments, this mean \nfewer dollars for local coffers and diminished investment in new jobs, \nour schools and economic activity.\n  Leading economists in our State have estimated that just the crop \nlosses alone have cost Kansans almost a billion dollars. This does not \ninclude any other ancillary or downstream economic costs that are sure \nto mount as this crisis deepens. It is for this reason that I will vote \nfor this amendment, brought by the Senator from South Dakota. While I \nwas disappointed that we were unable to work out a more bipartisan \ncompromise, one that would have encouraged more farmers to purchase \ncrop insurance and would have been balanced by offsets from other \nplaces in the budget, I will support this initiative and urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise. This serious drought is a major threat to \nour Nation's economy, and we should act quickly to get relief to our \nfarmers.\n  This is an issue of key importance to my State. As I said, over the \nAugust break I traveled extensively across Kansas and witnessed the \ndrought we are experiencing. We have parts of the State that have had \nless rainfall than at any time since 1895, including all the Dust Bowl \nyears when we had the terrible experience of the wind blowing soil in \ndark clouds. During the day you couldn't even see the Sun because there \nwas so much dirt in the air. That was due to both agricultural \npractices and lack of rainfall. Now we have better agricultural \npractices, but we have a lot less rainfall. It has been a disaster in a \nnumber of areas.\n  There are whole counties that haven't had any rainfall at all. I \nlooked at a lake near Jetmore, KS, that has a normal surface area of \nabout 100 acres and is now down to less than 10 acres. It is because of \na lack of rainfall. I saw whole fields where nothing has come up \nbecause of lack of rainfall.\n  Fortunately, some areas of the State are getting some moisture now, \nbut it is not enough. The crops have already died for the year. It will \nhelp, hopefully, on winter wheat planting that will now begin in some \nplaces.\n  What compounds the problem we are having today and why we need the \ndrought assistance is that the new farm bill doesn't work particularly \nwell in a situation such as this. Some agree with the increased impact \nand use of loan payments. I happen to disagree with the farm bill. The \nproblem is, with the loan payment, you need a crop to be able to borrow \nagainst to then use it and to default on it and get paid. That way, if \nyou don't have a crop, you can't use the loan payments. So you are \ncaught that way as well.\n  There is a problem with countercyclical payments. You get in a \ndrought situation, your crop reduces. The supply reduces, and generally \nwhere supply goes down, demand stays steady, the price goes up, and the \nprice has gone up for some crops. Not enough; it should be up more. But \nyour countercyclical payment doesn't help because when your price is \ngoing down, you get more payment. But when the price is going up, you \nget less payment.\n  The farmers in Kansas, in particular, are caught in a double vice. \nThey have problems with the new farm bill and its impact because of the \ndrought and the lack of a crop, and then we are getting caught in the \nloan payment scenario situation we have in the countercyclical payments \nnot being helpful to them.\n  Overall, we need the help. It would be a much better situation if we \nwere this fall getting the double AMTA payment that normally had been \ncoming through this body. That would help more people. It wouldn't be \ndependent upon crop production. They are not going to have that. That \nis not going to be the situation. That is why we need this drought \nassistance.\n  I think it would be better if we had an offset to it. That would be a \nwiser way, given the budgetary situation we are in today. We could find \nthat in other places. Although some of my other colleagues are saying \nthey don't want to go with an offset. Reaching $157 billion in deficits \nthis year points to the way we should be looking for offsets to be \nprudent in future years and for future generations so that we don't \noverspend what we have.\n  To sum up, we need this help. We need it because of the drought. We \nalso need it because of the new farm bill. This will help our farmers \nat a time and a situation and a place that they need it. It should be \noffset. I don't know that we will have that vote to be able to move \nthat side of the issue forward.\n  In my State we are looking at a $1 billion loss because of the \ndrought. That is going to impact our farmers and farm families. It will \nalso impact our communities and our entire State. This will be an \nimportant measure to get passed. I am hopeful we can make it happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it appears we will not be able to work \nthis out so we can have a vote on the Harkin amendment. Therefore, I \nthink what we will do is try to have a vote next week on the Harkin \namendment.\n  If we can't do it on Monday, we will do it on Tuesday, Wednesday. \nSometime before we finish this bill, the Senator from Iowa is going to \noffer his amendment.\n  That being the case, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to a \nperiod for\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\nmorning business, under the previous order----\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I may ask the leader to yield, I have been here all \nmorning. I thought there was no controversy on the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that the Senate and the Congress and the President act \npromptly to address these inequities on the Medicare repayment, of \nwhich the Senator from Idaho has been a very strong proponent for a \nlong time. I thought we were going to have a vote on it. I don't \nunderstand why we are not voting on this today.\n  Mr. REID. As I indicated, we had a sign-off from Senator Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I thought we had a sign-off from the \nranking member, but that didn't happen. It is my understanding that the \nSenator from Iowa and his staff are looking into the amendment now. \nThey have had the opportunity for a long time now, and they haven't \ngiven us a sign-off. Therefore, because of the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, not giving consent to move forward, \nSenator Burns has not allowed us to go forward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is my understanding that the Finance Committee people \nhad this for some time and look at it.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know about that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the assistant majority leader. I hope we can vote \non this next week sometime.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. The Assistant Democratic leader and my colleague \nSenator Harkin of Iowa have claimed that I withheld my consent to \nmoving to a vote on a Sense of the Senate Resolution directing Congress \nto promptly address inequities in Medicare payments across states.\n  The author of the Sense of the Senate resolution, Senator Harkin, has \nsaid ``it was my understanding the Finance Committee people had [his \namendment] for some time and had looked at it.''\n  This was not the case, because I was not given the courtesy of \nknowing about or even seeing the resolution in advance. No one talked \nto me about it at all. In fact, my staff and I did not learn of the \nresolution until we saw it raised on the Senate floor. By the time my \nstaff had the resolution in their hands, the Senate had moved on to \nother business, claiming that I was withholding my consent.\n  I believe the resolution, and all legislation to improve Medicare \nfairness in rural areas, deserves our attention and support. And I \nintend to support the resolution when we vote on it next week.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 2708, the Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  The committee-reported bill provides $81.936 billion in nonemergency \ndiscretionary budget authority including an advance appropriation into \n2003 of $36 million, which will result in new outlays in 2003 of \n$11.901 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are \ntaken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total \n$18.330 billion in 2003. Of that total, $1.442 billion in budget \nauthority and $1.075 billion in outlays are classified as conservation \ncategory spending.\n  In addition, the committee-reported bill provides new emergency \nspending authority of $400 million for wildland fire management, which \nwill result in outlays of $400 million. In accordance with standard \nbudget practice, the emergency spending is not counted against the \nappropriations committee's allocation until after conference.\n  Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee voted 29-0 on June 27 to \nadopt a set of non-binding sub-allocations for its 13 subcommittees \ntotaling $768.1 billion in budget authority and $793.1 billion in \noutlays. While the committee's subcommittee allocations are consistent \nwith both the amendment supported by 59 Senators on June 20 and with \nthe President's request for total discretionary budget authority for \nfiscal year 2003, they are not enforceable under either Senate budget \nrules or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. While I \napplaud the committee for adopting its own set of sub-allocations, I \nonce again urge the Senate to take up and pass the bipartisan \nresolution, which would make the committee's sub-allocations \nenforceable under Senate rules and provide for other important \nbudgetary disciplines. With the new fiscal year starting in 26 days, it \nis important that we act now.\n  For the Interior Subcommittee, the full committee allocated $18.926 \nbillion in budget authority and $18.804 billion in total outlays for \n2003. The bill reported by the full committee on June 27 is above its \nsub-allocation for budget authority by $10 million and is below its \nsub-allocation for outlays by $280 million. An amendment by Chairman \nByrd, however, at the outset of the bill's consideration lowered the \nbill's total budget authority by $10 million, making it consistent with \nits sub-allocation. In any event, the appropriations committee's sub-\nallocations are not enforceable under Senate rules; thus, a point of \norder did not lie against the bill for exceeding its sub-allocation as \nreported. However, by including emergency funding for wildland fire \nmanagement, the committee-reported bill does violate section 205 of H. \nCon. Res. 290, the concurrent resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year \n2001, by designating nondefense spending as an emergency.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying \nthe budget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 2708, INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES, 2003\n                     [Spending comparisions--Senate Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      General\n                                                                      purpose  Conservation  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.................................................    17,494       1,442           64    19,000\n  Outlays..........................................................    17,255       1,075           77    18,407\nSenate committee allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.................................................    18,926           0           64    18,990\n  Outlays..........................................................    18,610           0           77    18,687\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.................................................    18,292       1,438           64    19,794\n  Outlays..........................................................    17,800       1,052           77    18,929\nPresident's request: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority.................................................    17,632       1,321           64    19,017\n  Outlays..........................................................    17,524         971           77    18,572\n \n                 SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate committee allocation: \\3\\\n  Budget Authority.................................................        10           0            0        10\n  Outlays..........................................................      -280           0            0      -280\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.................................................      -798           4            0      -794\n  Outlays..........................................................      -545          23            0      -522\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.................................................      -138         121            0       -17\n  Outlays..........................................................      -269         104            0      -165\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Senate has not adopted a 302(a) allocation for the Appropriations Committee.

By\n  tradition, emergency spending is not counted against the Appropriations Committee's allocation until after\n  conference.\n \nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, 9-5-02.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support an important program \nfunded in the fiscal year 2003 Interior Appropriation measure. The \nAdvanced Microturbine Program is a Department of Energy effort to \nsupport and develop clean and efficient power technologies for the 21st \ncentury. The program's goals are to improve energy efficiency, reduce \nenvironmental emissions and expand fuel choices for the next generation \nof microturbines.\n  As I mentioned in the past, we must produce more energy, but we also \nmust conserve more energy. Conservation of energy is simply another way \nof producing energy. Energy efficiency is also integral to any energy \nplan. Electrical systems can and should be made more efficient. \nFinally, we must utilize renewable energies. Employing fuels such as \nethanol and using them to extend our energy supply makes good sense.\n  The Advanced Microturbine Program goes a long ways towards those \nends. The ultimate aim of the program is to produce ultra clean, highly \nefficient microturbine product designs by 2006 that are ready for \ncommercialization. The machines will utilize several fuel options, \nincluding landfill gas, industrial off-gases, ethanol, and other \nbiobased liquids and gases.\n  The Advanced Microturbine Program is a good example of how \npartnerships with industry, including one from my home State, and \ngovernment can deliver advanced technologies and practices to assist in \nmeeting challenging\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\ngoals in the areas of renewable resource development and environmental \nprotection. For this efficient technology to reach its full potential, \nI am told that the Advanced Microturbine Program should be funded at \n$14 million for fiscal year 2003. At the minimum, I encourage my \ncolleagues to recede to the higher House level of $12 million as we \nmove this bill to conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for an \namendment that has been introduced by our distinguished majority \nleader. This amendment, which has taken a variety of forms in the past \nseveral months, was originally proposed as a bill by Senator Baucus. I \ncosponsored this bill previously and support it now as it provides much \nneeded assistance to our Nation's farmers who have suffered significant \ncrop losses during the past 2 crop years. Farmers throughout the Nation \nhave suffered great losses, and farmers in my home State of Michigan \nhave been among those who have suffered most.\n  Two years of statewide crop failure have threatened the viability of \nMichigan's farmers, and this amendment strives to address the losses \nsuffered by growers in the 2001 and 2002 growing years. Over the past 2 \nyears, some farmers faced early warm temperatures followed by freezing \nconditions. For others, torrential rains came early in the growing \nseason and were followed by long droughts for some farmers. Still other \nfarmers faced drought conditions at the start of the crop year and \nheavy rains at harvest time.\n  This year, USDA Secretary Ann Veneman recognized the atypical weather \nconditions that greatly diminished crop production in Michigan by \ndesignating 50 Michigan counties as disaster areas. If that was not bad \nenough, Secretary Veneman designated that 82 of Michigan's 83 counties \nas official disaster areas last year.\n  Michigan is one of the Nation's most diverse states in terms of the \nsheer breadth and number of crops grown in it, and growers of many \ncrops have been affected by adverse weather conditions.\n  This year, cherry farmers in Michigan lost upwards of 95 percent of \ntheir crops--a level that threatens to devastate Michigan and the \nNation's cherry industry, given that Michigan produces over 70 percent \nof the tart cherries in the nation. Earlier this year, I had the \nopportunity to visit with cherry growers in Michigan and listen to them \nas they told me how this year's crop losses were the worst that the \nindustry had ever suffered since crop records have been kept. \nAdditionally, all apple growers in Michigan have had at least 20 \npercent of their crops damaged this, and 80 percent of all Michigan \napple farmers have lost upwards of 40 percent of their crop this year.\n  Last year, farmers in just one area of Michigan, which is one of the \nleading dry bean producing regions in the Nation, lost 85 percent of \ntheir bean crop. Across the state, in the southwest corner of Michigan, \nlabrusca grape growers lost 80 percent of their crop, and they suffered \nsimilar losses this year. While the losses suffered by bean and grape \ngrowers are particularly severe, they are not the only crops to have \nsuffered drastic losses.\n  Approximately 25 percent of apple growers in Michigan and across the \nNation are in danger of going out of business in the next 2 years, and \nin Michigan that means that our cherry, peach and asparagus crops, \nwhich are often grown on the same orchards as apples, will be greatly \ndecreased. Orchard communities around the country have been devastated. \nAs farmers have left the business, small businesses and cooperatives \nthat have been around for generations have also gone out of business, \nand local governments have lost significant tax revenue. This \nassistance will allow many growers to reduce debt and get private bank \nor USDA loans for the next growing season. This assistance for will \ngive farmers the shot in the arm they need to recover from several \nyears of low prices.\n  Our Nation's farmers have not shared in the prosperity which many \nAmericans have experienced over the past decade. No one, least of all \nAmerica's farmers, likes the fact that annual emergency agriculture \nsupplementals have seemingly become routine.\n  Yet we must provide this assistance if we are to address the problems \nfacing farmers throughout the Nation. Several growers have told me that \nthe crops losses they suffered this year were so severe that without \nemergency assistance they will most likely lose their farms. This \nassistance is not the answer to the problems facing our farmers and \nrural America, but it is an important part of an effort to keep \nfamilies on their farms. I thank the Senator for South Dakota and the \nSenator from Montana for their efforts in drafting, supporting and \noffering this amendment.\n\n\n                          Hay and Fescue Crops\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I wish to enter a short colloquy with \nmy good friend, the Senator from Montana, one of the chief authors of \nthis amendment, and ask him if losses to hay and fescue crops due to \narmyworm infestation qualify for assistance under amendment 4481 to the \nInterior Appropriations Act.\n  As the distinguished Senator might know, farmers of forage crops in \nsouthern Missouri, and across the country, were devastated by a recent \narmyworm infestation. The Secretary of Agriculture declared sixty-two \nMissouri counties as natural disaster areas due to damage caused by \nsevere armyworm infestation. Last year Senator Leahy and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 1354, to provide emergency relief for these farmers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In response to my distinguished colleague, we have \nconsulted with the Department of Agriculture and these crop losses \nwould indeed qualify for assistance under this amendment.\n  I know that the armyworm infestations have caused massive damage to \ncrops throughout the Midwest and Northeast and I am pleased that this \nlegislation will provide some assistance to these farmers.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nassurances that this important legislation will provide much needed \nrelief to so many farmers and farm communities in Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8250-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today to express my growing \nconcern that we may shortly be faced with a decision to unilaterally \ninvade another nation-state, and that is the State of Iraq. This \nconcern has been heightened by the news of today's assassination \nattempt of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kandahar. Earlier on, a car \nbomb exploded in central Kabul, killing at least 22 people.\n  This event, in my view, underscores the point that our primary focus \nmust remain on our immediate war on terrorism being waged in troubled \nAfghanistan, where our soldiers are on the front line. As a matter of \nfact, preliminary reports indicate it was Americans who took down the \nattempted assassins.\n  While I welcome President Bush's recent statement indicating he will \nseek congressional approval of such a use of\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\nforce, I believe any action in Iraq at this time, without allied \nsupport, without United Nations support, and without a compelling case \nfor just cause, would be both morally wrong and politically mistaken.\n  I just returned from a trip to Europe. As part of my role as chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, I toured \nU.S. military bases and met with a variety of individuals. They \nincluded members of the intelligence community, the military, and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\n  I was shocked at how dramatically perceptions in Europe have shifted \nsince September 11 toward our country. All of the sympathy and concern \nwe received in the wake of the terrorist attacks has apparently \nvanished, replaced by the sense that the United States is becoming an \narrogant and aggressive power, a nation that simply gives orders, a \nnation that neither listens nor hears.\n  When I was in Europe, much attention was given to the absence of \nPresidential participation at the Summit on Sustainable Development in \nJohannesburg. And this, on top of our rejection of the Kyoto treaty, \nour casting of aspersions on international accords such as the \nInternational Criminal Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile and Landmine \ntreaties, has led to a growing belief, right or wrong, that the United \nStates is using its power in an increasingly unilateral and somewhat \narrogant manner.\n  Above all, there is our approach to Iraq and our perceived readiness \nto invade that nation unilaterally.\n  I believe we have to ask many critical questions, most of which are \nunanswered.\n  Questions about the ongoing war on terrorism. How do we stay the \ncourse, root out terrorism and, at the same time, initiate war with a \nnation-state which, to this day, remains unconnected to 9/11.\n  Questions about the extent of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction and about who will get to them first.\n  Questions about going it alone in Iraq.\n  Questions about casualties and cost.\n  Questions about collateral human damage--civilians killed in the \nshort term and in the long run.\n  Questions about the future of Iraq, about whether we can honestly \nexpect a democracy to be created out of a nation consumed by tribal \nfactionalism.\n  And questions about what the long-term impact might be on the Arab \nworld, on the Middle East. What if Iraq attacks Israel? What will we \ndo, and what will the world do?\n  Present United States policy toward Iraq stands in stark contrast to \nhow we conducted Operation Desert Storm just over a decade ago. Then, \nthe first Bush administration spent several months building a broad-\nbased coalition that included 30 nations, including many in the Islamic \nworld. It sought and received resolutions supporting the use of force \nagainst Iraq from the United States Congress and the United Nations \nSecurity Council, and American and international public opinion stood \nfirmly behind such action. Today, no nation is firmly allied with the \nUnited States on this issue.\n\n  At the very least, I believe we should launch a major diplomatic \neffort with the United Nations, our allies, and our Arab friends, with \nthe goal of delivering an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein: Either open up \nor go down.\n  If he does not comply with this demand, it will give the United \nStates added moral and diplomatic strength to any future effort. It \nwill help unite the world community behind us.\n  Additionally, I am very concerned that the United States stay the \ncourse on our war against terrorism. To date, there is no direct \nconnection between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the 9/11 attacks that has \nbeen substantiated.\n  This means staying the course in our war against terrorism, part of \nwhich exists in Afghanistan. The government of Hamid Karzai is fragile \nat best. Today should show that. During its first 6 months in power, \ntwo Cabinet officials have been assassinated. Today, President Karzai \nhimself barely escaped an assassination attempt, and a major act of \nterrorism has killed many in central Kabul. The Karzai government must \nhave security and stability, or it will perish and so will democracy.\n  Additionally, we know the Taliban and al-Qaida lurk in the remote \nmountains, waiting for an opportune moment to come back. If Afghanistan \ncannot be stabilized, if its streets and homes cannot be made secure, \nand if its first democratic government cannot survive, this will be a \nvery serious setback.\n  Afghanistan is our beachhead in the war on terror. We cannot lose it, \nor we lose the war on terror. We must put al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, \nand a host of other terrorist groups out of business before they can \nstrike out again at America and our interests.\n  That is why concentrating on this war--the critical war against \nterrorism--is so important.\n  An attack on Iraq at this time would only deflect from this war, by \ndiverting attention and forces away from bringing to justice the \nperpetrators of 9/11. Can we afford to do this?\n  If there is an imminent threat to the United States or to our \ninterests, then we must act. At this moment, however, I do not believe \nsuch a threat exists. No one doubts that Iraq has chemical or \nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them. They have used them \non at least three occasions, but they have not used them in the last 10 \nyears, and I believe they know what will happen if they do use them.\n  What is less clear, however, is the status of Iraq's nuclear weapons \ncapability. In 1981, Israel destroyed the Osiraq reactor provided by \nFrance. While Iraq continues to seek to develop nuclear capability, \nthere is no evidence I have found that Iraq is nuclear capable today. \nSo there is no imminent threat.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has claimed that if we wait for Iraq to develop \nnuclear weapons, then it will be too late. He is right. The key is to \nfind a way to stop Iraqi nuclear ambition, and stop it now, which is \nwhy opening Iraq's borders to a search and destroy mission for weapons \nof mass destruction, conducted by our allies, our friends in the Arab \nworld, and the United Nations, is critical.\n  I believe this requires renewed diplomatic efforts on our part, with \nthe United Nations, with our allies, and with friendly Arab nations. We \nmust stop Iraq from becoming nuclear capable. And the world in turn \nmust respond. Otherwise, an attack becomes the only alternative.\n  As Gen. Wesley Clark recently stated:\n\n       In the war on terrorism, alliances are not an obstacle to \n     victory. They're the key to it.\n\n  By acting unilaterally, the United States not only runs the risk of \nisolating these long-standing allies, but also of solidifying the \nentire Arab world sharply against us. This may not result in any direct \nor traditional military response against the United States, but what \nabout a personal jihad throughout this country--a jihad of bombs and \nother terrorist acts carried out throughout the world?\n  There are people out there eminently capable and able to finance \ndoing just that.\n  With the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not yet under control, a United \nStates attack on Iraq would certainly fuel the fire of Islamic \nfanaticism, uniting the Arab world against the West and Israel. The \nconsequences could be unprecedented and beyond our present \ncomprehension.\n  The Israeli-Palestinian situation should be our highest priority. \nThis conflict must be resolved. The United States must use its \ninfluence and leadership here, with the Israelis, the Palestinians, and \nthe surrounding Arab world. Here, too, we must stay the course.\n  At the same time, there is some troubling evidence today of the \npreparation of a second front in southern Lebanon to attack Israel in \nthe event we attack Iraq. Ambassador Dennis Ross recently told me of \nthousands--he mentioned 10,000--extended-range Katyusha rockets that \nhave been moved through Syria from Iran and into southern Lebanon, for \nan attack on Israel. He said they had been extended so that they could \nhit at the major Israeli industrial zone north of Haifa. I believe this \nhas been confirmed.\n  In the face of all of this, assume we do attack Iraq. Consider that \nwe mobilize 250,000 to 300,000 soldiers, our aircraft carriers, our B-\n52s, our 117s. This will not be another Desert Storm\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\nwhere exposed Iraqi troops are routed in the open desert, overwhelmed \nby American airpower.\n\n  This war will be waged in Baghdad, in Tikrit, and in other cities. It \nwill be waged from house to house and palace to palace, from street to \nstreet and school to school and hospital to hospital.\n  We will certainly kill many Iraqis, and how many of our own will be \nkilled? And will we stay the course once the body bags start coming \nback to Dover? Will Americans stand up and say, ``More''? I think not.\n  Then there are the thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians civilians \nalready brutalized by the last 12 years--who will become casualties in \nthis war.\n  America has never been an aggressor nation unless attacked, as we \nwere at Pearl Harbor and on September 11, or our interests and our \nallies were attacked. We have never initiated a major invasion against \nanother nation-state, which leads to the question of whether a \npreemptive war is the morally right, legally right, or the politically \nright way for the United States to proceed.\n  Lastly, there is the immensely complicated question of the Iraqi \nnation Saddam Hussein now has and what will happen if he is overthrown. \nHave we really thought out our options here? Have we taken into account \nthe deep tribal factionalism and divisions, the bitter and often bloody \nrivalries among the Shia majority, the ruling Sunni minority, and the \nKurds, that lie at the very root of Iraq? Will we protect the Kurds \nfrom possible genocide? How long will we stay to secure a new \ngovernment? And who would replace Saddam Hussein?\n  Let's be realistic. A democracy is not likely to emerge. One must \nlook closely at the history of Iraq to draw such a conclusion, and I \nhave.\n  Madam President, I would like to quote from the recently published \nbook, ``The Reckoning: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein'' by \nSandra Mackey. She writes:\n  When [Saddam Hussein] finally loses his grip on power either \npolitically or physically, he will leave Iraq much as it was when the \nBritish created it--torn by tribalism and uncertain in its identity. It \nis this Iraq that threatens to inflict its communal grievances, its \ndecades of non-cooperation, and its festering suspicions and entrenched \nhatreds on the Persian Gulf, the lifeline of our global economy.\n  In light of such conditions, is the United States ready to be an \noccupational force? It could take many years for the seeds of a stable \npluralist society to flourish in Iraq. Are we really ready to spend a \ngeneration there?\n  Given what is at stake here--American lives, American prestige, and \nAmerica's respect for the rule of law--we find ourselves at a critical \ncrossroad.\n  Again, according to Sandra Mackey:\n\n       . . . the time is fast approaching when the United States, \n     for a series of perilous reasons, will be forced to look \n     beyond Hussein to Iraq itself. That is when all Americans \n     will pay the price for what has been a long night of \n     ignorance about the land between the rivers.\n\n  In closing, I am very happy to see that President Bush will now seek \ncongressional approval regarding military action. So this debate has \njust begun.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to \nensure we not only ask the questions but see that the answers are \nmoral, see that they are legal, see that they are befitting the \ngreatest democracy on Earth, and see whether they are worth, for the \nfirst time, the United States of America making a unilateral attack on \nanother nation-state.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8252-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8252-S8253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the attacks of September 11 changed us \nas individuals and as a nation. They changed the way we think about our \npersonal security, and they challenged our assumptions about the \nthreats posed by groups and organizations hostile to our values and our \nway of life.\n  The events of the past year have also bolstered our resolve. We have \ncome a long way since that terrible day, but much more needs to be \ndone. We have toppled the Taliban and severely disrupted the al-Qaida \nnetwork, but our military is still working around the clock to destroy \nal-Qaida elements around the world.\n  We have dramatically improved security at our airports, but we have \nmuch to do to protect our aviation system, our ports, and our borders. \nWe have spent billions to recover from the attacks, but unfortunately \nwe must spend more to protect our homeland from threats ranging from \nbioterrorism to dirty bombs.\n  Today, we are focused on reorganizing our Federal Government to meet \nthese new security challenges. I believe creating a new Federal \nDepartment of Homeland Security is the right thing to do. We need one \nagency whose exclusive focus is controlling our borders and protecting \nour homeland. That is why I support the bill before the Senate.\n  I commend Senator Lieberman for the leadership and tenacity he has \nshown in getting us to this point. We began hearings last year on this \nproposal, and now we have brought the Senate a well-designed, \ncomprehensive bill, approved on a bipartisan basis by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. I was proud to vote for that bill.\n  I also commend President Bush for his decision to support the \ncreation of a Homeland Security Department.\n  I believe now is the time for Congress and the President to work \ntogether to create a strong, effective, and well-equipped department--a \nrobust department. The American people rightly demand that the first \nduty of the Federal Government is to provide security. So we need to \nmake sure we give the new Department the structure and the tools it \nneeds to do the job.\n  The committee-approved homeland security bill creates an agency that \nwill improve coordination, cooperation, and communication among all the \nGovernment organizations that will work at this new effort. It will \nbring together information and expertise from Federal, State, and local \ngovernment and the private sector. Such efforts are key to preventing \nand containing further attacks.\n  Our States are on the front line of this battle. Missouri recognized \nthis and was the first State to hire a homeland security director. In \nrecognition of the strong bonds needed between Federal, State, and \nlocal government, the committee bill includes an office of State and \nlocal government Coordination. This office will assure that the Federal \nGovernment reaches out to the State and local levels with training, \ntools, and a coordinated strategy.\n  It will take more than this bill to prepare communities to respond to \nan attack, however. There must be the resources to do the job. I am \nalready concerned because Federal funding for homeland security still \nhas not made its way to the local level in Missouri. In the aftermath \nof 9/11, the staffing needs of many fire departments have increased \ndramatically across our Nation. Two-thirds of all fire departments, \nlarge and small, operate with inadequate staff. The International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs estimates that 75,000 additional \nfirefighters are needed to meet minimal acceptable levels for safety \nand effective response.\n  I offered an amendment with Senator Collins that will begin to \naddress this. It will establish a program to enable local fire \ndepartments in Missouri and across the country to hire 10,000 new \nfirefighters. I am pleased the amendment passed unanimously in \ncommittee. This amendment is an effort to strengthen the ranks of those \nwho protect us and did so on September 11, and who risk their lives \ndaily to keep our communities safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this provision when the Senate bill \nis conferenced with the House bill. We not only need to make sure our \nfirst responders have sufficient resources, but we will need to make \nsure they have adequate training. I sponsored an amendment in committee \nthat requires the new Department to coordinate with the Secretary of \nDefense for training on how to respond to chemical and biological \nattacks. This is a logical step because the Defense Department is the\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nprimary Government agency supporting the training of military and \nnonmilitary personnel to respond to chemical and biological attacks.\n  Just last January, the Coast Guard sent 30 national strike force \nmembers to the Army's chemical school in Fort Leonard Wood, MO. They \nlearned how to spot nerve agents, scan people for radiation, and \nrespond in other ways to terrorist attacks. From their DOD schooling, \nsome went straight to the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City for duty.\n  My amendment, which the committee also accepted unanimously, makes \nsure that the new Department of Homeland Security has access to the \nDefense Department's expertise.\n  We will consider a number of amendments in the coming days and \nhopefully have a thorough debate. But let's not lose sight of the fact \nwe have a very solid proposal before the Senate. It implements the \nPresident's call for the creation of a strong, robust Department of \nHomeland Security. It does so in a careful and constructive way. In the \nend, it will preserve, protect, and defend the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8253-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8253-S8255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDGE PRISCILLA OWEN\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I regret to say this day is a very dark day \nin the history of the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee, of which \nI am a member, has just rejected, on a purely partisan party line vote, \nthe nomination of one of President Bush's finest nominees to the U.S. \nCircuit Court, Justice Priscilla to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  First, there was a vote to reject her 10 to 9. Then, Senator Hatch \nasked she be reported to the full Senate without recommendation so that \nall of our colleagues could have an opportunity to cast their vote on \nher nomination. That was rejected 10 to 9. Finally, he said, all right, \nthen, I will move that we report her out unfavorably since the majority \nof the committee, 10 to 9, does not support her confirmation. That, \ntoo, was rejected on a party-line vote.\n  The full body of the Senate will not have an opportunity to vote on \nthe confirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen.\n  The reason this is so distressing today is because it marks a new era \nin the judicial confirmation process. That much was made clear by the \nDemocratic members of the committee today. It is clear now that there \nis a new test to be applied to the President's nominees. It is no \nlonger enough that the nominee be well qualified and above reproach in \nterms of judicial ethics. It is now necessary that the candidate be \ncommitted to actively pursuing the political agenda of the majority of \nthe members of the committee. If not, they will characterize the \nnominee as ``extremist,'' as ``right wing,'' as Justice Owen was \ncharacterized today.\n  Now, some time ago the chairman of the committee said the American \nBar Association, which had historically rated the qualifications of \nnominees, was 6really the gold standard because they were very careful \nin how they considered the qualifications of nominees and their \nrecommendations were not made lightly. The highest recommendation that \nthe American Bar Association can give to a nominee is ``well \nqualified.'' Justice Owen received the recommendation of ``well \nqualified'' not by a majority of the members of the ABA who decide \nthese matters, but unanimously. Every single person involved in the ABA \nwho rated the nominee, rated her well qualified. In other words, she \ncould not have gotten a higher rating from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  As I said, the chairman of the committee characterized this process \nas the gold standard for nominees. I said today that I guess the Senate \nhas now gone off the gold standard; that is no longer enough.\n  The Senator from New York was quite candid in articulating again, as \nhe has on numerous occasions, what he believes the new standard should \nbe. And central to the application of the new standard is a \ndetermination by the members of the committee of the purported \nideology, political ideology, of the nominee with the right to \ndetermine whether the nominee is within the mainstream, as they \nidentify it, and then the right to vote down any nominee considered to \nbe outside the mainstream.\n  Never mind that our great and distinguished colleagues, such as \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts, Senator Schumer of New York, Senator \nLeahy of Vermont, in my opinion, are not necessarily the most qualified \nto describe what is mainstream in American politics--as least not as \nqualified as a person who has been elected by all of the people of the \ncountry, the President of the United States. Apart from the fact that I \nthink President Bush probably has a better handle on what is mainstream \nin the country than my colleagues on the committee, myself included, \nthe rejection of the previous standard and the insertion of this new \npolitical standard into the Judiciary Committee deliberations is a \nbreach of tradition, highly dangerous to the continuation of the rule \nof law in the United States, and itself an exercise in blatant, \npolitical activity.\n  When the Senator from New York suggested this new standard, he held a \nhearing. Among the people who testified were Lloyd Cutler, counselor to \nseveral Democratic Presidents. Lloyd Cutler is a man of great \ndistinction in the bar with a long history of activity in the judicial \nnomination process. He said it would be a grave mistake to insert \npolitics into the nonpolitical branch of Government, the third branch, \nthe judicial branch. He said if an ideological litmus test ever became \nthe Senate's reason for confirming or rejecting a nominee, that it \nwould have injected politics into the third branch, and the citizenry \ncould then well conclude that the third branch of Government was merely \nan extension of the other two, subject to political decision making, \nand that the public could then rightly lose faith; that the designates \nof the third branch of Government would be devoid of political \ninfluence, that they would be fair and honest. And I would just add in \nmy own words that it would be pretty hard to believe anymore that when \nyou went into a court and you expected to receive blind justice, as we \nare all accustomed to, that you might well be faced with the decision \nof a political judge who would not base the case on the law or the \nConstitution, but rather on political ideology.\n\n  That is wrong. It is dangerous. It is unprecedented. That is why I \nsay this was a black mark in the history of the Senate because today we \nhad a committee that made a decision that I can only characterize as \napplying a political litmus test to the nominee--and a faulty one at \nthat.\n  If my colleagues can characterize Justice Priscilla Owen as a right-\nwing extremist, an ideologue, an activist judge--as they did--then \nanyone can be so characterized. Senator Gramm made the point a few \nminutes ago. He said: I know a political ideologue when I see one \nbecause I am. Most of us in the Senate, in fact, are political \nideologues in the finest sense of that word. We believe in a political \nideology and we care enough, no matter what other occupation we might \nhave had, to try to advance our political philosophy in the U.S. Senate \non behalf of our constituents. That is in the great tradition of the \nUnited States and applied to the second branch of Government, the \nlegislative branch.\n  But it has never been appropriate to apply that to the third branch \nof Government, our judges. As I said, if Priscilla Owen can be so \ncharacterized, then anyone can be. She is about as far from being an \nideologue or an extremist or an activist as anybody I have ever seen \nnominated to the court.\n  A bit about her: She has earned the support of Texas Democrats and \nRepublicans. She has been three times elected to the Texas Supreme \nCourt. She had the endorsement of every major Texas paper in her last \nrace. She is not a partisan.\n  She is brilliant. She had the highest score on the Texas bar exam \nwhen she took it. As I said, the American Bar Association rated her \nunanimously with their highest rating of ``well qualified.''\n  Everything that was said about her in the committee deliberations \nthis morning was considered by the bar association in making that \nrecommendation. I suggest the charges that those outside the Senate \nhave made are trumped up charges that bear no resemblance to the truth.\n  In characterizing her as somehow outside the mainstream, these groups\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nhave done a great disservice, not just to the President and to the \ncourt system and the rule of law, but to this fine individual, \npersonally. That is, perhaps, the biggest tragedy of all.\n  The Washington Post, which is not known to be, by conservatives \nanyway, a friendly newspaper to the President or to conservatives or to \nthe conservative philosophy, in an editorial on July 24, made clear its \nview that it would be inappropriate to reject Justice Owen; that she \nwas highly qualified and that her conservative views, if indeed she had \nthem, would not be a reason for her to be disqualified and rejected. \nThe Post characterized her as a conservative in the editorial, \nconcluding:\n\n       In Justice Owen's case, the long wait has produced no great \n     surprise. She's still a conservative. And that is still not a \n     good reason to vote her down.\n\n  I remember in the last few weeks of the campaign for the Presidency, \nAl Gore said one thing I agreed with. He said: You should not vote for \nPresident Bush because if he's elected President then he'll nominate \nconservatives to the court.\n\n  It is no great surprise that a President would nominate people to the \ncourts who think like the President does. That is traditional in this \ncountry and Al Gore was right.\n  If you elected him, you are more likely to get people who are more \nliberal. If you elected President Bush you are more likely to get \npeople who are more conservative. That is our system and that has never \nbeen a basis for the Senate to substitute its political judgment for \nthat of the President--who after all, again, was elected by all of the \npeople in the country--and vote the nominee down based on ideology.\n  Instead, it has always been the tradition to determine whether the \ncandidate was well qualified, had the right ethics and judicial \ntemperament, and was otherwise qualified. If so, then the candidate was \nconfirmed.\n  As a member of the committee and as a Member of this body, I have \nvoted on a lot of nominees with whom I did not agree politically. There \nare members of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting now who have \nvoted wrong in every controversial case, as far as I am concerned. But \nI voted for them. I voted to confirm them because I believed that \nPresident Clinton, having been elected by all of the people of the \ncountry, deserved his nominees. I couldn't argue with the \nqualifications or ethics of the people for whom I voted. These, too, \nwere rated highly by the American Bar Association. They, too, were \nsmart people who had good judicial ethics. So I voted for them, knowing \nthat probably they would come down on the wrong side of decisions that \nmattered to me in certain situations. And that has been the case. But I \ndo not regret voting for them because that has been the tradition for \nover 200 years in this country.\n  Senator after Senator on the floor of the Senate has made that point: \nI don't necessarily like this candidate's views, but I am going to \nsupport the candidate because of the tradition of the Senate to give \nthe President's nominees the benefit of the doubt.\n  The new ideology in the Senate, according to the majority members of \nthe committee, is that the burden of proof is now on the nominee; that \nunless the nominee can demonstrate to the members of the committee the \nnominee's willingness to abide by this test that has been established, \nthat the committee has the right to turn these nominees down. The \nburden of proof has heretofore been on the committee members to find a \nreason to reject the nominee if, in fact, there was one.\n  To be candid, Members of the Senate have sometimes gone looking for \nreasons to oppose a nominee when they believed that the ideology was \ntoo far one way or the other. Sometimes they found those reasons and \nsometimes they did not. But up to now, anyway, unless you could find a \ndarned good reason to oppose a nominee, you didn't do so.\n  Now that has changed. That is why I said this is a very dark day in \nthe Senate. If this persists, we are going to get to the point where we \nhave judges sitting who were confirmed based upon political ideology so \nthe citizens of the country are no longer going to be able to go into \ncourt and be satisfied regarding the one person who will rule on their \nfate, on their property, and in some cases even their lives--that the \nindividual litigant can no longer count on the decisions made to be \nfair and in accordance with the law and the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I know of very few countries in the world where a citizen is willing \nto volunteer and go into court and say: I believe I am absolutely \nright, but I am willing to let a judge, somebody I have never met \nbefore, who I do not know, make a decision that could dramatically \naffect my life because I believe in the rule of law as applied in the \nUnited States of America, in fairness and in the application of the \nrule of law in the U.S. Constitution. There are not very many places in \nthe world where you feel good about going into a court and literally \nplacing your life in the hands of someone you don't know.\n  But we trust those people in the United States because of the \ntradition that has enabled us to appoint people to the bench who, by \nand large, rule on the basis of their view of the law and of the \nConstitution rather than on a political ideology. But if this persists, \nyou are not going to know when you go before the judge whether this was \na judge who was chosen because of ideology and, if so, how that might \nbe applied in your particular case. That is a very bad thing. It begins \nto undermine the rule of law in this country. That is why people, such \nas Lloyd Cutler and others, were very wary of a change in the practice \nof confirming judges this way.\n\n  I think it is interesting that liberals in this country were always \nvery concerned about President Reagan and the first President Bush \napplying a litmus test to nominees. They both made it clear that they \napplied no such litmus test. The litmus test that was of most concern \nrelated to the issue of abortion. It is clear, from at least some of \nthe nominees President Bush appointed, that he did not have a litmus \ntest in mind because those judges have not agreed with the Reagan-Bush \nkind of political philosophy. But I think it is appropriate that there \nbe no litmus test on abortion or any other issue.\n  When I recommended a judicial nominee to the President--either to \nPresident Clinton or to President Bush--I did so on the basis that I \ncould easily say I never asked this candidate about his or her position \non an issue such as abortion. In fact, to this day I don't know those \ncandidates' positions, by and large, on that particular issue. But it \nappears to me now the litmus test is being applied, and specifically on \nthe issue of abortion, if you listened to the members of the committee \nwho discussed Justice Owen's nomination today.\n  It is interesting that the Judiciary Committee, in response to the \nconcern about a President applying a litmus test, has a question that \nhas always been put to the nominees before it. We have a list of \nquestions. But one of the key questions is: Has anybody at the White \nHouse or in the Government asked you about your position on any issues \nthat might come before the court? If so, specify who, when, and so on. \nBecause the members of the Judiciary Committee wanted to know if \nanybody in the executive branch queried them about their political \nviews on issues that might come before the court. And, of course, if \nanybody had done so, the committee would have risen as one and said: \nThat is improper; you are applying a litmus test, and you can't do \nthat.\n  Some of the witnesses who came before the committee when we had the \nhearings on this alluded to that questionnaire. And we said: You can't \nsubstitute the traditional advice for confirmation with a political \nlitmus kind of test and only apply it in the legislative branch.\n  If the members of the Judiciary Committee are going to begin applying \na litmus test--if we are going to begin making our decision on \nideology--then you can expect the President of the United States is \ngoing to do the same thing, continuing down that road.\n  I think there is an element of hypocrisy because that question still \nexists. It is still asked by the members of the Judiciary Committee. \nBut we say the President dare not ask it.\n  I think we have to get our thinking straight. Are we going to allow \ndecisions such as the one that was made today by the majority of the \nJudiciary Committee to become the prevailing view in the Senate and the \ntraditional practice and test of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate \nor are we going to\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\ntake a big, deep breath and say: Wait a minute--whether it is a \nRepublican or Democratic President and whether it is a Republican or \nDemocratic Senate--this is taking us down a very wrong and dangerous \npath.\n  I believe that in the great tradition of partisan Members of this \nbody, who nevertheless understood that politics was no way to make \ndecisions on judges, good sense will ultimately prevail and the Senate \nwill return to a standard that is appropriate--whether the candidate is \nwell qualified based upon traditional temperament and ethics, and on \ntheir ability to apply the law fairly, and understanding and knowledge \nof the law.\n  If we don't return to that kind of a standard, then we are on an \ninevitable decline in the way that our country applies the rule of law; \nand, since the rule of law underpins everything in the United States--\nfrom our guaranteed constitutional rights to our economic free market \nsystem, our property rights, and all the rest--it would be the \nbeginning of the end of this country.\n  I do not exaggerate when I say that nothing less is at stake and that \nthis body needs to address this question very seriously before \ndecisions such as today's become the rule rather than the aberrant \nexception.\n  I believe this is a dark day in the history of the Senate, that \nhistory will judge the actions of the committee today very harshly. I \njust hope my colleagues will consider whether in the future we need to \nreturn to the tradition that has served Presidents and the Senate and \nthe Nation so well. I hope so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I heard the last part of the remarks \nof the Senator from Arizona about what happened today in the Judiciary \nCommittee to Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, a member of the \nTexas Supreme Court, who was voted down on a straight party line vote. \nI have never seen a case in which a person who is totally qualified, a \nperson who has shown integrity on the bench, and who has the academic \ncredentials to be a great Federal judge would be turned down for, \nreally, I think a litmus test on issues.\n  In the past administration--the Clinton administration--I voted for a \nnumber of judges with whom I disagreed philosophically, judges who I \nknew would rule differently from what I thought would be the ``right \nvote'' on the court. But I tried to see what their qualifications were. \nI certainly tried to see if they would be strict constructionists to \nthe Constitution, if they would adhere to the law rather than be \ntraditional judicial activists. I voted for people with whom I \ndisagreed many times. Today, I don't think that could be said for \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am told there has never been a nominee who had the unanimous \nqualified recommendation from the American Bar Association and the \nsupport of both home State Senators who has been turned down for a \ntraditional nomination.\n  I am sad today because I know Priscilla Owen. I know what a fine \nperson she is. Not only did she graduate right at the top of her class \nin law school, but she had the No. 1 grade on the Texas bar exam when \nshe took it. She has sterling credentials academically. She is very \nwell regarded by the former Democratic attorney general. The chief \njustice of the Supreme Court of Texas was very supportive of her and \ncame out publicly for her. The other Democratic member of the Supreme \nCourt of Texas with whom she served came out strongly for her.\n  It is just stunning that someone who never had one smirch on her \nrecord of integrity, who was totally well qualified and unanimously \ncertified by the American Bar Association, and who was reelected to the \nTexas Supreme Court by over 80 percent of the vote would be turned down \nby the Judiciary Committee. I think this is a sad day.\n  But I will say this: I talked to Justice Owen today. I said: You lost \nthe battle today, but you could win the war because I am absolutely \ncertain that President Bush will renominate her if there is Republican \ncontrol of the Senate. If that happens, she will be confirmed, because \nshe deserves to be confirmed.\n  It is very hard on a personal level to see someone as committed as \nPriscilla Owen--she is basically a nonpolitical individual. She did not \neven know when she was asked to submit her name for the Supreme Court \nof Texas if she had voted in the primary before. This judge is not \npolitical.\n  But George Bush--Governor of Texas at the time--appointed her. She \nthen ran for election after her appointment and was endorsed by every \nnewspaper in Texas and was just thought of by both Republicans and \nDemocrats as the most qualified person who had been put forward for \nthis particular seat on the bench on the Fifth Circuit.\n  It is a sad day, but I think this is not over.\n  I do believe that President Bush will reappoint her in the next \nCongress if the Republicans control the Senate and he believes that she \nwill get a fair hearing. I believe she will win the vote of the Senate, \nand she will show what a great judge she can be because she will be \nsitting on the Fifth Circuit bench.\n  But this is a tough day for her. I think she did not deserve this \ntreatment. I will say that in the parts of the hearing that she had \nthat I saw, she was outstanding and did as good a job as anyone I have \never seen who was a nominee for the Federal bench. She did so well that \nshe won the endorsement of the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, \nand the Wall Street Journal. She had accolades from newspapers across \nAmerica.\n  She does not deserve to have the treatment that she got today. But we \nwill have another day, and I believe Priscilla Owen will go down in the \nrecords as a great Federal judge, because I believe she will be one \neventually.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 5005, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Wellstone Amendment No. 4486 (to amendment No. 4471), to \n     prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from contracting \n     with any corporate expatriate.\n       Reid amendment No. 4490 (to amendment No. 4486), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Smith (N.H.) amendment No. 4491 (to amendment No. 4471), to \n     amend title 49, United States Code, to improve flight and \n     cabin security on passenger aircraft.\n       Reid (for Boxer/Smith (N.H.)) amendment No. 4492 (to \n     amendment No. 4491), to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to improve flight and cabin security on passenger aircraft.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nWellstone has a modification that will allow us to proceed and finish \nhis amendment. Recognizing that as the case, people still wish to speak \nin relation to that amendment. I think that can be done after we take \nthat action. So if Senator Wellstone is ready, I will ask that he be \nallowed to modify his amendment, and that will be accepted by voice \nvote.\n  Following that, the Senator from Texas will be recognized for 20 \nminutes to speak in relation to the legislation before the Senate; and \nthe manager of the bill, Senator Thompson, wishes to speak, and I ask \nthat he be recognized following the statement of the Senator from \nTexas.\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\n  Senator Lieberman wishes to speak after Senator Thompson. At that \ntime, we should be in a position to move forward on the Smith-Boxer \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume consideration of the \nWellstone amendment; that Senator Wellstone then modify his amendment \nwith changes that have been agreed upon; that Senator Wellstone have 20 \nminutes to speak with respect to his amendment; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the Reid second-degree amendment No. 4490, as \nmodified, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that the Wellstone amendment 4486, as amended, be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening \naction or debate, with the proviso that Senators be recognized as I \nindicated: Senators Gramm, Thompson, Lieberman. And at that time, we \nwould be in an almost certain position to move forward on the Smith-\nBoxer amendment. There have been conversations taking place among \npeople with regard to this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I apologize. I was called \nto the Cloakroom. It was my understanding that after Senator Gramm \nspeaks in morning business that we were going to go to the Smith-Boxer \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. That was the case, but we have the two managers of the bill \nwho wish to speak on the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. On which amendment?\n  Mr. REID. On the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask, where are we in terms of time?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Thompson wants 10 minutes. We are talking about 40 \nminutes. We hope at that time we will have something that will dispose \nof this amendment on which Senator Boxer and Senator Smith have worked. \nAt that time, we will be in a position to determine what is going to \nhappen thereafter. We have had conversations. Senator Thompson has an \namendment he wishes to offer today or on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object one more second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make the point that Senator Smith and I are \nanxious to move forward on our amendment. We are working with Senator \nFeinstein on an amendment that she would like to offer by UC which, if \nit is in the spirit of what we discussed, would be fine with us. We do \nhope we can move forward.\n  Talk about homeland security, 9/11, planes being hijacked and pilots \nand flight attendants being essentially helpless--we want to change \nthat. We are going to stay here and push hard to try to get a vote on \nthat before the end of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object, as I understand it, \nSenator Gramm will speak first. Then I will have the opportunity to \nspeak and then Senator Lieberman. Does the Senator from Minnesota want \nadditional time?\n  Mr. REID. Under the agreement I just stated, he has 20 minutes if he \nwishes to use it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. First? First meaning immediately, right now, before \nSenator Gramm?\n  Mr. REID. After the vote. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Just so everyone understands--and I am sure they do--the \nSenator from Minnesota will send his modification to the desk. At that \ntime, we will vote in relation to the Wellstone amendment. Following \nthat, Senator Wellstone will speak. Then the lineup will be what was \nenunciated before, all in relation to the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4490, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a technical modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the modification is \naccepted.\n  The amendment (No. 4490), as modified, is as follows:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE \n                   EXPATRIATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may not enter into any \n     contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is

the case of an acquisition with respect to a \n     domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic \n     partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits \n     interest in the domestic partnership, and\n       (3) the expanded affiliated group which after the \n     acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial \n     business activities in the foreign country in which or under \n     the law of which the entity is created or organized when \n     compared to the total business activities of such expanded \n     affiliated group.\n       (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this \n     section--\n       (1) Rules for application of subsection (b).--In applying \n     subsection (b) for purposes of subsection (a), the following \n     rules

a domestic corporation \n     or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date \n     which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of \n     subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as \n     pursuant to a plan.\n       (C) Certain transfers disregarded.--The transfer of \n     properties or liabilities (including by contribution or \n     distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part \n     of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the \n     purposes of this section.\n       (D) Special rule for related partnerships.--For purposes of \n     applying subsection (b) to the acquisition of a domestic \n     partnership, except as provided in regulations, all \n     partnerships which are under common control (within the \n

percent'' each place it \n     appears.\n       (3) Foreign incorporated entity.--The term ``foreign \n     incorporated entity'' means any entity which is, or but for \n     subsection (b) would be, treated as a foreign corporation for \n     purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (4) Other definitions.--The terms ``person'', ``domestic'', \n     and ``foreign'' have the meanings given such terms by \n     paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.\n       (d) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) with \n     respect to any specific contract if the President certifies \n     to Congress that the waiver is required in the interest of \n     national security.\n       This section shall take effect one day after the date of \n     this bill's enactment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the second-degree \namendment No. 4490, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4490), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the first-degree\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\namendment No. 4486, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4486) as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, that I am very pleased this amendment has been accepted. A \ngood part of this is in a similar amendment passed in the House. This \nwill be part of the law of this homeland defense bill.\n  Maybe I will take up all my time; maybe I should reserve some time to \nrespond. I am interested in what my colleagues, Senators Thompson and \nGramm, say about the amendment. Let me explain briefly to other \nSenators why I have done this.\n  We did this on the Department of Defense appropriations bill. That \nwas only for 1 year. We offered an amendment yesterday that would bar \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security from entering into contracts with \nU.S. companies that give up their U.S. citizenship to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  I will give an example. It is a small story that I think tells a \nlarger story. This is the story of Tyco. We heard all about Tyco \nInternational. They saved $400 million in taxes last year by chartering \nits base in Bermuda.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about a month ago \nthat suggested actually these savings might have helped the company buy \nCEO Dennis Kozlowski's $19 million home in Boca Raton and a $6,000 \nshower curtain for his place in Manhattan. They have received $220 \nmillion in Government contracts. I guess the question is whether or not \nany of that was used to pay for the shower curtain.\n  This amendment, and the reason I have been focused on no Federal \ncontracts for expatriates, is all about corporate reform. It is an \negregious practice when these companies set up sham headquarters in \ncountries such as Bermuda.\n  They have no staff. They have no operation. Not only do they not end \nup paying taxes on foreign profits but they can also take the profit in \nour own country and then cook the books and move it overseas to Bermuda \nor wherever else. It is not all that patriotic. It means a lot of other \nbusinesses, large and small, in my State of Minnesota and the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Rhode Island get the short end of the stick.\n  Most of the large and small businesses in Minnesota, Rhode Island, \nand around the country would never do this. They would not do it, even \nif they had the lawyers and the accountants to tell them how, because \nthey would not believe it was the right thing to do if they could do \nit. A lot of smaller businesses would never have the lawyers and the \naccountants to tell them how to do it.\n  If these companies are going to renounce their citizenship and engage \nin this kind of egregious behavior and not pay their fair share of \ntaxes, it seems to me that is fine. Renounce their citizenship and they \ndo not get any more Government contracts. It is that simple.\n  By the way, I do not think the companies that are good corporate \ncitizens, that do not engage in any of this sham activity, should be \npenalized. Why should they end up being penalized in bidding for the \ncontracts because they are paying their fair share of taxes or even \nmore because other companies are engaged in this tax avoidance? Why \nshould they be penalized for doing the right thing, which is to stay in \nour country? That is what is going on right now.\n  We have a situation where former U.S. companies that have renounced \ntheir citizenship currently hold about $2 billion worth of contracts \nwith the Federal Government. This amendment has now passed the Senate, \nand it is now in the House bill, so it is going to become a part of \nlaw. So they are not going to be able to do that anymore.\n  These Bermuda companies have no staff, have no offices, have no \nbusiness activity. The only thing they are trying to do is shield \nincome and not pay their fair share of taxes. These are Enron-like \nschemes involving sham loans and other income transfers that allow \nthese companies to reduce their U.S. taxes on U.S. source income, \nincluding income from Government contracts. It is called earnings \nstripping.\n  I am pleased with this amendment, and I want people to know about \nthis because it has now passed the Senate. If a company reincorporates \nin a foreign country and 50 percent or more of the shareholders of the \nnew foreign corporation are the same as the shareholders of the old \nU.S. company, then they do not get to contract with the Homeland \nSecurity Agency, and if the company does not have any substantial \nbusiness activity in its foreign home. That is the two-part test. This \nis actually the two-part test in the Grassley-Baucus tax bill, and I \nthank them for their superb work.\n  There are many sacrifices people are making today. The only sacrifice \nthis amendment asks of Federal contractors is that they pay their fair \nshare of taxes like everybody else.\n  I say to my colleagues, I know we had a debate last time when I did \nthis on the DOD appropriations bill. About 99 percent of the people in \nMinnesota in coffee shops would say: Absolutely. If these companies \nwant to do this kind of tax avoidance, then they should not be getting \nthe Government contracts. I think people are tired of this kind of \negregious corporate behavior.\n  My second point: I am very proud of the fact that the vast majority \nof businesses in Minnesota and in our country do not engage in this \nkind of behavior. I do not want to see them put at any kind of \ncompetitive disadvantage because they do the right thing.\n\n  My third point: I think this is good public policy. I know last time \nin the debate some of my colleagues said it is a great thing to do, it \nis a good, populace thing to do, and people are going to be for it--in \nfact, I think that is why we had a voice vote, because a lot of people \ndo not want to vote against it--but it is not good public policy. There \nare two Senators in the Chamber who are probably going to say that. \nThey are going to say that in good faith, and they are going to marshal \nevidence for their point of view.\n  I have watched them both. Both of them are going to be retiring, and, \nfrankly, though I do not always agree with one of them and I never \nagree with the other one, both of them have made the Senate a much \nbetter place. So I am not arguing that there is not a place for honest, \nintellectual disagreement.\n  From my point of view, it is good public policy. There is no reason \nin the world that these companies should be able to engage in this kind \nof egregious behavior. It is a big scam. There is no reason in the \nworld that other businesses and other people should end up having to \npay more taxes, and there is certainly no reason in the world that the \nvast majority of U.S. companies, that play by the rules of the game, \nstay in our country and do not engage in this kind of tax avoidance, \nshould be at any kind of disadvantage.\n  I am glad the Senate has passed this amendment. I cannot overstate \nits importance. This is part of maybe the new look in the Senate. The \nSarbanes bill was a powerful step forward. It took some jarring events \nto get that bill out of committee, but all of a sudden people started \nrealizing we have to deal with some of these scandals, we have to deal \nwith some of these abuses.\n  We are going to have a pension bill on the floor soon. That is going \nto be part of this. I am really glad the Senate has now passed this \namendment because I think this is all about dealing with these kinds of \ncorporate abuses. This is all about corporate accountability, and this \nis all about reform.\n  I am very proud of the fact the Senate has accepted the amendment, \nand I thank my colleagues for doing so.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Johnson and Senator Harkin as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment is a perfect example, if one \ngoes around doing surveys to decide on public policy, of how far afield \nfrom logic and reality and good sense one can get.\n  Let me try to make a couple of points. If someone wants to get a \ngood,\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nrousing round of applause in front of any group, stand up and say \ncompanies that are domiciled in the United States that change their \ndomicile to any other country should not be able to do business with \nthe Federal Government. They will get applause every time.\n  I wonder if one is going to get the applause when they explain to \npeople that for the entire history of America, companies born in other \ncountries have moved their domicile to America because we have had a \nbetter business climate.\n  Secondly, let me make it clear that these are private businesses. \nThis is private property.\n  Another point: we sell about 80 to 90 percent of all defense and \nsecurity goods sold in the world. They are produced by American \ncompanies, by American workers. The vast majority of those companies \nare domiciled in the United States, although not all of them. Why in \nthe world we should be saying to the various parliaments and congresses \naround the world--some of whom may be having similar debates about why \nshould they buy goods for their government that are produced by \nAmericans when they can produce inferior goods at higher cost at home--\nwhy we should be picking this fight, I do not understand.\n  Finally, the world must think we have gone mad. We are the country \nthat has drawn capital and business and literally created a brain drain \nin the world as people have voluntarily chosen to come to America and \nbring their wealth and bring their genius. They have helped make us the \ngreatest country in the history of the world, but now the greatest \ndeliberative body on Earth is trying to punish people who want to move \nthe domicile, the headquarters, of their company, to another country? \nIf I have ever seen logic in history turned on its head for political \nreasons, this is it.\n  This bill is not prospective. It does not make any sense. What about \na company that was born in America and in 1812 decided that most of its \nbusiness was in Britain? Now, we have to understand, Britain is the \nlargest investor in the United States of America and they are investing \ntens of billions of dollars in our country every day. But we will say, \nbecause a company in 1812 decided it could operate its business better \nby having the headquarters in London, but the ownership of the company \ndid not change, that we are not going to let them do business with the \nFederal Government?\n\n  Finally, this is simply a sign of a logic that is very dangerous; \nthat is, this logic that somehow this is America against the world, and \npeople are trying to get their businesses out of America, get their \nwealth out of America, and we have to stop them. For the long history \nof America, the preponderance of movement has been into our country, \nnot out of it. Do we want other countries to be passing laws to prevent \nbusinesses from moving to America? I don't think so.\n  In the Finance Committee today, there was an effort to mark up a \nbill--and people will think this is a joke, but it is the truth--that \nsaid if you own property and you want to leave America and you want to \ngo become a citizen in Ireland or Germany or Argentina, we will act as \nif you have sold your property, and you have to pay a tax to the \nAmerican Government before you leave. Now, forgive me, but that is \nright out of Nazi Germany. I don't understand, when people are trying \nto bring wealth to America every day, when we have been a net gainer \nfrom people moving capital for over 200 years, why all of a sudden we \nare passing laws that sound as if they are right out of Nazi Germany.\n  The idea that somebody cannot leave America and take their property \nwith them, that they have to pay a tax in order to get their property \nout of America--forgive me, but that rings of another era and another \nsystem, a system that I hated when I read about it as a schoolboy, and \nI still hate it.\n  Look, it is good politics to bash on companies that are increasingly \ninternational. Many of these companies end up with more American \nemployees by relocating their headquarters than they would have \notherwise. It is very good politics to say: We are going to show them. \nMove your headquarters out of America, or if you did it in 1812, you \ncan't do business with the government. It is good politics, but it is \nterrible public policy.\n  We have probably, over the 200 years with active commerce in America, \ngained 100 companies domiciling in America for every one that has gone \nin the other direction. Do we really want to create an economic war \nwhere companies say, if you ever open a headquarters in our country, \nyou can never move it anywhere else? Do we want that to happen to \ncompanies that want to come and locate in Texas? I don't think so. So, \nboy, you can get a great, rousing applause--probably even the Rotary \nClub would applause this--until they understood what you were talking \nabout.\n  We took this amendment because people do not want to vote on it. I am \nhappy to vote on it. This is a bad policy. It is a wrongheaded policy \nthat is basically counter to everything we believe in as a nation. If \nyou do not want to live in America, I just as soon you leave. If you \nwant to take your property, great, go to it.\n  Now, the fact that for the whole history of America, property and \npeople have been coming our direction, that does not change the fact \nyou either believe in freedom or you do not. But to start saying, in \norder to sell us a good--even if your product is better, even if your \nproduct would save lives, even if your product would save money, if \nanyone cares about saving money--that you cannot sell it to us if, in \n1812 you were domiciled in Boston and you moved to London and you did \nnot change your ownership by moving. People make business decisions for \nbusiness reasons. Part of what economic freedom is about is the ability \nof people to move their money and to move their labor by moving \nthemselves.\n\n  It is great to get rousing applause. It is wonderful. I don't doubt \nthat 90 percent of the people in Minnesota would be for it. I am not \ncriticizing Minnesota. I don't believe 90 percent of the people in \nTexas would be for it, but there may be. There may be. But whether it \nis 90 percent or 100 percent, you either believe in freedom or you do \nnot.\n  And I must stand up and speak out when, for over 200 years, people \nhave been bringing their businesses to America, bringing wealth to \nAmerica. We had almost $100 billion of wealth coming to America \nannually in the 1990s. Why we are suddenly passing laws saying you \ncannot go in the other direction? The problem with that is, if you \ncannot take it out, you will not bring it in.\n  One of the reasons I am being so hard on the Senator from Minnesota \nis this amendment we had in the Finance Committee today. I am sure \nsomebody can defend it and say: People ought to pay taxes. We want \ntheir taxes. We want their money. We do not want them to take their \nmoney out of America.\n  Look, it is their money. It is a free country. Being a free country \ndoes not mean that you can do business with the Government if you do \nwhat the Government wants you to do. Freedom means you can do whatever \nyou want to do. If people want to move their businesses, they ought to \nhave a right to do it. If people want to take their money, their \nwealth, and move to France--I don't know why in the world anyone would \nwant to do that--but if they do, my basic position is, God bless them \nand let them go. For every person that does that, there will be three \npeople from France who want to move their wealth here.\n  Good applause. Great political issue. You could run a dynamite \npolitical spot on this: Old Joe Jones voted to let people move their \nbusinesses out of America and that cost us tax revenue. Yet he let them \nsell to the Homeland Security Department.\n  To me, that is what freedom is about.\n  This is bad policy coming on the same day as this Finance Committee \nbill that would force you to act as if you sold your property when you \nwant to leave America, to pay a tax. God forbid this should be the \npolicy of the United States of America. And it is not going to be. This \namendment is not going to become law. I intend to work very hard to see \nit doesn't. I don't believe it will.\n  Again, nobody wants to vote against it. Everybody is going to applaud \nit, but in the end, some logic is going to prevail. When for 200 years \npeople have been bringing wealth here, moving\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nbusinesses here, why we want to prevent people from going in the other \ndirection is beyond my comprehension, other than we are going to get a \nbig applause in doing it. Applause is a poor reason to have public \npolicy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take just 2 minutes, and I know the Senator \nfrom Tennessee will speak. I assume I have a little bit of time.\n  The fact is, this will become law. It will be in this bill. It will \nstay in this bill. The House passed a similar provision.\n  I will say a couple things to my colleague from Texas. I appreciate \nwhat he said, although I think a lot of it did not describe this \namendment. This is not about buy America, or about business moving. It \nis basically about going after tax cheats. It is about people paying \ntheir fair share of taxes. Frankly, as long as we are going to talk \nabout freedom--\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Nothing in this amendment talks about taxes. This \namendment says if you redomicile without changing half your ownership, \nthat you can't sell the products in America.\n  You are assuming that if I move my business to France that I did it \nfor tax reasons. I may do it for some other reason. I may just do it \nbecause I like French food.\n  So you are acting as if the only reason people do this is for taxes. \nAnd, even if that were the case, that wouldn't change my opinion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No, I would say to my colleague--I appreciate it and I \nwill finish up--I know I will not change his opinion. I am well aware \nof that. I will just tell you the Senate Finance Committee did a pretty \nthorough investigation of this, and we know very well that these \ncompanies have engaged in what I think is blatant tax avoidance. We \nknow they set up these sham companies that don't have personnel there \nor they do not do any business there. We know they avoid paying taxes, \nincluding actually transferring some of the money they made in this \ncountry to avoid taxes. It is Enron-like schemes.\n  You talked about freedom. I am free, as a United States Senator, to \nintroduce a piece of legislation that says we go after these tax cheats \nand they should pay their fair share of taxes. I am free, as a Senator \nfrom the State of Minnesota, to represent the people of my State and do \nso, and that is what I have done and this amendment passed and that is \na fact.\n  Frankly, when my colleague says: Well, the only reason it passed is \nbecause it is just a popular thing to do, so Senators really would not \nhave voted against it, that is quite an indictment of the Senate. I \nwould have thought if the majority of Senators believed this was bad \npublic policy, they would have been out here to oppose it--or at least \nsome of them would have. I have to believe the majority believed it was \ngood public policy. Otherwise I don't think it would have passed. I \ndon't assume Senators are afraid to come and debate and are afraid to \nexpress their viewpoint and are afraid to oppose a policy if they don't \nthink it is a good public policy. If that is the case, it is a sad \ncommentary.\n  As my colleague knows, I would have been pleased to debate anybody \nbecause I think this is absolutely the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have other business to attend to, so I \nam not going to belabor this. Let me make my point. Nothing in this \namendment has anything to do with or says anything about tax cheating. \nThis amendment would apply to a company that moved from the United \nStates to Great Britain in 1812.\n  The Finance Committee did not do any great deliberation in coming up \nwith this amendment. It was a pay-for, something to create money they \nwanted to spend, and it seemed like a popular thing to do. Let's not \ndeceive ourselves into thinking any great thought was behind it. And \nanybody who does not understand that amendments pass every day in the \nSenate that everybody hopes and believes will end up dying somewhere in \nsome dark corner somewhere--where much of God's work is done, by the \nway--then I don't think they understand the reality of politics.\n  So I just stand by the following points: First, this amendment has \nnothing to do with taxes. This amendment is punitive to companies that \nmay have started in America, may still employ 90 percent of their \npeople in America but are now domiciled abroad; that is, they call \nanother country their economic home. The incredible paradox of the \namendment is that for every American company that has moved abroad, 100 \nhave moved to America over the last 200 years.\n  Look, it is going to be on this bill. It is in the House bill. But I \ndo not believe it is going to become law.\n  Second, I want to make the point that we are going to end up hurting \nAmerica in the capital markets of the world if we keep this business \nup. If we had our major trading partners pass and enforce a similar \nlaw, we would lose 100 or maybe 1,000 companies that are coming here \nfor every one we are preventing going there. This is not smart.\n  Third, I just have to raise this provision considered by the Finance \nCommittee, which is based on the same logic: How dare anybody move out \nof America and take anything with them? My God, for over 200 years, \npeople have moved from Asia and Europe and South America and \neverywhere, and they brought wealth with them to America. The idea of \ntaxing people to get out of your country, the most dramatic example of \nthat I remember is Nazi Germany.\n  So I just ask people to please take a long, hard look at some of \nthese things we are doing. Some people think they won't actually become \nlaw. I hope not. But I do believe we are going to reach a point where \nwe are going to begin to do some harm. The people in the financial \nmarkets around the world must think we are crazy when they see these \nkinds of amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Wellstone for \nintroducing this important amendment to the homeland security bill.\n  Our international tax code currently has a loophole that allows U.S. \ncorporations to open shell companies in tax haven countries while \nenjoying all of the benefits of conducting business in the United \nStates without paying taxes. The Finance Committee has reported out a \nbill that temporarily addresses this very issue. I hope that in the \ncoming weeks we will debate and pass the Finance Committee bill.\n  The amendment currently before us prohibits the new homeland security \nagency from contracting with any corporate expatriate. I commend my \ncolleague for introducing this fair and very simple amendment. What \nthis amendment says is that if you are incorporated outside of the \nUnited States and do not have substantial business activities in the \nforeign country you are incorporated in, and if at least 50 percent of \nthe stock of the entity is held by former shareholders of the domestic \ncorporation or by former partners of the domestic partnership, you will \nnot be allowed to contract with the new homeland security agency.\n  Also, unlike previous discussions on this issue, Senator Wellstone's \namendment includes all inverted companies, so that there is no \ndifference between companies who have just inverted or have been \ninverted for 6 months or 6 years. This is plain and simple, and more \nimportantly, this is fair.\n  The U.S. government should not be in the business of contracting with \nU.S. based corporations that are avoiding their tax responsibilities by \nincorporating in offshore tax havens. Corporations have a right to \ndetermine where they should incorporate and what is best for their \nbusiness, just like we have a right to determine how hard earned U.S. \ntax dollars should be spent. I strongly believe that U.S. tax dollars \nshould not be spent in government contracts to companies that have \nexpatriated in order to avoid paying taxes.\n  Companies who are or will be affected by this amendment must \nunderstand that there are benefits and costs to the decisions they \nmake. This amendment, if adopted, will force corporations to include in \ntheir calculus\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\nthe fact that they may no longer be able to enjoy the earnings that are \nbrought to them through Government contracts if they incorporate off \nshore to avoid U.S. taxes. That may or may not alter management's \ndecision to move--management may decide that it does not matter that \nthe company will not be able to contract with the government. If this \nis the decision, so be it. But we should not perpetuate a system that \nputs companies that do pay U.S. taxes at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause their counterparts have less of a tax burden.\n  I represent the State where Stanley Works is located. Stanley Works \nhas a wonderful history and tradition in Connecticut, and so it was a \ngreat disappointment to many of us when they took steps towards \ninverting their company to Bermuda. Obviously Stanley Works executives \nweighed the benefits and costs to inverting the company and found that \nthe costs outweighed the benefits, and so I can speak on behalf of \nConnecticut when I say, that we are pleased that Stanley Works dropped \nits plan to reincorporate to Bermuda.\n\n  In FY 2001, Stanley Works had a total of $5.2 million of defense and \nhomeland security related Government contracts. Now that they are going \nto stay incorporated in the U.S., they would be put at an unfair \ndisadvantage if they have to compete with companies who also weighed \nthe cost and benefit, but decided that they are better off leaving the \nU.S. or remaining incorporated outside of the U.S.\n  The amendment currently before us takes away this unfair advantage. \nAnd so if companies like Ingersoll-Rand, Cooper Industries, and others \nare interested in continuing to contract with the Federal Government, \nthen all they have to do is come back.\n  To continue to contract with companies that have inverted, to \ncontinue to allow companies to engage in tax saving techniques not \navailable to most individual taxpayers and yet still be eligible for \nimportant and profitable government contracts, would in the words of \nthe Treasury Department, ``reduce confidence in the fairness of the tax \nsystem.''\n  U.S. companies that have decided to move offshore currently hold at \nleast $2 billion worth of contracts with the Federal Government. We \nhave a responsibility to ensure that these offshore shell companies are \nnot rewarded for turning their backs on America. And that is exactly \nwhat this Amendment does.\n  At a time when confidence in U.S. business practices is at an all \ntime low, when the country is engaged in foreign policy challenges, and \nwhen CBO is projecting lasting deficits until 2006 we cannot continue \nto condone this practice, and we surely cannot allow the Government to \ncontinue to allow this unfair loophole to continue. Offshore tax havens \nare a massive $200 billion loss of U.S. tax revenue that should stay in \nthe U.S. The 2002 U.S. deficit is expected to be at $157 billion--a \ndeficit that would be closed were these offshore companies to pay their \nfair share of taxes.\n  I think that we can agree that we must address the problems in our \nflawed international tax code which is obviously in need of reform. \nThere are problems with the fact that the tax code is currently putting \nAmerican companies at a competitive disadvantage by taxing income from \ntheir overseas operations while other nations do not tax income earned \nabroad. But what we need to do is work together to change the law and \nnot just abandon ship and reincorporate. And so while we work on making \nchanges to the tax code, it is important that we do not disadvantage \nthose companies who remain in the U.S. by also awarding contracts to \nthose who have left. That is why I am pleased that this amendment \npassed the Senate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is right. This is \na significant change in procurement policy. The Senate Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, which has jurisdiction over Federal procurement \npolicy, has not had a single hearing to consider this issue and the \nimpact it will have on the procurement process.\n  I think at the outset it ought to be observed that it is very unfair \nto publicly accuse a company of being a tax cheat when they have not \nviolated one single law, rule, or regulation of the United States. I \nhave been informed since this discussion has been going on that one of \nthe many unintended consequences, probably, and potentially unintended \nresults, is one involving a company called Intelsat.\n  If we are going to prohibit companies from dealing with the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, why limit it to the Department of \nHomeland Security? Let's prohibit them from doing business with--I \nguess, the closest comparable department would be the Department of \nDefense. But the Department of Defense uses satellites of Intelsat.\n  I do not know the extent of the traffic, but I think it is \nsignificant, and I know it is important to the national security of \nthis country. Intelsat is a Bermuda company, and it is an inversion. \nThat is the sort of thing we are dealing with, if thoughtful people \nthink this thing through before we finish up this process.\n  Another result of this amendment would be to allow foreign companies \nthat have always been foreign companies to be able to bid on Department \nof Homeland Security contracts. But it would preclude foreign companies \nthat have at one time in the past been headquartered in the United \nStates from bidding on those contracts, even if the work would be \nperformed in the United States by American workers.\n  So if you have always been foreign, you can deal with the Federal \nGovernment. But if at one time, at any time in your past history you \nwere an American company, you can't. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  I am also concerned that this amendment might violate our trade \nobligations because it is discriminatory against certain foreign-based \ncompanies. If we were to enact the amendment, what would be the \nunintended results? I am concerned we would be giving governments an \nexcuse to ban U.S. companies from bidding on foreign contracts, when we \nhave been fighting to get foreign governments to open their procurement \nprocess to U.S. companies.\n  Denying a company the ability to be awarded Federal contracts based \nsolely on the location of its headquarters represents a significant \nchange in Federal procurement policy and counteracts years of work to \nstreamline the Federal acquisition process. If we begin to use Federal \ncontracts as leverage against potential contractors, the system will \ninevitably become highly politicized and the goal of obtaining the best \nvalue on Government contracts will no longer be a priority; It will be \na political football, where the procurement process will turn into an \nattempt to punish our enemies and reward our friends instead of trying \nto get the best deal for the Government--which, of course, is the best \ndeal for the taxpayer, who the proponents of this amendment claim they \nare looking out for.\n  Government contracts are not gifts. Federal contractors face a \nburdensome process full of redtape, paperwork, and unique Government \nregulatory requirements. That is why it can be difficult to get \nmultiple companies to even bid on a contract.\n  We have attempted to streamline this process in recent years in order \nto increase competition, to save taxpayers money, but restrictions such \nas this discourage companies from bidding in the first place. We do not \nwant to end up in a situation where DHS has to rely on sole-source \nvendors because we prohibit the Department from contracting with an \ninverted corporation. The least we could do is provide the Secretary \nwith the authority to waive the ban in order to ensure competition in \nthe bidding process. That procurement bar is a serious sanction, \nreserved only for egregious conduct such as fraud or criminal offenses \nin connection with obtaining the contract or performing a public \ncontract.\n  What is important to Government procurement officials when evaluating \na contract bid is not where the bidding company is headquartered. They \nlook at where the work is to be done, whether the company will do a \ngood job, and whether the bid is cost effective.\n  Whether or not you believe corporate inversions should be prohibited, \nthe fact of the matter is that inversion transactions are legal under \nthe current tax laws. Because the amendment\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\nis retroactive, it would bar companies that have engaged in legal \nbehavior--an inversion--from bidding on DHS contracts. The inversion \ncould have occurred a year ago or 10 years ago. Either way, these \ncompanies had no way of knowing that they could be banned from bidding \non federal contracts if they inverted.\n  This amendment's definition of an inversion is problematic, because \nit would snag any company that inverted at any time if 50 percent of \nthe shareholders are the same before and after the inversion. This \namendment would not just go after the sham transactions that are \ntargeted by the Finance Committee bill. It would also catch companies \nthat engaged in inversion transactions for legitimate business reasons. \nThe Finance Committee-reported bill has an 80 percent shareholder test, \nwhich is intended to target the most egregious transactions.\n  It is important to note that these companies do and will pay U.S. tax \non the income earned from their government contracts regardless of \nwhether they are headquartered in the U.S.\n  The amendment does not address the root cause of corporate \ninversions, which is our highly complex foreign tax regime that taxes \ncompanies on a worldwide basis. U.S. tax laws put domestic companies at \na distinct disadvantage relative to their foreign competitors who are \ntaxed on a territorial basis.\n  That is the heart of the problem. That is the root cause, and that is \nwhat we ought to be addressing.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I could have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is very gracious of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  I just wanted to say again that I appreciate the remarks of both of \nmy colleagues. I did want to address one point that was made by my \ncolleague from Texas, which is to say this won't become law when almost \nthe identical provision was passed in the House and the Senate has \nagreed to it. I believe the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee is committed to it. I believe there are many people in the \nHouse who are as well.\n  I will tell you one other thing. The public is committed to this as \nwell. There are going to be a lot of people looking at the conference \ncommittee. The only time I get feisty is when there is an implication: \nOh, well, you know we don't want to go on record because we are afraid \nto oppose it, which I think is unfair implication. I think it is bad \npublic policy. They come out here and say: We will just knock it out in \nthe conference committee; never mind that the vast majority of people \nthink, of course, this is about tax avoidance; of course, we know what \nwe are doing. Don't worry about that because it will be business as \nusual. We will just go to the conference committee and knock it out.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that I believe there are many Senators \nand representatives in that conference committee who will make sure \nthat doesn't happen. I sure will be monitoring this. It will become \nlaw. It is not going away. We will not be back to the business of \nhelping these corporations with all their egregious behavior and \nthinking they can get away with it. It doesn't work that way any \nlonger. It is a new world. People do not stand for that kind of \negregious behavior.\n  That is the standard of ordinary citizens and good public policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak in favor of the amendment that the \nSenator from Minnesota has introduced, which has been adopted, as \namended. I want to say to him that not only do I support it personally, \nbut as the manager of this bill and as chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, from which the underlying bill has emerged, when we \ngo into conference on this bill with the House, I will naturally have \nin mind not only my personal support of the Senator's amendment but the \nfact that the Senate has adopted the amendment by voice vote \nunanimously. I will be pledged to do everything I can to keep it in the \nultimate conference report, particularly since the House has adopted a \nsimilar amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on this. I think the Senator \nhas done something that is important and that is just. He attached this \nto a bill on homeland security. But it responds to a broader problem. \nIt does, in a sense, touch the same spirit of patriotism that we \ngenerally responded to after the events of September 11 which \nengendered the basic bill before us. It is this notion that a \nsignificant number of American businesses that have been born and grown \nup here, benefitted from all the opportunities that America provides, \ndecided to wriggle their way out of the taxes and locate offshore to \navoid paying taxes to the United States of America. This is just wrong. \nIt is like so much else that is going on around it.\n  Unfortunately, more than a few of our biggest companies have chosen \nto incorporate overseas and thereby avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  Evidently, these companies have asked themselves if it is legal \ninstead of asking if it is right or wrong. They have had some lawyers \nor accountants tell them it is legal to do this. Legality isn't the \nonly standard for what is right and wrong.\n  It seems to me that a company that has grown up in America and that \nhas benefitted from American workers and all that America does to \ncreate a climate for enterprise, economic growth, and markets for goods \nand services that are provided ought to, as an act of citizenship, even \nthough it might not be illegal to go offshore, as an act of citizenship \npay its fair share of taxes.\n  My dad was a small businessman. He did well as he went along. I \nalways remember, it makes me think that I was raised in an age longer \nago than it was. In fact, my dad used to say: I never complain about \npaying taxes because the taxes I pay are the price I pay as a \nbusinessman for doing business in this country, for the extraordinary \nnot only blessings of liberty that America gives, but as part of that, \nthe blessings of economic opportunity that are allowed me--dad never \nwent to college--to start this business and be able to make enough \nmoney to send my kids to college and graduate school.\n  That ethic, which is still shared by the great majority of businesses \nin our country, including particularly, may I say, small businesses \nthat don't have the wherewithal to kind of wriggle their way through \nthe legal system, is not reflected as often in the actions that we have \nseen documented so well.\n  I share the view of many of my colleagues that we should close the \ntax loophole to prevent companies from further irresponsible behavior. \nThat is the most direct way to address the problem. But I also support \nthis amendment, which sends a simple and profound message: if you don't \nwant to participate as U.S. citizens and pay your fair share of taxes, \nthen don't expect to make billions of dollars of profits from U.S. \ngovernment contracts that are paid with the tax dollars of Americans \nwho pay their fair share in taxes.\n  My State of Connecticut has some recent history on this issue--\nhistory with a happy ending--that I would like to relate to the Senate. \nBack in May, StanleyWorks, a proud company based in New Britain, wanted \nto pack its corporate bags and reconstitute in Bermuda. And not because \nits executives wanted to try driving on the left side of the road. It \nwas because some of its leadership decided it would be nice to avoid \npaying taxes to the United States of America.\n  It is sad and ironic, when you think about it. This company was \nfounded in ``New Britain''--a name that calls to mind our roots as 13 \ncolonies that broke away from the mother country because she tried to \ntax us from afar without giving us the rights, representation, and \nrespect that we deserved. And here was a New Britain-based company \nthinking of setting up a shell in Bermuda to avoid paying taxes even \nthough it is in every other way a full-fledged citizen of our United \nStates.\n  StanleyWorks started in 1843 when an enterprising businessman named \nFrederick Trent Stanley set up a small\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nshop to make door bolts and other hardware from wrought iron. It was \none of dozens of small foundries and other backyard industries in town \nstruggling to make a go of it by turning out metal products--but \nStanley had a special innovative spirit and an uncommon passion for \ndoing things right. So, as often happens in America, what began as a \nmodest enterprise prospered and grew.\n  To see this company so willing to scrap its proud history and proud \npresence in my State, and to see similar things happening around the \ncountry, really got me angry. It got a lot of us angry. And with good \nreason. Thousands and thousands of hardworking small businesses like \nthe business my father owned and operated, and thousands of \ncorporations, contribute to America every single day--not only the way \nthat all businesses do, by producing jobs for Americans--but also by \npaying their fair share of taxes. Meanwhile, other companies have the \ngall to look for a clever way to fatten their bottom line and get an \nedge over their competitors who play by the rules.\n  That is why in May I cosponsored the bill by Senators Baucus and \nGrassley to close the tax loophole that Stanley attempted to exploit, \nand supported adding to that bill a provision preventing overseas tax \ndodgers from competing for or receiving federal contracts.\n  I am proud that at least in my State, at least with StanleyWorks, a \nlittle bit of shame seemed to have an effect. StanleyWorks decided not \nto go overseas after all. They made the right decision, and I \nappreciate it.\n  But other corporations are still busy relinquishing their American \ncitizenship and, in the process, relinquishing their good corporate \ncitizenship in the very same act. Mr. President, when you wriggle out \nof taxes you wriggle out of responsibility. When you evade the basic \nrequirements that everybody else meets, you erode our common bonds as a \ncommunity. It may seem to make sense for individual companies at first \nwhen they're viewing through the narrow and amoral blinders of the \nbottom line, but it's downright destructive for American society as a \nwhole.\n  And I must say, in the end it may not help a company's bottom line \neither, and this amendment helps make that clear. The fact is, when a \ncompany thumbs its nose at the country that gives it the opportunity to \nprosper, it loses credibility. It loses trust. It loses respect. It \nloses customers. And, yes, though it may seem that way based on the \ninitial calculations of the CFO, it loses money.\n  Good ethics make good business. This amendment leaves no doubt about \nthat fact. The border, in this case, is the line between right and \nwrong. We in Congress have to draw that line--to say that if you cross \nit, you will not be eligible for Federal contracts. Plain and simple.\n  In the context of Homeland Security, these actions seem even more \nunsavory. If a U.S. company wants to bid for work to defend the \nhomeland--work that is being paid for in the tax dollars of its \ncustomers, among others--how can that company not even pledge \nallegiance, in the most basic fiscal sense, to the United States of \nAmerica?\n  This measure that the Senator from Minnesota has attached is right on \ntarget. It says if an American-based company is not willing to pay \ntaxes to America, they ought not to receive contracts through the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security that we are establishing in this bill, \nwhich after all are contracts that will be paid for by taxes paid by \nAmerican companies. To me, that seems to be elementary fairness.\n  So I close with a quote from Paul Krugman of the New York Times, \nwhich I think says it well, when he wrote:\n\n       [T]he trouble is that hinting, even by silence, that it's \n     O.K. not to pay taxes is a dangerous game. . . . Accountants \n     and tax planners have taken the hint; they now believe that \n     it's safe to push the envelope. . . . Furthermore, what does \n     it say to the nation when companies that are proud to stay \n     American are punished, while companies that are willing to \n     fly a flag of convenience are rewarded?\n\n  That is what this amendment is all about and why I was pleased to \nsupport it on the voice vote and why I intend to work with all the \nstrength and skill I have in the conference committee to make sure it \nis part of the final conference report that comes back to the Senate \nwith this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think under the unanimous consent request \nI have 20 minutes to speak on the bill. We have been talking about the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota, and I had yet to get the 20 \nminutes. I think maybe the Senator from California was under the \nimpression that I had spoken before that debate but----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It was my understanding, in the unanimous consent \nagreement Senator Reid propounded, that Senator Gramm would have a \ntotal of 20 minutes, which he could use either to speak on the \nWellstone amendment or more generally on the bill.\n  I see Senator Reid in the Chamber. Perhaps he can clarify.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I thought you were going to speak 20 minutes on the \nWellstone amendment, and then Senator Wellstone would speak for 20 \nminutes, and then 20 minutes for the two managers. But if you want to \nspeak on the bill, that certainly is your right.\n  The thing is, we have been waiting to finish this Smith-Boxer \namendment. We would like to get that done. But if you have the \nunderstanding that you were to speak for 40 minutes----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, probably we could move everything along by \nmy just starting and trying to be expeditious. I speak slowly, so I \nwill try not to repeat myself.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has the floor, and he has the right. I would \njust indicate to everyone, we are going to have a vote sometime this \nafternoon on the Smith-Boxer amendment. Everyone has agreed that would \ntake place. So everyone should understand that after the Senator from \nTexas completes his statement, Senator Boxer will modify her amendment \nto meet a couple of the objections that were raised, and then she will \nspeak, Senator Smith will speak, and maybe even Senator Hollings will \ncome and speak.\n  So I would estimate that probably at around 4:30 or thereabouts we \ncould have a vote on the Smith amendment. I think that would be all of \nthe legislation on this bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have started the debate on homeland \nsecurity, and one of the things that has struck me is that while we \nhave talked about the President's request for flexibility--about his \nability, in a national emergency, to override collective bargaining \nagreements--the debate, to this point, has basically been in the \nabstract. So while it does not make for a pretty speech, I would like \nto try to get specific this afternoon for 20 minutes and try to give \nsome concrete examples as to what this debate is about.\n  The President has said that in order to protect the American \nhomeland, he needs the ability to put the right person in the right \nplace at the right time, and that he also needs the ability to move or \nremove people who are not capable of doing the job that needs to be \ndone in order to protect our country, its people, its property.\n  I would like to just note the following things on this issue. No. 1, \nthis is not a new concern. In 1984, the Grace Commission stated:\n\n       The lack of integration of the INS, the Border Patrol, and \n     the Customs Service would lead to security breakdowns.\n\n  That was the Grace Commission in 1983.\n  Does anybody doubt when INS approved a visa for two of the people who \nflew airplanes into the World Trade Center, after their pictures and \nnames have been on every television station and every front page of \nevery newspaper in the world, that the concern expressed by the Grace \nCommission in 1983 has been borne out?\n  In 1989, the Volcker Commission, on the National Commission on Public \nService, concluded:\n\n       The current system----\n\n  They are talking about our system of hiring, firing, and promoting.\n\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\n\n       The current system is slow, it is legally trampled, and \n     intellectually confusing. It is impossible to explain to \n     potential candidates. It is almost certainly not fit for \n     filling the spirit of our mandate to hire the most \n     meritorious candidates.\n\n  Does anybody doubt that the young lady who was an FBI agent who tried \nto warn headquarters that we had suspected terrorists taking lessons on \nflying planes but not on landing them should have been promoted and \ngiven a raise? I think the concerns of the Volcker Commission in 1989 \nhave been borne out.\n  And then the U.S. Commission on National Security, chaired by our \ndear friend and former colleague, Warren Rudman, stated:\n\n       An agile, flexible personnel system is required for us to \n     have a successful defense of the American homeland.\n\n  We can debate whether the current system is flexible enough, but let \nme just let the facts speak for themselves. And they are pretty simple \nfacts.\n  Mr. President, 1,800,000 people worked for the Federal Government in \nthe year 2000--1,800,000. How many do you think were fired because they \nwere incapable of doing their job? With 1,800,000 people working for \nthe Federal Government, how many of them do you think lost their job \nbecause they were not getting it done? The answer: 6.\n  In 2001, how many Government employees do you think lost their job \nout of 1.8 million because they were not getting the job done? The \nanswer: 3.\n  Does anybody believe that all but three Federal employees in all of \nAmerica, in every agency combined, would have met the standards of the \nprivate sector to keep their job? I do not think so.\n  Only 500 people out of the 1.8 million people who worked for the \nFederal Government were demoted in the year 2000 for lack of \nperformance. Only 600 were denied pay raises.\n  Think about that. The vast majority of people who got bad ratings--\nover 99 percent of the people who work for the Federal Government who \nwere given failing grades on their evaluations--got automatic pay \nincreases with the Federal Government. No wonder two-thirds of Federal \nworkers, in independent polls that have been conducted, believe that \npoor performers are not adequately disciplined. Further, nearly half of \nall Federal workers believe that job performance has little or nothing \nto do with a chance for promotion.\n  It seems to me when you look at these facts, the President is simply \nasking, in the area where life and death are at stake, to have greater \nflexibility in being sure we hire the right person; it does not take 6 \nmonths to do it; and if somebody is clearly not doing the job, that we \nat least move them out of these highly sensitive areas.\n  In listening to people who are defending workers instead of defending \nthe homeland, you get the idea that the President is proposing a \nwholesale rewriting of personnel laws.\n  I just want people to look at the facts and see that under the \nPresident's bill, only 6 of the 70 chapters in the Federal Registry \ngoverning the civil service system are modified, and none of them is \nrepealed.\n  Another area where people are wondering what are all these \npoliticians talking about is this whole area of collective bargaining. \nWhy, in this area of national security, in order to get a decision made \nand to get up our shield and to protect our people, does the President \nwant to be able to waive collective bargaining agreements on a \nselective basis?\n  I simply picked out 8 that are very different to give you examples of \nthe kind of problem you have in trying to make the Government work. \nPlease forgive my clumsiness in reading them, but they are pretty \nrevealing.\n  No. 1: Collective bargaining agreements can prohibit improvements to \nborder protection in inspection areas. Let me give an example. In 1987, \nthe Customs Service office at Logan Airport was renovated with a minor \nchange in the area where the baggage of international flight passengers \nwas inspected. The National Treasury Employees Union objected, saying \nthe renovation had to be part of a collective bargaining agreement. The \nFederal Labor Relations Authority ruled that the Customs Service could \nnot renovate its baggage inspection areas without a collective \nbargaining agreement.\n  Are we kidding? Are we going to put American lives at stake over \nchanging collective bargaining agreements so that we can upgrade \ninspection areas? I don't think so. I don't think that is protecting \nworkers or protecting jobs. I think that is protecting the status quo \nand exposing Americans to being hurt.\n  Let me give another example: Collective bargaining agreements can \nprohibit agencies from working together to protect the border. \nPresident Clinton's drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, as many will remember, \nnoted the separate union rules that controlled how its inspectors would \nsearch vehicles. According to the San Francisco Examiner--this is \nGeneral McCaffrey speaking--\n\n       Officials at one agency were actually forbidden to open the \n     trunks of cars, a policy well known to drug dealers.\n\n  We are not asking people to share toothbrushes. We are just asking \nthat the President have the ability to jointly train people at the \nBorder Patrol and at INS and at Customs so that they can work together. \nThis is a perfect example of where that has not happened.\n  Another example: Collective bargaining agreements could prohibit \nagencies from increasing the number of immigration inspectors. In 1990, \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service added an extra shift at the \nHonolulu International Airport to handle a surge of international \nflights in the afternoon. The American Federation of Government \nEmployees objected, saying the new shift affected overtime and \ndifferential pay of existing workers and had to be negotiated with the \nunion. The Federal Labor Relations Authority agreed that new shifts of \nborder inspectors could not be added without a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  Do we really think the President ought to have the ability to add \npersonnel if our lives are at stake? I think the answer is yes.\n  Another example: Collective bargaining agreements could prohibit \nspecial task forces of the Border Patrol from being deployed in any \nregion. Let me read you the union agreement and what it requires for \ndeploying Border Patrol. I am not criticizing them. I have been maybe \nthe biggest supporter of the Border Patrol. Under normal circumstances, \nwhen you are posting people, you want them to be posted in areas where \nthey can preserve the basic quality of life. But let me read to you \nwhat the union agreement says.\n\n  They have to be posted where there are ``suitable eating places, drug \nstores, barber shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and \nsimilar places necessary'' to sustain the comfort or health of the \nemployees.\n  In peacetime, when we are getting the job done, that is perfectly \nreasonable. But are we going to stand by and let a union work agreement \nsay that we can't, in an emergency, deploy the Border Patrol where \nthere are no dry cleaners? I don't think so.\n  Another example: Collective bargaining agreements could prohibit the \nforward deployment of the best Customs Service inspectors to foreign \nports to inspect container ships destined for the United States. Unions \nare currently negotiating with the Customs Service to determine which \ninspectors will be shifted abroad based not on merit, but on seniority.\n  When we have a critical area where people's lives are at stake, we \ncan't be fooling around with seniority. We have to give the President \nthe right to say: Look, that agreement is perfectly good under ordinary \ncircumstances, and at the post office we are going to agree with it. \nBut when people's lives are at stake, we are not going to be fooling \naround where we can't put the best person in the best place. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  Another example: Collective bargaining agreements could prohibit \nagencies from implementing a new body search policy on detainees. \nListen to this one. In 1995, the INS sought to change its policies \nregarding body searches and detentions in order to protect employees \nfrom harm and the Service from lawsuits. The American Federation of \nGovernment Employees insisted that no change in body search policy \noccur until a broader collective bargaining agreement was reached. When \nthe INS implemented the new policy, the union challenged it before the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, and they ruled that the new body\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nsearch policy could not be implemented without a new collective \nbargaining agreement.\n  The President is asking for flexibility in the name of national \nsecurity. This is exactly the kind of circumstance he is talking about. \nWhen we have people at these press conferences saying, protect our \nworkers, they are not talking about protecting workers, they are \ntalking about protecting agreements that don't make any sense, given \nthat we have had over 3,000 of our fellow citizens killed.\n  Let me give you a couple more examples. Collective bargaining \nagreements could prohibit agencies from canceling annual leave during a \nborder crisis. In 2000, the Customs Service was pushing a drug \ninterdiction effort along the Florida coast. When annual leave was \ncanceled, the union filed a grievance on behalf of those Customs \nofficers who wanted to attend the World Police and Firearms Games. The \nFLRA ruled that despite the interdiction effort, annual leave could not \nbe canceled.\n  When people are saying the President doesn't need this authority and \nthese agreements are sacred, is anybody willing to say that in order to \nprotect people's right to go to some conference, we are going to deny \nthe President the ability to say no, today we are going to protect \npeople's lives in your hometown? I don't think so.\n  Let me give you one more example. Collective bargaining agreements \ncould prohibit agencies from disbanding a single office. In 1991, INS \nattempted to shut down a unit facility due to a steady decrease in \nactivity and staffing. No more than two union workers were at the \nfacility in its last year, and one manager was capable of handling the \nworkload. Yet, the union challenged the move and the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority ruled that the elimination of any unit could not \noccur until the collective bargaining agreement was changed.\n\n  So when we are talking about giving the President, for national \nsecurity reasons, the right to waive these work rules, this is exactly \nthe kind of thing that we are talking about. When people's lives are at \nstake, should we be able to deploy the Border Patrol on a sustained \nbasis where they don't have dry cleaners? When people's lives are at \nstake, should we be able to change facilities without renegotiating \nunion contracts? When lives are at stake, should we be able to require \nthat people that were attending some conference stay on their job to \nprotect our fellow citizens? That is what this debate is about.\n  The President has asked for the right to use a policy that has been \navailable to every President for the last 20 years. Yet, in this bill, \nwhen we are supposed to be promoting homeland security, that right is \ntaken away from the President. So what has happened here is we are \nproviding a lot more money, and that will help. But we are imposing \nrestrictions on the President that guarantee the money will not be well \nspent.\n  I understand the power of special interest groups. I understand that \npeople have other concerns in national security. But I think, under the \ncircumstances, given the crisis that we face, that those who say the \nPresident is trying to trample on labor rights, trying to take away \nfrom unions their power, I don't think they have a leg to stand on. I \nthink if my colleagues would look at these examples, they show very \nclearly exactly the kind of thing we have to do.\n  Finally, I believe that the vast majority of people who are going to \nbe in these emergency agencies would like to have these restrictions \nremoved. They would like to have promotions based on merit. They would \nlike incompetents who endanger their lives, as much or more than they \nendanger our lives, to be removed. That is what this debate is about. \nWe have been sort of shouting back and forth at each other, and I \nthought it was important to come over and put some meat on the bones \nand give concrete examples.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the benefit of Members, I know Senator \nReid has been working hard to move things along. We have reached \nagreement on modifying our amendment, making sure that the pilot \ntraining is strengthened. I think we have done that with the help of \nSenator Feinstein. I am very pleased that she was over here earlier to \nassist us with this amendment. I think she would be pleased with what \nwe have done.\n  Basically, it is the amendment that Senator Smith wrote in the form \nof a bill, and I was very glad to come on board after we wrote a few \nmore bits and pieces about putting video cameras in the cockpits, and \nsome other small items.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his vision and tenacity \nin making sure that what happened on September 11 will not happen \nagain.\n  Now we say, is there any one thing we can do can to ensure this will \nnever happen? Of course not. Life is too complicated for that. As \nsomeone who has been a leader in the effort for sensible gun control \nlaws, what we are doing in this amendment is very carefully thought \nout. It is backed by the Air Line Pilots Association International, and \nit is backed by the flight attendants.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I just received from the Air \nLine Pilots Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Air Line Pilots Association,\n\n\n                                                International,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the 67,000 members of the \n     Air Line Pilots Association, International, I want to offer \n     our thanks and support for your amendment to the pending \n     homeland security legislation. The Boxer-Smith amendment \n     creates a program allowing volunteer pilots who meet strict \n     federal qualification standards to receive training to become \n     federal flight deck officers, authorized to defend the \n     cockpit against acts of criminal violence and air piracy.\n       Our nation has suffered greatly as a result of the events \n     of September 11. More than 3,000 people were murdered, \n     billions of dollars of property damage was incurred, the \n     nation's economy was rocked, thousands of people were laid \n     off and life in America will never be the same again--all \n     because terrorists were able to kill eight pilots and take \n     over the cockpits of their airliners on that day.\n       This must never happen again. Providing more armed federal \n     air marshals and enhanced cockpit doors will help. However, \n     not all flights will have the protection of air marshals and \n     new, more secure cockpit doors will not be installed \n     overnight. As an absolute last line of defense our government \n     has authorized U.S. jet fighters to shoot down an airliner if \n     hijackers gain control of it. To authorize such an action, \n     without empowering pilots to defend the cockpit against \n     hijackers, is both illogical and unacceptable.\n       We are confident that the program, created by your \n     legislation, would not only add a genuine security \n     enhancement in the very near term, but also give passengers \n     and crews the added confidence that their government had \n     provided all possible resources needed to defend against a \n     terrorist hijacking.\n       The scrutiny and training our members undergo during their \n     preparation for a career as professional airline pilots, we \n     believe, provides a ready-made pool of individuals who would \n     be well-equipped to participate in such a voluntary program: \n     highly educated, physically and mentally fit men and women \n     who are conditioned to react calmly and deliberately in a \n     crisis.\n       In this period of attempting to find money for security \n     initiatives that will have the most immediate and direct \n     impact on preventing another terrorist attack, we believe \n     that this legislation provides the most practical program for \n     cockpit defense.\n       Thank you again for all your efforts on this important \n     issue of safety and security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Duane E. Woerth,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this letter from the pilots comes \nfrom the heart. When we think back to that terrible day, we know \nexactly what happened. The flight attendants were trained never to \ninterfere if someone wanted to hijack a plane. The pilots were trained \nto go along. Do you know, according to the flight attendants that \nSenator Smith and Senator Burns and I met with today, they haven't had \none bit of new training since 9/11, almost a year ago?\n  They are desperate for this legislation, which includes very \nimportant training for the flight attendants, to be repeated every 6 \nmonths at no new costs. As one flight attendant said, ``I don't need \nmore training in how to make a napkin look better on a tray; I want to \nknow how to defend myself in the cabin.''\n  In this bill, no one is authorized to carry a gun. It doesn't do \nthat. All it says is that if a pilot feels that he or she wants to get \nthis very extensive training--and we have strengthened it with the \nFeinstein language--and be qualified to defend the plane, as a last \nresort, if someone does break through the doors, under this amendment, \nthey will have video cameras in the cockpit, which is what I wanted so \nmuch. That is kind of a rear-view mirror. And Senator Smith put in \nwireless communication so that the flight attendants can talk to the \npilots in an unobtrusive fashion.\n  This is a package that will make our skies safer. I am not going to \ntalk long because I know Senator Smith, who started the ball rolling on \nthis, is anxious to speak, Senator Hollings has some remarks, and \npeople want to vote. So in the next 4, 5 minutes, I will lay out the \nrest of my argument.\n  Why do we need this bill, which will have this voluntary program of \narming pilots who would have to go through a rigorous course and get \nqualified repeatedly and have the psychological profiles and everything \nelse that we would expect to have happen?\n  Why do we need that? Why do we need to have the flight attendants' \ntraining? Mr. President, if I could stand before you and assure you \nthat I believe the skies are safe, I would not be here supporting this \nbill, but I cannot tell you that, sadly. I join with my chairman. He \nhas been a leader in safety, and we well know what has happened.\n  Just yesterday we learned that reporters from a New York newspaper \nwent through screening processes in 11 airports with box cutters, razor \nblades, knives, and pepper spray. What happened? Each and every one got \npast security at those 11 airports, even airports from which planes \ninvolved in the disaster of 9/11 originated.\n  On July 1, we found out that the TSA, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, itself conducted a random test, and they found that in \nmany airports there was a 40-percent failure rate of finding the \ncontraband, finding the weapons. Sadly for me, two of those airports \nthat did the worst were in my State, Sacramento and Los Angeles.\n  Add to this we do not have enough air marshals. I cannot say how many \nwe have. That is a classified item. But the American people need to \nknow that we wrote the bill, and with the help of my chairman and his \nranking member, we wrote the part of the bill that deals with putting \nair marshals on all the high-risk flights, the long-haul flights. I am \nhere to say today unequivocally that we are way behind.\n  On some of the airlines--very few--they have not strengthened the \ndoors. Guess what, Mr. President. As my chairman has repeatedly said, \nthey are open during the flight. I am on flights constantly, all across \nthe country and in between, and I see the pilot come out of that door. \nGuess what they do. Sometimes they have a cart in front of the door to \nprotect against the cockpit\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nbeing taken over--a cart as a defense. Sometimes they will just have \none or two flight attendants. Sometimes they will not even do anything; \nthey just ask the passengers to stay away from the door.\n  To sum up, failure is what happens at those screening points. The \nsame weapons that caused the tragedy of 9/11 are getting through. We do \nnot have enough air marshals. The flight attendants have not had one \nbit of new training on what to do. The pilots want to have something at \ntheir disposal to save the aircraft. And on top of that, the U.S. \nmilitary has issued orders to shoot down a commercial aircraft that is \nunder the control of hijackers. Imagine that. Imagine if that happened \nand we knew we had not taken action at least to give our pilots a \nchance.\n  When I cosponsored this bill, people were really surprised because \nthey said: Barbara Boxer is a leading advocate of gun control laws and \nmaking sure guns stay out of the hands of criminals; she is strong; she \nis on the floor. This is not about guns in the hands of criminals. This \nis about a trained pilot who volunteers, most of whom have training in \nthe military, and they will have rigorous training under this bill.\n  I do not know how we can, in the name of the victims of 9/11, not \npass this bill today. I trust that we will do it.\n  Today, one of the flight attendants I met is the mother of Mark \nBingham, who was one of the passengers on flight 93 who fought so hard \nagainst the hijackers.\n  God knows what they saw before they went into that cockpit. God knows \nwhat was done to the flight attendants who were told in their training \nto do nothing. God knows what they did to the pilots. God knows. \nBelieve me, this wonderful woman talked today, and she could only \nspeculate what it was like for her son and the others. When the son \ncalled, he would not go into any detail because, she said, he wanted to \nspare her that.\n  Today we have a chance. This is the homeland security bill. What \nbetter way than to make a statement today that we are going to do \neverything in our power to ensure that at least the flight attendants \nare trained in self-defense, that the pilots have the tools they need, \nincluding a video camera, the training they need, wireless \ncommunications with the aircraft. If we do this, we will be doing a \nvery good thing for the people of this country, for the traveling \npublic of this country.\n  I would like, at this time, to give an opportunity to Senator Smith \nto speak. I see he is away from the floor. I am going to yield the \nfloor and say about Senator Smith's effort that he has really been the \nhero of this bill. He has worked hard with me to modify it in such a \nway so that I am proud to be on it. He has kept the coalition together. \nHe has worked across the aisle and within his own party, and I think he \nand I are going to have a victory today. I certainly hope we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, Senator Smith had to leave the floor for a \nmoment, so if I may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe this is an important amendment, \none I find great support for in the country. I believe it makes sense \nto arm qualified airline pilots, to add another layer of protection to \nour existing aviation security system. That is what we are seeking to \ndo.\n  We have had increased security, of course--increased screening \nrequirements, fortified cockpit doors, increased numbers of sky \nmarshals--since September 11. We must continue to do more and do all \nthat we can.\n  I recently wrote an op-ed in the Denver Post, as well as in a Wyoming \npaper, that indicated some 80 percent of American people, according to \nthe polling, support this idea. This amendment mirrors the legislation \nintroduced in both Houses of Congress and now passed by an overwhelming \nmajority in the House to allow, but not require, carefully screened, \nproperly trained and equipped airline pilots to be commissioned as \nFederal law enforcement officers and to carry firearms on the flight \ndeck for defense.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation, which has had a change of \nposition, proposed a limited arms pilot program, but the Smith \namendment would be even stronger. The Smith amendment would prevent \nairlines from opting out of the program to avoid a situation where \nmisguided liability concerns block pilots from volunteering.\n  The Smith amendment would prevent airlines from discriminating \nagainst pilots who choose to participate.\n  The Smith amendment would provide liability protection both for the \nairlines and for lawful actions of armed pilots preventing a terrorism \ntragedy turning into a feeding frenzy for the trial bar.\n  Unfortunately, opponents of arming the pilots have fostered misplaced \nfears of the issue. Here are some of the facts.\n  Pilots would use firearms only in the defense of aircraft after \nhijackers breached the cockpit door. No manmade door is impenetrable to \ndetermined attackers, of course.\n  According to the May 2 House subcommittee testimony from Boeing's \ndirector of aviation safety, commercial planes are extremely unlikely \nto suffer catastrophic failure due to firearms on board. Aircraft are \ndesigned with sufficient strength, redundancy, and damage resistance \nthat even single or multiple handgun bullets would not create holes \nthat would result in the loss of the aircraft.\n  Even the worst possible mishap that could be brought about by an \narmed pilot is certainly not comparable to the alternatives. A plane \ndestroyed by a missile fired from a U.S. fighter plane or that crashes \ninto a ground target is simply not an acceptable outcome when there is \na chance of preventing it by allowing federally commissioned, trained, \nscreened, and volunteer pilots the means of mounting a last-ditch \neffort against terrorists and hijackers.\n  I certainly hope we can support this important amendment and make our \nskies even safer for Americans to travel. I urge my friends to vote yes \non the Smith amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. While we are awaiting the arrival of Senator Smith, I \nthought I would give some more details about the bill.\n  I see Senator Smith is in the Chamber, so at this point I am very \nhappy he has come back. I know he had to attend a quick meeting. I say \nto Senator Smith, if we can get a vote this afternoon, it will be good \nfor us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. While the Senator from California is \nstill in the Chamber, let me thank her in a big way for the wonderful \ncooperation she has given us as we have worked together to bring this \namendment to the floor, but also, more importantly, to bring the flight \nattendants and the pilots together in this effort and to have \nlegislation that is going to help them as we get through this terrible \nordeal.\n  This has been a long, arduous effort since 9/11. I know the Senator \nhas worked with various groups, as I have. Right after 9/11 we started \nto meet with pilots and flight attendants to hear from them as to what \nit was they believed they needed.\n  It became very clear, as the Senator from California has said, that \nthe flight attendants were not properly trained and believed they \nneeded that training. They were the first to die, we believe, in those \naircraft. Not only that, the pilots themselves had absolutely no \ndefense against these terrorist attacks.\n  In listening to the families, the flight attendants, and the pilots, \nwe were able to piece together, work through, and develop legislation \nwhich I hope the Senate will pass this afternoon.\n  This amendment will train and arm commercial pilots with a firearm to \ndefend the cockpit of our Nation's commercial aircraft from acts of \nterrorism. It also provides for increased training for flight \nattendants and communications devices for pilots and flight attendants \nto have the latest communications and video monitoring devices.\n  It is a terrible comment on our times that this kind of effort has to \nbe put forth, but that is the world we live in, where people who are \ndetermined to kill us have no qualms about killing themselves. What \nhappens, as we all\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nknow, is that these aircraft become weapons of mass destruction. They \nbecome bombs, in essence.\n  As the Senator from California said, the option of not having guns in \nthe cockpits or trained crews is having guns in the cockpits or, as a \nlast line of defense, F-16s which will shoot down commercial aircraft \nwith Americans on board, a terrible scenario to have happen, basically \nmaking the decision to take fewer lives to avoid killing more people \nbecause of what might happen on the ground. It is a terrible scenario \nwe do not want to see happen.\n  I am not sure we can guarantee 100 percent it will never happen, but \nwe can cut the odds with this legislation. That is why I am so excited \nabout its passage. Hopefully, when it goes to conference with the \nHouse--the House bill is very similar but not quite where we need it to \nbe--we can conference this and the President will sign it.\n  I was astonished to hear the flight attendants this morning in the \npress conference. They were very emotional and very articulate, I might \nadd, in talking about the training they did not have, and they have not \nhad any additional training since the 9/11 incident. I believe we have \nto give our Nation's pilots and flight attendants a fighting chance \nagainst these terrorists before our Government has to resort to \nshooting down an airplane and by all odds keeping the terrorists from \ngetting into that cockpit. The cabin would be the first place the \nterrorists would be. At least with trained flight attendants, they can \nperhaps incapacitate the person or at least slow the person down. If \nthat person gets to the cockpit with a lethal weapon, a properly \ntrained pilot will stop that person before that person gets into the \ncockpit and causes the plane to lose control.\n\n  We have met some wonderful people. I was taken aback this morning in \nthe meeting with Alice Hogan. She is the mother of Mark Bingaman who \nlost his life on flight 93, one of the many heroes on that aircraft. It \nis very emotional to see these people coming to Washington and talking \nwith us and asking us to help. They should not have to ask, but they \nare here, they are articulate, and they are emotional. They want help. \nThey deserve help. We do not want any more flight 93s or flight 175s.\n  A few weeks ago, I met Ellen Saracini whose husband Vic was the pilot \nof the aircraft that went into Tower 2. Ironically, she told us, she \nhad had a conversation with her husband not too long before September \n11 in which he indicated to her he wished they had better security on \nthe aircraft, better training for flight attendants, maybe guns in the \ncockpit, some lethal way to stop a potential terrorist; that they did \nnot feel comfortable with this philosophy of being a pacifist when it \nhappens, do not make any waves and everything will be fine; the \nterrorist will land the aircraft somewhere.\n  That world is gone. We are not there anymore. I remember a reporter \nasking Ellen, ``Do you think your husband would have survived this \nincident if he had had a gun in the cockpit or a trained crew?'' And \nshe said, ``I do not know how it could have been any worse than what \nhappened.'' I certainly concur with that.\n  There are a lot of things we can say. I want to speak from the heart \nabout this. We hear a lot about cost: How much is it going to cost to \ntrain the flight attendants? How much is it going to cost to train the \npilots? How do you even estimate the cost of human life that happened \nin New York or at the Pentagon? We cannot put a cost on that.\n  This is an emotional time for all of us. We are on the eve of the \nanniversary of 9/11, and what a great tribute it would be to pass this \nlegislation now so we can try to see it does not happen again. The cost \nis not that bad, frankly. If an air marshal had to be put on every \nsingle flight in America--I do not know what it is, 30,000 flights a \nday or whatever it is--the costs would be prohibitive. So this way, the \npilots are armed and the flight attendants are trained. The odds are \ndramatically reduced.\n  Down the road perhaps, with better reinforced cockpits, maybe things \nwill improve. Right now, we need this legislation, and we need it \nbadly. I hope the Senate will pass it this afternoon and that it will \ngo to the President's desk very shortly.\n  One other thing I want to mention, because it has been talked about: \nI have not heard anything official, but there has been some rumor there \nmay be an effort to go with a test program, or a pilot program--no pun \nintended--where guns would be put in the cockpit on 2 or 3 percent of \nthe planes, maybe train the flight attendants, maybe not. We need those \nflight attendants trained. This is not where we need to be. This is not \ngoing to get the job done.\n  If someone is a passenger on an airplane, they might want to know \nwhether this is one of the 2 or 3 percent where the pilots are armed. I \nknow I would want to ask. Ninety-seven percent of the planes are not \ngoing to have these so-called test provisions.\n  I am thinking, what are we testing for? It is not a good idea. The \nHouse started out with this, and they left it a long time ago and moved \nour way on the legislation. What is so ludicrous about this is, let's \nsay we implement a test program for 5 years. Three percent of the \naircraft have trained pilots and are carrying arms, and nothing happens \nfor 5 years--and we would hope it would not--what does that mean? We \nare going to wait until something happens with the other 97 \npercent? And when something happens, we will increase it to 15 or 20 \npercent? It is illogical. We need this bill to pass now. Armed pilots. \nThe pilots want it. The flight attendants want it. The American people \nwant it. I hope the majority of the Senate wants it, as the majority of \nthe House.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Smith has been eloquent and his leadership has \nbeen stalwart.\n  I very much worry that some kind of test program is going to be put \nforward by the administration, as opposed to what we are doing. I ask \nmy friend if he does not agree. We already know there are huge failure \nrates at the screening points. TSA said in some airports it was 40 \npercent; in some it was 30 percent; and in some it was 20 percent.\n  That means when the New York Daily News sent out reporters, and they \ncame back after Labor Day and said they snuck on box cutters, pepper \nspray, knives, razor blades, all without detection, we already know, \nGod forbid, we could theoretically and practically have another \nincident.\n  Since we already know about that failure rate, and since we already \nknow the military will shoot down commercial aircraft they decide is \nunder control of hijackers, and since we know that the doors are not \nyet secure, and that in many cases they are open and the pilots come \nout or the flight attendants go in and they are guarded by a cart, \ndon't we have enough information to move forward with this bill right \nnow with this amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I absolutely agree with the Senator. We \ndo; we have more than enough information. I certainly do not think it \nis worth having a test program to wait and hope that something else \ndoes not happen again. We need to cut the odds dramatically. I don't \nknow if it can be 100 percent, but we certainly can cut the odds \ndramatically. We need to restore the confidence of the American people \nto fly again.\n  The stories just related are incredible--.357 magnums getting on \naircraft. Another thing which has not been focused on, terrorists do \nnot necessarily have to have something we can determine as a weapon; \nthey have bare hands. They have been trained to murder. They have gone \nthrough the Bin Laden terrorist camps. They are experts in martial \narts. They can kill with their hands. Some small weapon could be \nhelpful to a terrorist, but they could kill with their bare hands.\n  They have to be stopped. The best way, of course, is to keep them off \nthe planes. In the event they get on the plane, this is the last line \nof deterrence and defense. I am hopeful the Senate will realize this. I \nknow it has been a long process. The House has had hearings. They \nmarked a bill, 310 to 113, on July 10. Today we are considering \nessentially similar legislation--not exactly the same.\n  The Allied Pilots Association, the Airline Pilots' Security Alliance, \nAirline Pilots Association, Coalition of Airline Pilots Association, \nSouthwest Airlines Pilots Association, Association of Flight \nAttendants: all of these\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\ngroups have not only supported this amendment but have worked very hard \nand talked to Members of Congress in a very informative, instructive, \npositive way, pleading with Congress to help them defend the people on \nthose aircraft and the people on the ground.\n  I have several items to print, including one from the pilots to \nPresident Bush, an editorial by Richard Cohen, and an editorial by \nGeorge Will, and I ask unanimous consent these documents be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                                                    April 3, 2002.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As representatives of the largest \n     airline pilot organizations in this country, we would like \n     your assistance in the immediate development and \n     implementation of a program to defend the American traveling \n     public with voluntarily armed pilots.\n       Public opinion polls and those within our own pilot groups \n     indicate overwhelming support for arming flight deck \n     crewmembers with lethal weapons. Nothing short of lethal \n     force can stop lethal intent to hijack and destroy our \n     aircraft and murder all on board. Yet the volunteer pilot \n     arming provisions of the Aviation and Transportation Security \n     Act of 2001 that you signed into law on November 19, 2001, \n     are being ignored.\n       To remedy this situation, we ask for your assistance in \n     implementing a flight deck protection program that has the \n     following characteristics: All volunteer pilots must be \n     carefully screened, successfully trained and subsequently \n     designated by a federal law enforcement agency such as the \n     FBI or TSA; pilots so selected, screened and trained should \n     be deputized or have the same indemnification and protections \n     afforded other law enforcement officers in the employ of the \n     U.S. government; pilots must be certificated in weapons \n     handling, use of lethal force, carriage policy and procedure, \n     rules of engagement in all environments, recurrent training, \n     tort law, and other subjects deemed necessary by the \n     governing authority; choice of weapons and ammunition will be \n     mandated by the responsible federal agency; and certified \n     pilots will draw their weapons only for use in direct defense \n     of the flight deck in accordance with program ``use of \n     force'' rules.\n       If the unthinkable happens again, there must be a means \n     provided for our flight crews to defeat any hijacker who \n     breaches the flight deck with a weapon and attempts to \n     destroy the aircraft. Otherwise, a U.S. fighter may be \n     ordered to shoot down a commercial airliner full of innocent \n     passengers. America's pilots must have lethal weapons as a \n     last line of defense against well-coordinated, highly trained \n     teams of terrorists.\n       Each of our pilot groups has independently assessed and \n     recommended the best way to implement a plan to arm our \n     flight crews. Each has drawn similar conclusions closely \n     paralleling a proposed training program developed by the FBI \n     at the request of the Department of Justice. We have \n     forwarded our specific recommendations through the comment \n     process requested by the Federal Aviation Administration, and \n     stand ready to immediately assist your administration in the \n     establishment of such a program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Captain Duane Woerth,\n       President, Air Line Pilots Association.\n     Captain Tracy Price,\n       President, Airline Pilot Security Alliance.\n     Captain Jon Weaks,\n       President, Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association.\n     Captin John E. Darrah,\n       President, Allied Pilots Association.\n     Captain Bob Miller,\n       President, Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2002]\n\n                               Guns . . .\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       Careful readers of this column will remember when, some \n     years back, I was burglarized. It was the middle of the \n     night, sometime around 3 a.m., when I heard a noise--the back \n     door being forced open. I awoke with a start, tried to quiet \n     my thumping heart, rushed to the head of the stairs and heard \n     someone running around the floor below. At that moment, what \n     I wanted more than anything in the world was a gun.\n       What I wanted at that moment--and only that moment, I \n     hasten to add--was denied last month to airline pilots who \n     just might have to deal with a terrorist somehow getting into \n     the cockpit. That this decision was made by the pro-gun Bush \n     administration only deepens the mystery. If I were a pilot, I \n     would want a gun in the cockpit. And in every survey, most \n     pilots say they do.\n       The gun I would want would not be carried on my person. It \n     would not be on me when I went to the bathroom or left the \n     cockpit for any reason. It would be in a secure location, \n     accessible only to someone who knew a code, and while it \n     might be loaded with bullets that could stop a man but not \n     penetrate the fuselage, even conventional ammo does not \n     present an unacceptable risk. Planes don't deflate like \n     balloons from one or two bullet holes. And, anyway, air \n     marshals and other law enforcement officers already fly not \n     only armed but with conventional ammo.\n       This gun would be used only as a last resort to stop a \n     terrorist from gaining control of the plane. It's probably \n     not too much to say that if pilots had had weapons on Sept. \n     11, the attacks might have been averted. A man with a box \n     cutter is no match for a man with a gun.\n       The union that represents the pilots, the 62,000-member Air \n     Line Pilots Association, favors having a weapon in the \n     cockpit. Not all pilots agree, of course. Some of them feel \n     that arming pilots would distract from the real job at hand--\n     making the cockpit as secure as possible as quickly as \n     possible. This includes, among other things, bulletproof \n     cockpit doors that can't be broken down. It also includes \n     beefing up the air marshal program. After all, El Al Israel's \n     national airline, does not arm its pilots and has not had a \n     hijacking since 1968. It uses sky marshals.\n       But El Al has only 34 airplanes. The United States has more \n     20,000 flights a day. It will be a long time, if ever, before \n     there's a sky marshal on every flight. That cannot, of \n     course, be said for pilots. Every flight has at least one.\n       Back in 1995, when he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush \n     signed a bill giving Texans the right to carry a concealed \n     weapon. The bill insisted only that the gun-toters be at \n     least 21, pass a criminal background check and have no \n     history of mental illness. I can only hope that pilots \n     already meet those criteria.\n       If that's the case, then why is it somehow logical to allow \n     every Tom, Dick and Harry to pack some heat but to forbid \n     that same right to airline pilots, who, I may point out, \n     often are ex-military people? Regardless, they would all be \n     trained in the use of the gun, and their first duty, always, \n     would be to fly the plane--no matter what. Only if a \n     terrorist somehow managed to gain access to the cockpit would \n     the pilot use the weapon. Could even a stray shot be worse \n     than a commandeered plane on a terrorist mission?\n       I am, like all reasonable people, in favor of the tightest \n     restrictions on guns. I fear the things, since they are \n     easily concealed and lethal. The more there are, the more \n     chances they will fall into the wrong hands. That is \n     precisely what I feared the night I was burglarized--not that \n     the burglar had a knife (I had scissors), but a gun.\n       But even in my most anti-NRA moods, I want the cops to be \n     armed, since, among other things, just be being so, they \n     deter crime. Armed pilots would also be a deterrent. A \n     terrorist would not be dealing with the chance that an air \n     marshal is aboard but the certainty that, in the cockpit, it \n     is gun and a person--cool enough to be an airline pilot--who \n     is cool enough to use it. Just one night in my life, I wanted \n     a gun. On just one flight, a pilot might feel the same way.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 6, 2002]\n\n                          Armed (and Trusted)\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The next perpetrators of terrorism in America probably are \n     already here, perhaps planning more hijackings. Post Sept. 11 \n     airport security measures may have made hijackings slightly \n     more difficult, but the fact that these are America's most \n     visible anti-terrorist measures vastly increases the \n     terrorists' payoff in proving the measures incapable of \n     keeping terrorists off airplanes.\n       Recently this column presented, without endorsement, the \n     views of three commercial airline pilots who oppose guns in \n     cockpits. Today's column presents, and endorses, the views of \n     three other commercial airline pilots--two trained as fighter \n     pilots, one civilian-trained--who refute the other pilots' \n     principal contentions, which were:\n       Proper policy regarding suicidal, hijackers is to land as \n     quickly as possible, which can be as quick as 10 minutes. So \n     priority should be given to making cockpits impenetrable. \n     Armed pilots might be tempted to imprudent bravery--\n     particularly ``renegade'' pilots with fighter-pilot \n     mentalities, who would leave the cockpit to battle terrorists \n     in the main cabin. And arming pilots serves the pilots' union \n     objective of requiring a third pilot in each cockpit.\n       The three pilots who favor allowing pilots to choose \n     whether to carry guns respond:\n       Passengers already entrust their lives to pilot's \n     judgments. Landing a hijacked plan is indeed the first \n     priority, but pilots need to be alive to do that. A cockpit \n     impenetrably sealed from terrorists is an impossibility, in \n     part because planes cannot be landed as quickly as the other \n     three pilots say. An ignoble fear--of lawyers, of liability--\n     explains why the airlines oppose arming pilots. But \n     legislation could immunize airlines from liability resulting \n     from harms suffered by passengers as a result of pilots' \n     resisting terrorists.\n       Landing a plane from 30,000 feet requires at least 20 \n     minutes, never just 10. A training flight, simulating a fire \n     emergency on a flight just 4,000 feet up and 15 miles from \n     Philadelphia's airport, takes about 12 minutes to land when \n     done perfectly. Transatlantic flights can be three hours from \n     a suitable airport. Such airports are not abundant west of \n     Iowa. Which means on most flights, terrorists would have time \n     to penetrate the cockpit.\n       Bulletproof doors are not the answer: the Sept. 11 \n     terrorists had no bullets. Well trained terrorists can blow \n     even a much-reinforced cockpit door off its hinges using a \n     thin thread of malleable explosive that can pass undetected \n     through passenger screening\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n     procedures when carried on a person rather than in luggage. \n     Here is what else can be undetected by security screeners \n     busy confiscating, grandmothers' knitting needles:\n       The knife with the six-inch serrated blade that a passenger \n     found, in a post-Sept. 11 flight, secreted under her seat. \n     Two semiautomatic pistols that recently passed unnoticed \n     through metal detectors and were discovered only when the \n     owner's bags were selected for a random search at the gate. A \n     mostly plastic 22-caliber gun that looks like a cell phone. \n     An entirely plastic and razor-sharp knife. A \n     ``bloodsucker''--it looks like a fountain pen but has a \n     cylindrical blade that can inflict a neck wound that will not \n     stop bleeding.\n       The idea that arming pilots is a means of justifying a \n     third pilot is derisory: Reengineering cockpits for that \n     would be impossibly complex. Equally implausible is the idea \n     that a Taser (electric stun gun) is a satisfactory aid when \n     locked in a plane, seven miles up, with a team of trained \n     terrorists.\n       A pilot's gun would never leave the cockpit because the \n     pilot never would. And shooting a terrorist standing in the \n     cockpit door frame would not require a sniper's skill. The \n     powerful pressurization controls, as well as the location and \n     redundancy of aircraft electronic, hydraulic and other \n     systems, vastly reduce the probability that even multiple \n     wayward gun shots--even of bullets that are not frangible--\n     would cripple an aircraft.\n       About fear of ``fighter pilot mentality'': The military \n     assiduously schools and screens pilot candidates to eliminate \n     unstable or undisciplined candidates. Airlines, too, \n     administer severe selection procedures for pilots, who are \n     constantly scrutinized. Captains have two physical \n     examinations a year (first officers, one) with psychological \n     components. Everything said in the cockpit is recorded.\n       Besides, many passengers fly armed--county sheriffs, FBI \n     and Secret Service agents, postal inspectors, foreign body-\n     guards of foreign dignitaries. Why, then, must the people on \n     whom all passengers' lives depend--pilots--be unarmed? \n     Especially considering that the prudent law enforcement \n     doctrine is that lethal force is warranted when menaced by \n     more than one trained and armed opponent.\n       To thicken the layers of deterrence and security, in the \n     air as well as on the ground, Congress should promptly enact \n     legislation to empower pilots to choose to carry guns. Time \n     flies. So do hijackers. And the next ones probably are \n     already among us.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I reiterate:\n  This amendment trains and arms commercial pilots with a firearm to \ndefend the cockpit of our Nation's commercial aircraft from acts of \nterrorism. The amendment also provides for increased training for \nflight attendants and communications devices for pilots and flight \nattendants to have the latest communications and video monitoring \ndevices.\n  Today, there are no defensive capabilities our Nation's pilots. No \nfirearms.\n  Only Federal air marshals, on a very small percentage of commercial \nflights, are armed to defend against terrorism.\n  When all else has failed to defend a commercial aircraft, the only \noption for the defense of the public from the use of a commercial \naircraft as an instrument of mass terror is for the United States \nmilitary to shoot down that commercial aircraft.\n  I firmly believe that we should give our Nation's pilots & flight \nattendants a fighting chance against terrorists before our Government \nresorts to shooting commercial aircraft out of the sky.\n  I am proud to have joined a bipartisan coalition including Senator \nZell Miller, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Frank Murkowski, and Senator \nBarbara Boxer in introducing our bill, S. 2554, the ``Arming Pilots \nAgainst Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002.''\n  On July 21, 2001, the FAA limited the carriage of weapons of aircraft \nto certain law enforcement officers.\n  September 11, 2001--the worst terrorist attack in U.S. History. That \nattack could have been prevented if pilots were armed.\n  I was convinced of this fact by a wonderful and brave woman--Ellen \nSaracini of Pennsylvania.\n  Over one month ago, I spoke at a press conference with Ellen \nSaracini.\n  Ellen is the wife of the late Captain Vic Saracini.\n  Captain Victor Saracini was the pilot of United Flight 175 on its way \nfrom Boston to Los Angeles when it was commandeered on September 11 and \ncrashed into the World Trade Center Tower 2.\n  Vic supported armed pilots before September 11th and Ellen has \ncontinued that support.\n  Our nation has suffered a great loss with the loss of the pilots, \nflight attendants and thousands of victims of September 11th.\n  I never ever want to see an event like September 11th happen again \nand I firmly believe that armed pilots will be an effective tool to \nprevent any future contemplated acts of terrorism.\n\n  What we learned from September 11th is that a military jet shooting \ndown a commercial aircraft is not only possible, it is now commonly \nconsidered as a part of airline security.\n  We also recently learned that the military contemplated ramming \ncommercial jets with military aircraft if they were hijacked weapons of \nmass destruction. On September 11th, I understand that the shooting \ndown of commercial aircraft may have been necessary at the time. Today, \nthere is no excuse not to arm pilots before we allow our military to \nshoot down commercial aircraft.\n  At the time it was the right decision, because the despicable acts of \nSeptember 11th were unthinkable--not anymore.\n  Since September 11th, there have been some advancements in commercial \nairline security, yet, the most common sense legislation to train and \narm commercial airline pilots, has yet to be implemented.\n  The Aviation and Transportation Security Act was approved and signed \ninto law. This act authorizes air carrier pilots to carry a firearm in \nthe cockpit if: (1) the Undersecretary for TSA approves; (2) the air \ncarrier approves; (3) the firearm is approved; and, (4) the pilot has \nreceived proper training.\n  This law was passed as a result of my amendment in the Senate and a \nprovision passed by the House. I was unhappy with the language, but I \nhad the hope that the Department of Transportation would give adequate \nconsideration to the issue of armed pilots.\n  The FAA published a request for comments on whether pilots should be \nallowed to be armed on December 31, 2001. By March 15, 2002, the FAA \nhad received over 7,500 comments and according to the FAA's analysis, \nmore than 96% of the comments favored armed pilots. As a result of the \nopen comment period, the TSA decided to agree with the 4% of \nrespondents who disapproved of armed pilots and ignored the comments of \n96% of respondents.\n  This is a critical point in the debate today. Today, the \nTransportation Security Administration is authorized to start training \npilots in the proper use of a firearm to defend the cockpit. One pilot \nsaid that the current inaction on the part of TSA and the Department of \nTransportation is a criminal act of negligence. Maybe this inaction is \na political act of negligence that needs to be addressed by the Senate \ntoday.\n  On May 21, 2002, the former Under Secretary for Transportation \nSecurity, John Magaw, testified that he would not approve the arming of \ncommercial pilots.\n  The House passed a strong armed pilots bill by an overwhelming \nmargin--today the Senate finally considers an amendment to train and \narm pilots.\n  The bottom line is that armed pilots are the first line of deterrence \nand last line of defense to terrorism.\n  First line of deterrence, because terrorists will never target \nAmerican commercial aircraft again, if terrorists know that an armed \npilot will end an attempted hijacking with deadly force.\n  Last line of defense, because an armed pilot is the last line of \ndefense before an F-16 or other military aircraft shoots down a \nhijacked aircraft full of innocent civilians. It really is that simple.\n  Nonlethal weapons are a great supplement to a firearm--but it is not \nan alternative.\n  Our nation's air marshals are armed with a firearm. Maybe they should \nalso be given a stun gun or a tazer, but nobody in this chamber would \nargue that our nation's air marshals should only have a stun gun. \nTazers and stun guns are good to disable one or two terrorists, but a \nfirearm is the best alternative to defend against a September 11th \nstyle attack.\n  The pilots and the flight attendants want safer travel. My \nunderstanding is that the Department of Transportation initially \nopposed arming pilots because of liability issues. Our amendment grants \nthe airlines a limited liability shield to protect from aggressive \ntrial lawyers. Our amendment will ensure\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nthat the pilots and airlines are not held liable for actions taken to \nprotect the lives of the crew and passengers from terrorist attack.\n  A commercial aircraft is not going to crash as a result of the \ndischarge of a firearm on a commercial aircraft. On May 2, 2002, Ron \nHinderberger of the Boeing Company testified before the House Committee \non Transportation. Hinderberger said: ``The risk of loss of an aircraft \ndue to a stray round from a hand gun is very slight.''\n  The cost of this program is not going to be too much to bear. The \ncost that I never want this nation to pay again--is another September \n11 style attack on the United States of America. I am willing to work \nwith the good members of the Senate to keep the cost of this program to \na minimum. My office has consulted some private training facilities \nincluding Gunsight in Arizona and Blackwater Lodge in North Carolina. \nBoth have assured my office that the cost would be minimal. Gunsight \nquotes the cost at about $2000 per pilot for initial training and about \n$700 per pilot for recurrent training.\n  The amendment contains findings that we inserted at the request of \nSenator Barbara Boxer that a Federal air marshall should be on all high \nrisk flights.\n  The amendment creates a Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to train \nand arm pilots.\n  Ninety days after the bill is passed the Undersecretary for \nTransportation shall establish a program to deputize qualified pilots \nwho volunteer for the armed pilots program.\n  The bill grants pilots the authority to use force and provides a \nliability protection for pilots acting in scope of their duties as \nFederal Flight Deck Officers.\n  The amendment establishes the Aviation Crewmember Self-Defense \nDivision within the TSA to train flight attendants to prepare them for \nterrorist and criminal threats.\n  Another provisions states that the air carriers shall provide flight \nand cabin crew with a discreet, hands free wireless method of \ncommunicating. The purpose of this device is to provide a method for \nthe pilot to communicate with the flight attendant to understand if \nthere is a threat to a commercial aircraft.\n  Also, another provision was added at the request of Senator Boxer to \nprovide a real time and cost effective video monitoring device for the \npilot to monitor the activities in the passenger's cabin. This gives a \npilot a view of any possible threat to the pilot's cockpit without \nhaving to open the cockpit door.\n  Today it is an honor to be fighting on behalf of the pilots, flight \nattendants, commercial airline passengers, and the American people who \nsupport the idea of armed pilots and trained flight attendants on the \nfloor of the United States Senate.\n  If my state of New Hampshire is any barometer of the popularity of \nArmed Pilots--the Congress would pass this amendment by Unanimous \nConsent right now.\n  The House of Representatives conducted hearings, marked up and passed \nan armed pilots bill by a margin of 310-113 on July 10th.\n  Today, the Senate is considering a similar armed pilots amendment and \nit is my hope and prayer that this amendment is passed by the \nanniversary of September 11th. One year is long enough for the American \npeople to wait for this common sense and reasonable amendment to arm \npilots and train flight attendants.\n  Also, I want to thank the Allied Pilots Association, the Airline \nPilots' Security Alliance, the Air Lines Pilots Association, the \nCoalition of Airline Pilots Associations, the Southwest Airlines \nPilots' Association and the Association of Flight Attendants for the \nleadership and hard work these groups have completed to help the \nCongress draft and pass an armed pilots and trained flight attendant's \nbill.\n  Yesterday, we learned that many different reporters investigating \nairport security were able to smuggle small knives and pepper spray \nthrough the checkpoints of 11 airports over Labor Day weekend.\n  These airports included Newark International, Logan Airport in \nBoston, Dulles Airport, O'Hare, LaGuardia and Kennedy, among others.\n  These are our largest and busiest airports, where security should be \nthe tightest.\n  Anbd this report is certainly not the only instance where weapons \nhave passed through security without detection.\n  But we have to assume that occasionally mistakes happen, even at our \nbiggest and busiest airports.\n  Some sort of weapon could be smuggled aboard an airplane.\n  All it took on September 11th was a few box-cutter knives.\n  This recent example of screening insecurity is just another reason \nwhy airline pilots need to be armed.\n  Because they will provide the first line of deterrence and the last \nline of defense.\n  In other words, if terrorists know that the pilots have firearms, \nthen they will be less likely to attempt a takeover.\n  But if the unthinkable happens and a terrorist gets through security \nwith some sort of weapon and then tries to take over a plane, the plan \nis to start descending to land the plane immediately, and to use the \nfirearm if the terrorists try to get into the cockpit.\n  The terrorists will not be able to get into the cockpit with armed \npilots.\n  And the lives of passengers and the crew, as well as perhaps \nthousands of Americans on the ground, will be saved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire is right. Pilots do work hard. I have commented to that \neffect on other occasions, and on other measures. Our problem is, \nlooking at the Senate floor, we have two Senators, maybe three at the \nmost. What really occurs is that we are addressing a ``fixed'' jury.\n  In other words, 35 years ago when I came to the Senate, we did not \nhave the luxury of television. So if you wanted to know what was going \non, you had to come over on the floor. Invariably, there were always 20 \nto 30 Republican Senators in their cloakroom, and 20 to 30 Democrats in \ntheir cloakroom. If an issue was raised, you could make a point and \ncome right out on the floor. Or if you agreed with a particular \nSenator, you could thank him for his observation. In a sense, we would \nlearn from each other.\n  We now have the TV everywhere. Incidentally, if you are watching it \nin your office and you find you want to raise a point, you come to the \nfloor quickly; then you find out someone else has been waiting an hour, \nanother Senator has been waiting a half hour, so your opportunity is \ntotally missed. But the real point is, we do not listen to each other.\n  The pilots have worked--he is dead right, they have worked this bill. \nAnd to my surprise, it has come up this afternoon.\n  I have tried my very best to improve airline security since the \nterrorist attacks. As the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I got the \nbest possible witnesses together, and we immediately passed out of the \ncommittee a bipartisan, unanimous airline security measure. We passed \nit out of the Senate 100 to 0.\n  While we had the view in the Senate that airline security should be \nwithin the Justice Department in order to compromise and get things \ndone, we went along with the House and kept it in the Transportation \nDepartment which proved to be, of course, a mistake in that we wasted \nnow 6 or 7 months in confirming the man who took over, but was replaced \nin the particular role as head of transportation security. Without a \nmuch debate and without a report we just put his nomination up on the \nfloor and we voted to have him confirmed so he could get off to a \nrunning start.\n  In any event, we made a mistake. I realize we were behind the curve, \nand we had a some unnecessary requirements with respect to airline \nsecurity and they were going in the wrong direction in some instances.\n  Let me say categorically, I am pleased Admiral Loy, the Commandant of \nthe Coast Guard--we had the Coast Guard authorization in our particular \ncommittee, so we worked closely with Admiral Loy on Coast Guard and \nseaport security. We had field hearings together, as well as within the \nSenate. He is very realistic, very attune, an expert, very \nprofessional, very much experienced on security. He had not\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\ntaken over for very long before the August break. I did not demand that \nhe respond to questions for his nomination, but I gave him our \nquestions in a 2-page letter and said: Work over August and we will \nhave a hearing on this security measure, the guns.\n  I am constantly asked by the press about this issue, and we would be \ndelighted to vote on guns in the cockpit, we would be delighted to vote \nin the committee.\n  We had this hearing scheduled. I talked to Admiral Loy only \nyesterday. He has answered our letter, and he is ready to go next \nTuesday.\n  He has been doing just the right kind of work, getting around and \nconferring with the airport managers and getting everybody working \ntogether. Not unlike the former occupant of this desk who greatly \nimpressed me, Senator Robert Kennedy. He had never been in the \ncourtroom, but when he was selected as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, he was the first Attorney General to go around and shake \nhands with the 32,000 in the Justice Department at that time.\n  You have to get your team working together. Admiral Loy has done \nthat. But I say it is a fixed jury because the pilots, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has pointed out, have been working this issue. We \nall have many responsibilities. I just have not had the opportunity to \nbring up the facts and test what we already have. The Senator from \nCalifornia said: ``And since we know this, and since we know that,'' \nwhy have any further tests? I could not agree with the distinguished \nSenator from California any more. We do know. How do we know? We know \nfrom the best of the best.\n  There is one airline that is under the gun. That is the Israeli \nairline, El Al. In fact, they have been so successful in preventing \nhijacking that they do not even have attempted hijackings, as far as we \nknow. They just go after the ticket counter itself, as they did in Los \nAngeles, and shoot it up and kill those people there.\n  But knowing El Al is the most under-the-gun airline, we had the \nprivilege of talking to a gentleman, the chief pilot of El Al, in \nSeptember of last year. It was just about a year ago, slightly less \nthan a year.\n  He said: ``Senator, what you want to do is get a secure door to the \ncockpit. That is the last line of defense. Not a gun--the last line of \ndefense is that secure door. And that door is never, ever to be opened \nin flight.'' Once the door is secure and if there is any disturbance \nwhatsoever in the cabin, they go immediately to the ground and law \nenforcement meets them there.\n  The chief pilot of El Al emphasized--I will never forget it--he said: \n``Senator, they can be assaulting my wife in the cabin. I do not open \nthat door.''\n  And for 30 years they have not had a hijacking.\n  We have a test, and that is why I am on the floor of the Senate \ntrying to make sense out of this bad mistake that is about to be made \nbecause there is one thing you do not want to do, and that is put \nweaponry on the plane itself. In fact, the marshals pointing their guns \nrecently on that Delta flight going into Philadelphia--wrong. You don't \npoint your gun, and law enforcement and gun safety dictate that, unless \nyou intend to use it. Anybody should know that.\n  So even our marshals need better training already. But be that as it \nmay, for 30 years now they have not had a hijacking on El Al Airlines. \nWe have had a test and we know it.\n  The trouble is, this has been worked politically. I know how the \nsystem works. I look around and I look for the measures and speakers \nwho will talk in support of it. I find out that Senators who first were \ninclined to vote with me and listen and understand the problem, they \nhave gone. I know the White House position is they should not have \nthem. It has been announced and reaffirmed that they do not want pilots \nto carry guns in the cockpit. But you don't see anybody out here \ndefending President Bush and the policy of this administration.\n  More to the point, I could talk all day long, or talk into next week \nand just hold the floor. I hope we can work out a compromise with \nrespect to keeping the door closed. But let me read a letter, which is \nnew to me. It was less than an hour ago when I had an appointment with \nMr. Leo Mullin, the chief executive officer of Delta Airlines down in \nAtlanta, down in my backyard. Mr. Mullin was there and mentions the \ndiscussion we had about the economic travails of air transport in \nAmerica. He said:\n\n       By the way, I want to thank you for your leadership on \n     this.\n\n  I haven't led anybody. I can't find anybody behind me. I am not a \nleader unless they let my staff vote. I think they would go along with \nme. But I haven't been able to find a Senator to go with me, and we \nhave called the White House.\n  You can rest for a while. Don't worry about it because I am going to \ntake a little time and give you all some rest. I know I am doing the \nLord's work.\n  This letter is dated today.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: With the safety of our passengers \n     and crewmembers as our number one priority, we are writing to \n     convey our serious concerns regarding S. 2554 that would \n     permit the use of firearms by pilots aboard commercial \n     aircraft. As discussions continue on the merits of this \n     subject, we stand ready to work with Congress and the \n     Administration in an effort to reach a prudent consensus \n     position. It must be noted, however, that while we are \n     spending literally billions of dollars to keep dangerous \n     weapons off of aircraft, the idea of intentionally \n     introducing thousands of deadly weapons into the system \n     appears to be dangerously counter-productive.\n\n  Divert right here. I ask unanimous consent the letter in its entirety \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Air Transport Association\n\n\n                                             of America, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: With the safety of our passengers \n     and crewmembers as our number one priority, we are writing to \n     convey our serious concerns regarding S. 2554 that would \n     permit the use of firearms by pilots abroad commercial \n     aircraft. As discussions continue on the merits of this \n     subject, we stand ready to work with Congress and the \n     Administration in an effort to reach a prudent consensus \n     position. It must be noted, however, that while we are \n     spending literally billions of dollars to keep dangerous \n     weapons off of aircraft, the idea of intentionally \n     introducing thousands of deadly weapons into the system \n     appears to be dangerously counter-productive.\n       In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, we \n     understand the rational for providing crewmembers with means \n     to defend themselves and their aircraft. However, we believe \n     that allowing guns aboard every aircraft is ill-advised.\n       A variety of serious safety, technical and training issues \n     have been raised that require answers prior to moving forward \n     with any proposal to even consider the use of firearms by \n     cockpit crews. To ensure the safety and security of our \n     customers and employees, we have a duty and obligation to ask \n     these tough questions and to have a clear understanding of \n     the answers. Otherwise, innocent passengers and crewmembers \n     will be killed or injured through accidental firings of \n     weapons, or worse, there being used against crews and \n     passengers.\n       We believe that the public must know what studies or \n     testing have been conducted to determine the effects of an \n     accidental weapon discharge in a pressurized aircraft at \n     altitude, or discharge into a sophisticated instrument panel? \n     How will the firearm be stowed, maintained and protected from \n     misuse between flights, particularly when the aircraft is \n     parked overnight or deployed in international operations? \n     What is the process to measure the ability of armed pilots to \n     handle a firearm in the close confines of the cockpit? Will \n     the training program disrupt the airline's ability to operate \n     their schedules? How often are firearms utilized by trained \n     law enforcement officers lost, misplaced, stolen, fired \n     accidentally or used against the officer carrying the \n     weapons.\n       The Transportation Security Administration has testified \n     that the cost to the government for the program is \n     approximately $860 million. In light of programs already \n     completed and underway to secure cockpit doors, we seriously \n     question the cost effectiveness of a program mandated in S. \n     2554 that would impose a further burden on scarce TSA \n     resources. Indeed, with secure cockpit doors now being \n     further upgraded with even higher protective capabilities, \n     the advisability of introducing dangerous and unnecessary \n     weapons in the cockpit environment must be carefully \n     considered.\n       Until such time as validated answers to these and other \n     questions are available, we believe that a decision to deploy \n     firearms aboard commercial aircraft raises a serious and \n     unnecessary risk for both passengers and crewmembers. Just as \n     we would not introduce an aircraft into service without \n     thorough testing, training of crewmembers and evaluating all \n     safety measures, no one should place deadly weapons in the \n     hands of flight crews without a thorough evaluation.\n       In view of these concerns, we urge you to reject calls for \n     the introduction of thousands of deadly weapons into the \n     cockpits of our aircraft.\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\n       Sincerely,\n         ATA Board of Directors: Carl D.

Weidemeyer, President, United \n           Parcel Service Airlines\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think there are 101,249 commercial airline pilots \nwith active pilot certificates. So we could have 100,000 running around \nhere with pistols. And, incidentally, possibly getting pistols on board \nfor the hijackers because you have to understand that hijacking has \nchanged now.\n  You don't just have an individual coming on board because he wants to \nfly to Cuba. You don't have somebody escaping criminal justice because \nhe wants to get out of the country. We know and we have been put on \nnotice, they have five-man teams, professional suicidal terrorists. Try \nthat on, Senator Smith. Try that on as a pilot. You are a big man. I \nthink Senator Smith could take care of two of them. I think he could \ntake care of two of them and, with a pistol, maybe take care of three. \nBut while he has already killed three, unloading, quick, the pistol, \nthey still have two more that are going to knock him down and take over \nthe other pilot.\n  You crack that door and you are a goner. You are not going to stop \nprofessional teams of suicidal attackers. I don't care how good a pilot \nor how much training you have had, it is not going to happen. That \nplane is going to be taken over.\n  Think about the situation where there is some disruption and I have a \npistol and some fellow is coming after me and I can defend myself. That \nis not the problem. The problem here is to prevent, if you please, \nSenator, an airline in the United States, a commercial airline, from \never being used as a weapon of mass destruction. You don't want to save \npeople from getting hurt or whatever else, but you save it, with all \nthat fuel aboard, from ever being run into the Chrysler Building, the \nEmpire State Building, the Sears Building, the Coca-Cola Building down \nthere in Atlanta--wherever they want to run it. They can make a mark if \nthey wiped out the Coca-Cola Building in Atlanta, I can tell you that. \nAnd that is the whole idea. It is not necessarily how many, but to get \nit on national news.\n  So it is that they commercially trade. They stay in country for at \nleast 2 years. They are disciplined. You never know they are here. They \ntrain at the gym every day, they are physically fit, and they go on-\nboard planes not with pistols but with box cutters, or whatever else \nthey have on them. But they know how to break in any ordinary cracked \ndoor and take over that plane. So you can't crack the door. They should \nnever be opened in flight--and we would have a 30-year record of no \nhijacks and never have this occur again.\n  There is one way I know of that I can guarantee the American public \nthe best security I can--if anybody can give that guarantee--is to take \nthe El Al procedure and protocol and follow it to the letter T. They \nhave a 30-year track record of success.\n  I will go ahead and read because they have something about testing. I \nam not worried about cost. I am not worried about testing. I am not \nworried about the professionalism in the trade. I am worried about this \nnever, ever happening again--no 9/11.\n  I am able, if I can get a majority of this body to go along with me \nand go along with the administration, to give the public that kind of \nassurance--that they can get on a plane; immediately the plane will \ntake off. You won't have the plane flying around above you, ``Hey, they \nare ready to shoot you down,'' because you have secured the cockpit \ndoor and there is not going to be any need to shoot down a plane. The \nplane itself is not going down because it was forced. You don't have to \nworry about it because it is going by a big building or a nuclear power \nplant. You don't have to worry about, 30 minutes after takeoff and 30 \nminutes before landing, keeping your seat, because you are not going to \nhave to worry about that kind of activity, and that is a silly rule, if \nI have ever heard one. It is one that we ought to be able to get rid \nof. You don't have to worry about taking off from Reagan National and \nrunning into the White House. You don't have to worry about that \nbecause as they take off, the door is secure. If they start storming \nthe door, they will land at Dulles with law enforcement to meet them. \nThat hijacking team knows they are going off to the jail. I have given \nthem the guarantee.\n  But if, in turn, you want to support these pistols in the cockpit and \nif you are going to guarantee that weaponry is there, we hope they can \nuse it. Getting it on the plane and keeping it in the cockpit--a secure \nlittle safe, or whatever it is--it is just a bad idea to arm a plane.\n  Let me read further, since the entire letter is one of particular \ninterest.\n  I quote from the letter from the Air Transport Association:\n\n       In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, we \n     understand the rationale for providing crewmembers with means \n     to defend themselves and their aircraft. However, we believe \n     that allowing guns aboard every aircraft in the absence of \n     comprehensive research and testing and without a full \n     evaluation of the potential consequences, is ill-advised.\n       A variety of serious safety, technical and training issues \n     have been raised that require answers prior to moving forward \n     with any proposal to allow the use of firearms by cockpit \n     crews. To ensure the safety and security of our customers and \n     employees, we have a duty and obligation to ask these tough \n     questions and to have a clear understanding of the answers. \n     Otherwise, innocent passengers and crewmembers could be \n     killed or injured--through accidental firings of weapons or, \n     worse, their being used against crews and passengers.\n       For example, what studies or testing have been conducted to \n     determine the effects of an accidental weapon discharge in a \n     pressurized aircraft at altitude, or discharge into a \n     sophisticated instrument panel? How will the firearm be \n     stowed, maintained and protected from misuse between flights, \n     particularly when the aircraft is parked overnight or \n     deployed in international operations?\n\n  Let me divert. There is a law in a lot of these countries that you \ncan't have a weapon. There is not going to be a weapon in a cockpit if \nyou land in downtown Heathrow. We know that. You have all kinds of \nconsiderations that come into this.\n  Let me further read from the letter:\n\n       What is the process to measure the ability of armed pilots \n     to handle a firearm in the close confines of the cockpit? \n     Will the training program disrupt the airline's ability to \n     operate their schedules?\n\n  How often are firearms utilized by trained law enforcement officers? \nWill they be lost, or misplaced? Will they be fired accidentally, or \nused against the officer carrying the weapon?\n  I have the figures on that. In some years, over 10 percent of law \nenforcement officers are killed when their own weapons are used against \nthem. I have all kinds of criminal statistics from the FBI.\n  I read further:\n\n       The Transportation Security Administration has testified \n     that the cost to the government for the program is \n     approximately $850 million.\n\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I am not \nworried about the cost. Some should be worried about costs. As of \nyesterday at 11 o'clock, the deficit was $394 billion, and by the end \nof the month it will exceed $400 billion. But you can see what they are \ndoing now. They are trying to offload expenditures into the next fiscal \nyear because they are worried about the campaign a couple of months \nfrom this time in November. And they have come from a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus. They already have created a $400 billion deficit. Nobody wants \nto talk about it. We asked corporate America for a certificate under \noath that we have gotten corporate America away from corruption--\ncertified by the CEO.\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nGet the CEO of the U.S. Government to certify his figure. No way, Jose.\n  I will go back. I read that sentence again in this letter.\n\n       The Transportation Security Administration has testified \n     that the cost to the government for the program is \n     approximately $850 million. In light of programs already \n     completed and underway to secure cockpit doors, we seriously \n     question the cost effectiveness of a program mandated in S. \n     2554 that would impose a further burden on scarce TSA \n     resources.\n\n  Therein I divert to join the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from California. I am not worried about the cost. I think they \nare right. When we are trying to prevent a 9/11, let us not start \ntalking money around here. When somebody is against something, they all \nwant to start talking money. But when I get up and try to get it paid \nfor, I can't find anybody who wants to pay.\n  Talking about Social Security, we have been using that as a piggy \nbank, and not a lockbox. Come on. We know it.\n\n       Indeed, with secure cockpit doors now being further \n     upgraded with even higher protective capabilities, the \n     advisability of introducing dangerous and unnecessary weapons \n     in the cockpit environment must be carefully considered.\n       Until such time as validated answers to these and other \n     questions are available, we believe that a decision to deploy \n     firearms aboard commercial aircraft raises a serious and \n     unnecessary risk for both passengers and crewmembers. Just as \n     we would not introduce an aircraft into service without \n     thorough testing, training of crewmembers and evaluating \n     all safety measures, no one should place deadly weapons in \n     the hands of flight crews without a thorough evaluation.\n       In view of these concerns, we urge you to reject calls for \n     the introduction of thousands of deadly weapons into the \n     cockpits of our aircraft.\n\n  I say to the Senator from California, you had a nice letter and \nthousands of pilots.

For a question, yes, ma'am, I am glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. The Senator always makes a great \nargument for his position, but I have to say, these are the very same \nairlines who have not given the flight attendants one new bit of \ntraining.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will agree with the Senator 100 percent. We have to \nget the flight attendants.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Good.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They are on the front lines. We call them in a war, the \nMLR, the main line of resistance. With my door secure, it is the flight \nattendants who are going to have to defends themselves while getting \nthe plane down to the ground.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator is with us on that. I want to make the \npoint, though, as you name the names of folks who are good folks and \ngood business-people--some better business-people than others--they \nhave not embraced a lot of things that you and I embrace. In this case \nyou agree with them, But they are not in the planes. They fly around in \ntheir own corporate jets.\n  I say to my friend, it is the flight attendants, the pilots, and the \npassengers in the planes. I honestly think if you want to look to who \nthe leaders are on safety, I would rather look to the pilots and the \nflight attendants.\n  But I know my friend feels very strongly about the cockpit doors, and \nI so agree with him. I just want to pose this question to him. He will \nhave the floor as long as he wants, although I hope we can reach some \nagreement on the doors so we can end this lengthy debate.\n  The Kevlar doors, which have been put into some of the JetBlue \nplanes, to me, are a tremendous answer because you cannot penetrate \nthat Kevlar door if it is kept shut.\n  So I want to know if my friend had seen a demonstration of that \nKevlar. And as we work together on the committee, I want to work with \nyou on those doors. But I hope we can accommodate you in this bill and \nthat we can bring this to a vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right. Well, I don't know about agreeing to the vote. I \nwant to hear some more. I might be persuaded by the Senator from \nGeorgia or the Senator from New Hampshire. I am sure they are going to \nhave more to say.\n  But, yes, one, on the flight attendants, absolutely we have to. And \nwe have that hearing next week. And we finally have someone in charge \nof airline security. You know it. I think you like Admiral Loy. I like \nAdmiral Loy. He is the bipartisan choice of the committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So, working with him, we are going to find out his \nsteps, and when, and get realistic drop-dead dates, and so forth, \nespecially airports--that they can't be rebuilt--and get this equipment \nin and everything else.\n  I remember the distinguished Senator said: Look, they make them out \nin my backyard, and they are only making seven a month. They can make \n50 a month if they have the orders.\n  This was last year.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They were not ordering all the things. They were \nwondering about the curtains in the office and the logo. Do you not \nremember?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So we are together on that. I will agree with you on \nthe flight attendants and anything else we can possibly get done to \nincrease safety, and more than anything else, get the airline business \nback up and going.\n  I am very much disturbed that we could adopt the Smith-Boxer \namendment, and you could have a plane being used as a weapon of mass \ndestruction. There isn't any question about it. It is not going to be \none fellow, and one fellow defending himself in the cockpit. I can see \nit now, with the flight attendant outside saying, ``He's killing me''--\nwhatever it is--``Open the door.'' Once that door is slightly cracked, \nthey have their team, and they will have practiced how to take over \nthat plane.\n  They will take the shots, the first two or something like that, but \nthe other three will get in and have that plane. And they will have \ncontrol and they will have pistols. They will take that pistol away. I \ncan tell you that here and now.\n  So you have really weaponized the aircraft, which El Al says do not \never do that. I can tell you that right now. Don't weaponize. They do \nnot have weapons in the cockpit.\n  With that having been said, that is why I feel as strongly as I do. \nWe have had the tests. I agree with the distinguished colleagues. We \nare not worried about cost in this instance. We have already spent $15 \nbillion to keep people economically going. To save one life, I would \nspend another $15 billion. So it is not the cost; it is not the \ntraining; this is a tested and true program of never having had a \nhijacking in 30 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I believe that my timing could have been \na little better.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator from Georgia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. MILLER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have heard a lot of the debate--not all of the debate--\nand I\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nhave had a number of Senators from both sides who are interested in \nknowing when they could leave. I was trying to figure out a better way \nto say that. I wonder if there is any idea now from the Senators \ninvolved--Senators Boxer, Smith, and Hollings--as to how much longer is \nneeded to debate this before we have a vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not quite yet.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might just answer the question this way: I would \nsay, in all honesty, the ball is in the court of my chairman, Chairman \nHollings. We have a couple of people who want to talk, but they are not \nasking for a lot of time. They have brief comments. But as soon as the \nSenator from South Carolina believes he is ready, we are ready. We do \nnot have anything else we have to add. So we are working with him. We \nare trying to work with him on the issue of cockpit doors. We are \nhoping that it will occur to him to perhaps support us or at least \nallow us to have a vote. We just have to wait and see.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nGeorgia yielding. I just say this: I can remember when the Senator \noffered his amendment, which was adopted overwhelmingly, on the energy \nbill that pickups would not be subject to SUV guidelines. And I had a \nconversation with the Senator from Georgia at that time that I thought \nit should be a requirement that all pickups sold in the United States \nshould come out with gun racks. Do you remember that, Senator?\n  Mr. MILLER. I would be happy not to make any remarks and we vote \nright now. I am not anxious to follow Senator Hollings in this debate. \nBut if we are not going to have a vote right now, then I think I will \nmake some remarks.\n  Mr. REID. I think you should proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, as I started to say, my timing could be \nsomewhat better than following my good friend from South Carolina.\n  No one in this body or outside of this body has more respect, more \nadmiration, and more downright affection for someone than I do for the \nSenator from South Carolina. His record as Lieutenant Governor, as \nGovernor, and as Senator for 35 years is stuff of which legends are \nmade. On this issue, unfortunately, I disagree with him, because I rise \ntoday in support of this amendment.\n  Our airline pilots are among the most highly trained professionals in \nall of the American workforce. Every day millions of Americans put \ntheir lives in the hands of airline pilots, and we have great reason to \ngive them our trust.\n  Thanks to literally thousands and thousands of hours of training, \ncommercial airline pilots have made aviation our Nation's safest form \nof public transportation. But since September 11, our Nation's pilots \nare faced with a grave new danger: Homicidal fanatics who think nothing \nof using our airplanes to kill themselves and as many Americans as they \ncan.\n  With these new threats, the American public has uniformly called for \ngiving the pilots every measure of protection possible in order to make \nour skies safer.\n  But there are some folks who are leery of putting their trust in our \nNation's pilots. I cannot understand the logic that says we can trust \nsomeone with a Boeing 747 in bad weather, but we cannot trust that same \nperson with a Glock 9 millimeter.\n  The folks who oppose arming pilots say we should put our trust \nelsewhere. We have heard about making the doors stronger. We have heard \nabout security screeners. The Senator from California talked about the \nrecent examples in the airports in New York where so many went through \nwith things that they should not have had in their luggage. We all know \nhow that is. We travel. We see it. Deep down we know it is a screening \nprocess that our Nation's Transportation Security Administration's own \nstudies show fails one out of every four times. So let's face it, if \nour pilots were failing one out of every four landings, America would \nnot be putting our trust in them to keep us safe.\n  Our Nation's air safety plan has multiple levels, from little steps \nsuch as banning nail clippers, all the way up to authorizing military \nfighter aircraft to shoot down a commercial jetliner filled with \ninnocent passengers.\n  Why is there not--somewhere between banning nail clippers and \nshooting down the plane, somewhere between those two extremes--some \nroom for allowing a trained pilot to use a handgun to defend the \ncockpit?\n  Some critics have worried what might happen if terrorists got hold of \nthe gun, to which I would answer: Nothing worse than if terrorists got \ncontrol of the aircraft. Others wonder what happens if a bullet goes \nastray in the fight with a terrorist. Could it damage the aircraft? I \nwould answer: Yes, but not nearly as much as a missile that would be \nfired at the aircraft if terrorists took control.\n  If you have any doubts about how the American public feels about this \nsubject, ask them this question: If you had to choose between flying on \nan airline with pilots who were armed to protect the cockpit and an \nairline whose pilots were unarmed, which would you choose? I am \nconvinced they would overwhelmingly choose to fly with armed pilots, \nand I am just as convinced that terrorists would prefer to fly with \ndefenseless pilots.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment to train \nand arm our Nation's airline pilots. I, for one, trust our Nation's \npilots to keep me safe when I fly. But I want to give them more than \njust my trust. I want to give them the training and the tools they need \nto keep all Americans safe in the air.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have recently--in fact, today--\nreceived a copy of a letter that was addressed to me as well as \nprimarily to Senator Hollings, chairman of the Commerce Committee. I \nthink it is an important letter.\n  The views of the administration should be considered, as is always \nthe case or should always be the case when we are dealing with issues. \nThis one, of course, is very emotional and, frankly, an issue which has \nbeen polarizing in some respects.\n  I would like to read this letter that was delivered today. I hope my \ncolleagues will pay attention to some of the concerns raised here and \nperhaps understand that there are some difficult issues that need to be \naddressed. Among them are training, cockpit modifications, coordination \nwith other nations and international airlines--for example, landing in \na country that has stricter gun control laws--and complying with State \nand local gun control laws. As we know, there are different laws in \ndifferent States, the issue of legal liability, support organization, \nand the cost. So I would like to read this letter that was sent by \nAdmiral Loy to Senator Hollings with a copy to me:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, This responds to your letter to me of \n     August 1, 2002. I wanted to answer your question on my views \n     about whether and how to arm flight deck crews operating \n     commercial aircraft. The balance of the questions in your \n     letter will be addressed by separate correspondence, which I \n     will send you later this week.\n\n  This letter is from Admiral Loy, the new acting Under Secretary for \nthe Transportation Security Administration.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       After I began work as the Acting Under Secretary at the \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and following \n     the vote in July by the House of Representatives supporting a \n     program to arm pilots with lethal weapons, Secretary Mineta \n     asked me to review the range of issues associated with a \n     voluntary deployment of guns in the cockpit. His concern and \n     mine is, above all, to ensure the safety of airline \n     passengers and crew. I have finished my review and wanted to \n     share my conclusions and concerns with you while the \n     discussion continues in the Congress.\n       Our review included significant outreach in which we sought \n     counsel from airlines, pilots, airports, the FAA and numerous \n     federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Secret \n     Service and ATF. The study team evaluated a range of \n     deployment and training options and numerous associated \n     policy and budget issues. The review was intended to reach \n     general conclusions and also to outline the elements of the \n     general protocols to be followed if a decision was made to \n     arm pilots. A core assumption of pending legislation, and \n     also of our review, was that any program would be carried out \n     by volunteer pilots who would receive training consistent \n     with the designation as armed Federal Flight Deck Officers.\n       We concluded that if legislation is passed authorizing a \n     program to arm pilots with lethal weapons, it would be \n     preferable if pilots\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\n     were individually issued lockboxes that would be used to \n     transport their weapons to and from the aircraft. They would \n     be trained on weapon use and their responsibilities under the \n     program, and subject to periodic evaluation. The pilots would \n     be responsible for maintenance and proper care of the weapon. \n     We determined that the alternative program design--having \n     general use weapons stored aboard an aircraft and maintained \n     by a cadre of airline employees--poses greater security \n     risks, operational complexity and cost.\n       Many of the federal law enforcement experts we consulted \n     continue to have significant concerns about arming pilots \n     with either lethal or non-lethal weapons. The airline \n     industry shares these concerns. The Board of Directors of the \n     Air Transport Association has sent Secretary Mineta a letter \n     signed by twenty-one airline chief executive officers urging \n     a cautious approach to arming pilots and outling their \n     concerns (attached).\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the board of directors \nof the Air Transport Association, sent to Secretary Mineta, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                    Air Transport Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Norman Y. Mineta,\n     Secretary, Department of Transportation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: With the safety of our passengers and \n     crewmembers as our number one priority, we are writing to \n     convey our thoughts regarding S. 2554 that would permit the \n     use of firearms by pilots aboard commercial aircraft. As \n     discussions continue on the merits of this subject, we stand \n     ready to work with Congress and the Administration in an \n     effort to reach a prudent consensus position.\n       In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, we \n     understand the rationale for providing crewmembers with means \n     to defend themselves and their aircraft. However, we believe \n     that allowing guns aboard every aircraft in the absence of \n     comprehensive research and testing and without a full \n     evaluation of the potential consequences, is ill-advised.\n       A variety of serious safety, technical and training issues \n     have been raised that require answers prior to moving forward \n     with any proposal to allow the use of firearms by cockpit \n     crews. To ensure the safety and security of our customers and \n     employees, we have a duty and obligation to ask these tough \n     questions and to have a clear understanding of the answers. \n     Otherwise, innocent passengers and crewmembers could be \n     killed or injured.\n       For example, what studies or testing have been conducted to \n     determine the effects of an accidental weapon discharge in a \n     pressurized aircraft at altitude, or discharge into a \n     sophisticated instrument panel? How will the firearm be \n     stowed, maintained and protected from misuse between flights, \n     particularly when the aircraft is parked overnight or \n     deployed in international operations? What is the process to \n     measure the ability of armed pilots to handle a firearm in \n     the close confines of the cockpit? Will the training program \n     disrupt the airline's ability to operate their schedules?\n       The Transportation Security Administration has testified \n     that the cost to the government for the program is \n     approximately $850 million. In light of programs already \n     completed and underway to secure cockpit doors, we seriously \n     question the cost effectiveness of a program mandated in S. \n     2554 that would impose a further burden on scarce TSA \n     resources. Indeed, with secure cockpit doors now being \n     further upgraded with even higher protective capabilities, \n     the advisability of introducing dangerous and unnecessary \n     weapons in the cockpit environment must be carefully \n     considered.\n       Until such time as validated answers to these and other \n     questions are available, we believe that a decision to deploy \n     firearms aboard commercial aircraft raises a serious and \n     unnecessary risk for both passengers and crewmembers. Just as \n     we would not introduce an aircraft into service without \n     thorough testing, training of crewmembers and evaluating all \n     safety measures, no one should place deadly weapons in the \n     hands of flight crews without a thorough evaluation.\n       In view of these concerns, we urge you to consider a more \n     pragmatic, thoughtful approach that does not interject \n     excessive risks and consequences for the traveling public and \n     our employees. Moving forward, you can rest assured we will \n     continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that air \n     travel remains the world's safest form of transportation.\n           Sincerely,\n         ATA Board of Directors: Carl D.

Continuing from Admiral Loy's letter to Chairman \nHollings:\n\n       We agree that there are literally dozens of issues that \n     would need to be resolved as part of a program involving \n     lethal weapons. Let me mention a few such issues or \n     questions.\n\n  The next topic that he brings up is entitled ``Training curricula and \nprogram design.''\n\n       We estimate that some 85,000 pilots may be eligible for the \n     program authorized by the House. In order to avoid \n     significant safety and security risk, a detailed, effective \n     training program must be designed from scratch and tested. \n     This must include firearms training and safety instruction. \n     It would include classroom training on numerous issues, such \n     as airport security procedures that would be established for \n     airline employees to carry weapons through airports, and the \n     legal liability and responsibilities of employees and \n     airlines when a weapon is carried on duty and off duty. It \n     must include specific training about the circumstances under \n     which the weapon may be used onboard the aircraft and outside \n     the aircraft at airports and within the community at large. \n     It must establish protocols and communications tools to \n     coordinate a pilot's responsibilities with those of Federal \n     Air Marshals and other law enforcement officers authorized to \n     travel armed. It is possible that special training facilities \n     would be needed for high-volume training, so that the program \n     could incorporate at least some practice in a simulated \n     aircraft environment, such as is provided to our Federal Air \n     Marshals.\n       Cockpit modifications. In order to allow ready access to \n     the weapon in the cockpit while securing it appropriately, it \n     would be necessary to install special sleeves for the weapons \n     in each cockpit. Obviously each different aircraft will raise \n     different design and installation considerations. It would be \n     necessary for TSA, the airlines and aircraft manufacturers to \n     assess these issues in more detail.\n       Coordination with other nations and international airlines. \n     There are numerous thorny issues that must be resolved with \n     foreign nations and foreign airlines. For example, pilots \n     flying international routes for a U.S. carrier must comply \n     with gun control laws abroad. In order to avoid conflict, \n     TSA, with the support of other federal agencies, would need \n     to undertake extensive coordination with countries around the \n     globe to clarify rights and responsibilities of airline \n     employees traveling armed. Would we authorize the employees \n     of foreign air carriers to participate in this program? Would \n     we provide reciprocal access to the U.S. if other nations \n     design similar programs to arm pilots? What type of \n     background investigation would be possible and necessary? Who \n     would pay?\n       Complying with state and local gun control laws. We have \n     only begun to assess the issues associated with complying \n     with state and local gun control laws. Our review suggests \n     that some meaningful legal work and coordination would be an \n     early task for the program.\n       Legal liability. There are numerous and complex issues of \n     legal liability that need careful, thorough review. These \n     relate to the pilots, flight crews, other airline employees, \n     the airlines, airports, vendors supporting the program and \n     individuals who provide training to the pilots participating \n     in the program.\n       A large support organization. A worldwide program of this \n     size would require sizable staff and support. Existing TSA \n     headquarters functions would be considerably stretched in \n     order to manage the program, track the inventory of federal \n     weapons and investigate accidental weapon discharges, \n     program operation and public complaints.\n       Cost. Our preliminary estimate is that a program involving \n     all commercial pilots could cost up to $900 million for the \n     start-up and some $250 million annually thereafter. Of course \n     these estimates must be refined to reflect details of an \n     actual program, including the possibility that fewer than all \n     commercial pilots will participate. These estimates do not \n     include any projections for necessary cockpit modifications \n     to accommodate ready access to the firearms. The total \n     program costs may vary widely according to program design \n     decisions, but any program open to all pilots would be very \n     expensive. TSA's current budget does not allow for further \n     work in this area, which raises the question of who will bear \n     the cost of this potentially expensive program.\n       I am convinced that if there is to be responsible \n     legislation establishing a program\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\n     to allow guns in the cockpit, it must address the numerous \n     safety, security, cost and operational issues raised by TSA's \n     review, and should enable us to implement the program in a \n     methodical, careful, and pragmatic manner.\n       I remain committed to working with the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives on this important issue. I have provided \n     an identical copy of this letter to Senator McCain. Thank you \n     for your interest and leadership in this matter and I look \n     forward to our hearing next Tuesday.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                     James M. Loy,\n                                           Acting Under Secretary.\n  The reason I read this letter is that I think it is important for us \nto understand there are a lot of complexities involved with \nimplementing a program of this nature. I know there are certain foreign \ncountries where no one is allowed to carry or possess a weapon under \nany circumstances--certainly not a hand weapon, if it is not for \nhunting purposes. I know there are different laws in different States \nas far as weapons control is concerned.\n  I wonder who is going to pay the $900 million for startup and some \n$250 million annually thereafter. I think that issue should be \naddressed here. I visited with the CEO of a major airline this morning \nwho made a compelling case that the major airlines in the United States \nare in deep and serious trouble. One major airline just declared \nbankruptcy. Others are convinced that another major airline will be \ndeclaring bankruptcy soon.\n  Who is going to pay for this program? Are we going to lay it on the \nairlines, or are we going to lay it on the taxpayers of America?\n  Legal liability is always a question whenever we embark on a program \nthat involves the use of weapons. The support organization at TSA, I \nthink, is a legitimate question. Right now, we are facing a deadline of \nthe end of the year for installation of devices that would check all \nluggage. We all know that isn't going to happen. We are undergoing the \ntransition from private companies to Federal employees at our airports.\n  So what I am asking is that the sponsors of the legislation, who \nobviously feel very strongly on this issue, make sure that, as we enact \nthis legislation--and I am convinced there will be a significant vote \nin support of this amendment--these issues are adequately addressed. I \nthink these issues warrant our concern and our attention. There are \nvery small airplanes--for example, commuter aircraft--that carry a \nsizable number of passengers. How are we going to put those weapons in \nthose very small cockpits? I am sure there is a way, but I want to \nimpress upon my colleagues that there is a lot of complexity associated \nwith this issue as outlined by Admiral Loy, and there are other \nconcerns that I think we deserve to know at least some of the solutions \nfor as we address this amendment and this issue, which has already been \npassed by the other body and, I am confident, would be passed by a \nlarge vote here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to support this amendment, \nwhich would enable those we already entrust with our lives on \nairplanes--namely, pilots and flight attendants--to have the tools and \nthe training they need to disable terrorists in the air.\n  Since September 11th, we have taken many steps to make it safer to \nfly. For all the agency's troubles, the creation of the Transportation \nSafety Administration has been a step forward. Airlines themselves have \nbeefed up their security. Airports like Bradley International Airport \nin Windsor Locks, Connecticut--which I toured last month--have made \nvery visible progress. And so much of this progress has resulted from \nbetter collaboration and cooperation, which bodes well for the creation \nof a Department of Homeland Security.\n  But we still have a long way to go and a short time to get there. I \nwas disturbed by an investigative report in yesterday's New York Daily \nNews. Let me read you the opening:\n\n       Carry-on bags concealing potentially deadly weapons. Six \n     major airlines. Eleven airports. Fourteen flights. And not \n     once did anyone catch on.\n       To test the supposedly more stringent security imposed at \n     the nation's airports after the Sept. 11 attacks, Daily News \n     reporters boarded flights over the Labor Day weekend carrying \n     contraband--including box cutters, razor knives and pepper \n     spray.\n       Not a single airport security checkpoint spotted or \n     confiscated any of the dangerous items, all of which have \n     been banned from airports and planes by federal authorities.\n\n  Obviously we must fix these lapses without further delay. But at the \nsame time, we have to realize no matter what security procedures we put \nin place on the ground, they won't be failsafe. We need a security \nnetwork that's flexible enough to protect passengers from danger even \nif one link in the chain breaks down.\n  The reality is, if a dangerous person has managed to get on a plane \nwith a weapon or an explosive device, there is one last line of \ndefense: the people on the plane. We need to make sure that last line \nof defense is a strong line of defense.\n  Having our flight crew carry weapons has been carefully considered in \nboth houses of Congress. We've thought through stun guns as an \nalternative, but it turns out they are unreliable, and the cockpit is \ntoo small to use them effectively. While potential concerns and \ncomplications about equipping pilots with firearms have been raised, in \nthe end, this idea just makes sense.\n  It is also important to note that this amendment provides much-needed \ntraining and communications capability for the cabin crew. These \nprovisions will prepare flight attendants, who are often the first to \nencounter potential hijackers on a flight, to handle such threats. \nFlight attendants will also have improved communications with the \ncockpit in the event of an emergency.\n  Besides the fact that firearms can actually give our flight crews a \npractical advantage over terrorists in the air--if it comes down to \nthat--sending the message that the good guys will be armed gives us an \nimportant psychological advantage as well. The mere fact that a pilot \nor co-pilot could have a lethal weapon should be a powerful deterrent \nto would-be terrorists.\n  We will never forget the heroism of the men and women on Flight 93 \nwho resisted the highjackers and brought down that plane, which may \nwell have been headed in our direction. It is in their spirit that this \namendment should be considered. The flight crew isn't a passive target. \nIt is an active force that can fight back against anyone who seeks to \nhijack a plane or use it as a weapon ever again.\n  Of course we need to secure the cockpit door. Of course we need to \nmake sure that the passengers are screened effectively for weapons. Of \ncourse we need to have high-quality, well-trained air marshals on our \nflights. But we should also take this sane, sensible step of training \nand equipping our flight crews, who we already entrust with our lives, \nwith the tools they need to protect us.\n  I strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am unable to support the amendment by \nmy colleagues Senator Smith and Senator Boxer to arm pilots on \ncommercial flights because I am concerned that such a proposal would \ninvite gun fights in the cockpit.\n  I believe that federal air marshals are the individuals best suited \nto handle any terrorist situation which might arise on a flight, and am \nfully supportive of providing the financial resources necessary to hire \nadditional air marshals. Although this amendment would provide \nsignificant training for pilots to handle firearms, I remain concerned \nthat in an emergency situation their concentration should be focused on \nflying the plane, not dealing with attackers in the passenger cabin.\n  I do strongly support the provision in the amendment which would \nprovide self-defense training for flight attendants, however I simply \ndo not believe it is worth the risk to have the availability of guns in \nthe cockpit which could fall into terrorist hands.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague, Senator Bob Smith, the Arming \nPilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002. This amendment \nsends a strong message to would-be terrorists and acts as a significant \ndeterrent against the hijacking of America's planes.\n  As a last line of defense in potential terrorist attacks, I believe \nthat pilots who want to should have the ability to carry firearms in \norder to defend the cockpit. This is a policy that makes sense. An \noverwhelming majority of the American public supports arming\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\npilots. Counterterrorism experts believe that firearms are the best \ndeterrent when it comes to cockpit security.\n  I have heard from large numbers of pilots and constituents from my \nhome state of Utah who advocate for the ability of pilots to carry guns \nto protect the cockpit. It is my hope that this amendment will help \nensure that all who travel on airlines feel safe, including pilots, \nflight attendants, and most importantly, the public. While I support \nthe right of pilots to carry weapons on-board aircraft, at the same \ntime, it is important for them to receive the proper training to be \nable to discharge a firearm in the cockpit safely and effectively.\n  I also support the language in this amendment that exempts the \nairlines and pilots from liability as they attempt to defend our \nairplanes. This is an industry that has been struggling, even before \nthe tragic events of September 11th. We must not further burden these \ncompanies with what could eventually be frivolous lawsuits that would \nendanger the domestic airline industries very existence. I am \nencouraged to see that this important issue is addressed in Senator \nSmith's amendment.\n  I must add that, while there are many worthy aspects to this \namendment, portions of it give me pause. The foremost issue is who \nbears the burden of its cost. At a time when Congress has critically-\nimportant decisions to make as we face our responsibility to improve \nour national aviation and homeland security procedures, we must balance \nthose responsibilities with our commitment that many of us made to our \nconstituents to spend within our means and avoid increased deficit \nspending.\n  This amendment could have serious unintended consequences. As part of \nour nation's aviation and homeland security policy, the Federal \nGovernment is already paying for Federal air marshals, the \nfederalization of the baggage screening process, and reinforced cockpit \ndoors. These are important safety measures that I strongly support. The \nTransportation Security Administration estimates this amendment will \ninitially cost approximately $884 million, of which the majority, $865 \nmillion, will go to pay for training, requalification, equipment, \nbackground checks, program management, and direct course costs for \n85,000 pilots over a period of two years. And at least $264 million of \nthe $885 million will be recurring costs. Furthermore, an additional \n$16.5 million will need to be allocated for the purchase and \ninstallation of gun storage boxes on airplanes. That being said, I \ndon't think that the airline industry can afford to pay these training \ncosts either.\n  Serious questions must be raised about having the Federal Government \nshouldering the costs of training. The amendment not only allows for \npilots to be trained, but flight attendants as well. I strongly support \nthe ability of these individuals to carry weapons onboard planes after \nthey have received proper training, I am concerned about the Federal \nGovernment picking up the tab.\n  While I have reservations over a few of the provisions of this bill, \non the other hand, it can readily be argued that no legislation \nallowing pilots to be armed if they wish might compromise the safety of \nour skies. This is not a perfect piece of legislation, but on balance, \nI think it is a needed one. I will vote for this amendment in order to \ntake an additional step to help ensure the safety of our airlines and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \namendment to establish a program to permit pilots to defend their \naircraft against acts of criminal violence or air piracy. This \nlegislation will provide a critical last line of defense to secure \ncommercial aircraft, allowing qualified pilots to carry firearms.\n  The legislation requires the Under Secretary of Transportation for \nSecurity to establish a program not later than 90 days after the date \nof enactment to deputize qualified volunteer pilots as Federal law \nenforcement officers to defend the cockpits of commercial aircraft in \nflight against acts of criminal violence or air piracy. Pilots who are \ndeputized will be known as ``Federal Flight Deck Officers'' and will be \nauthorized to carry a firearm and use force--including deadly force--\nagainst an individual in defense of an aircraft.\n  I was disappointed that the Department of Transportation initially \nopposed this effort. Recently the Department has indicated its support \nfor a limited pilot program. While important steps to improve the \nsecurity of our airports and protect the flying public have been taken, \nthe tragic events of last September 11th demonstrated our enemies will \nstop at nothing to inflict harm on Americans and destroy our way of \nlife. Our response must be equally as determined and resolute. We must \nnot take half measures or engage in wishful thinking. We must not \nrefrain from utilizing every tool we possess. We must enable those who \npilot commercial passenger aircraft to defend against any threat and \nprotect the safety of their aircraft and passengers. And finally, we \nmust do so without further delay. This amendment properly addresses \nthose concerns and I strongly support its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We are very close to having a vote on this amendment. \nSenators Boxer and Smith worked out the problem with the Commerce \nCommittee. I am grateful for that. The only speaker I know of is \nSenator Murkowski, who wishes to speak for about 5 minutes on this \nissue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that as soon as he completes his statement, \nthe Senator from California be recognized to modify her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate then vote with \nrespect to the Reid for Boxer-Smith amendment No. 4492; that upon \ndisposition of that amendment, the Smith amendment No. 4491, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So Members should be advised that at approximately 4:55 \nthere will be a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I didn't hear the time of the vote.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as the Senator has finished.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am proud to join Senator Smith, \nSenator Boxer, and others. I was one of the original Members joining \nSenator Smith in this effort, which allows commercial pilots the right \nto carry firearms in defense of their aircraft.\n  We have heard the explanation given time and again, if indeed an \naircraft is hijacked and you happen to be on that plane, that there is \nthe authority to take that airplane down with a military jet, an F-l6, \nor whatever. I think any Member, if asked would they support having the \npilot in command of the aircraft having a weapon of some kind, a \nhandgun, as a last line of defense, that virtually every Member of this \nbody would say absolutely, anything other than the alternative, which \nwould be to take the aircraft down.\n  I have listened to the debate here off and on today, and I would like \nto comment a little bit. The Senator from South Carolina is interested \nin the secure doors.\n  Some of the airlines are putting secure doors on their aircraft. They \nare doing it currently at their own expense. I just took a flight \nacross the country, and the cockpit door was opened six times by either \nthe pilot or copilot on a 5\\1/2\\ hour flight. At least two times it was \nopened to provide food access into the cockpit. So that cockpit door \nwas opened eight times during that flight.\n  That is the harsh reality. We do not have the capability to feed nor \nto provide restroom facilities for the crew. We are certainly not going \nto retrofit all the aircraft in the skies immediately with those \ncapabilities in the cockpit. So we are going to have the potential \nrisk.\n  While those who perhaps commute short distances feel secure because \nof a closed cockpit, we do not have that on a cross-country flight. \nThat is the harsh reality.\n  It is also apparent, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out, that \nthere is some difficulty in implementing the program. The idea of \nsecure doors and the question of who pays for it, obviously, are \nconcerns of the airline industry. How the guns are managed, if you\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nwill, is a concern of the airlines. Their business, obviously, is \nreducing the amount of administrative authority they can, but our job \nis protecting the public.\n  If, indeed, history proves itself, as it appears to have done in a \ncouple of instances, one occurred on a FedEx cargo plane. During \ntakeoff, the crew was overpowered by an individual who was a crew \nmember who happened to be deadheading on the flight, and he attacked \nthem with a hammer. There was a tremendous fight in the cockpit. This \naircraft was fully loaded with fuel and freight, but the crew managed \nto subdue this individual with the weapon they were able to take away \nfrom the individual who initiated the attack and land that aircraft \nsafely. It was a hammer. It was very bloody. Nevertheless, it proved \nthat the crew was willing to do whatever they could to stop that \naircraft from crashing. I gather it was to crash into some of the FedEx \nfacilities.\n  If we look at the concerns expressed in the general discussion about \nsecure doors, we cannot secure the door; it is going to be opened from \ntime to time. There is talk about changing the air pressure of the \naircraft by puncturing the hull. An air marshal is obviously trained. \nIf there is an altercation of some nature, there is as much chance of \npenetrating the hull by him. Evidence has shown there is not an \nexplosion, there is a decompression, and a decompression is manageable \nby the cockpit crew.\n  As we look at the alternatives, it is clear that the airlines oppose \nthis because they are not in the business of managing guns. Their \nbottom line is transporting passengers. It does create problems. But if \nwe look at how we are implementing the security program in this \ncountry, it was not very well thought out. I am not suggesting that as \nan example. Nevertheless, we are looking at a first rather I should say \nlast line of defense which is probably more correct.\n  We have debated this back and forth. We as legislators, and certainly \nas passengers, have to recognize we trust the flight crew with our very \nsafety and security, and we should give them all the tools to complete \nthat task. That is the reason I am standing with my friend, Senator \nSmith, on this legislation. It is first and foremost an attempt to \nincrease the level of safety aboard our commercial airliners.\n  My State of Alaska has many small planes. There are firearms \navailable for various reasons: If the plane goes down or if a passenger \nattempts to overcome the crew. As we look at the question of guns in \nthe cockpit, there is a great inconsistency. One is the inconsistency \nassociated with sky marshals, and the other is associated with the \nrealization that we would simply be arming pilots who are highly \ntrained.\n  I do not think there is any question about the substance of this \namendment. It provides a greater level of safety. I think most of the \npilots would agree they, too, want to have this capability and are \nprepared to use it in an appropriate manner.\n  I do not take this legislation lightly. This amendment does not \ncavalierly attempt to hand out guns to flight crews, and wish them the \nbest.\n  Because of September 11, 2001, and the tactics used by the hijackers \nthat day, we must change the way aircraft and passengers are protected. \nThe amendment is an important part of that effort.\n  As many in this body are aware, there is a large percentage of pilots \nwho have served in the military and law enforcement. In fact, many also \nserve as reservists in the different branches of the military. These \npilots have been trained in the use of weaponry. Why not utilize the \ntrained personnel already on hand?\n  The Airline Pilots Association supports this concept and has written \nto the F.B.I. requesting a program to train cockpit personnel. I have \nheard from many pilots in Alaska and around the country that support \nit. So why not further enhance the chances of passenger and aircraft \nsurvival?\n  I applaud the administration and this Congress for moving quickly to \nsecure cockpit cabins, adding needed Sky Marshals, improving airport \nperimeter security, training screening personnel, and increasing flight \ndeck security.\n  But we must also afford passengers the utmost in security after the \nplane has cleared the runway. Arming pilots is not the only solution, \nbut it is an important component.\n  The pilots know they need it. The passengers will support it. And \nthis Congress should pass it. I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nadd Senators Tim Hutchinson, Craig Thomas, and Strom Thurmond as \noriginal cosponsors, and I thank my colleague from South Carolina for \nhis cooperation. I appreciate it very much. I again thank my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, for her leadership, and I thank Senator Reid for his \ncooperation as well.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4492, as further modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote in 2 minutes. I am \ngoing to wrap up in 2 minutes. I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk. I want to explain to my colleagues that this is a \nmodification that has been written by Senator Hollings. It will result \nin the cockpit door remaining closed during the flight except for \nmechanical emergencies or physiological emergencies.\n  This is an issue on which Senator Hollings has been a very strong and \nsometimes lone voice. We are very proud to accommodate him, and we \nhope, therefore, he will be with us on this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4492), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON OPENING COCKPIT DOORS IN FLIGHT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 449 of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 44917. PROHIBITION ON OPENING COCKPIT DOORS IN FLIGHT\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The door to the flight deck of any \n     aircraft engaged in passenger air transportation or \n     interstate air transportation that is required to have a door \n     between the passenger and pilot compartment under title 14, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, shall remain closed and locked \n     at all times during flight except for mechanical or \n     physiological emergencies.\n       ``(b) Mantrap Door Exception.--It shall not be a violation \n     of subsection (a) for an authorized person to enter or leave \n     the flight deck during flight of any aircraft described in \n     subsection (a) that is equipped with double doors between the \n     flight deck and the passenger compartment that are designed \n     so that--\n       ``(1) any person entering or leaving the flight deck is \n     required to lock the first door through which that person \n     passes before the second door can be opened; and\n       ``(2) the flight crew is able to monitor by remote camera \n     the area between the 2 doors and prevent the door to the \n     flight deck from being unlocked from that area.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     449 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     after the item relating to section 44916 the following:\n       ``44917. Prohibition on opening cockpit doors in flight.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in closing this debate, I thank everyone, \nparticularly Senator Smith for his amazing work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to the flight attendants and the \npilots who worked so hard to help us get this to a vote today: Your \nwork will be rewarded. You are, in many cases, the last line of defense \nwith the fact that our security checkpoints are failing, unfortunately. \nThey are doing better, but they are not where they should be, and \ncontraband is getting on to the planes, coupled with the fact that our \nmilitary has orders to shoot down a plane that has been taken over by \nhijackers. Let's give this program a chance. Let's give people a chance \nto save their lives and the lives of the crew, the passengers and, \nfrankly, the people on the ground.\n  This is important for homeland security, to make sure we are doing \neverything to avoid another 9/11. I ask for an aye vote.\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we vote--and the vote will occur \nmomentarily--I have spoken to the majority leader, and this will be the \nlast vote tonight. I will also indicate the majority leader has \nindicated we will come in on Monday at 12 o'clock. We will have an hour \nof morning business, and at 1 o'clock we will vote on a judicial \nnomination, or if we do not work something out on the cloture motion \nthat was filed today, we will vote on that on Monday. We will have a \npro forma session in the morning, and that would ripen on Monday.\n  We are going to have to vote on Monday at 1 o'clock either on a \njudicial nomination or cloture on drought assistance.\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation today. We have been able to move \nforward two very important amendments on this very important \nlegislation. I have spoken with Senator Thompson. We have not cleared \nthis with Senator Byrd and others. We want to make sure Senator \nThompson has the first amendment when we come back on Monday, and \nfollowing that, Senator Byrd will have the next amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4492, as further \nmodified.

Under the previous order, amendment No. 4491, \nas amended, is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider is laid on the \ntable.\n  The amendment (No. 4491), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Bayh in \noffering an amendment to the homeland security bill.\n  It is a straighforward amendment designed to improve and strengthen \nthe protection of our Department of Defense installations which contain \nthe storage and destruction facilities for our Nation's chemical agent \nand munitions stockpile.\n  Prior to September 11, no temporary flight restrictions existed for \nany of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile sites. Secretary \nRumsfeld took quick action after September 11 to establish temporary \nflight restrictions at each of these sites, but numerous violations of \nthese flight restrictions have occurred.\n  In the case of the Anniston Chemical Destruction Facility and storage \nsite, 22 violations have occurred since flight restrictions were \nimplemented by the Department of Defense. The latest was just today \nwhen a Lear-type jet flew over the incineration facility at less than \n1000 feet. Another violation that caused great concern was a night time \nover-flight which included 3 passes by an unidentified aircraft.\n  These incursions are serious matters. Current law provides for stiff \npenalties to be levied against those who violate restricted air space. \nIn the case of our chemical weapons storage sites and weapons \ndestruction facilities, we must be ever vigilant. That is what this \namendment seeks to do by:\n  First, requiring the Secretary of Defense to review the current \ntemporary flight restrictions to determine if they are sufficient to \nprovide maximum protection to these facilities from potential airborne \nthreats and to report his findings to Congress.\n  Second, the amendment would require the FAA to issue a report on each \nviolation of the temporary flight restrictions which apply to these \nsites. Mr. President, as I have stated, very serious penalties already \nexist for those who violate these restrictions. Given the tremendous \ndanger to the workers and local citizens associated with any \nunintentional crash or intentional act at any one of these storage \nsites, I believe this amendment is both reasonable and prudent in \nrequiring the FAA to report on actions taken in response to a confirmed \nand properly investigated restricted airspace violation.\n  Lastly, in the amendment we ask the Secretary of Defense to assess \nthe use of periodic air patrols and military flight training exercises \nin terms of their effectiveness as a deterrent to airspace violations \nor other potential airborne threats to these facilities.\n  While little, if anything, could be done to stop someone intent on \nattacking one of these storage sites from the air, we should take every \nstep to make sure that these flight restrictions are respected and \nviolators are punished. This amendment is about safety, enforcement of \nthe law, and, ultimately, protection of our citizens who live in close \nproximity to these chemical weapons facilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8280-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, we had a very sad day today. The Senate\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nJudiciary Committee, on a party-line, partisan vote of 10 to 9, voted \ndown the nomination of Priscilla Owen, a justice on the Texas Supreme \nCourt, for a position on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Having practiced many years in Federal court, 15 years full-time as a \nFederal prosecutor, I care about the Federal courts. I want it to be \nthe very best it can be. I believe deeply in the rule of law in \nAmerica. I believe it is a tradition we have to cherish and turn over \nto our children and our grandchildren, so that it has the same \nstrength, moral coherence, and integrity that it has always had.\n  In fact, most of the nations around the world today that are \nstruggling so badly--the Third World nations--are not struggling \nbecause their people will not work or because they do not have \nresources. Too often, it is generally because there is no legal system \nthat can operate where people can make loans and expect them to be \nrepaid, or where they can own property and not have it stolen from \nthem. So the legal system is exceedingly important.\n  What happened this morning--and it was particularly tragic--\nrepresents a culmination of a decision, apparently reached a year or so \nago, when President Bush was elected, and three liberal activist \nprofessors--Laurence Tribe, Cass Sunstein, and Marcia Greenberger--met \nwith the Democratic Conference to discuss judicial nominations. And \nthey asserted that President Bush had won by only a small margin and, \ntherefore, he did not have the same authority that other Presidents had \nto nominate judges, forgetting, of course, that the total vote \npercentage received by President Clinton, I believe, was only about 44 \npercent. President Bush got a larger percentage of the American vote \nthan Clinton did.\n  But at any rate, these professors set about to deliberately alter the \nconfirmation ground rules. In fact, a newspaper--I believe the New York \nTimes--reported that they had met to discuss changing the ground rules \non the nominations of Federal judges. And it was a real serious thing.\n  So, well, that is politics. You hear those kinds of things.\n  You wouldn't think that the decisions we have used since the founding \nof this Republic, certainly in the last 60 years of anybody's \nrecognition here of the normal way things are done, would be changed \nsignificantly, but I am afraid we may be wrong. We may be seeing \nsignificant change. I am hopeful that is not the case. Maybe we can \nturn it around. Maybe it is not too late. But today's vote was very \ndisturbing because we had one of the finest nominees ever to come \nbefore this Senate, a nominee that clearly had the votes to pass on the \nfloor of the Senate but was voted down in committee, blocked from \ncoming to the floor of the Senate so we could have a full airing and a \nfull vote.\n  We had some hearings in the Judiciary Committee and subcommittees on \nhow to change the ground rules. Some liberals, including law professors \nalleged in one of the hearings that one out of every four Supreme Court \nnominees during the first 100 years of this country were voted down \nbecause of ideology. We have checked that in detail and researched \nthose allegations, and that is just not true. They suggested that the \nburden should lie on the nominee to prove him or herself worthy. We \ndemonstrated that history did not support that position. They asserted \nthat the Supreme Court of the United States is a right-wing Court and \nthat ideology drives what they do, undermining respect for the law. I \nreject that characterization of the Supreme Court.\n  They said that the ABA ratings need to be given consideration, except \nin this case the nominee got a unanimously well-qualified rating, the \nhighest possible rating of the ABA.\n  They said that we don't want to have a judge that would vote to \noverrule Roe v. Wade. We can't have a right-wing activist. And they \nasserted that ideology or politics is a basis for rejecting a nominee.\n  We had hearings on that. Lloyd Cutler, who served as counsel for two \ndifferent Democratic Presidents, flatly rejected that in the hearing, \nmade a strong statement saying this would politicize the courts. So did \nGriffin Bell, former Attorney General under President Jimmy Carter. \nThey rejected this ideological approach to the judiciary, something we \nhave never done in this Senate's history.\n  One thing we noticed, all of these arguments don't meet the test of \nlogic or history or facts except one, and that was the one chosen--raw \npolitical power to vote down a nominee of extraordinary capability \nsubmitted by President Bush. We have not seen that before.\n  We had at one of the hearings a Democratic justice, former justice \nretired from the Supreme Court of Texas. He was here to support Justice \nOwen from Texas. He said to me after the hearing: At least for some of \nthese nominees there was a basis to vote against them, but they have no \nbasis to oppose Owen. They put out nothing on her.\n  That is a fact. Nothing was said that would undermine her ability, \neven if you were highly suspect of a nominee. To me, there were just no \nfacts there. She conducted her life not politically but professionally, \nas a lawyer, with integrity and outstanding ability.\n  They said that in the first 100 years so many Supreme Court Justices \nwere voted down on ideology. That is an absolutely untrue statement. In \nfact, only a few were rejected for political reasons, and sometimes \nthose battles were pretty tough in the days of the founding of this \ncountry.\n  We do know that they didn't even have hearings on most of them.\n  They say that the burden should be on the nominee. Well, if history \nis to serve as a guide, we would do well to think about what we have \ndone here. During the first 130 years of our country's history, the \nSenate did not even ask a nominee to come before the Senate for a \nhearing. The first nominee to even appear before the Senate before \nconfirmation was Justice Harlan Fisk Stone, in 1925. Nominees did not \nappear regularly before the Judiciary Committee until John Marshall \nHarlan in 1955. Occasionally the committees asked a few nominees \nquestions in writing, but there wasn't the kind of examinations we have \ntoday.\n  So it would be difficult for anyone to argue that historically we \nhave put the burden on the nominee to prove their worthiness.\n  What we have always done is that the President submits people. The \nSenators from that home State have to approve that nominee. If they \ndon't approve, the nominee almost universally is not confirmed. But if \nthe home State Senators approve, it comes up before the committee, and \nthe committee looks to see if they are extreme, if they have good \nintegrity, if they have basic legal skills, that they have a proven \nrecord of capability and respect within the bar that would make them \nworthy of the position of a lifetime appointment on the bench.\n  The Senate is not a rubber stamp. It should not vote for every \nnominee, just because the President submitted that nominee. But we \nought to have a basis within that traditional realm of evaluation of a \nnominee to vote one down. That was lacking here today.\n  As Senator Orrin Hatch said: Her testimony was perhaps the finest \ntestimony ever received in his time as chairman and ranking Republican \non that committee.\n  Those are the facts about our history. My Democrat colleagues assert \nsomehow that the Supreme Court of the United States is a right-wing \nCourt and that we need a balance. We need to make sure that moderate or \nliberal nominees get put on for every moderate or conservative or \nliberal that was on there, some sort of balancing out, some sort of \nmoderate deal. That is not the way we have done nominations. The \nPresident submits nominees. We evaluate them and see if they are \nworthy.\n  I will just ask: What is moderation? What does that mean? Does that \nmean you enforce half the law? You analyze it halfway? You don't make \nanybody mad with your ruling? You try to carve your ruling so it \nsatisfies everybody? If the statute of limitations is run and the \nperson wants $10,000, do you give them $5,000? Is that justice? Is that \nmoderation? I don't think so.\n  This Supreme Court has faced some tough decisions. It protected the \nburning of an American flag and said that the act of burning a flag is \nfree speech. The act of burning a tangible object is covered by the \nfirst amendment protection of free speech. I don't think that is good, \nin my personal view. But you had\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\npeople such as Justice Scalia, supposedly a conservative, voting for \nthat with others. I think it was a bad decision. But they ruled on \nthat, this so-called right-wing Court.\n  They banned voluntary school prayer at high school football games. \nFormer Judge Griffin Bell of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, \nactually originally from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nAttorney General of the United States under President Carter, once \nsaid--perhaps in jest; perhaps not--nobody ought to serve on the \nSupreme Court, on the Federal bench, that doesn't believe in prayer at \nfootball games.\n  I don't think that is a good opinion. I don't believe a voluntary \nprayer at a football game violates the establishment clause of the \nfirst amendment, but that is what the Supreme Court has ruled, and many \nother cases along that line.\n  They stopped the police from using heat sensors to search for \nmarijuana-growing equipment in houses. That was pretty much considered \na liberal opinion.\n  They struck down a law that bans virtual child pornography, which I \nwas disappointed to see since, as a prosecutor, I know how difficult \nthat is going to make it for prosecutors to be successful. And they \nreaffirmed and expanded abortion rights to include substantial \nprotections for partial-birth abortion, this so-called right wing \nSupreme Court. That is a bogus argument also.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, they said the ABA rating was the gold standard, \nbut that didn't help them in this argument because the ABA unanimously \nvoted that Priscilla Owen was well qualified for the Eleventh Circuit. \nThey had seen her practice law, they had seen her as a justice of the \nTexas Supreme Court, and they found that she was well qualified, giving \nher the highest rating. The bar association, as I recall, has 15 \nmembers of the committee that actually does that vote. Heretofore, they \ndidn't say anything about whether you were qualified, well qualified, \nor unqualified. Now they tell you whether or not it was unanimous. It \nis hard to get 15 of them to be unanimous. They select the committee \nthat evaluates them, and it is a fairly sizable committee. Many are \ncivil rights attorneys, some are big law firm attorneys, some are \nindividual practitioners, and others are officials in the State bar. It \nis a big committee, and it is hard to get a unanimous vote of well \nqualified, but she was so rated.\n  They said: We don't want anybody who would reverse the right of a \nwoman to have an abortion--reverse Roe v. Wade. Well, everybody knows a \njudge on the Fifth Circuit cannot overrule the Supreme Court's opinions \non abortion. They cannot overrule any Supreme Court decision, including \nRoe v. Wade. In fact, the Fifth Circuit has explicitly adopted Roe v. \nWade in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Both of those are big-time, \nimportant abortion cases. They have already affirmed those.\n  Priscilla Owen has never voted on or opposed Roe v. Wade, as Justice \nByron White did when he was on the Court. She never called Roe v. Wade \na ``heavy handed judicial intervention,'' as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \nPresident Clinton's nominee to the Supreme Court, did. She never voted \nfor a statute to ban abortion, as Al Gore did, or never supported a \nconstitutional amendment to ban abortion, as Dick Gephardt, the would-\nbe Speaker of the House, has done in the past. Would all of these \nindividuals be blackballed and fail to pass a lockstep test of the \nDemocratic majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee if they were \nnominated for a Federal judgeship? I think this is going a bit far.\n  So we have heard that we cannot have a conservative judicial activist \non the court. I agree with that. You can have people who are so \nconservative that they force their agenda by reinterpreting the words \nof statutes, as well as you can have a liberal do that. The traditional \nconservative theory of law is that you respect the laws passed by the \nlegislature and enforce them as written, whether you like it or not.\n  Traditionally, the ideology of the left--as is dominating in our law \nschools today, unfortunately--is that--really, today they are getting \nawfully cynical--the law is truly a tool of one group to oppress \nanother group, that words don't have any finite meaning and you can \nmake them mean whatever you want to say, and that the law is a tool for \nsocial progress and not a protection of rights, as we have understood \nit.\n  Traditionally, in the last 30 years, most of the activism has come \nfrom the left. We have actual people who assert with quite a strong \nconviction that if the legislature didn't act, the court had to act. \nHave you ever heard that? I think we hear that pretty often. But think \nabout it. Particularly in Federal Court when you have a lifetime-\nappointed judge. Well, let's see. The legislature didn't act, so now we \ncan do whatever we want to as a judge, or as the court.\n  Well, if the legislature did not act, and they are the duly elected \nrepresentatives of the people, then in fact they have acted, haven't \nthey? They have decided not to act on whatever political agenda \nsomebody has. And that does not justify a judge becoming a legislator \nbecause of that.\n\n  I think this is important also. This nominee, Priscilla Owen, has \njust been magnificent and disciplined in her view of the law. One of \nthe things they complained about was her interpretation of a single \nTexas statute, passed by the legislature--the parental notification \nstatute. She clearly followed the legitimate sources of law in \ninterpreting that. She read the statute clearly. She interpreted the \nwords of the statute using the pro-abortion cases of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt upon which the statute was based, and it was not an act of \nactivism. In fact, Senator DeWine carefully analyzed these matters, and \nin the 12 cases under this statute--and this was the biggest point made \nagainst this fine nominee's record--in 3 of them she voted with a \nminority of the judges on the Texas Supreme Court. Most of the time, 9 \ncases, she voted with a majority.\n  By the way, in every case that reached the Supreme Court of Texas, \nthe Texas law was vaguely written and difficult to interpret, and it \ninvolved a situation in which a trial judge and an intermediate court \nof criminal appeals had both ruled that notification of a parent had to \noccur before an abortion by a minor could be conducted. So she was, in \neach instance, voting on a case in which a trial judge saw the \nsituation firsthand, and an intermediate court of appeals had ruled in \nthe same way Justice Owen ruled. In each case that she ruled against \nthe majority, she ruled in favor of the intermediate court of appeals \nand the trial judge--not an extreme record, trust me.\n  We looked at this hard. Senator DeWine's analysis of it was very \nthoughtful and persuasive. Well, they say, that is bad, we don't want a \nparent to be notified. Some states have parental consent, where a \nparent has to consent to an abortion for a teenager. In some States, \nthey have to have consent to get a tattoo, or an earring, or a nose \nring, but they don't need to have consent to get an abortion. All it \nsaid was they had to tell at least one parent, unless there was an \nexcuse not to. It did not require permission of that parent. And 82 \npercent of the people in this country, when polled, say they favor \nparental notification.\n  So who is extreme here? Is it the group smearing her for enforcing a \nrather modest Texas law, or is it the nominee herself?\n  Actually, her study of that was very carefully done, I thought, and \nactually utilized definitions in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion to help \nclarify the definitional tools of Texas law on the correct presumption \nthat when Texas had the parental notification law, they tried to make \nit compatible with the Supreme Court ruling, which is what a great \njudge does.\n  Well, only the most extreme liberal groups such as NARAL, Planned \nParenthood, and the ACLU, that have been active against her, could see \nanything wrong in this, in my opinion.\n  Well, they said you can't get into politics. That is something to \ndiscuss. This nominee hardly has any politics. Senator Gramm from Texas \nsaid when people asked her to run for the Supreme Court of Texas, she \ncould not remember, when asked, which primary she voted in last time, \nRepublican or Democrat.\n  She finished third in her class at Baylor Law School and was one of \nthe finest litigators in Texas, well respected. When she was approached \nto\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nrun, she was a single mom. She gave up a highly lucrative law practice \nto take on the race for the supreme court. She won, and then won again, \nwith 84 percent of the vote. She had the endorsement of every single \nnewspaper in Texas of any size. She was an exceptional candidate in \nevery way.\n  She is not a person who is a political warrior. As Senator Gramm \nsaid, ``I am a political warrior, I know what one is.'' This lady is \nnot. As Senator Hutchison of Texas, who knows her and supports her, \nassures us, this is a legal professional who goes about her day trying \nto do the right thing.\n  The danger in all this, to my way of thinking, is that we are sliding \ninto a concept that the courts in America are inherently political and \nthey cannot be trusted to enforce the law as written. Indeed, these \nprofessors assert and many of them are teaching in law school today--\nand it is quite a source of debate in law school--that they believe you \ncannot know anything, that nothing is really knowable, that there is \nreally no truth, that character really does not count, that there are \njust winners and losers. If you do not get your judge on the court, you \ndo not win.\n  That is a dangerous philosophy. In fact, I raised it with Professor \nLaurence Tribe, the brilliant activist liberal law professor. In his \nwritten statement to our Judiciary Committee when we had hearings, he \nflat out said, that we might as well reject the Olympian ideal of \njustice under law--that an Olympian ideal was an illusory concept.\n  That theory is a threat to the rule of law in America, and I think we \nsaw it played out in Committee this morning because they basically \nsaid: This lady did not agree with parental notification; we heard she \nwas a conservative; we cannot trust her to interpret the thousands and \nthousands of cases that come before her. That is not true.\n  I practiced as a Federal prosecutor before Federal judges and tried \nhundreds of cases. I was there for years. There may be a case every now \nand then that a judge's philosophy of life--you would expect one more \nlikely to buy this argument than that argument. But if you had the \ncases, if you had the law, if you had the authority, whether the judges \nwere Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative, routinely, day after \nday in my court and every court in America, judges followed that. This \nis a dangerous concept to be selling around here.\n  Yes, we have politics in this body. There is nothing in the Senate \nthat is not involved in politics. Of course, we are a political body. \nThat is not true in courts, and if it is, we are in big trouble.\n  Why should you respect a court if you do not believe they are \nenforcing the law? We have people who believe that rules of property \nownership are ways to oppress people who do not have property by people \nwho have property and that the enforcement of a deed is somehow an act \nof class warfare against the poor. If you do not own the property, you \ndo not own it in America. They want to say you ought to get a part of \nit anyway. It is a dangerous philosophy we are about.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude. I feel deeply about this issue \nbecause what was unique about this rejection of this superb nominee who \ntestified brilliantly in addition to having a brilliant record, what \nwas most disturbing about this process was that she was ignored. Her \nanswers were ignored, and she was just voted down--Raw power.\n  Maybe that is supposed to send a message to the President, but this \nis a real person who has a real family, who has dedicated her life to \nthe rule of law. She is popular in her home State. She had the \nconfidence of the President of the United States who was Governor of \nthe State of Texas, and he knows the people in Texas. She has the \nsupport of Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, the Senators from \nTexas, and she should have been confirmed.\n  The failure to do so troubles me because I am afraid we may be \nadopting this postmodernism view that nothing is knowable, that there \nis no truth, that there is no objectivity, and that there is no such a \nthing as a rule of law because it is all just a manipulation; that \nwhoever has the power writes the laws to benefit themselves and oppress \neverybody else.\n\n  If that is what we are heading to, I think we have a problem. Maybe \nthat is not so. Some have said: Are we going to retaliate? I have been \nasked a lot about that. Is that the way Republicans are going to do the \nDemocrats if we get a Democratic President and he submits nominees?\n  Let me just say it this way: I do not give up. I am hoping that a \nnumber of the members of the Judiciary Committee maybe made premature \ncommitments on this case, maybe did not realize the full consequences \nof their votes, and that we will not continue to see this kind of overt \npoliticalization of the process. I think that should avert a historic \nalteration in the process by which we have dealt with judges in \nconfirmation.\n  We have to maybe take a deep breath. I am very upset and most of the \nRepublican members of our committee are very upset and wonder what \nhappened.\n  Under President Clinton, only one nominee in 8 years was voted down \nin committee or on the floor of the Senate. We have already had two \nvoted down in committee on a party-line vote, and in both cases, the \nnominee would have passed had they been on the floor of the Senate. In \nboth cases, there was a majority vote on the floor of the Senate to \npass them had they gotten out of committee.\n  This is not healthy. I respect the talent and ability and commitment \nof my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, but they are \nvery much a Northeast-West Coast group. They do not represent the legal \nthinking of a majority of Americans, much less a majority of the \nSenate.\n  This little group, by sticking together in lockstep fashion, have \nasserted and demonstrated a power to kill nominees before they even get \na full vote, superb nominees such as Judge Pickering. He had been on \nthe Federal bench for 12 years. He was No. 1 in his class in law \nschool. He was well qualified by the American Bar Association for the \nCourt of Appeals, and he was voted down.\n  I think it is a big deal. I am very frustrated about it. There is a \nlot of unease. I do not know of anything to do but to continue to go \nforward, continue to talk to my colleagues, ask them to back off; let's \ngo back to the traditional respect given to Presidential nominees, and \nI think we can make progress there.\n  Some said a lot of nominees who received well-qualified ratings did \nnot get voted on. True, most of those overwhelmingly had objections \nfrom home State Senators. As soon as the Democratic Members of Congress \ngot the majority and Senator Leahy became chairman, they asserted not \nonly did they want to maintain that power, but they wanted to \nstrengthen it further than they have in the past. I do not see how \nanybody can complain on the senatorial courtesy rule if they, in fact, \nare asserting not only should it be maintained but strengthened.\n  If President Bush nominates a judge from New York and Senator Schumer \nobjects to that judge, that judge will not move and will not be \nconfirmed even though that judge is voted well qualified. That is just \nthe way it has been here. Sometimes it is unfair, but that is how it \nhas been.\n  As Senator Hatch, who just came into the Chamber, who so ably chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee, knows, that is just the way it has been. I do \nnot see any call for weakening of that rule.\n  I would say we have a long way to go in the future to work through \nthis unfortunate event. I hope we can. It would be a tragic event, \nindeed, if this Senate were to abandon its historical system of \nevaluating judges.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Sessions and \nthank him for his kind remarks today. As usual, he is one of the most \narticulate and eloquent spokespeople in this country with regard to the \nFederal Judiciary and, of course, with regard to the law in general and \nthe rule of law. I want him to know I have a tremendous amount of \nrespect for him and how much I enjoy working with him on the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Senator from Alabama adds much to the Judiciary \nCommittee. He is a terrific addition to the Committee and will leave \nhis mark decades from now for his service in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama has made a lot of points on \nwhat happened in the Judiciary Committee today, but I wanted to take a \nlittle time, as well, to address the injustice dispensed by the \nJudiciary Committee against Priscilla Owen of Texas. President Bush's \nnominee to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The Committee defeated her nomination today. Although I am afraid it \nwas a deal cut long before Justice Owen's hearing occurred, in \ndefeating Justice Owen's nomination I regret that my friends on the \nCommittee and the Senate Democrat leadership chose the path of \npartisanship over friendship and fairness.\n  The justice my colleagues dispensed is like no other the Judiciary \nCommittee has ever inflicted. It is incomparable to any controversy \nraised against any nominee, Democrat or Republican. My Democrat \ncolleagues rejected a nominee who is unblemished in every respect but \nfor the smears of her opponents, smears which go beyond the pale of \ndecency, distortions which are outside the bounds of cynicism and \ndeceptions which fall below any standard of fairness, even for \nWashington politics and the left-wing professional lobbyists in this \ntown.\n  For the first time in history, my colleagues rejected a nominee that \nhas received the American Bar Association's unanimous rating of well-\nqualified, a rating that earlier this year my friends on the other side \nannounced to be the gold standard for judicial nominees and which, of \ncourse, they now criticize because the independent body of the American \nBar Association has rated President Bush's nominees as highly qualified \nas any we have ever seen.\n  I think this vote will be long remembered and regretted on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  One sample smear against Priscilla Owen of Texas came this week in \none of the most outrageously false editorials I have ever read in The \nNew York Times, but that editorial said nothing new. The editorialists \napparently used only the talking points supplied by the usual suspects \nin Washington. Among other falsehoods, the New York Times editorial \nsaid:\n\n       In abortion cases, Justice Owen has been resourceful about \n     finding reasons that, despite the United States Supreme Court \n     holdings and Texas case law, women should be denied the right \n     to choose.\n\n  The New York Times should be ashamed of themselves--or whoever the \neditorial writer is who wrote this. Under the parental notice cases of \nwhich they speak, no one is denied a right to an abortion. They are \nabsolutely wrong. Abortion rights are not implicated in the parents' \nright to know and to be involved in their children's most painful \ndecision, an abortion.\n  Even with parental notice, every minor has a right to abortion in \nTexas, and no decision of Justice Priscilla Owen denies that. In fact, \nin Texas, minors cannot get a tattoo without parental consent, but they \nhave an unhindered right to obtain an abortion.\n\n  Last year most members of the Judiciary Committee voted to require \nparental consent for 18- to 21-year-olds to get credit cards.\n  Such is our world, Mr. President.\n  This willful error by The New York Times is one example of the \ndeceptions and distortions perpetrated on Justice Owen's exemplary \nrecord. Of course, The New York Times again repeats the falsehood that \nJudge Alberto Gonzalez, now our White House Counsel, called Justice \nOwen an activist while he was serving on the same court, when in fact \nthe truth is that a careful review of the full record of the particular \ncase shows he was referring to another judge who wrote another \ndissenting opinion. He was not referring to Justice Owen. Yet we have \nheard time after time the same arguments used against Justice Owen.\n  The New York Times was not alone in addressing Justice Owen's \nnomination. I am heartened to know that beyond the overwhelming support \nfrom her own home State of Texas and the scores of op-ed pieces written \nacross the country in support of this nomination, Justice Owen's \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit has received editorial support from \nover 24 newspapers published across the Nation and across the political \nspectrum, including the Washington Post, the Wisconsin State Journal, \nthe Wall Street Journal, Amarillo Globe-News, Richmond Times Dispatch, \nAkron Beacon Journal, The Florida Times-Union, The Philadelphia \nInquirer, The Tampa Tribune, The Detroit News, The Dallas Morning News, \nThe Denver Post, The Daily Oklahoman and the Chicago Tribune, to \nmention a few.\n  Only three newspapers, in fact, in New York, Los Angeles and San \nFrancisco, have come out firmly against this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a selection of these 24 editorials in \nsupport of Justice Owen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 24, 2002]\n\n                          The Owen Nomination\n\n       The nomination of Priscilla Owen to the 5th Circuit Court \n     of Appeals creates understandable anxiety among many liberal \n     activists and senators. The Texas Supreme Court justice, who \n     had a hearing yesterday before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, is part of the right flank of the conservative \n     court on which she serves. Her opinions have a certain \n     ideological consistency that might cause some senators to \n     vote against her on those grounds. But our own sense is that \n     the case against her is not strong enough to warrant her \n     rejection by the Senate. Justice Owen's nomination may be a \n     close call, but she should be confirmed.\n       Justice Owen is indisputably well qualified, having served \n     on a state supreme court for seven years and, prior to her \n     election, having had a well-regarded law practice. So rather \n     than attacking her qualifications, opponents have sought to \n     portray her as a conservative judicial activist--that is, to \n     accuse her of substituting her own views for those of \n     policymakers and legislators. In support of this charge, they \n     cite cases in which other Texas justices, including then-\n     Justice Alberto Gonzales--now President Bush's White House \n     Counsel--appear to suggest as much. But the cases they cite, \n     by and large, posed legitimately difficult questions. While \n     some of Justice Owen's opinions--particularly on matters \n     related to abortion--seem rather aggressive, none seems to us \n     beyond the range of reasonable judicial disagreement. And Mr. \n     Gonzales, whatever disagreements they might have had, \n     supports her nomination enthusiastically. Liberals will no \n     doubt disagree with some opinions she would write on the 5th \n     Circuit, but this is not the standard by which a president's \n     lower-court nominees should be judged.\n       Nor is it reasonable to reject her because of campaign \n     contributions she accepted, including those from people \n     associated with Enron Corp. Texas has a particularly ugly \n     system of judicial elections that taints all who participate \n     in it. State rules permit judges to sit on cases in which \n     parties or lawyers have also been donors--as Justice Owen did \n     with Enron. Judicial elections are a bad idea, and letting \n     judges hear cases from people who have given them money is \n     wrong. But Justice Owen didn't write the rules and has \n     supported a more reasonable system.\n       Justice Owen was one of President Bush's initial crop of 11 \n     appeals court nominees, sent to the Senate in May of last \n     year. Of these, only three have been confirmed so far, and \n     six have not even had the courtesy of a hearing. The fact \n     that President Clinton's nominees were subjected to similar \n     mistreatment does not excuse it. In Justice Owen's case, the \n     long wait has produced no great surprise. She is still a \n     conservative. And that is still not a good reason to vote her \n     down.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, July 25, 2002]\n\n         Owen Nomination; Critics Are Distorting Texan's Record\n\n       After hearing U.S. Court of Appeals candidate Priscilla \n     Owen vilified in recent weeks--called everything from racist \n     to anti-abortion to (gasp!) pro-business--the members of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee got the chance Tuesday to see for \n     themselves what all the fuss is about. And, after a year in \n     the deep freeze, the 47-year-old Texas Supreme Court justice \n     finally got the chance to defend herself against liberal \n     critics who have distorted her record and character in a \n     bare-knuckled attempt to keep her off the 5th Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n       One of the biggest distortions is that Justice Owen is a \n     ``Judicial activist'' intent on bending and twisting statutes \n     to fit a rigid political agenda. That is the view of Sen. \n     Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, who tore into \n     Justice Owen for what he said was a tendency to ``expand and \n     embellish'' in her written opinions. Democratic Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein of California was more polite but just as direct \n     when she asked Justice Owen point-blank if she was, in fact, \n     a ``judicial activist.'' Justice Owen's response suggests \n     that the Baylor Law School graduate is absolutely clear on \n     what position she is applying for. She has no desire to \n     legislate from the bench, she told Sen. Feinstein. If \n     confirmed, she said, she would do only what the job calls \n     for: interpret the law as written.\n       Justice Owen can be trusted to do exactly that, say those \n     in Texas legal circles who know her best. Her supporters \n     include Republicans and Democrats alike, and their\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n     vote of confidence should count for something--especially \n     when weighed against the smear campaign engaged by the \n     lobbies of the left.\n       As for Justice Owen's personal views on abortion, or on any \n     issue, they remain totally irrelevant. By all accounts, she \n     has spend the last eight years on the Texas high court doing \n     precisely what she this week promised the Judiciary Committee \n     she would continue to do at the federal level.\n       Those who oppose a judicial nominee have every right to \n     challenge the nominee. But they do not have the right to--in \n     legal terms--``assume facts not in evidence.'' For all their \n     political games, grandstanding and name-calling, the \n     assembled critics of Priscilla Owen have presented nothing to \n     discredit her.\n       The committee should do its best to rectify this situation \n     by scheduling a vote without further delay and approving \n     Justice Owen's nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Florida Times-Union, July 26, 2000]\n\n                             A Fine Choice\n\n       Using legitimate criteria--judicial expertise, temperament \n     and reputation--there is no finer candidate for a spot on a \n     federal appeals court than Priscilla Owen, whose nomination \n     was the subject of committee hearings this week.\n       Owen, an honors graduate who earned the highest grade on \n     the bar exam, has served with distinction on the Texas \n     Supreme Court since 1994--and is so respected that every \n     major newspaper in Texas endorsed her successful campaign for \n     reelection in 2000.\n       After she was nominated for the 5th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, the American Bar Association unanimously gave her \n     the highest possible rating for the job--no small matter \n     since the Senate Judicial Committee chairman said previously \n     that the ABA's rating is `the gold standard by which judicial \n     candidates are judged.' A bipartisan group of 15 past Texas \n     Bar presidents endorsed her nomination, as have Democratic \n     former justices.\n       Still, her nomination is in trouble because she is deemed \n     insufficiently liberal by a few fringe special-interest \n     groups that have considerable influence with the Senate's \n     Democratic leadership.\n       The main complaint revolves around cases in which young \n     girls wanted to have an abortion without either parent's \n     knowledge.\n       Under Texas law, a parent must be told unless a judge rules \n     a girl is sufficiently mature and informed to make the \n     decision alone.\n       Owen contended some youngsters were not informed \n     sufficiently.\n       That, extremist, pro-abortion groups say, proves Owen is a \n     `judicial activist' who makes rulings based on ideology \n     instead of what the law actually says. Never mind that they \n     have enthusiastically supported judicial activism in the past \n     and that Roe vs. Wade, the decision legalizing abortion, was \n     in itself a blatant act of judicial activism.\n       Owen is under fire not because she is a judicial activist \n     but because she is perceived as a conservative activist.\n       The facts are, however, that Owen based her opinion on U.S. \n     Supreme court guidelines--and the author of the law said she \n     had interpreted it the way the legislature intended.\n       Parental notification laws are designed not just to protect \n     children but also to keep pedophiles from coercing their \n     young victims into destroying the evidence before they can be \n     arrested, tried and locked up. They are not something that \n     the courts should routinely circumvent, except under rather \n     limited conditions prescribed by law.\n       Critics complain, less vociferously, about other Owen \n     opinions--that a person shouldn't collect insurance benefits \n     on a house a spouse destroyed by arson, for example. That, \n     critics insist, proves she is too pro-business. But why \n     should an arsonist be allowed to profit from his own crime?\n       The appointment is being scandalously politicized. Owen \n     deserves better. More importantly, the American people \n     deserve better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, July 29, 2002]\n\n                  Owen Is Qualified for Federal Bench\n\n       Feingold and Kohl should stop their Senate Colleagues from \n     ``borking'' Priscilla Owen. Why should Wisconsinites care \n     about Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, nominated \n     by President Bush to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals?\n       Because ``borking''--judging a judicial nominee on \n     political and ideological grounds rather than \n     qualifications--is ugly no matter which party is doing it and \n     must be stopped.\n       Because Wisconsin's two senators, Herb Kohl and Russ \n     Feingold, sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the \n     ``borking'' of Owen is under way. If these two Democrats take \n     the high road and approve Owen even though (horrors!) she is \n     a conservative, their courage could persuade their Senate \n     colleagues to give up this nasty practice. The charge against \n     Owen is being led by the extremist wing of the abortion-on-\n     demand crowd, who are incensed that Owen voted several times \n     to uphold a Texas law that allows teens to get abortions \n     without notifying their parents only in extreme \n     circumstances.\n       Polls show that a majority of Americans support parental \n     notification laws, and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that \n     such laws do not violate the terms established by Roe vs. \n     Wade. Nonetheless, National Abortion Rights Action League \n     President Kate Michelman called Owen ``someone who \n     exemplifies the most extreme hostility to reproductive rights \n     of any of the nominees that President Bush has named.'' My, \n     my.\n       Other groups complain that Owen's rulings show her to be \n     anti-consumer, anti-worker and pro-business. They say she too \n     often voted to overturn huge jury verdicts in malpractice and \n     product-liability cases. Considering that Texas juries' \n     propensity for handing down outrageous verdicts makes the \n     state a favorite filing-ground for trial attorneys pursuing \n     dubious liability cases, Owen should be applauded for \n     attempting to apply the brakes.\n       They say she is a ``judicial activist'' who will try to \n     legislate from the bench. But when U.S. Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein, D-California, asked her about that charge, Owen \n     responded ``If I am confirmed, I will do my utmost to apply \n     the statutes you have written as you have written them, not \n     as I would have written them or others might want me to \n     interpret them.''\n       But none of this should matter much to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, which is supposed to examine a nominee's \n     qualifications, fitness for office, and temperament. No one \n     has questioned (yet) her temperament; her qualifications \n     include graduating cum laude from Baylor Law School, getting \n     the top score on the Texas Bar Exam, practicing commercial \n     litigation for 17 years before winning election to the Texas \n     Supreme Court, and getting a unanimous ``well-qualified'' \n     rating from the American Bar Association's Committee on the \n     Federal Judiciary.\n       Every president has the right to nominate whomever he wants \n     to the federal judiciary. The Senate has the right to grill \n     the nominees over their qualifications, temperament, and \n     fitness for office. Presumably it's that latter term that \n     some senators believe justifies ``borking'' Owen on abortion \n     rights, etc.\n       But it's still wrong.\n       Feingold knows it. That's why he made his courageous vote \n     to confirm John Ashcroft as U.S. attorney general. Feingold \n     didn't like Ashcroft's right-wing politics, but he believed \n     in a president's right to choose his own nominees. Feingold \n     was right.\n       Feingold and Kohl should both vote to confirm Owen, and \n     should try to convince their colleagues to do likewise. She \n     is well qualified, and that's all that should count.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Aug. 20, 2002]\n\n                      Ideologues vs. Justice Owen\n\n       At least since the 1987 battle over Robert Bork's \n     nomination to the Supreme Court, judicial appointments have \n     been a major arena for conflict in Washington. It doesn't \n     matter if the White House is in Republican hands and the \n     Senate under Democratic control, or the other way around: \n     Whenever a nominee can be tarred as extreme, unethical or \n     incompetent, ideologues paint the most appalling picture in \n     the hope of killing the appointment.\n       It's not a good way to find the truth or to select good \n     judges. Instead, it fosters irresponsible distortion and \n     discourages strong-minded individuals from accepting judicial \n     posts, while rewarding lawyers whose chief talent is never \n     doing anything, good or bad, to make enemies. The latest \n     fight is over Priscilla Owen, a Texas Supreme Court justice \n     chosen by President Bush for the 5th Circuit court of \n     Appeals. She got the highest rating from the American Bar \n     Association. To get that endorsement, says the ABA, a nominee \n     ``must be at the top of the legal profession in his or her \n     legal community, have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity and either \n     have demonstrated, or exhibited the capacity for, judicial \n     temperament.''\n       You'd never guess any of these qualities from the attacks \n     on Owen. Senate Democrats and liberal activists have \n     denounced her as a right-wing ideologue and a lap dog for big \n     corporations, particularly Enron. Their favorite evidence is \n     a quotation from fellow Justice Alberto Gonzales, now White \n     House counsel, accusing her of ``an unconscionable act of \n     judicial activism'' in voting to deny a minor permission to \n     get an abortion without her parents' knowledge.\n       But judges accuse each other of judicial activism all the \n     time. It's safe to assume that if Gonzales distrusted Owen's \n     instincts, he would have lobbied his boss not to choose her. \n     Today, he says, ``She will exercise judicial restraint and \n     understands the limited role of the judiciary.''\n       In the abortion case they disagreed about the application \n     of a Texas law that generally requires parents to be \n     notified. Owen, dissenting from the court's decision to grant \n     permission, made a perfectly rational case that the majority \n     was reading the law too liberally.\n       As for her views about corporations, it's not surprising \n     that a candidate picked by a conservative president has not \n     been hostile to private business. It's true that, in running \n     for the office, she got campaign contributions from Enron \n     employees and then sat on cases involving the company. But \n     people associated with Enron gave to lots of political \n     candidates, and Owen didn't violate any ethics rules.\n       Owen is just one of many Bush nominees who have been \n     inexcusably blocked from filling vacant seats on the bench--\n     something that also happened, with equal lack of \n     justification, to many of President Clinton's appointees.\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\n       But the only real argument against her is that she's not \n     the sort of choice a Democratic president would make. That's \n     no reason Bush shouldn't have picked her, or that the Senate \n     shouldn't confirm her.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, July 28, 2002]\n\n                          The Real Extremists\n\n                            (By Jeff Jacoby)\n\n       Why do professional abortion-rights advocates anathematize \n     as ``antichoice'' anyone who favors even minimal regulation \n     of abortion? Their absolutism would seen as ridiculous in \n     almost any other area of law.\n       For example: Americans have a fundamental right to own and \n     use land, but no one believes that land use should be \n     entirely untrammeled. A great body of law has developed to \n     regulate what people do with their land--from local zoning \n     ordinances to common law nuisance remedies to federal \n     wetlands and endangered-species statutes. Reasonable people \n     can and do debate the wisdom of particular regulations. But \n     nearly everyone agrees that there must be some restrictions \n     on an owner's right to make use of his property. Only a crank \n     would argue that to favor any sort of limitation at all is to \n     be ``anti-ownership'' or an enemy of landholders.\n       To take another example, Americans have the constitutional \n     freedom to express their views in public. But no one takes \n     the First Amendment to mean that self-expression may never be \n     restricted. Your right to free speech does not authorize you \n     to utter slander, to threaten the life of the president, to \n     falsely shout ``fire!'' in a crowed theater, or to give \n     perjured testimony in court.\n       Yet when it comes to abortion, there is no such thing as a \n     reasonable restriction--not to the abortion-right spokeswomen \n     whom we invariably hear from whenever the issue comes up. A \n     24-hour waiting period? Pre-abortion counseling to discuss \n     possible risks or alternatives? Parental notification when a \n     minor wants an abortion? A ban on partial-birth abortions? \n     The politician who calls for such limits or the judge who \n     upholds them can count on being slammed as a threat to \n     ``reproductive rights'' and a foe of ``choice.''\n       Just ask Priscilla Owen, the Texas Supreme Court justice \n     nominated by President Bush to the Fifth Circuit US Court of \n     Appeals. She is by most accounts a restrained and thoughtful \n     judge; the American Bar Association unanimously pronounced \n     her ``well qualified.'' But because in several teen-abortion \n     cases she ruled that parental notification was required, she \n     is being excoriated. Planned Parenthood calls her an ``anti-\n     choice extremist.'' The National Organization for Women \n     accuses her of ``disdaining women's rights.'' The National \n     Abortion Rights Action League says she ``exemplifies the most \n     extreme hostility to reproductive rights.''\n       But who are the real extremists here? In a new analysis, \n     the Gallup News Service reports that ``in general, polling \n     shows wide public support for parental consent laws--policies \n     that are even more restrictive than parental notification.'' \n     In 1996, a Gallup survey found 74 percent of Americans in \n     favor of requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion. \n     Since then, the level of support has gone even higher. In a \n     1998 CBS/New York Times poll, 78 percent wanted parental \n     consent. And in a Los Angeles Times survey two years after \n     that, the figure was 82 percent.\n       Justice Owen insists her rulings are based on Texas law, \n     not her own personal views. But if they do reflect her \n     personal views, she clearly has lots of company. Are more \n     than four Americans in five ``anti-choice extremists?'' Or is \n     it NARAL, NOW, and Planned Parenthood that are far outside \n     the mainstream?\n       In poll after poll, a majority of respondents say that, as \n     a general rule, abortion should remain legal and the \n     government should not interfere with a woman's right to end \n     her pregnancy. But when asked about restricting abortion in \n     specific ways or circumstances, they often say yes.\n       Thus, 86 percent of Americans would make abortion illegal \n     in the third trimester (Gallup, 2000), and 63 percent would \n     vote to ban partial-birth abortions. Mandatory pre-abortion \n     counseling is favored by 86 percent of the public (Gallup \n     1996); a 24-hour waiting period by 79 percent (CBS/New York \n     Times, 1998). (These all presuppose a healthy mother and \n     child; Americans overwhelming support legal abortion when the \n     mother's health is seriously threatened or when there is \n     likely to be a serious defect in the baby.)\n       It makes sense that the public does not regard these \n     limitations as unreasonable. Americans recognize that \n     abortion is too serious and tragic to be undertaken lightly. \n     They know that the pro-life slogan ``Abortion stops a beating \n     heart'' is a statement of fact. So while they support \n     reproductive rights, they do not support unfettered abortion \n     on demand, for any reason at any time.\n       But that is largely what organizations like NARAL, NOW, and \n     Planned Parenthood do support, which is why they vigorously \n     oppose the kinds of abortion regulations that most Americans \n     would endorse. That is their right, of course. But why should \n     their radical viewpoint be the standard for defining \n     ``prochoice?'' Prochoice is what most Americans are: In favor \n     of the right to choose, but also in favor of common-sense \n     limits on that right. For NARAL & Co. we need a more accurate \n     term. I'd suggest ``pro-abortion.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Aug. 22, 2002]\n\n               A Conservative Judge's `Judicial Activism'\n\n       Priscilla Owen is not a household name across America, but \n     she has achieved an amazing level of notoriety among left-\n     leaning interest groups, who regard her much as Dalmatian \n     owners view Cruella De Vil. The Texas Supreme Court justice \n     became their Public Enemy of the Month by doing two things: \n     1) compiling a judicial record that can fairly be described \n     as conservative, and 2) being nominated to the 5th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals by President Bush.\n       Those offenses were all it took to unleash a torrent of \n     invective against Owen, whose nomination is awaiting Senate \n     action. Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, \n     denounced her as an ``ultraconservative.'' The National \n     Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said she's \n     possessed by ``a strong personal bias against the right to \n     choose that renders her unable to follow the law.'' The most \n     frequently heard criticism is not from liberals but from a \n     conservative--White House counsel and former Texas Supreme \n     Court Justice Alberto Gonzales, who is quoted as having \n     accused Owen of ``an unconscionable act of judicial \n     activism'' in how she handled one abortion case. That charge \n     is supposed to prove that she's not only too conservative for \n     liberals, but too conservative for conservatives.\n       What her opponents don't publicize is that from all \n     evidence, Owen is an excellent lawyer and judge. Fifteen \n     former presidents of the Texas State Bar wrote the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee to announce that though ``we profess \n     different party affiliations and span the spectrum of views \n     of legal and political issues, we stand united in affirming \n     that Justice Owen is a truly unique and outstanding \n     candidate.''\n       The American Bar Association, which is not regarded as a \n     dear friend by conservatives agrees. Its Standing Committee \n     on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Owen ``well-\n     qualified.'' That's the highest score the ABA evaluators \n     give, and they don't hand it out to just anybody who can pass \n     the bar exam and tie her own shoes.\n       ``To merit a rating of `well-qualified,' '' the ABA \n     explains, ``the nominee must be at the top of the legal \n     profession in his or her legal community, have outstanding \n     legal ability, breadth of experience, the highest reputation \n     for integrity and either have demonstrated, or exhibited the \n     capacity for, judicial temperament.'' This portrait of Owen \n     doesn't quite match the drooling Neanderthal depicted by her \n     critics.\n       The judicial activist charge is also hard to square with \n     reality. In the case cited by critics, where Gonzales affixed \n     the label on three dissenting justices, he was clearly \n     beholding the mote in his brother' eye while ignoring the \n     beam in his own.\n       The dispute involved a 17-year-old high school student who \n     wanted to get an abortion without notifying either of her \n     parents, as required under Texas law. A minor may get a judge \n     to waive the requirement if she can show that she is ``mature \n     and sufficiently well-informed'' to make the decision alone \n     (or to prevent abuse, which was not an issue).\n       ``Mature'' and ``well-informed'' are not terms of \n     mathematical precision, leaving some room for interpretation. \n     But after hearing her testify, a trial court judge ruled that \n     the girl was not sufficiently well-informed. An appeals court \n     reached the same conclusion. Without the benefit of face-to-\n     face contact with the girl, the Texas Supreme Court overruled \n     them.\n       There is no ``judicial activism'' in respecting the \n     findings of a trial court judge, as Owen did. Nor is there \n     anything startling in her view that the law was not supposed \n     to make waivers automatic. In fact, during the legislative \n     debate back in 1999, supporters of the proposal envisioned \n     the bypass mainly for instances of incest and physical abuse.\n       Critics insisted then that the bill made it too hard to get \n     around the notification rule. One opposing legislator \n     predicted that if the measure passed, not a single waiver \n     would be granted. The legislators who originally sponsored \n     the measure filed a brief in this case, arguing that the \n     whole point of their legislation was to ``restore parents'' \n     natural authority to act as chief advisors to their minor \n     daughters who become pregnant and seek abortions'' and to \n     assure that parents would be excluded only in ``exceptional \n     circumstances.''\n       The Texas legislature, a conservative one, passed a \n     restrictive law aimed mainly at assuring the involvement of \n     parents, not preventing it. So how is it ``judicial \n     activism'' for a judge to read it the way that even its \n     critics read it during the debate? More plausibly, the \n     activism was on the other side. Owen was not giving into the \n     temptation to legislate from the bench, but resisting it.\n       If Owen had gone along with a more relaxed reading of the \n     law, she might indeed be accused of judicial activism. But \n     not by the people attacking her today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Wall Street Journal, September 5, 2002]\n\n                        Too Smart for the Senate\n\n       Priscilla Owen isn't exactly a household name.

Currently on the Texas Supreme\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n     Court, she is one of the best legal minds of her generation \n     and at age 47 is potential Supreme Court material. She's a \n     conservative, but the liberal American Bar Association gave \n     her its highest rating--a unanimous well-qualified.\n       There was a time that jurists of her intellectual caliber \n     were welcomed by Senators of both parties, but no more. \n     Barring a last-minute bout of conscience, Democrats seem \n     ready to pull a Pickering--that is, kill Judge Owen's \n     nomination in committee and deny her a vote of the full \n     Senate. This was the treatment meted out to Charles Pickering \n     Sr. last March, when the Mississippi judge's nomination was \n     stopped before moderate Democrats got a chance to vote for \n     him. If Judge Owen were to reach the Senate floor, she too \n     would be confirmed with Democratic support.\n       Political war over judges isn't new, but the Judiciary \n     Democrats are taking it to an entirely new level. Chairman \n     Pat Leahy won't even schedule hearing dates for the best \n     appeals-court nominees; six of Mr. Bush's first 11 picks are \n     still waiting, 16 months after being nominated. That includes \n     legal luminaries Miguel Estrada, Jeff Sutton, John Roberts \n     and Michael McConnell, who, like Judge Owen, are potential \n     Supreme Court candidates--which is their real sin in liberal \n     Democratic eyes.\n       But maybe they're the lucky ones. Judge Pickering had to \n     endure race-baiting that African-Americans in his home state \n     deplored. D. Brooks Smith was confirmed, amid phony charges \n     of sexism, only because Senator Arlen Specter called in chits \n     for his fellow Pennsylvanian.\n       Judge Owen's fate is to be called ``anti-abortion'' because \n     she's upheld Texas's parental-notification law--a view \n     supported by more than two-thirds of Americans and the U.S. \n     Supreme Court. Her critics also make the dishonest charge \n     that even the President's own lawyer, Alberto Gonzales, who \n     served with her on the Texas Supreme Court, thinks she's a \n     judicial ``activist,'' Mr. Gonzales has denied this \n     repeatedly, and as White House counsel had a big say in her \n     nomination.\n       There's more at stake here than the fate of one \n     accomplished jurist. There's also the Constitutional ``advise \n     and consent'' process that throughout U.S. history has meant \n     that the entire Senate should work its will. The liberal \n     Judiciary 10 are denying to this President a Constitutional \n     right that Presidents Reagan, Clinton and George H.W. Bush \n     were all granted by Senates controlled by the opposite party. \n     We hope those Senate Democrats who want to be President \n     understand that the same thing could happen to them.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am heartened not just for the sake of Justice Owen, but \nbecause at her hearing I expressed alarm at the efforts by some to \nintroduce ideology into the confirmation process. I am heartened that \neditorial and op-ed writers across the country reflect not only support \nfor Justice Owen but also the near universal rejection of this \nmisguided effort to make the independent Federal Judiciary a mere \nextension of the Congress, and less than the independent, coequal \nbranch it was intended to be.\n  It is important to place this vote against Justice Owen's nomination \nin context for the American people because I know there are those who \nseem to justify this wrong in childlike fashion with the intellectual \ncrutch of ``they did it, too.''\n  Let me say that we Republicans have never done what was done today. I \nvoted against only one Clinton nominee, as I recall, but I did it \nstanding on the Senate floor where the American people could see me, \nwhere I could be counted, not sitting in the shadows of the Judiciary \nCommittee room.\n  Allow me to place this vote further in context, Mr. President. In \nthis session so far, the Senate has confirmed 73 judges. There is much \neagerness in asserting that this number now compares to the last three \nsessions of Congress during which I was Chairman. Although I am \nflattered to hear my record used as the benchmark for fairness, I am \nafraid this does not make for a correct comparison because I was never \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee during any of the President's first \n2 years in office.\n  I am glad to say that the proper comparison is not, as they say, \nabout me. During the first 2 years of President Clinton's first term, \nwhen Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate \nconfirmed 127 judicial nominees. Senator Biden achieved this record \ndespite not receiving any nominee for the first 6 months. In fact, \nSenator Biden's first hearing was held on July 20 of that year, more \nthan a week later than the first hearing this session, which occurred \non July 11, 2001.\n  Clearly, getting started in July of year one is no barrier to the \nconfirmation of 127 judges by the end of year two, but we have \nconfirmed only 73 nominees in this session.\n  Senator Biden's track record during the first President Bush's first \n2 years also demonstrates how a Democrat-led Senate treated a \nRepublican President. Then-Chairman Biden presided over the \nconfirmation of all but five of President Bush's 75 nominees in that \nfirst 2-year session. Chairman Thurmond's record is quite similar. The \ncontrast to the present could hardly be more stark.\n  We are about to close President Bush's first 2 years in office having \nfailed the standards set by Chairmen Biden and Thurmond, and that is \nnothing over which to be proud.\n  Some discredit Justice Owen's nomination by pointing to the few \nClinton judges who did not get hearings when I was chairman, especially \nJorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno from Texas. But that is not fair to me, \nand not truthful, and it has nothing to do with Justice Owen. Neither \nof those nominees had support of their home State Senators, and there \nwere good reasons. This prevented me from scheduling a hearing for them \nand would have prevented any chairman, including Chairman Leahy \npresently, from holding hearings.\n  In fact, these nominees lacked home senator in part because President \nClinton ignored the Texas Senators and the Texas nominating commission \nin making their nominations. It was a legitimate complaint and one that \nmy Democrat colleagues repeat now. Our process is when both State \nsenators are against a judgeship nominee from their State, that \njudgeship nominee will not go anywhere.\n  This practice is not one I put in place. It was put in place under \nthe Democrat leadership of this Judiciary Committee. Today, Democrat \nSenators from the State of North Carolina, California, and Michigan \nhave prevented the Judiciary Committee presently from holding hearings \non six of President Bush's nominees.\n  One final point on Rangel and Moreno and, for that matter, any of the \nClinton judges confirmed or not: I am not a betting person, but if I \nwere, I would bet that neither would trade places with Charles \nPickering.\n  As important as anything we do is the way the Committee has treated \nthe so-called controversial nominees. Their records have not only been \ndamaged and distorted, they have been turned completely upside down, \n180 degrees from the truth.\n  Charles Pickering came to this committee with a four-decades-old \nrecord of working in favor of civil rights. He testified against the \nImperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, at a time when doing \nso put him, his wife, and his children smack in the crosshairs of a \nviolent and unforgiving terrorist organization. That was an act of real \nbravery motivated by his belief in doing right.\n  But what happened? The hearing room and the subsequent fundraising \nletters echoed with the word ``racist.'' Charles Pickering's record was \ncompletely turned upside down.\n  Judge Brooks Smith's true history fared no better. Judge Smith had a \nreputation for going out his way to assist women in the legal \nprofession. Judge Smith received the Susan B. Anthony Award because of \n``his commitment to eradicating gender bias in the court system.'' But \nJudge Smith's opponents did not talk about that. In fact, they worked \nhard to create an impression exactly opposite by focusing not on his \nwork as a judge but on his previous membership in a small men's fishing \nclub. Never mind that Susan B. Anthony Award.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that we are pleased that Judge Smith won \nthe approval of the vast majority of the Senators when he was given a \nchance to be heard on the floor after long delay. I think it would be \nfair to give that same chance to Priscilla Owen, and I think she would \nfare just as well as Judge Brooks Smith.\n  Today, we decided the fate of another so-called controversial \nnominee, and once again there is a 180-degree disconnect from the truth \nof Priscilla Owen's record and the yarn being woven around it. We heard \ntoday about the same handful of cases--a very few of Owen cases out of \nthousands. And, by the way, not only have Owen opponents selected only \na few cases, ignoring many, they have distorted the cases they do cite.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\n  Today, we heard again the stale rhetoric that Justice Owen fails \nplaintiffs, from those who are more interested in being more just to \nplaintiffs--to make it more to the point, the plaintiff's trial lawyers \nwho are their strong supporters.\n\n  In fact, there are several leading cases that Justice Owen's \ndetractors ignore in which she ruled for plaintiffs and against \nmanufacturers and physicians. Think about it. Sometimes a company or \nemployer may be right, under the law. Now, I know there are those on \nthe other side of the aisle who think that just cannot be, as they are \nadamantly work on behalf of the plaintiff's trial lawyers. Sometimes \nbusinesses are right.\n  Of course, much of the opposition of Justice Owen has been driven by \ninterest groups that advocate for the right to abortion. And this is \nbecoming tremendously dominant on the Democratic side because of these \noutside special interest groups that have immense power. Millions and \nmillions of dollars are put into People for the American Way and other \npro-abortion groups to advocate just this cause. It is terrifying to \nhave these groups against you, but it is the right thing to stand up \nagainst them when they are wrong. In this case, they have been wrong.\n  These groups have said they want judges on the bench who will read \nand apply and follow the Supreme Court cases in the area of the right \nof privacy, especially in the landmark cases of Griswold, Roe, and \nCasey. Yet here we have Justice Owen, the first nominee we have \nconsidered in this session who as a judge read those cases, cited them, \nquoted them, applied them, has followed them. Yet her record was so \ndistorted as to make it seem she was against abortion when, to this \nday, I don't know where she stands on that particular issue.\n  Justice Owen researched the case law of abortion and has faithfully \nincorporated Supreme Court rulings into her decisions on a related \ntopic in an inferior court. This shows the application of precedence \nthat should satisfy anyone interested in upholding the Supreme Court's \nabortion decisions or any other decision. It was the right thing for \nher to do because she was bound by the law of the land. Frankly, as \nmuch as some pro-life people may not like that, she upheld the law, \nwhich is what she should have done.\n  Yet here she was defeated this morning, primarily on that single \nissue, when it really was not an issue. But it was distorted, and it \nwas manipulated, and it was used against her in, frankly, a very \ndespicable way.\n  Of course, Justice Owen's critics are not praising her for following \nthe Supreme Court law. They are attempting to portray her as a judicial \nactivist. The truth is, she is a judicious judge who never digresses \nfrom the rules of precedence and legal construction. She always grounds \nher decisions in binding authority or judicial rules of decision.\n  Of course, the charge that she is a judicial activist is a cynical \ntrick of words from Washington special interest lobbyists, liberal \nspecial interest lobbyists, as well as their well-funded allies in \nTexas who have made their careers taking positions without letting the \nwords of the Constitution stand between them and their political \nobjectives.\n  The people of Texas, almost 84 percent of them, voted for Priscilla \nOwen to be reelected to the State supreme court. So she has the vast \nmajority of the people of Texas who know what a high quality person she \nis. Yet these people today, the people on the committee, ignored all of \nthat.\n  Why are they doing so? Ironically enough, they are doing so because \nthey do not like the Texas statute requiring parental notice in cases \nof abortions for children. Justice Owen voted to give the statute some \nmeaning. It was a poorly drafted statute where they tried to please \neverybody, and that is always a bad statute. As she explains in \nbrilliant fashion in her written responses to the questions of \nSenators, Justice Owen sought to find that meaning in Supreme Court \ncases that informed the Texas legislators in adopting the notice law.\n  This is what any good lawyer would try to do or would know to do, let \nalone a good judge. She sought to give the lower courts in her State \nthat were reaching diverse results, county to county, Supreme Court \nguidance.\n  Even Planned Parenthood's lawyer understood this. She said in a 2000 \ninterview:\n\n       A lot of what the Supreme Court is doing is giving \n     guidelines to the lower courts on how to interpret the \n     parental notification law.\n\n  Justice Owen's opponents think a minor should always be able to avoid \nthe Texas legislators' standards. It is the groups allied against \nJustice Owen who are the judicial activists here, the ones who are \nlooking to achieve in the courts an outcome that is at odds with the \nlaw passed by the duly elected legislators of the State of Texas.\n  The Texas legislature did not pass a judicial bypass law with some \nexceptions. They passed a parental notice law, and they stated that \nthey intended the court-granted exceptions to be rare. And, in fact, in \npractice they are rare.\n  This is what Justice Owen's opponents cannot stomach. So here they \nare in our midst. But why? The truth is that while my colleagues' vote \nare entirely about an abortion litmus test, I fear the opposition to \nJustice Owen from the abortion lobby is not at all about abortion \nrights, because abortion rights are affected by a mere notice statute. \nThe opposition to Justice Owen is not really about abortion rights, it \nis about abortion profits.\n  Simply put, the abortion industry is opposed to parental notice laws \nbecause parental notice laws place a hurdle between them and the \nprofits from the abortion clients--not the girls who come to them but \nthe adult men who pay for these abortions. These adult men, whose \naverage age rises the younger the girl is, are eager not to be \ndisclosed to parents, sometimes living down the street.\n  At $1,000 per abortion and nearly 1 million abortions per year, the \nabortion industry is as big as any corporate interest that lobbies in \nWashington. They not only ignore the rights of parents, they also \nprotect sexual offenders and statutory rapists.\n  And who are the lobbyists for the abortion industry? They are exactly \nthe same cast that launched an attack on Justice Owen. One wonders, as \ncolumnist Jeff Jacoby did in the Boston Globe:\n\n       Who are the extremists on this issue?\n\n  Who is out of the mainstream? It is certainly not Justice Owen. \nEighty-two percent of the American people favor consent and notice laws \nsuch as Justice Owen interpreted. In fact, 86 percent in the State of \nIllinois favor these laws.\n  I will say it again. While my colleagues are applying an abortion \nlitmus test, the assault against Justice Owen from the outside groups \nwas not about abortion rights, it was about abortion profits. It is not \nabout a woman's right to an abortion. It is about assailing parental \nlaws that threaten the men who pay for abortions. It is whether parents \nshould at least know--not even consent to, but just know when a minor \nchild is having an abortion paid for by an adult.\n  But there is another interest at play here. Justice Owen was also \nopposed by the trial lawyers--I should say the plaintiff's trial \nlawyers. It is they who keep score over judges and how they rule on \nconsumer, environmental, and personal injury cases, all of the areas of \nthe law from which they most profit. And it is the trial lawyers, who \nmost fund the special interest groups, who oppose all of President \nBush's nominees.\n  I have to say, I know a number of these great plaintiff's lawyers, \nand a number of them are very upstanding people. But unfortunately, the \nvast majority are more interested in making sure they can continue to \nget big verdicts than they are in doing what is just.\n  I do not want to malign those who are decent, honorable plaintiff's \nlawyers. I was one of those myself, as well as a defense lawyer. But I \ncould not stomach this type of attitude towards the law that some of \nthem are pushing.\n  In almost infantile fashion, they would portray Justice Owen as pro-\nthis or anti-that. Professor Victor Schwartz, a leading authority on \ntorts in this country, addresses this in a letter he sent the Judiciary \nCommittee. After reviewing Justice Owen's record, this tort law expert \nconcludes that Justice Owen cannot be described as pro-defendant or \npro-plaintiff.\n  The truth is that Justice Owen functions as any judge should, as an \nunbiased umpire. As an umpire, Justice\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nOwen calls the balls and the strikes as they are, not as she alone sees \nthem and not as she wants them to be. It is silly to suggest she is \npro-bat or pro-ball, pro-pitcher, or pro-batter. Of course, trial \nlawyers and those who shill for them have an interest in Justice Owen's \nscore.\n  As she said in her hearing, she is blind to rich or poor without \nturning a blind eye to equity. Any Senator who met her or who attended \nher hearing or who read the letters from those who know her would not \nquestion her compassion and fairness.\n  I hoped that no Senator would cast a vote who did not meet her or who \ndid not attend the hearing. But unfortunately I know some did.\n  Let's speak truth to power. Justice Owen was picked to be opposed \nbecause she is a friend of President Bush from Texas. She was opposed \nby an axis of profits. This axis of profits combines the money of trial \nlawyers and the abortion industry to fund these Washington special \ninterest groups and spreads its influence to the halls of power in \nWashington and in State courts across this country.\n  As an aside, some estimate that one of these lobbying groups rakes in \nsomewhere between $12 million and $15 million a year from the Hollywood \ncrowd and others, especially the trial lawyers in this country. There \nis nothing on our side that even comes close to that to be able to \ncorrect the record.\n  The opposition against Justice Owen is intended not only to have a \nchilling effect on women jurists that will keep them from weighing in \non exactly the sorts of cases that most invite their participation in \ntheir perspectives as women, but also on all judges in all State courts \nwho rule on cases that trial lawyers want to win and cash in on.\n\n  Today's vote besmirched a model young woman from Texas who grew up, \nworked hard, and did all the right things, including repeatedly \nanswering the call of public service at a sacrifice of personal wealth \nand family. I might add, she was one of the top lawyers in the country. \nShe worked for one of the top law firms in the country. She was doing \nvery well financially many times over what she makes as a Texas Supreme \nCourt justice. She was a single mother who was raising her child. She \ngoes to a church. She is in the choir in her church and helps to lead \nthe choir. She is a decent, honorable person, and she is about as \nnonpolitical as anybody I have ever seen come before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Yet she has been treated very poorly indeed.\n  Today my Democrat colleagues voted against the American promise--the \npromise that anyone who works hard can serve the public trust. Such a \nvote, in my opinion, should not have taken place anywhere but in the \nlight of the Senate floor, where 100 Senators would have the right to \ndetermine whether this fine woman should or should not sit on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I have to say it should have taken place in \nthe light of the Senate floor and not in the shadows of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I fear, as a result of the Owen vote, a sword of Damocles has fallen \non the Senate in its role of advice and consent. I hope the American \npeople will repair the damage done to the Constitution when they vote \nin November.\n  Let me just say that when I ran for President, and I was one of those \nwho was in the race with President Bush--whom I grew to love and \nrespect as I was running with him or against at the time. I thought he \nwas terrific throughout the process. I raised the issue of the \nimportance of keeping the Federal judiciary independent, how important \nit is that we get the best people for these judgeship positions.\n  I have been on this Senate Judiciary Committee for 26 years, and I \nhave to tell you I have not seen a better nominee come before the \nJudiciary Committee than Priscilla Owen. Of all the sitting judges that \nPresident Bush has nominated she is the clearly the best.\n  Not only is she an honorable person, but she handled herself very \nwell at her hearing. She took a litany of bad comments from some \nDemocrats with aplomb. She was very judicious in her approach. I have \nto tell you, she is one of the best people I have met in my whole time \nin the Senate. Yet she was treated in a shabby fashion--I think just to \nhurt the President, in some ways.\n  But, even more important than that, it was to satisfy these \ndespicable--in this case, outside special interest groups that are \nextreme and far to the left of the American people. They want only \npeople who agree with them on the courts, and do not abide with anybody \nwho doesn't agree with them, and they have immense wealth behind them \nto be able to distort the wonderful record of a person such as \nPriscilla Owen.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement of \nSenator Zell Miller, a Dear Colleague letter by myself concerning the \nNew York Times editorial that I mentioned, and my published letter to \nthe New York Times published today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Miller Voices Support for Texas Nominee\n\n       Washington, DC.--U.S. Senator Zell Miller (D-GA) today \n     issued the following statement on judicial nominee Priscilla \n     Owen, whose nomination is expected to be voted on by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n       ``Justice Owen enjoys bipartisan support in her home state \n     of Texas, and she is a qualified jurist. I will support her \n     nomination and I believe she deserves a vote by the full \n     Senate. I really hope we will not begin the trend of \n     rejecting nominees over narrow, single-issue litmus tests.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2002.\n       Dear Colleague: I am taking the unusual step of writing to \n     the entire Congress because I am outraged about an untruthful \n     and misleading attack on Justice Priscilla Owen that appeared \n     on today's New York Times editorial page. I am deeply \n     concerned that such misinformation, if given serious weight \n     by the country's decisionmakers, could undermine the \n     integrity both of the judiciary and the branch of government \n     in which we are privileged to serve.\n       As you know, Justice Owen is a Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     whose nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \n     currently pending before the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary. The editorial, entitled ``The Wrong Judge,'' \n     wrongly accuses Justice Priscilla Owen of being ``far from \n     the mainstream.'' No doubt that charge will stun Texas \n     voters, who have twice elected her overwhelmingly to \n     statewide office. It should also shock all of us who serve in \n     Congress and who therefore know that Justice Owen, whom the \n     American Bar Association has unanimously rated ``well \n     qualified'' (its highest rating), undoubtedly fits well in \n     the mainstream of American thought. If defeated, Justice Owen \n     will become the first judicial nominee with the ABA's highest \n     rating to suffer that fate.\n       The editorial also falsely claims that Justice Owen has \n     ``ignored statutory language and substituted her own views.'' \n     In truth, her record of applying the law as written is among \n     the very best of any judicial nominee ever presented to the \n     Senate. This is particularly true in her decisions concerning \n     the Texas law requiring parental notification when their \n     minor children obtain abortions. Contrary to the editorial, \n     no one's right to choose was implicated, only the right of \n     parents to have knowledge of, and an opportunity for \n     involvement in, one of the most important decisions of their \n     children's lives. In those cases, Justice Owen did exactly \n     what any restrained judge should do: She applied the Texas \n     statutory law as directed by the Supreme Court's cases \n     including Roe v. Wade. Ironically, it is Justice Owen's \n     opponents--the ones who accuse her of being an activist--who \n     would have her ignore the legislature and the Supreme Court \n     in order to reach a political result.\n       The New York Times uses similarly flawed analysis when it \n     accuses Justice Owen of ``reflexively'' deciding cases in \n     favor of ``manufacturers over consumers, employers over \n     workers and insurers over sick people.'' This charge is not \n     only factually without basis, but also belies the accusation \n     of ``activism.'' Only someone obsessed with outcomes--rather \n     than the law governing the particular cases--would be \n     compelled by a mere counting up wins and losses among parties \n     who have appeared before a judge. Working as a judge is like \n     being an umpire; Justice Owen cannot be characterized as pro-\n     this or pro-that any more than an umpire can be analyzed as \n     pro-bat or pro-ball. A judge's job is to apply the law to the \n     case at hand, not to mechanistically ensure that court \n     victories go 50/50 for plaintiffs and defendants, \n     consumers and corporations.\n       I endorse the words of my friend Senator Biden, a former \n     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who said some years ago \n     that: ``[Judicial confirmation] is not about pro-life or pro-\n     choice, conservative or liberal, it is not about Democrat or \n     Republican. It is about intellectual and professional \n     competence to serve as a member of the third co-equal branch \n     of the Government.''\n       The New York Times' attack on Justice Owen's ``lack of \n     sensitivity to judicial ethics'' is also contrary to the \n     facts. Justice Owen went above and beyond the Texas ethics \n     rules in her last election, voluntarily setting her own \n     stricter guidelines for fund-raising. She has also advocated \n     reforming the Texas judicial elections process in order to \n     protect the integrity of the courts.\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n       Ironically, the editorial attempts to deploy against \n     Justice Owen the words of one of her biggest supporters, \n     Alberto Gonzales, President Bush's White House Counsel. Judge \n     Gonzales served with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court \n     and has written publicly that she is ``extraordinarily well \n     qualified to serve as a judge on the federal appeals court.'' \n     Rather than focus on his ringing endorsement, however, the \n     New York Times instead sensationalizes a disagreement that \n     Judge Gonzales had not with Justice Owen, but rather with a \n     whole group of judges who filed a dissenting opinion in a \n     case involving the Texas parental consent law.\n       Last but not least, the editor5ial blames the Bush \n     Administration for not getting the message ostensibly sent by \n     the defeat of Judge Charles Pickering that it should not \n     nominate any ``conservatives.'' It seems to imply some \n     connection between Pickering defeat and the nomination of \n     Justice Owen. If the editorial board would have done its \n     homework, however, it would have learned that Justice Owen \n     was nominated two weeks before Judge Pickering was nominated \n     and ten months before he was defeated by a party-line vote in \n     the Judiciary Committee.\n       Justice Owen is an excellent judge. Her opinions, whether \n     majority, concurrences or dissents, could be used as a law \n     school text book that illustrates exactly how an appellate \n     judge should think, write, and do the people justice by \n     effecting their will through the laws adopted by their \n     elected legislatures. Justice Owen clearly approaches these \n     tasks with both scholarship and mainstream American common \n     sense. If the Congress of the United States cannot, in all \n     its power and wisdom, detect these qualities and disentangle \n     them from the ill-considered assertions of a powerful \n     newspaper--inspired not by facts but by left-wing Washington \n     special interest groups--then our institution is in trouble.\n       I hope you will join me in informing the American people of \n     the truth surrounding the nomination of Justice Owen and in \n     warning them of the grave danger posed by an uninformed \n     politicization of the federal judiciary.\n           Sincerely,\n     Orrin G. Hatch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 5, 2002]\n\n                            The Right Judge\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                September 4, 2002.\n       To the Editor: ``The Wrong Judge'' (editorial, Sept. 4) \n     accuses Justice Priscilla R. Owen, President Bush's nominee \n     to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \n     of being ``far from the mainstream.'' No doubt that charge \n     amuses Texas voters, who have twice elected her overwhelming \n     to statewide office.\n       You also assert that Justice Owen has ``substituted her own \n     views'' for the law. In fact, her record of applying the law \n     as written is among the best of any judicial nominee ever \n     presented to the Senate. This is particularly so in her \n     decisions concerning the Texas law requiring parental \n     notification when minors obtain abortions. In these cases, \n     the right to choose was not implicated, only the right of \n     parents to know. Justice Owen applied the Texas law as \n     directed by the Supreme Court's cases, including Roe v. Wade.\n       You also attack Justice Owen's ``lack of sensitivity to \n     judicial ethics.'' Justice Owen went above and beyond the \n     Texas ethics rules in her last election, voluntarily setting \n     her own stricter guidelines for fund-raising. She has \n     advocated reforming the Texas judicial elections process.\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                          Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is really starting to get to me that \nbecause of special interest control of this body, abortion is becoming \na single litmus test issue on the part of a number of Senators in this \nbody--not all, thank goodness, on either side, but a number of \nSenators. It is an important issue. There are very sincere people on \nthe pro-choice side. There are very sincere people on the pro-life \nside. Both sides deserve consideration and respect.\n  When we get to where one single issue will determine whether a person \ncan serve in a position in this country, such as a Federal judgeship, \nwe know this country is in trouble; that is, whether it comes on this \nside or it comes on that side.\n  I can remember when Reagan was the President and we had control of \nthe committees. There was a constant berating of us because they \nthought we might have abortion as a single litmus test issue. The fact \nof the matter is, we didn't. I know the question was never even asked \nbecause I know who did the betting. He happened to be a former staff \nmember of mine. He never asked that question. They might have thought \nthey had somebody who was pro-life, but they never asked that question. \nThat was not even a consideration in the questions. They found out that \na number of their people whom they nominated and who were confirmed \nwere pro-choice.\n  During the Clinton years when I was chairman of the committee, I \nwould not allow that single litmus test to be used on our side because \nI don't believe any single litmus test should be used in any way with \nregard to the Federal judiciary. The fact that I might disagree with a \nnominee on an issue that is important to me is somewhat irrelevant \nunless there are other really justifiable reasons for voting against \nthe person.\n  I am finding that basically justifiable reasons depend an awful lot \non how much force is brought to bear by outside interest groups who are \nbasically supportive of the pro-abortion side. I have had folks on \nother side say it is a litmus test. Thank goodness, not many.\n  But that is why they wanted to keep Priscilla Owen from coming to the \nSenate floor--because Priscilla Owen would have passed on the Senate \nfloor, would serve very well on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, I \nthink would please both sides of this body because of the very decent \nperson she really is, because of the great legal scholar she is, and \nbecause of the honest and upright person she is.\n  We have lost that opportunity for this year. But I can tell the \nAmerican people that if they will support President Bush, and if we can \nget control of the Senate, Priscilla Owen will make it through because \nshe will at least have a vote. I believe she will make it through.\n  In that regard, I am very appreciative of the endorsement of the \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Zell Miller, of her right to have a vote \non the floor and his statement that he would vote for her--a Democrat \nSenator. I think he recognizes that this body is becoming very \npolarized. It is becoming a body that may not be a great body anymore, \nif we keep going this way, because we are polarizing ourselves to where \nsingle litmus test issues can determine whether or not we vote and do \nwhat is right.\n  Frankly, we ought to be doing what is right regardless of any single \nlitmus test issue. I know there are some on both sides who believed \notherwise. But I think they are a distinct minority. But on the \nJudiciary Committee on this issue of abortion, I have to admit that it \nis coming down to the point where it is a prime issue.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say they voted for \npeople who are pro-life. That is true, because you can only do this so \nmany times to a President's nominee. You can't get away with it very \noften. I hope they don't get away with it with regard to Justice \nPriscilla Owen. She deserves a vote on the floor.\n  I have to say I am reaching a point in my tenure here where I am so \nsick and tired of the politics of this body on judicial nominations. I \nam so sick and tired of the way people are treated here. That is on \nboth sides from time to time. I really believe, barring just cause, \nthat every President's nominee for the Federal judiciary--at least for \nthe Circuit Courts--ought to be given a vote on the Senate floor \nregardless of what the Senate Judiciary Committee does. If the \ncommittee votes a person down, that should be given tremendous weight; \nno question about it--in this case as well. But the fact of matter is \nthat at least the Constitution says we should have a right to consent. \nAnd it doesn't mean 10 Senators, it means 100 Senators. I believe that \nwould be only the fair way to do it. I really believe it ought to be \ndone whether a President is Republican or Democrat.\n  I wish I had made that suggestion. I did allude to it on more than \none occasion on the floor during the last 6 years of President \nClinton's tenure.\n  I have heard nothing but badmouthing about what Republicans did to \nPresident Clinton's nominees, even though half of the Federal judiciary \ntoday are Clinton judges and President Clinton himself told me that I \ntreated him fairly. Let me tell you, there is no reason for that. \nPresident Reagan got 382 Federal judges through and confirmed. That is \nthe most in history. He had 6 years of a Republican Senate--his own \nparty--to help him to do that. President Clinton got 377 through--\nvirtually the same number--and he had 6 years of a Republican Senate, \nan opposition party Senate which helped him to do that. I know. I was \nchairman during those 6 years. He was treated very fairly.\n  There are always those who do not make it, I have to admit. There is \nalways a complaint about that. But that\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\nis true whether it is Republican control of the committee or Democrat \ncontrol of the committee. I would stack up our record on getting \nClinton judges through against any record of the Democrats with regard \nto Reagan or Bush nominees.\n  Frankly, we are talking about circuit court nominees here who have \nbeen sitting on the nominations list now for over a year and half, some \nof the finest nominees in history--just to mention a few, John Roberts \nis being considered as a Supreme Court Justice--whether they are \nDemocrats or Republicans. He is one of the two or three top appellate \nlawyers in the country who I don't think has an ideological bent.\n  How about Miguel Estrada, the first Hispanic to ever be put on the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia? I don't believe \nhe would be anything but one of the finest judges in the country; \nMichael McConnell, who is considered one of the two or three greatest \nconstitutional experts in the country--a law professor.\n  You could go right on down the line. Deborah Cook; Jeffrey Sutton. \nThey have all been sitting there for a year and a half because the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will not act on them.\n  I have a commitment from Senator Leahy, and I am going to rely on \nthat commitment, that he would get McConnell and Estrada through not \nonly the committee but through the floor before the end of this \nsession. We are running out of time. If he did that, certainly I would \nbe very pleased. I take him at his word that he will try to do that. \nThose are two of the finest people we could possibly have as judges in \nthis country.\n  I am hopeful that we will have that done before the end of this year. \nIt is the right thing to do. I hope we can get John Roberts, Sutton, \nCook, and others who have been sitting there for a year and half who I \nthink have been very badly treated. There is no reason not, other than \nthey know how brave all these people are.\n  I suspect they think they can ascertain how they are going to rule on \nthe bench once they get there. Frankly, nobody knows how that is going \nto work once the person gets a lifetime appointment.\n  Let me just say again that one-half the Federal judiciary are Clinton \njudges. There is little or no reason for any complaint on the other \nside, even though, yes, there were some who didn't make it at the end, \njust as there are always 50 or more who didn't make it who were \nRepublican nominees at the end of the first Bush administration.\n  By the way, John Roberts was nominated by the first President Bush. \nHe is still sitting there. He is one of the two best appellate lawyers \nin the country just sitting there for a year and a half.\n  I might add that others, as well, have been nominated twice now and \nare just still sitting there after more than 10 years.\n  So it is time to get this out of the realm of politics and start \ndoing what is right; and that is, the President has a right to \nnominate, which is the greater power. We have a right to confirm or not \nconfirm, but that ought to be done on the Senate floor, not by 10 \npeople who basically are, in my opinion, by and large, doing the \nbidding of these outside groups who have tremendous sway because of \ntheir money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In less than 15 months the Judiciary Committee has \nfavorably reported 80 judicial nominees and voted not to report 2.\n  Four conservative, Republican women have already been reported and \nthree have been confirmed by the Senate: Sharon Prost to the Federal \nCircuit; Edith Brown Clement to the 5th Circuit, who was the first \nnominee to the 5th Circuit to get a hearing in seven years, since 1994; \nJulia Smith Gibbons to the 6th Circuit, who was the first nominee to \nthe 6th Circuit to get a hearing in almost 5 years; and today the \nCommittee voted unanimously to report Judge Reena Raggi, who is \nnominated to a vacancy on the 2d Circuit.\n  In addition, approximately a dozen more conservative, Republican \nwomen have already been confirmed to the Federal District Courts, \nincluding: Karen Caldwell, E.D. KY; Laurie Smith Camp, D.C. NE; Karon \nBowdre, N.D. AL; Julie Robinson, D.C. KS; Marcia Krieger, D.C. CO; \nCallie Granade, S.D. AL; Cindy Jorgenson, D.C. AZ; Joan Lancaster, D.C. \nMN; Cynthia Rufe, E.D. PA; Joy Flowers Conti, W.D. PA; and Amy St. Eve, \nN.D. IL.\n  I appreciate that the Administration and Republicans are disappointed \nwith the outcome of the vote on the nomination of Priscilla Owen. I \nwant to accord other Senators respect and, in these circumstances, some \nleeway in their comments--even as those comments are directed \npersonally at me and other Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n  In response to their protestations, as if there were anything \nimproper in the Judiciary Committee's consideration of the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen, I note that the salient difference between the vote \non Justice Owen and the six and one-half years that preceded the change \nin majority is that Justice Owen was given a thorough and fair hearing, \nthe Committee had a public, open and extensive debate and the \nnomination was then voted upon in public session. That was not true for \nmore than a dozen nominees to vacancies on our Courts of Appeals over \nthe last several years--several of which were left pending without a \nhearing or a vote for months and years. Here are just a few of those \ncircuit court nominees with ``Well Qualified'' peer review ratings from \nthe ABA that the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee never \naccorded a vote:\n  James Duffy, nominated to the Ninth Circuit; Kathleen McCree-Lewis, \nnominated to the Sixth Circuit; Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth \nCircuit; James Lyons, nominated to the Tenth Circuit; and Robert \nCindrich, nominated to the Third Circuit. Others, like Allen Snyder, \nnominated to the DC Circuit, were given a hearing but was never given a \nCommittee vote, up or down. These and scores of other nominees of the \npast President were defeated by the Republican decision to deny them \nCommittee votes.\n  Republicans' preferred method for ``defeating'' more than 50 circuit \nand district court nominees rated ``highly qualified'' and \n``qualified'' by the ABA and those with significant professional \ncredentials was to deny them hearings and, for some who had hearings, \nto deny them Committee consideration.\n  To those Senators who are now contending that the ideology and \npossible activism of judicial nominees should have no place in \nSenators' consideration, I ask them to start by reviewing their own \nrecords of opposition to President Clinton's nominees, including their \nown votes against nominees professionally qualified. Those who voted \nagainst Margaret McKeown, Marsha Berzon, Sonia Sotomayor, Rosemary \nBarkett and Merrick Garland, Ray Fisher, Richard Paez, William Fletcher \nand Timothy Dyk to the Courts of Appeals, as well as those who held up \nany vote on Allen Snyder, Bonnie Campbell and the others, could ask \nthemselves what standards they applied in so doing. The same question \ncan be asked with respect to those who opposed and voted against \nMargaret Morrow, Gerry Lynch, Mary McLaughlin, Ronnie White, Ann Aiken \nand those who held up any consideration of Clarence Sundram or Fred \nWoocher and the scores of nominees never allowed a hearing.\n  I do not wish to embarrass other Senators, but I am struck by how the \nstatements I have heard today are wholly inconsistent with votes and \nactions in the years in which they were delaying, opposing and voting \nagainst the moderate judicial nominations of a President on another \npolitical party.\n  I raise this consideration not as a matter of tit for tat, for we \nhave assiduously avoided payback, but because it is Republicans who are \ntrying to change their history and pretend that they did not oppose \nnominees based on what they perceived to be the ideological outlook of \nthe nominees.\n  I am reluctant to quote my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho are saying something very different now than they said in the prior \nsix years when they were blocking judicial nominees, but in light of \nthe attacks on the Committee, some context is necessary to understand \nthe hollowness of the charge that Committee members acted unfairly, \ninappropriately or in some unprecedented fashion in their consideration \nof the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen.\n  For example, in 1996, one Republican said that he ``led the fight to \noppose the confirmation of [two judges] because their judicial records \nindicated\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\nthat they would be activists who would legislate from the bench.'' \nWhile we may differ on whether a judge's record evidences judicial \nactivism, Republicans can hardly now be saying that such inquiry is \ninappropriate.\n  Another Republican Senator argued in 2000 in defense of his record of \nstalling Senate consideration of judicial nominees voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee that having ``strong qualifications and personal \nattributes,'' being ``fine lawyers [who] are technically competent'' \nwas not the test. He said then: ``My concern is with their judicial \nphilosophies and their likely activism on the court. . . . Judicial \nactivism is a fundamental challenge to our system of government, and it \nrepresents a danger that requires constant vigilance.'' He went on to \nsay that the Senate should not defer to the President ``if there is a \nproblem with a series of decisions or positions [judicial nominees] \nhave taken.''\n  Another Republican Senator said in 1998 that the Republicans were \n``not abusing our advise and consent power. As a matter of fact, I \ndon't think we have been aggressive enough in utilizing it to ensure \nthat the nominees to the Federal Bench are mainstream nominees.''\n  Yet another Republican said in 1994: ``My decision on a judicial \nnominee's fitness is based on my evaluation of three criteria: \ncharacter, competence and judicial philosophy--that is, how the nominee \nviews the duty of the court and its scope of authority.''\n  There are numerous other examples, of course, but these suffice to \nmake the point.\n  I ask that my full statement in opposition to the nomination of \nJustice Owen from the Judiciary Committee consideration be included in \nthe Record at the end of these remarks. It focuses on the merits of the \nnomination, as did Senator Feinstein, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Durbin and Senator DeWine. A few of the statements in the two-\nhour debate before the Committee were not helpful to a reasoned debate, \nbut by and large the Committee debate was on the merits. That followed \nan extensive hearing, that lasted six hours, which Senator Feinstein \nchaired fairly and patiently. A thorough hearing and a fair vote is \nwhat Justice Owen's nomination received from the Committee.\n  The name-calling, threats, tactics of intimidation and retaliation \nare not helpful to the process. Holding up important legislative \ninitiatives is harmful. Holding up ``the comma bill'' and threatening \nDemocrats that they will be barred from Air Force One are silly.\n  Today the Senator Judiciary Committee reported a conservative \nRepublican nominee to the Senate for a vacancy on a Court of Appeals. \nThis nominee, Judge Reena Raggi, was first appointed by President \nReagan and she came before the Committee with strong bipartisan support \nand without the divisive controversy that accompanies so many of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees. Judge Raggi was reported out \nunanimously today. Indeed, since the change in majority less than 15 \nmonths ago, the Committee has worked hard to report 80 judicial \nnominees to the Senate. They include a number of very conservative \njudges.\n  I have made suggestions to the White House for improving the \nnominations and confirmations processes but those suggestions continue \nto be rebuffed. I wish the White House would work with us rather than \nstridently insist on seeking to skew the federal courts ideologically.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8292-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, last week the Violence Policy Center, VPC, \nreleased a report entitled Sitting Ducks detailing the danger of the \n.50 caliber sniper rifle as a terrorist threat to, among other things, \nrefineries and hazardous-chemical facilities. According to the VPC's \nreport, the .50 caliber sniper rifle, equipped with explosive or armor-\npiercing ammunition, is capable of hitting a target accurately from \nmore than a thousand yards away making it well suited to attack fuel \ntanks and other high-value targets from a distance.\n  The VPC report highlights the danger of a .50 caliber sniper rifle \nbeing used in a simple conventional attack with potentially disastrous \nresults. The weapon is not only readily available, ``low technology'', \nbut a .50 caliber sniper rifle is so powerful that it has been said to \nbe able to wreck several million dollars' worth of jet aircraft with \none or two dollars' worth of ammunition.\n  Despite its obvious power, under current law .50 caliber sniper \nrifles are no more regulated than hunting rifles. That is why I \ncosponsored Senator Feinstein's ``Military Sniper Weapon Regulation \nAct,'' S. 505. This bill would change the way .50 caliber guns are \nregulated by placing them under the requirements of the National \nFirearms Act. This action would subject these weapons to the same \nregimen of registration and background checks to which other weapons of \nwar, such as machine guns, are currently subjected. This is a necessary \nstep to assuring the safety of Americans.\n  Mr. President, .50 caliber weapons are too powerful and too \naccessible to be ignored. Tighter regulations are needed. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Feinstein's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8292-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8292-S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMEMORATING SGT. FIRST CLASS CHRISTOPHER JAMES SPEER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we meet here just days from the \nanniversary of the terrorist attacks on our country, it is my sad duty \nto report that another of my statesmen has lost his life in the war on \nterror. Sergeant First Class Christopher James Speer, a former resident \nof Albuquerque, NM, died on August 7, 2002 as a result of wounds he \nsustained during a firefight with suspected terrorists in Afghanistan. \nToday, I want to take a few moments to convey my condolences to the \nSpeer family, and to talk a little bit about who this special young man \nwas.\n  Christopher Speer was a 1992 graduate of Sandia High School in \nAlbuquerque. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army and \nbecame a medical specialist. In 1994, he volunteered for and was \nselected for Special Forces training. After completing this training, \nhe was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Airborne Group at Fort Bragg, \nNorth Carolina where he served as a medical sergeant. Last spring, \nChristopher was sent to Afghanistan as part of a Joint Special \nOperations task force.\n  On July 27th of this year, Christopher took part in a U.S. operation \naimed at confirming intelligence about enemy activities in one of the \nmost dangerous parts of Afghanistan. During that operation, our troops \nwere ambushed and a four-hour gunbattle ensued. During this battle, \nfive American personnel were wounded, and one of them--Christopher \nSpeer--lost his life. For his valor and ten years of dedicated service \nto country Christopher received the Soldier's Medal, the Bronze Star \nwith ``V'' device, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal and \ntwo Army Achievement Medals.\n  In addition to patriot, Christopher was very much a family man, as \nwell. And for those family members who knew him best and loved him \nmost, this September 9th will be especially difficult. Because on that \nday, Christopher was to have turned 29 years old. To Tabitha, his wife; \nto Taryn and\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\nTanner, his children; and to Betty, his mother, Nancy and I sent \nheartfelt prayers on behalf of all New Mexicans as well as the \nappreciation of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8293-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPATRIATING AMERICA TO AVOID U.S. INCOME TAXES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Texas, in a \ndebate on Senator Wellstone's government contracting amendment, \ncriticized a proposal the Finance Committee was scheduled to markup \ntoday. The Senior Senator from Texas characterized the proposal as an \neffort at ``passing laws that sound like they're right out of Nazi \nGermany.'' Senator Gramm went on to criticize: ``(t)he idea that \nsomebody can't leave America and take their property with them, that \nthey've got to pay a tax in order to get their property out of \nAmerica.''\n  Mr. President, as the ranking Republican member of the Finance \nCommittee and a participant in crafting this provision, I felt \ncompelled to respond. First of all, I'm proud to serve on the Finance \nCommittee. When someone characterizes a bipartisan Finance Committee \nproposal as something ``right out of Nazi Germany,'' I'm going to be \ndisturbed.\n  Tax-motivated expatriation activities are something that troubles me. \nAll you have to do is look at the infamous case of Marc Rich. You will \nrecall Mr. Rich's case came to light in the rush of pardon applications \nduring the waning hours of the Clinton Administration. Mr. Rich \nreportedly left the U.S. to avoid U.S. taxation and sought a pardon \nwith respect to criminal indictments on, among other things, criminal \ntax charges.\n  Mr. President, there is a major principle at stake here. A key \npremise in our tax system is that those individuals and corporations \nthat derive financial benefits from economic activity that is, as the \ntax law says, ``effectively connected'' with the United States, should \nbe taxable on that income no matter where their domicile is. Any \nalternative to this concept would result in U.S. persons bearing a \nlarger burden of Federal taxation than a foreign person earning a \nlivelihood here. America and her major trading partners recognize this \nprinciple. It is reflected in the tax laws of our trading partners and \nthe international tax treaty network.\n  Let's take a look at current law. For individuals that expatriate, an \nincome tax is imposed on appreciation in the assets of the expatriate, \non a 10 year going forward basis, if the expatriate is leaving the U.S. \nwith the ``principal purpose'' of avoiding U.S. income tax. For \npurposes of this current law rule, expatriates are deemed to have \nexpatriated with a principal purpose of avoidance of U.S. income tax in \ntwo cases. In the first case, the deemed rule applies if the expatriate \nhad, on average, $100,000 of net income, for the five years at the time \nof expatriating. In the second case, the deemed rule applies if net \nworth of the expatriate exceeds $500,000. In the case of corporations, \nthe appreciation in assets transferred offshore is taxable at the time \nof transfer.\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that, under our current tax policy, \nindividuals and corporations that attempt to either leave or transfer \nassets are taxable when they leave the U.S. Frankly, the Finance \nCommittee views the so-called ``inversion'' transactions as a loophole \nthat undercuts current law principles. It is on that basis, closing an \ninsidious loophole, that the Finance Committee recently reported \nlegislation to curtail inversion transactions.\n  Similarly, in 1995 and 1996, the Finance Committee, and full Senate, \nsought to plug the loophole on the individual expatriation level. A \nproposal virtually identical to the one criticized by Senator Gramm \ntoday, was passed, on several occasions during those two years. That \nproposal did not become law because the Senate, with much reluctance, \nreceded to the House in conference. The House proposal aimed to tighten \nthe 10 year rule.\n  The Chairman and Ranking Member have revived the Finance Committee \nexpatriation proposal because of concerns about the effectiveness of \ncurrent law. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation's estimate of \nthis proposal appears to confirm that the long-standing tax policy with \nrespect to individual expatriation will be better served by the Finance \nCommittee approach.\n  Under the Finance Committee proposal, individuals that expatriate \nwould, as the Senator from Texas said, be taxable on gain in \nappreciation in U.S. assets when they leave America. This proposal \nwould replace the current law regime described above. The Finance \nCommittee proposal, is hardly ``right out of Nazi Germany.'' It \nstrengthens long-standing tax policy. The Senate has spoken favorably \non it on many occasions.\n  So, Mr. President, let's keep our eye on the ball. Current law, not a \nputative Nazi regime, preserves the fairness of U.S. tax system. The \nFinance Committee proposal makes sure the fairness of the U.S. tax \nsystem is strengthened by closing loopholes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8293-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8293-S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUCCESS AT VINCA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to remind my colleagues that an \nimportant milestone in our progress toward reducing the risks of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction took place about 2 weeks \nago.\n  Events like September 11 would have been far worse if terrorists had \naccess to weapons of mass destruction. Since September 11, appreciation \nof this threat has increased dramatically. Many of us have spoken on \nthe need to rein in the forces of international terrorism and any \npossibility that they may gain the use of such weapons.\n  The milestone to which I refer is the successful removal of enough \nweapons-grade uranium from the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences near \nBelgrade, Yugoslavia to make more than two nuclear bombs. This removal \nwas accomplished through coordination among government and private \ngroups, including contributions from Yugoslavia and Russia, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, and the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n  I especially salute the contributions made by the Nuclear Threat \nInitiative, headed by Ted Turner and our former colleague Senator Sam \nNunn. This episode represents another critical effort from the NTI. I'm \nvery honored to serve on the Board of the NTI, along with Senator \nLugar. There will always be aspects of international efforts that are \ndifficult to handle through government channels, where the private \nresources of the NTL may be vital.\n  But even as we congratulate ourselves over this victory, we need to \nrecognize that it is very small in the overall scale of the problem. \nEstimates are that weapons-grade uranium exists at over 350 sites in \nover 50 countries. Some of these have very small quantities, but many \nof these locations have enough material for one or more bombs. Some of \nthese sites include research reactors, provided by either the United \nStates or the Soviet Union, fueled by highly enriched uranium which \ncould be diverted for weapons use.\n  And we also need to examine why it required such complex coordination \nto accomplish this work and explore how Congress can simplify the \nprocess in the future. This part of the puzzle has a much simpler \nsolution, because the tools to accomplish this are now part of the \nSenate-House conference on the Armed Services authorizing legislation.\n  Let me briefly explain why the Vinca operation required so much \ncoordination. The Yugoslavian government very logically required that \nany Vinca solution address both fresh fuel and spent fuel from their \nresearch reactor. The fresh fuel was highly enriched uranium, and our \ngovernment was able to assist because it represented a proliferation \nthreat for weapons of mass destruction. That cooperation is authorized \nthrough the 1991 Nunn-Lugar and the 1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nLegislation.\n  But the spent fuel at Vinca, which is not useful for making a nuclear \nweapon, could pose both an environmental concern as well as a dirty \nbomb threat, depending on its level of radioactivity. The former \nrepresents work that is clearly beyond the authorization of our \nGovernment's nonproliferation mission and the latter represents work \nthat is not authorized.\n  Now since September 11, there have been volumes of testimony on the \nthreat posed by highly radioactive materials and their potential use as \ndirty\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nbombs. But today, despite these concerns, there are no statutes which \naddress the government's authority to offer help to other countries \nregarding dirty bomb threats.\n  I am pleased to note that the Domenici-Biden amendment to the Senate \nArmed Services legislation provides authorizations to enlarge the \nability of the government to step into such situations. With final \npassage of that amendment in the Armed Services legislation, we can \nprovide important new tools to our government.\n  Under that amendment, programs to address dirty bomb issues are \nspecifically authorized, including assistance to any country requesting \nour aid. And of equal importance, programs to broaden our ability to \naddress fissile material issues around the world, not just associated \nwith the former Soviet Union, are authorized along with new approaches \nto speed up the conversion of highly enriched uranium to material \nunusable for weapons.\n  Even with this amendment, I am sure there will be many opportunities \nfor private groups, like the NTI, to step in and plug gaps in \nGovernment programs. But with this amendment, we will vastly simplify \nfuture operations at the hundreds of remaining sites.\n  The Domenici-Biden amendment enjoyed broad support in the Senate, and \nI appreciate that Senators Lugar, Landrieu, Hagel, Carnahan, Murkowski, \nBingaman, and Lincoln joined us in introducing it.\n  It is my hope that the success at Vinca, along with the sobering \nrealization that we need to repeat this success hundreds of times to \nfully address the threat of proliferation of materials suitable for \nnuclear bombs, will encourage the Conferees from both the House and the \nSenate to ensure that provisions of the Domenici-Biden amendment are in \nthe Armed Services authorization bill that will eventually emerge from \nConference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THE 38TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WILDERNESS ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I commemorate the 38th \nAnniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was signed into law on \nSeptember 3, 1964, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Wilderness Act \nof 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ``to \nsecure for the American people of present and future generations the \nbenefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' The law reserves to \nCongress the authority to designate wilderness areas, and directs the \nFederal land management agencies to review the lands under their \nresponsibility for their wilderness potential.\n  The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest \nService land in 54 wilderness areas. Now, the wilderness system is \ncomprised of more than a 100 million acres that are administered by \nfour Federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service in the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As we in this body know well, the passage and enactment of \nlegislation of this type is a remarkable accomplishment. It requires \nsteady, bipartisan commitment, institutional support, and direct \nleadership. The United States Senate was instrumental in shaping this \nvery important law, and this anniversary gives us the opportunity to \nrecognize this role.\n  I have been very pleased to see this body return to the tradition of \ndesignating wilderness since the 35th anniversary of the act in 1999. \nThe 106th Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, a total of \neight wilderness bills adding more than 1 million acres of public land \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. This is the largest \nnumber of acres of wilderness added to the system since 1994 and is a \nstark contrast to the 105th Congress, which did not enact any \nwilderness designations.\n  While the 107th Congress may not surpass the wilderness achievements \nof the 106th, there are a number of wilderness bills pending in the \n107th Congress, several of which are likely to become law before the \nend of the year. The designation of the James Peak Wilderness in \nColorado and additions to the Black Elk Wilderness in South Dakota have \nalready been approved by Congress and signed into law by President \nBush. Bills designating new wilderness areas in Washington, Nevada, and \nPuerto Rico are likely to move forward this fall, while others, such as \nthose to designate wilderness in Washington State and California, may \nsee hearings or other congressional action.\n  Many would agree that more must be done to protect our wild places, \nbut much has been done already. In commemoration of anniversaries like \nthis one, the Senate should celebrate our accomplishment, on behalf of \nthe American people, in the protection of these wild places.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8294-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING EARLEEN ALLEN FRANCIS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have the privilege and honor of \nrising today to recognize Ms. Earleen Allen Francis of Clinton, KY. \nLast month, Ms. Francis was presented with a certificate of honor for \nher military service as an Army Nurse during WWII by the Kentucky \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs.\n  Ms. Francis, now 91 years young, is among fewer than 20 survivors of \nthe group of about 60 Army and Navy nurses captured by Japanese forces \nafter the fall of Corregidor, a small fortified island in the \nPhilippines.\n  In 1942, Japanese troops advanced on the Bataan peninsula. The Army \nand Navy nurses stationed at Bataan were evacuated to Corregidor as a \nsafety precaution. However, shortly after being moved, Japanese troops \nstormed the small island and captured 20 of the 85 nurses, including \nEarleen Allen Francis. For three long and grueling years, Earleen and \nthe 19 other nurses were starved and locked up by their captors. Their \nfreedoms were stripped from them in the blink of an eye. In many ways, \nEarleen never quite recovered from this horrific time period in her \nlife.\n  Ms. Francis' story has been told in books and on television and she \nwas even honored by President Reagan in 1983 for her service to \nAmerica. It is important that her story continues to be told.\n  I believe it is vital that we as a nation never forget about heroes \nlike Earleen Allen Francis. Sometimes, we are forced to fight and die \nfor our freedom and the continuation of our unique way of life. Ms. \nFrancis personally sacrificed a large portion of her life to ensure \nthat future generations of Americans are able to enjoy the freedoms she \nhad stripped away from her for 3 years.\n  Now more than ever, we must learn from the sacrifices others have \nmade. Terrorist states and organizations around the globe are striving \nto take the word freedom out of America's vocabulary. These terrorists \nview the world in simple terms of black and white; Islam is on the good \nside, and the infidels--America, Israel, and the entire Western World--\nare on the bad side. Freedom and democracy don't always come easy. We \nsometimes have to fight for what we believe in and stand for.\n  I ask that my fellow Senators join me in honoring Earleen Allen \nFrancis for her sacrifice and commitment to America--the land of the \nfree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8294-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8294-S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF THE MARIN CONSERVATION CORPS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the \nachievements of the Marin Conservation Corps, MCC, the oldest local, \nprivate, non-profit conservation corps in the United States.\n  Twenty years ago the winter of 1982 brought severe flooding to much \nof Marin County. Concerned citizens led by Richard Hammond took action \nby going out and battling the winter storms and working to protect the \nneighborhoods and natural habitats that were at risk. Since I was a \nmember of the Marin Board of Supervisors at that time, I well remember \nthem.\n  From this community effort the Marin Conservation Corps was born. It \nidentified its mission as developing the youth of Marin County by \nproviding meaningful employment, education and training opportunities \nthrough projects that conserve natural resources, deliver human \nservices and respond to public emergencies.\n  In the 20 years since its founding, more than 3,000 corps members \nhave\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nparticipated in environmental service and educational programs. Youth \nand young adults between the ages of 11 and 30 receive service and \neducational opportunities. Participants in MCC may earn their high \nschool diplomas through the MCC charter school, enroll in AmeriCorps \nprograms or pursue lifelong learning programs, gaining valuable \neducation and job training while learning the importance of community \nservice.\n  Community service projects have included building and maintaining \nMarin County's hiking trails, clearing and disposing of highly \nflammable brush throughout Marin to prevent fire hazards, teaching \nenvironmental education classes to thousands of students in the Marin \nCounty public schools, restoring and clearing creeks and waterways to \nprevent flooding, establishing recycling programs, and collecting over \none million pounds of recyclables from approximately 250 bins that MCC \nmembers have built and placed throughout the county.\n  In the year 2000 the California Charter Academy presented its \n``Outstanding Program Award'' to the Marin Conservation Corps, \nrecognizing MCC's exceptional education program. Programs such as the \nMarin Conservation Corps enrich our people and our communities and \nprovide a model for similar efforts across our land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CELEBRATION OF LAO VETERANS OF AMERICA, MICHIGAN CHAPTER, DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend the Lao Veterans of \nAmerica, Michigan Chapter, will gather to commemorate Lao Veterans of \nAmerica Recognition Day. This tribute is an excellent opportunity to \nshow our appreciation of the Lao people's courageous efforts during the \nVietnam War, their love of the United States and their selfless \nheroism.\n  During the Vietnam War, thousands of Hmong and Laotian soldiers \nfought alongside the American forces as part of the United States \nSecret Army. In fact, the American public only recently learned about \nthe Lao people's courageous efforts throughout the conflict in Vietnam. \nThe Lao veterans served bravely and selflessly from 1961 to 1975 as \nthey risked their lives to avert the spread of Communism throughout the \nregion. They not only fought willingly and valiantly alongside United \nStates forces to prevent the North Vietnamese Army from entering South \nVietnam, but also proved to be invaluable in the effort to rescue \ndowned American soldiers in the region. Their heroic actions saved \ncountless American lives. The Lao Veterans and their families deserve \nour highest respect and gratitude.\n  It is estimated that at least 35,000 Laotian people lost their lives \nduring the Vietnam War. Over 50,000 Lao were wounded and thousands more \nare still listed as missing in action. Throughout the past twenty-seven \nyears, many of the survivors and their families have immigrated to the \nUnited States and many Laotian families currently reside in my home \nstate of Michigan. The transition to the United States has not been \neasy for many of these immigrants, but like many other immigrant groups \nthey have grown and prospered in their new home. It is important that \nwe demonstrate our appreciation for the courageous actions of the \nLaotian people.\n  The Lao Veterans of America, Michigan Chapter, their families, \nfriends, and supporters will gather on Saturday, September 7, 2002, to \ncommemorate Lao Veterans of America Day. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in saluting the Lao veterans' brave and heroic \nefforts and in recognizing their actions on behalf of the cause of \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8295-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATED ARTIST AND NATIVE TENNESSEAN HUBERT SHUPTRINE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is a wellspring of pride for the \npeople of Tennessee that Hubert Shuptrine is a native son. Born in \nChattanooga in 1936 and graduated from the University of Chattanooga in \n1959 with a degree in fine arts painting, Shuptrine is one of the most \ncelebrated American painters and watercolorists of the last several \ndecades.\n  From the Low Country of the Carolinas to the Hill Country of Texas to \nthe Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, Hubert Shuptrine's paintings \nhave captured the rustic beauty of the American South. His love for the \npeople of these places--and the places themselves--shines so strongly \nthat one cannot help but share his affection.\n  What lends such power to Shuptrine's paintings is that they are not \nconjured from his mind, but grounded in truth. He traveled more than \n15,000 miles to meet and talk with the people of the South when \nillustrating his first and highly successful book, Jericho: The South \nBeheld.\n  With a stroke of light, a sliver of shadow or a strategically placed \nprop, Shuptrine sketches the life stories of his subjects. They are \npure, simple and unrushed people--a former field hand resting on her \nfront porch, a widower centenarian living off his land, a basket weaver \npracticing her craft.\n  Shuptrine's wife, Phyllis, once said, ``A good portrait is like a \nbiography.'' Clearly Hubert Shuptrine has adhered to this code \nthroughout his career. He is an exceptional biographer not only of \npeople of the South, but the South itself.\n  Though the South has changed irreversibly since Jericho was published \nnearly 30 years ago, the truth and beauty of the people and places of \nthat time will never be lost. For it has been captured and will be \nhonored in perpetuity by a native son of Tennessee, Hubert \nShuptrine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8295-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FARRAGUT NAVAL TRAINING STATION\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of the Farragut Naval Training Station.\n  Mr. President, over the past year, Americans have rediscovered the \nimportance of our military and renewed their patriotism for our \ncountry. I am sure these were not reactions the terrorists desired.\n  We were once again reminded that millions of our fellow Americans \nhave fought, and many died, for the freedoms we enjoy. Freedoms our \nFounding Fathers found to be self-evident--freedoms we have been \nfighting to retain ever since, here and abroad.\n  World War II was one of the most significant of those fights, and \nthis Saturday, in Idaho, we are looking back and recognizing the \ncontribution Farragut Naval Training Station made to our efforts. At \nFarragut, the U.S. Navy built the second-largest naval training \nfacility in the world. Representative of the work ethic evident across \nAmerica during WWII, 22,000 men, many of them Idahoans, united together \nand built 776 facilities across 4,000 acres in just 9 months.\n  Then, in just 15 months, Farragut trained nearly 300,000 recruits to \nbe sailors.\n  This Saturday, September 7, 2002, many of those graduates and \npersonnel will be returning to celebrate the 60th anniversary of \nFarragut Naval Training Station.\n  Just like 60 years ago, they will come from all corners of the \ncountry and will arrive with varied memories and expectations. But, one \nthing is for sure, they will all come because their experience at \nFarragut affected their lives in profound ways.\n  I am proud and grateful for the men and women who trained and served \nat Farragut Naval Training Station. Their sacrifice for our freedoms is \npriceless. As the years go by, fewer and fewer veterans of WWII are \naround to hear our thanks. For those who are, I hope they hear us loud \nand clear: Thank you. We are all so grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8295-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the president of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8295-5", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8296-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1070.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \na guaranteed adequate level of funding for veterans health care; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHealth Care Funding Guarantee Act.\n  I am introducing the legislation because I believe the VA health case \nsystem is on the brink of crisis. While the number of veterans in the \nUnited States has decreased over the years, the number of veterans \nutilizing the VA health care system has increased exponentially. This \nis due in large part to the availability of Community-Based Outpatient \nClinics and the prescription drug benefits available through the VA. \nThe VA estimates that it will see an additional 1.2 million patients \nover the next fiscal year. This would bring the number of veterans \nserved through the VA up to 4.9 million, a 31 percent increase in one \nyear.\n  While the VA has become the health care system of choice for many \nveterans, the system is simply not equipped to handle this kind of \npatient influx at the current funding level. According to the VA, \n300,000 veterans are waiting for appointments, half of them will end up \nwaiting six months or more. I know this to be the case in my own State. \nIn Sioux Falls, veterans are currently being given appointment dates \nfor November of 2003. Furthermore, recent articles in the Aberdeen \nAmerican News and the Argus Leader reported that the VA has been \ninstructed not to recruit veterans into the health care system any more \nbecause of lack of resources.\n  This is despite the fact that for the past several years Congress has \nprovided funding for veterans health care in excess of the VA's \nrequest. Two years ago, I helped fight for a $1.4 billion increase in \nveterans health care funding over the Administration's initial request. \nLast year, we succeeded in adding an additional $1.1 billion. During \nSenate consideration of the Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill, I was pleased to work with my fellow members of \nthe Appropriations Committee to ensure that $417 million in additional \nfunding for veterans health care was included in the bill. Given the \ncurrent problems within the VA health care system, I was disappointed \nthat President refused to spend $275 million of the emergency funding \nthat was earmarked for veterans health care. According to the \nIndependent Budget, which is prepared by the Disabled American \nVeterans, AMVETS, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, the Administration's Fiscal Year 2003 request for VA \nhealth care is $1.7 billion less than what is needed to fully fund our \nveterans' health care needs.\n  We need a new approach to veterans health care. The Veterans Health \nCare Funding Guarantee Act that I am introducing today would change the \nway in which the VA health care system is funded by moving it from \ndiscretionary to mandatory spending. The bill would establish a base-\nline funding year and calculate the average cost of a veteran using the \nVA health care system. The bill would them provide funding for the \ntotal number of veterans who participate in the VA health care system. \nThat would be indexed annually for inflation.\n  In my opinion, the men and women who put their lives on the line in \ndefense of this Nation should not be told that they need to wait up to \na year before someone can assess their medical needs. I believe that \nthe Veterans Health Care Funding Guarantee Act is an important starting \npoint to begin a discussion about maintaining our commitments to our \nNation's veterans. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in \nexamining new ways to provide our veterans with the high-quality health \ncare they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2905. A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the elimination of \nthe 60-month limit and an increase in the income limitation on the \nstudent loan interest deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nrepeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2001 with respect to student loan interest deduction. My bill \nwill make permanent the provisions that are set to expire under current \nlaw on December 31, 2010. The affected provisions include the \nelimination of the 60-month limit on deductibility of interest paid on \na qualified education loan and clarify that voluntary payments of \ninterests are deductible, as well as the adjustment to the phase out \nrange for eligibility for loan interest deduction up to $50,000 through \n$65,000 for single taxpayers and $100,000 to $130,000 for joint \nreturns.\n  Making these provisions permanent will be good for taxpayers because \nborrowers will benefit from added tax relief when they voluntarily pay \nback\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\nhigher amounts of their student loans each month. More people will also \nbenefit from the adjustment of the phase out range to a higher income \nbracket for both single and joint tax returns.\n  In my home State of Colorado over 40 percent of the adult residents \nhave at least a Bachelor's degree, thus repealing the sunset date of \nthese provisions will have a positive long term effect on my \nconstituents. The current law is already helping many people and we can \ncontinue to help Americans keep more of their money by repealing the \nsunset date of these provisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF APPLICABILITY OF SUNSET OF THE ECONOMIC \n                   GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                   2001 WITH RESPECT TO ELIMINATION OF 60-MONTH \n                   LIMIT AND INCREASE IN INCOME LIMITATION ON \n                   STUDENT LOAN INTEREST DEDUCTION.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     amendments made by section 412 (relating to elimination of \n     60-month limit and increase in income limitation on student \n     loan interest deduction).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2906. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram to make allocations to States for projects to expand 2-lane \nhighways in rural areas to 4-lane highways; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nFour-Lane Highway Safety and Development Act of 2002. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to ensure that States have the resources they need \nto upgrade major two-lane roads across the Nation to high-quality four-\nlane divided highways. The goals of this bill are to improve the safety \nof our most dangerous highways and to stimulate economic development in \nrural areas.\n  I think most Senators would agree that the Dwight D. Eisenhower \nNational System of Interstate and Defense Highways is one of the \ntransportation marvels of the 20th century. The system's 46,000 miles \nof divided highways interconnect virtually every major urban areas in \nthe Nation. The system represents one of the most efficient and safest \nhighway systems in the world.\n  Unfortunately, when the Interstate System was planned it left many \nrural communities and smaller urban areas without direct links to the \nhigh-quality transportation network that the interstate highways \nprovide. Many of these smaller and rural communities continue to suffer \neconomically because of the lack of high-quality four-lane highways.\n  To address this issue, in 1995 Congress developed the concept of a \nNational Highway System as a way of extending the benefits of an \nefficient highway network to all areas of the country. Congress \ndesignated the National Highway System to help focus federal resources \non the nation's most important roads.\n  Today there are about 160,000 miles on the National Highway System \nincluding all of the interstate highways and all other routes that are \nimportant to the nation's economy, defense, and general mobility. The \nNHS comprises only 4 percent of the nation's roads, but carries more \nthan 40 percent of all highway traffic, 75 percent of heavy truck \ntraffic and 90 percent of tourist traffic.\n  The NHS reaches nearly every part of the nation. According to the \nFederal Highway Administration, about 90 percent of American's \npopulation lives within 5 miles of an NHS route. All urban areas with a \npopulation of more than 50,000 and 93 percent with a population of \nbetween 5,000 and 50,000 are within 5 mile;s of the NHS. Counties with \nNHS highways have 99 percent of all jobs, including 99 percent of all \nmanufacturing jobs, 90 percent of mining jobs, and 93 percent of \nagricultural jobs.\n  The NHS is the critical transportation link of most of our Nation's \nrural areas. According the Federal Highway Adminstration, of the \n160,000 miles now on the National Highway System, fully 75 percent, or \n119,000 miles, are in rural areas. Of the 1.2 trillion vehicle miles \ntraveled in 2000 on NHS roads, about 60 percent were in rural areas.\n  I hope all senators will agree that improving highway safety should \nbe our top priority. When it comes to highway safety, the fact that \ntravel on four-lane roads is safer than two-lane roads. This is \nespecially true in rural areas. According to the Bureau of \nTransportation Statistics, in 1998 the rate of traffic fatalities on \nall rural roads was 2.39 per 100-million vehicle miles; however, the \nrate of rural interstate highways was half as high, only 1.23 per 100 \nmillion vehicle-miles.\n  The reason for the lower fatality rate on rural interstate highways \nshould be obvious. When a road has only one lane in each direction, \ntrucks and other slow-moving vehicles increase the hazard of passing. \nVehicles turning on or off a two-lane road can also increase risk. A \ndivided four-lane highway greatly reduces these perils.\n  Of the 119,000 miles of rural NHS roads, about 33,000 miles are \ninterstates and another 28,000 miles have been upgraded to four or more \nlanes. The remaining 58,000 miles, more than half of this rural highway \nnetwork--are stil only two-lane roads with no central divider. These \nare the most dangerous roads on the National Highway System.\n  Unfortunately, there are only very limited funds available to upgrade \nthe most dangerous two-lane rural NHS roads to four-lane highways. \nAccording to a recent GAO study, over two-thirds of all federal \nhighways funding between 1992 and 200 has gone either to roads in urban \nareas or to interstate highways. Consequently, there is a continuing \nshortfall in Federal highway funding needed to upgrade the most \nimportant rural two-lane highways. My bill will help address the \nshortfall so that more rural segments of the NHS can be upgraded to \nfour-lane divided highways.\n  In my State of New Mexico, we have made some progress toward \nupgrading our rural two-lane highways to four lanes. In recent years, \nUS550 from Bernalillo to Farmington and US285 from Interstate 40 to \nCarlsbad have been widened to four lanes. In addition, upgrading of \nUS70 from Las Cruces to Clovis and a key segment of US54 from El Paso \nto Alamogordo are nearly completed. But much more remains to be done.\n  New Mexico has 2,935 miles of rural roads in the NHS. One thousand of \nthese NHS miles are interstates. Of the balance of New Mexico NHS \nhighways, 1,755 miles are in the rural parts of my state, especially \nChaves, Colfax, Eddy, Lincoln, Guadalupe, Otero, Quay, San Juan, and \nUnion Counties. And almost 70 percent--1,217 miles, of New Mexico's \nrural NHS highways remain only two-lane roads. These two-lane roads are \nmajor transportation routes with heavy truck and commercial traffic. In \n2000, a total of 10.3 billion vehicle miles were traveled on New \nMexico's NHS highways, and about one quarter, or 2.7 billion miles, \nwere traveled on these rural NHS roads.\n  As in many States, New Mexico's rural counties strongly believe their \neconomic future depends on access to safe and efficient four-lane \nhighways. Basic transportation infrastructure is one of the critical \nelements companies look for when choosing where to locate. Truck \ndrivers and the traveling public prefer the safety and efficiency of a \nfour-lane divided highway.\n  Thus one of the top priorities for rural cities and counties in my \nState is to complete the four-lane upgrade of such key routes as US54 \nfrom Tularosa to Nara Vista, US62/180 from Carlsbad to the Texas State \nline, US64/87 from Clayton to Raton, US 666 from north to Gallup to \nShiprock, US285 from Clines Corners to Lamy, and US180 from Deming to \nSilver City. These two-lane rural routes in New Mexico not only bear \nsome of the State's heaviest truck and automobile traffic, but also are \nsome of the state's most dangerous. In fact, US 666 is considered one \nof the most dangerous two-lane highways in the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table showing recent accident, \nfatality and injury rates for these major two-lane highways in New \nMexico be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n\n\n          EXHIBIT 1.--MAJOR TWO-LANE NHS HIGHWAYS IN NEW MEXICO\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Crashes   Fatalities   Injuries\n  Two-lane NHS routes in New Mexico    1998-2000   1998-2000   1998-2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUS 62/180 Carlsbad to Texas State             55           2          34\n Line 30 miles......................\nUS 54, Tularosa to Texas State Line          364          12         217\n SPIRIT High Priority Corridor 214\n miles..............................\nUS 64/87 Raton to Clayton Ports-to-          163           5         157\n Plains High Priority Corridor 74\n miles..............................\nUS 666 North of Gallup to Shiprock           148          12         166\n 59 miles...........................\nUS 180 Deming to Silver City 40.5             60           3          50\n miles..............................\nUS 285 Clines Corners to Lamy 37              42           0          26\n miles..............................\nUS 60/84 Santa Rosa to Ft.

Mr. President, New Mexico is not alone in needing to \nupgrade two-lane roads on the National Highway System. Just last month \nmy good friend Senator Reid of Nevada, chaired a hearing of the \nTransportation, Infrastructure and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on the topic of western \ntransportation issues. One of the witnesses, Tom Stephens, Director of \nNevada's Department of Transportation, testified that rural two-lane \nhighways are of special concern in Nevada. He indicated that the number \nof head-on accidents, which almost always include at least on vehicle \nwith no fault, were especially troublesome in his state. I would note \nthat Nevada has about 1,300 miles of rural two-lane NHS highways. \nExcluding interstates, 92 percent of the rural NHS miles in Nevada are \nstill only two-lane roads.\n  Along with Nevada, many other States have long stretches of two-lane \nNHS roads. For example, Texas has over 3,400 miles of rural two-lane \nNHS roads. In Montana, 95 percent of all rural NHS roads are still only \ntwo lanes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing \nthe number of miles of rural two-lane highways in selected States be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n\n                              EXHIBIT 2.--RURAL TWO- AND FOUR-LANE ROADS ON THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM FOR SELECTED STATES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Total rural NHS    Rural Interstate     All other rural   Two-lane rural NHS   Percent Rural Two\n                        State                                miles             NHS miles           NHS miles             miles               Lane\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArkansas............................................               2,253                 467               1,786               1,465                 83%\nCalifornia..........................................               5,031               1,357               3,674               2,433                 66%\nColorado............................................               2,598                 767               1,831               1,286                 70%\nIdaho...............................................               2,188                 526               1,662               1,471                 89%\nIllinois............................................               3,358               1,515               1,843               1,407                 76%\nIowa................................................               2,672                 635               2,037               1,547                 76%\nKansas..............................................               3,352                 694               2,658               2,293                 86%\nMichigan............................................               3,048                 741               2,307               1,753                 76%\nMinnesota...........................................               2,213                 557               2,581               1,897                 73%\nMissouri............................................               3,385                 806               2,579               1,853                 72%\nMontana.............................................               3,739               1,134               2,605               2,469                 95%\nNebraska............................................               2,686                 437               2,249               1,964                 87%\nNevada..............................................               1,921                 480               1,441               1,317                 92%\nNew Mexico..........................................               2,647                 892               1,775               1,217                 69%\nNorth Dakota........................................               2,619                 531               2,088               1,659                 79%\nOklahoma............................................               2,836                 721               2,115               1,105                 52%\nOregon..............................................               3,259                 581               2,678               2,197                 82%\nPennylvania.........................................               3,459               1,207               2,252               1,426                 63%\nSouth Dakota........................................               2,822                 629               2,193               1,938                 88%\nTexas...............................................               8,736               2,213               6,523               3,465                 53%\nWisconsin...........................................               3,240                 580               2,660               1,702                 64%\nWyoming.............................................               2,784                 826               1,958               1,924                 98%\nU.S. total..........................................             118,878              33,048              85,830              58,444                 68%\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: FHWA, Highway Statistics 2000, Tables HM-15 and HM-35\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Of course, two-lane rural NHS roads are not unique to \nthe large western states. Even in the East, where states are smaller, \nmany NHS routes remain only two lanes. In Vermont, 78 percent of rural \nNHS roads are only two lanes, in New Hampshire it's 84 percent and 99 \npercent in Maine.\n  Mr. President, I do believe it is time Congress took action to \nimprove the safety of cars and trucks on these important two-lanes \nroads. This year, I secured $1 million in federal funding to begin the \nupgrade of US64/87 between Clayton and Raton, which is part of the \nPorts-to-Plains High Priority Corridor on the National Highway System.\n  In addition, Senator Roberts and I have introduced legislation to \ndesignate US Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, through New Mexico, Texas, \nand Oklahoma to Wichita, Kansas as the SPIRIT High Priority Corridor. \nOur bipartisan bill has three cosponsors. A high-priority corridor \ndesignation provides no additional federal funding, but helps focus \nattention on the need to upgrade the nation's major two-lanes routes. \nThe sponsors of the bill have joined me in urging the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee to act promptly on our bill.\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the bill I am introducing today, the \nRural Four-Lane Highway Safety and Development Act of 2002, is to \nprovide direct federal funding to states to upgrade existing two-lane \nroads in rural areas to safe and efficient four-lane divided highways. \nThe states would determine which two-lane roads they wanted to upgrade. \nTo be eligible for funding, the highway must be on the National Highway \nSystem or a congressionally designated High Priority Corridor. In my \nbill, priority for funding is given to upgrading the most dangerous \ntwo-lane highways, routes most affected by increased traffic as a \nresult of NAFTA, highways that have high levels of commercial traffic, \nand projects that will help stimulate regional economic growth. Total \nfunding for six years is $1.8 billion from the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I continue to believe strongly in the important role \nof highway infrastructure to economic development. Even in this age of \nthe so-called ``new'' economy and high-speed digital communications, \nroads continue to link our communities together and to carry the \ncommercial goods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient \nhighways are especially important to citizens in the rural parts of our \ncountry.\n  I recognize that the funding level in this bill is not large enough \nto upgrade all of the remaining two-lane routes on the NHS in the \ncourse of the next six years. Upgrading an existing two-lane road to a \nfull four-lane divided highway can cost upward of one million dollars \nper mile.\n  Moreover, some of the existing two-lane roads probably don't have \nsufficient traffic to justify upgrading at this time. In addition, some \ntwo-lane NHS routes pass through scenic areas where it may not be \nappropriate to upgrade to four lanes. However, I do believe the funding \nin this bill will take us a long way toward ensuring the most critical \nprojects are completed in the next six years.\n  Mr. President, next year Congress must take up the reauthorization of \nthe comprehensive six-year transportation bill, TEA-21. I am \nintroducing this bill today to help ensure that the issue of the safety \nof rural two-lane NHS routes will receive the attention it deserves in \nthe debate on reauthorization. I look forward to working with the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Smith, the ranking member, as well as Senators \nReid and Inhofe of the Transportation, Infrastructure and Nuclear \nSafety Subcommittee, to find a way to ensure additional federal \nresources are in place to begin the work of upgrading existing two-lane \nNHS roads to safe, efficient four-lane divided highways.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 900 Brentwood Road, NE, in Washington, D.C., \nas the ``Joseph Curseen, Jr. and Thomas Morris, Jr. Processing and \nDistribution Center''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrename the Brentwood Postal Facility after Joseph Curseen, Jr. and \nThomas Morris, Jr., the two postal workers who died in last year's \nanthrax attack.\n  I have expressed my deepest condolences to the families of these two \nmen, both residents of my State of Maryland. They were true public \nservants. They were patriots. They died in service to their country. I \nwant to you to know that I will be standing sentry to make sure that we \ndo not forget Joe Curseen and Tom Morris.\n  America must remember the sacrifices they made, the pain felt by \ntheir families, and everyone affected by the anthrax attacks. All of \nour Nation's postal workers deserve our attention and our gratitude for \ntheir bravery, steadfastness and dedication to duty. The lives of \nJoseph Curseen, Jr. and Thomas Morris, Jr. truly exemplify the best \nqualities of our Nation's postal workers.\n  Joseph Curseen was a native of Washington, DC and a long-time \nresident of Prince George's County, MD. Mr. Curseen began and ended \neach day at his job with a handshake and a smile for his colleagues. He \nenjoyed his job at the postal service so much that he never called in \nsick during his 15 years there.\n  He was also a leader in his community and in his church. As President \nof his neighborhood association, he and his wife of 16 years, \nCelestine, helped build a playground and a park for local children. He \nwas also active in his local church and led a bible study group for his \nfellow postal workers. He will be missed by many.\n  Mr. Morris, who known as ``Moe'' by his friends at the Brentwood \nfacility, was also a Washington, DC native and long-time resident of \nMaryland's Prince George's County. He was a veteran, serving over four \nyears in the Air Force. He continued his public service with 23 years \nat the U.S. Postal Service.\n  His wife Mary says he was a quiet and deeply religious man who led by \nexample. In her eulogy, she said that he was true to others and true to \nhimself. Mr. Morris was a beloved husband, grandfather, father, and \nstepfather as well as president of his local bowling league. He will \nalso be deeply missed.\n  By renaming Brentwood in their honor, America will pay tribute to \ntheir commitment to public service, their families and their \ncommunities.\n  At their funeral, these two dedicated public servants were awarded \nthe Postmaster General's Medal of Freedom. Yesterday, Representatives \nWynn, Norton and the rest of the Maryland delegation led the charge to \npass a bill to rename the Brentwood facility for these two fallen \nheroes. Today, the Senate takes the next step to make sure that the \nBrentwood facility is renamed in honor of these fallen heroes.\n  On Friday, I will be going to New York to commemorate last year's \nterrorists attacks, to honor our public servants, our firemen, postal \nworkers, port authority workers, EMTs, policemen, and all those who \nassisted in the rescues.\n  I want all postal workers to know that I am on their side. I will not \nforget how deeply they have suffered. I will continue to fight for them \nin Congress and make sure that their voice is heard.\n  It is our responsibility as United States Senators to ensure the \nright people are asking the right questions to protect all Americans \nfrom the risks of terrorism, and to ensure that all Americans who are \nvictims of terrorist attacks are treated equally.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to establish at \nleast one Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team in each State, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Weapons of \nMass Destruction Civil Support Act of 2002. This bill would require the \nSecretary of Defense to establish at least one Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Team, WMD-CST, in each State by September 30, \n2003. The cost of establishing, training, equipping, and operating \nthese new teams would be paid for from existing fiscal year 2003 \nresources, thus requiring no additional spending.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Leahy, \nLieberman, Kohl, Reid of Nevada, Sarbanes, Torricelli, and Jeffords.\n  WMD-CSTs are comprised of 22 full-time National Guard personnel who \nare specially trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected \nnuclear, chemical, biological, or other threats\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\nin support of local first responders. There are currently 32 full-time \nand 23 part-time WMD-CSTs across the country.\n  The emerging chemical, biological, and other threats of the 21st \ncentury present new challenges to our military and to local first \nresponders. The WMD-CSTs play a vital role in assisting local first \nresponders in investigating and combating these new threats. The \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks emphasize the need to have full-time \nWMD-CSTs in each State. As the events of that day so clearly and \ntragically demonstrated, local first responders are on the front lines \nof combating terrorism and responding to other large-scale incidents. \nAs we rethink the security needs of our country, we should support the \ncreation of an additional 23 full-time WMD-CSTs as soon as possible. \nEstablishing these additional full-time teams will improve the overall \ncapability of Wisconsin and the other 18 States with part-time teams to \nprepare for and respond to potential threats in the future.\n  According to the National Guard Bureau, WMD-CSTs performed 694 \noperational missions between September 11, 2001, and August 26, 2002. \nThese missions fall into three categories: ``response,'' ``standby,'' \nand ``assist.''\n  Response missions occur when a team is deployed to sample a suspected \nor known hazardous substance. Since September 11, WMD-CSTs have \ndeployed on 151 response missions, most of which were to investigate \nreports of suspicious white powder in the wake of the anthrax attacks \nof last fall. Other response missions included reports of the presence \nof unknown liquids or of suspicious pieces of mail.\n  There have been 74 standby missions during this same time frame. On \nthese missions, WMD-CSTs deploy to provide expertise to a specific \ncommunity for the visit of a dignitary such as the President or a \nGovernor, or for a large-scale event. In the past year, WMD-CSTs have \nbeen on standby for events including the Major League Baseball All-Star \nGame in Milwaukee, the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Salt \nLake City, the World Series, the Super Bowl, and Mardi Gras.\n  Assist missions give WMD-CST members the opportunity to use their \ntechnical expertise to assist or provide advice to local first \nresponders or other organizations and to participate in conferences and \nother events that focus on how to respond to attacks. In the past year, \nCSTs have performed 469 assist missions in support of local, State, and \nFederal agencies including law enforcement, hospitals, health \ndepartments, state emergency management agencies, the American Red \nCross, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the United States Navy.\n  As I noted earlier, a WMD-CST was deployed to be on standby during \nthis year's baseball All-Star game, which took place in my home State. \nBecause Wisconsin has only a part-time WMD-CST, the Minnesota team was \ndeployed on a standby mission to Milwaukee for this event. The members \nof Wisconsin's part-time WMD-CST also participated in this deployment. \nAccording to the Wisconsin National Guard, if Wisconsin had a full-time \nteam, deployment of the Minnesota team would not have been necessary.\n  In light of the tragic events of September 11, the presence of at \nleast one WMD-CST in each State is all the more imperative. These \nterrorist attacks, and the subsequent mobilization of tens of thousands \nof National Guardsmen and Reservists, also underscore the need to \nprovide adequate resources for and to ensure full-time manning of the \nNational Guard. As we move to establish at least one 22-member WMD-CST \nin each State, I call on the Pentagon to allocate the necessary \nresources to ensure adequate National Guard personnel end-strengths to \nprovide for full-time manning and for the additional personnel \nnecessary for these new teams.\n  I am pleased that this bill is supported by the Wisconsin National \nGuard and by the National Guard Association of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses and \nto repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to such deduction and the \nextension of the exclusion for employer-provided education assistance; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce the College Tuition Relief Act of 2002, a bill that will go a \nlong way toward easing the burden of college tuition fees for parents \nand students across the country.\n  When President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act last year, millions of hard working Americans \nfinally got to keep more of their own money so that they could spend it \nin ways that helped their families most. Too often forgotten, though, \nis the fact that none of the provisions in that important tax relief \nbill is permanent. All will expire in a few short years, and, unless we \nact soon, the American taxpayers will have to adjust their budgets to \naccount for higher taxes once again.\n  Included in last year's tax relief legislation were two provisions \nthat are of the utmost importance to families and young students \nstruggling to pay the ever-increasing costs of higher education. The \nfirst allows taxpayers to deduct as much as $4000 of their college \ntuition expenses from their taxes every year; the second allows \nindividuals to exclude as much as $5250 in employer-provided education \nassistance from their taxes, a critically important benefit for a great \nmany Americans attempting to balance school with work, family, and \nlimited budgets.\n  Because of an unfortunate quirk in the law, both of these provisions \nwill expire after only a few years, and future generations of young \npeople will not receive the benefits of a more affordable education. \nThe solution to this problem is simple: we should make these provisions \npermanent. My bill does just that. The College Tuition Relief Act of \n2002 will simply ensure that future college students will be able to \ncount on their government to support them as they work towards \nattaining a good education.\n  The two provisions that this bill will make a permanent part of our \ntax law have always received broad bipartisan support, and I am \nconfident that none of us wants to take back the help we are currently \ngiving to college students\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\nand the families who so often contribute to their tuition. Even my \ncolleagues who did not vote for last year's tax relief should find it \neasy to support this bill and, along with it, our Nation's college \nstudents.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the modifications to \neducation individual retirement accounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to make \npermanent a provision included in last year's tax bill, the Coverdell \neducation savings accounts. Congress took an important step last year \nin providing real options for parents to save for their children's \nelementary, secondary, and postsecondary educations. It is important \nnow that we ensure that these options do not disappear in the future.\n  Coverdell education savings accounts provided a new way for parents \nto save for their child's education. Accounts were increased to a \nmaximum of $2,000, and parents can now use the tax-free savings for not \nonly a college education, but also for elementary and secondary school \nexpenses, including tuition, books, computers, and tutoring. Earnings \non contributions to this plan are tax-free due to the tax bill that was \npassed last year. Now, it is time to continue this commitment to our \nchildren.\n  Parents who want to open an education savings account this year for \ntheir child who is five years old have no guarantee that those accounts \nwill exist beyond 2010. Last year's tax bill, as we know, sunsets in \n2010. But for this program, parents need to be assured that money they \nare saving now will be available for college tuitions in 2011 and \nbeyond. With the cost of higher education rising faster than family \nincome, we need to ensure that these saving tools will be available for \nyears to come for families who are preparing for their future and being \nsmart about their money. The average cost of tuition and fees between \nthe 1989-1990 and 2001-2002 school years rose by 8 percent a year at 4-\nyear private colleges and 10 percent a year at 4-year public colleges, \nwhile family income rose by only 5 percent annually during that same \ntime period.\n  Parents should have the assurance that accounts that are started now, \nand that would not be tapped into for ten to fifteen years, would still \nbe around at that time.\n  I have started education savings accounts for my grandchildren, who \nare all infants and toddlers, and I want to know that they will be able \nto use this money years down the road for elementary or secondary \nschools or for their college education.\n  We need to make this benefit permanent now to ensure savings \nincentives for years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF APPLICABILITY OF SUNSET OF THE ECONOMIC \n                   GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                   2001 WITH RESPECT TO MODIFICATIONS TO EDUCATION \n                   INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     amendments made by section 401 (relating to modifications to \n     education individual retirement accounts).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Reed):\n\n  S. 2912. A bill to provide for educational opportunities for all \nstudents in State public school systems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Student Bill of \nRights. This bill is critical to ensuring that every child in America \nreceives the educational opportunity that is the foundation of \nAmerica's promise of equal opportunity for all.\n  This bill would hold States accountable for providing the \nfundamentals of education--including highly qualified teachers, \nprincipals, and academic support personnel, challenging curricula, \nsmall classes, current textbooks, quality libraries, up-to-date \nfacilities and technology, and capable guidance counselors to students \nat all schools in the State. Current law requires that schools within \nthe same district provide comparable educational services. This bill \nwould extend that basic protection to the State level by requiring \ncomparability across school districts. And, this bill would help ensure \nthat states comply with State or Federal court orders concerning the \nfairness of their public school systems.\n  I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Wellstone, and Reed for joining me \nin introducing this bill and for their longstanding commitment to this \nissue. I also want to thank Representative Chaka Fattah, of \nPhiladelphia. Representative Fattah is a leader in the fight for \neducational opportunity for all. He and I have worked together closely \non this issue, and he is introducing a similar Student Bill of Rights \nin the other body today.\n  Nearly 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education, our educational \nsystem remains largely separate and unequal. Whether an American child \nis taught by a high quality teacher in a small class, has access to the \nbest courses and instructional materials, goes to school in a new, \nmodern building, and otherwise benefits from educational resources that \nhave been shown to be essential to a quality education, still depends \non where the child's family can afford to live. In fact, the United \nStates ranks last among developed countries in the difference in the \nquality of schools available to wealthy and low-income children.\n  This is simply unacceptable, and it is why the Student Bill of Rights \nis so important to our children's ability to achieve academically, to \ngain the skills they need to be responsible, participating citizens in \nour diverse democracy, and to compete and succeed in the global \neconomy.\n  Last year, Democrats and Republicans worked closely with President \nBush to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, to hold schools accountable \nfor closing the achievement gap for low-income students, minority \nstudents, limited-English proficient students, and students with \ndisabilities and to hold them accountable for all students performing \nat a high level.\n  I commend the President for his interest in education. Holding \nschools to high standards of student achievement is critical. But, it's \nnot the same as reaching those standards. If we don't\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\nmake sure that every school has the tools it needs, we will be like \nparents with two children telling them that they expect both children \nto work hard and do well in school, but that they will only help one of \nthem with their homework, will only allow one of them to use the \nfamily's encyclopedia or computer, and will only allow one of them to \nstudy in their warm room, while the other must study in the unheated \nbasement.\n  I know that States have made some progress over the years in leveling \nthe playing field, and that they are facing terrific budgetary \npressures. And, I know that the Federal Government is facing budget \ndeficits instead of surpluses, but providing enough resources for \neducation shouldn't be a choice. We don't, and we shouldn't, say that \n``We'd like to do more about national security, but times are tough.'' \nWe can't accept that argument for education, either.\n  This bill does not represent a radical notion. This Congress and \nlast, 42 Senators and 183 Representatives voted for similar legislation \nthat Mr. Fattah and I offered. A radical notion is the idea that a \ncountry founded on the principal of equal opportunity for all can \ncontinue to accept an educational system that provides real educational \nopportunity for just a select few.\n  That's not to say that only states have to do better. The No Child \nLeft Behind Act rightly requires school districts and schools to do \nmore, and we need to do much, much more in Washington to fulfill our \nrole in this process. More than 90 percent of America's children rely \nupon public schools, yet less than 2 percent of our entire federal \nbudget is spent on helping our grade schools and high schools. That's \nonly about 7 percent of all education spending.\n  When he signed the No Child Left Behind Act this January, President \nBush promised that the Federal Government would make sure schools have \nthe resources necessary to meet the new law's requirements. But, in \nFebruary, with the ink on the new law not yet dry, the President sent \nhis education budget to Congress and the resources were not there. In \nfact, the President took an enormous step backward by proposing to cut \nFederal support for the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  For example, more than ten million low-income children attend schools \nin areas that are eligible for Federal assistance to hire and train \nteachers and buy textbooks, computers, and other school necessities. \nThe President's education budget would provide only 40 percent of the \nassistance that these schools need, leaving more than six million \nchildren behind. The President's budget also fails to even come close \nto fully funding the Federal Government's commitment to special \neducation, leaving families and local communities struggling to make up \nthe difference. We will never close the achievement gap as long as our \nNation's most disadvantaged students in the neediest schools are forced \nto make do with far less than other students.\n  At the same time, the President wants to take nearly $4 billion away \nfrom these students and these schools to fund private school vouchers. \nPrivate schools provide many children with a good education, but for \nAmerica to continue to succeed as a Nation, our public schools must \nalso succeed.\n  And, the way to help them succeed is not to drain resources from them \nin the vain hope that the answer lies elsewhere, but by making sure \nthat every public school has the resources to provide our children with \nthe education they need and deserve, through measures such as the \nStudent Bill of Rights, fully funding Title I and special education, \nand others.\n  In the end, this is about the simple fact that the quality of a \nchild's education shouldn't be determined by the digits of their zip \ncode. This measure corrects that inequity by ensuring that each and \nevery child's school has the resources to provide them with a decent \neducation, and in turn, an equal opportunity for a successful future.\n  And so, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Student \nBill of Rights.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is therefore necessary and \n     proper to overcome the nationwide phenomenon of State public \n     school systems that do not meet the requirements of section \n     101(a), in which high-quality public schools typically serve \n     high-income communities and poor-quality schools typically \n     serve low-income, urban, rural, and minority communities.\n       (2) There exists in the States a significant educational \n     opportunity gap for low-income, urban, rural, and minority \n     students characterized by the following:\n       (A) Continuing disparities within States in students' \n     access to the fundamentals of educational opportunity \n     described in section 102.\n       (B) Highly differential educational expenditures (adjusted \n     for cost and need) among school districts within States.\n       (C) Radically differential educational achievement among \n     students in school districts within States as measured by the \n     following:\n       (i) Achievement in mathematics, reading or language arts, \n     and science on State academic assessments required under \n     section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) and on the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress.\n       (ii) Advanced placement courses taken.\n       (iii) SAT and ACT test scores.\n       (iv) Dropout rates and graduation rates.\n       (v) College-going and college-completion rates.\n       (vi) Job placement and retention rates and indices of job \n     quality.\n       (3) As a consequence of this educational opportunity gap, \n     the quality of a child's education depends largely upon where \n     the child's family can afford to live, and the detriments of \n     lower quality education are imposed particularly on--\n       (A) children from low-income families;\n       (B) children living in urban and rural areas; and\n       (C) minority children.\n       (4) Since 1785, Congress, exercising the power to admit new \n     States under section 3 of article IV of the Constitution (and \n     previously, the Congress of the Confederation of States under \n     the Articles of Confederation), has imposed upon every State, \n     as a fundamental condition of the State's admission, that the \n     State provide for the establishment and maintenance of \n     systems of public schools open to all children in such State.\n       (5) Over the years since the landmark ruling in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), when a \n     unanimous Supreme Court held that ``the opportunity of an \n     education . . . , where the State has undertaken to provide \n     it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal \n     terms'', courts in 44 States have heard challenges to the \n     establishment, maintenance, and operation of State public \n     school systems that are separate and not educationally \n     adequate.\n       (6) In 1970, the Presidential Commission on School Finance \n     found that significant disparities in the distribution of \n     educational resources existed among school districts within \n     States because the States relied too significantly on local \n     district financing for educational revenues, and that reforms \n     in systems of school financing would increase the Nation's \n     ability to serve the educational needs of all children.\n       (7) In 1999, the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences published a report entitled ``Making \n     Money Matter, Financing America's Schools'', which found that \n     the concept of funding adequacy,\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\n     which moves beyond the more traditional concepts of finance \n     equity to focus attention on the sufficiency of funding for \n     desired educational outcomes, is an important step in \n     developing a fair and productive educational system.\n       (8) In 2001, the Executive Order establishing the \n     President's Commission on Educational Resource Equity \n     declared, ``A quality education is essential to the success \n     of every child in the 21st century and to the continued \n     strength and prosperity of our Nation. . . . [L]ong-standing \n     gaps in access to educational resources exist, including \n     disparities based on race and ethnicity.'' (Exec. Order No. \n     13190, 66 Fed. Reg. 5424 (2001))\n       (9) According to the Secretary of Education, as stated in a \n     letter (with enclosures) from the Secretary to States dated \n     January 19, 2001--\n       (A) racial and ethnic minorities continue to suffer from \n     lack of access to educational resources, including \n     ``experienced and qualified teachers, adequate facilities, \n     and instructional programs and support, including technology, \n     as well as . . . the funding necessary to secure these \n     resources''; and\n       (B) these inadequacies are ``particularly acute in high-\n     poverty schools, including urban schools, where many students \n     of color are isolated and where the effect of the resource \n     gaps may be cumulative. In other words, students who need the \n     most may often receive the least, and these students often \n     are students of color.''.\n       (10) In the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001, Congress--\n       (A)(i) required each State to establish standards and \n     assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science; and\n       (ii) required schools to ensure that all students are \n     proficient in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001-\n     2002 school year, and held schools accountable for the \n     students' progress; and\n       (B) required each State to describe how the State will help \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop the \n     capacity to improve student academic achievement.\n       (11) The standards and accountability movement will succeed \n     only if, in addition to standards and accountability, all \n     schools have access to the educational resources necessary to \n     enable students to achieve.\n       (12) Raising standards without ensuring access to \n     educational resources may in fact exacerbate achievement gaps \n     and set children up for failure.\n       (13) According to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report 2001-2002, the United States ranks \n     last among developed countries in the difference in the \n     quality of schools available to rich and poor children.\n       (14) The persistence of pervasive inadequacies in the \n     quality of education provided by State public school systems \n     effectively deprives millions of children throughout the \n     United States of the opportunity for an education adequate to \n     enable the children to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (15) Each State government has ultimate authority to \n     determine every important aspect and priority of the public \n     school system that provides elementary and secondary \n     education to children in the State, including whether \n     students throughout the State have access to the fundamentals \n     of educational opportunity described in section 102.\n       (16) Because a well educated populace is critical to the \n     Nation's political and economic well-being and national \n     security, the Federal Government has a substantial interest \n     in ensuring that States provide a high-quality education by \n     ensuring that all students have access to the fundamentals of \n     educational opportunity described in section 102 to enable \n     the students to succeed academically and in life.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To further the goals of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001), by holding States accountable for providing all \n     students with access to the fundamentals of educational \n     opportunity described in section 102.\n       (2) To ensure that all students in public elementary \n     schools and secondary schools receive educational \n     opportunities that enable such students to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (3) To end the pervasive pattern of States maintaining \n     public school systems that do not meet the requirements of \n     section 101(a).\n\n    TITLE I--EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN STATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS\n\n             Subtitle A--Access to Educational Opportunity\n\n     SEC. 101.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas epilepsy is a neurological condition affecting \n     2,300,000 people in the United States;\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\n       Whereas a seizure is a disturbance in the electrical \n     activity of the brain, and 25,000,000 Americans (1 in every \n     10) will have at least 1 seizure during their lives;\n       Whereas 180,000 new cases of seizures and epilepsy are \n     diagnosed each year, and 3 percent of Americans will have \n     developed epilepsy by the time they are 75;\n       Whereas 41 percent of people who currently have epilepsy \n     experience persistent seizures despite the treatment they are \n     receiving;\n       Whereas a survey sponsored by the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention shows that the burden of disease for \n     people with epilepsy is comparable to that experienced by \n     people with cancer, diabetes, and arthritis;\n       Whereas epilepsy in older children and adults remains a \n     formidable barrier to a normal life, affecting education, \n     employment, marriage, childbearing, and personal fulfillment;\n       Whereas stigma surrounding epilepsy continues to fuel \n     discrimination and isolates people with seizure disorders \n     from the mainstream life;\n       Whereas in spite of these obstacles, epileptics can live \n     healthy and productive lives and go on to make significant \n     contributions to society;\n       Whereas we must ensure that funding for epilepsy research \n     programs at the National Institutes of Health, and for \n     epilepsy programs at the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention must continue to increase; and\n       Whereas we must ensure that people with epilepsy in \n     underserved and unserved areas of the country have access to \n     appropriate care, and to this end it is essential that the \n     epilepsy program at the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration receive initial funding to create \n     demonstration projects to improve access to services in those \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2002, as ``National Epilepsy \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I would like to submit a \nresolution about an important health disorder which affects 2.3 million \nAmericans and 40,000 people in Arkansas. I am referring to epilepsy.\n  Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder; people with this \ndisorder may have seizures which may be as brief as a few seconds, or \nas traumatic as several minutes and visibly distracting. Several months \nago, I had the opportunity to meet with a young man from Arkansas who \nhas epilepsy and is a spokesperson for the Epilepsy Foundation, as part \nof their Winning Kids program, representing 300,000 children with this \ndisease. Additionally, he is a role model for his peers in Arkansas due \nto his courage. His name is Bryan Raymond. As he said in a speech to \nother children in March, ``We are all different. Some of us hardly ever \nhave seizures. Some of us have lots and lots of seizures. But we all \nwant the same things. We want to be busy and happy. We want to go to \nschool. We want to have friends. We want to play and have fun. We want \nother kids to understand what seizures are, and to respect us.'' The \none thing he asked me, and I ask of you is that we teach our children \nand our communities about a better understanding about this disease. \nSchool-age children have a better understanding of HIV/AIDS and cancer \nthan epilepsy. We must educate our children about this disease in order \nto allow these patients to thrive.\n  In addition to the touching conversation I had with Bryan and his \nmother earlier this year, this disease is even closer to home for me. A \nyoung woman on my staff is diagnosed with this condition. Amy is here \nwith me today for several reasons. First, she has provided a good \nfirst-hand account/knowledge of what epilepsy is and how it affects \ndaily life. Second, she signifies the success which epileptics can \nhave, like people from every other walk of life, when dealing with \nchronic conditions. To that end, this resolution is intended to serve \ntwo goals: to raise awareness about this disease, which in turn affects \nperception/stereotypes, and to increase funding for the long-term \nresearch for and care of patients.\n  Presently, doctors tell their patients that there is no cure for \nepilepsy. Rather the solution is long-term medication or surgery. It is \ncritical that we increase the funding committed to epilepsy. As far as \nwe have advanced in other areas of medicine, even other neurological \ndisorders, we must give equal time and resources to a cure for \nepilepsy.\n  I would like to move that we establish the month of November as \nNational Epilepsy Awareness Month. This is one small step toward the \nlarger goal of overcoming epilepsy. As with other chronic illnesses, \novercoming epilepsy is achieved in part through perception and part \nthrough science and medicine. Cancer, which was previously stigmatized \nto be terminal, is now more candidly discussed among patients and \nfamilies and leagues ahead in research. I hope that this will be true \nas well with epilepsy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 323--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION I \n SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL, ET.

Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following reservations, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification.\n       (1) The United States of America does not consider itself \n     bound by Article 11(1) of the Protocol to the extent that \n     United States law permits the limited taking of flora and \n     fauna listed in Annexes I and II--\n       (A) which is incidental, or\n       (B) for the purpose of public display, scientific research, \n     photography for educational or commercial purposes, or rescue \n     and rehabilitation.\n       (2) The United States has long supported environmental \n     impact assessment procedures, and has actively sought to \n     promote the adoption of such procedures throughout the world. \n     U.S. law and policy require environmental impact assessments \n     for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality \n     of the human environment. Accordingly, although the United \n     States expects that it will, for the most part, be in \n     compliance with Article 13, the United States does not accept \n     an obligation under Article 13 of the Protocol to the extent \n     that the obligations contained therein differ from the \n     obligations of Article 12 of the Convention for the \n     Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the \n     Wider Caribbean Region.\n       (3) The United States does not consider the Protocol to \n     apply to six species of fauna and flora that do not require \n     the protection provided by the Protocol in U.S. territory. \n     These species are the Alabama, Florida and Georgia \n     populations of least term (Sterna antillarum), the Audubon's \n     shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri), the Mississippi, Louisiana \n     and Texas population of the wood stork (Mycteria americana) \n     and the Florida and Alabama populations of the brown pelican \n     (Pelicanus occidentalis), which are listed on Annex II, as \n     well as the fulvous whistling duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), and \n     the populations of widgeon or ditch grass (Rupia maritima) \n     located in the continental United States, which are listed on \n     Annex III.\n       Section 3. Understanding.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understanding, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification:\n       The United States understands that the Protocol does not \n     apply to non-native species, defined as species found outside \n     of their natural geographic distribution, as a result of \n     deliberate or incidental human intervention. Therefore, in \n     the United States, certain exotic species, such as the \n     muscovy duck (Carina moschata) and the common iguana (Iguana \n     iguana), are not covered by the obligations of the Protocol.\n       Section 4. Declaration.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declaration:\n       Existing federal legislation provides sufficient legal \n     authority to implement United States obligations under the \n     Protocol. Accordingly, no new legislation is necessary in \n     order for the United States to implement the Protocol.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 323, submitted earlier today by the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       To authorize testimony and representation in Senator Mitch \n     McConnell, et al, v. Federal Election Commission, et al., and \n     consolidated cases.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the U.S. District Court in the District \nof Columbia has consolidated for adjudication a number of challenges \npending before it to the constitutionality of the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act of 2002, which Congress enacted into law this spring.\n  These challenges include the lead case, which was filed by our \ncolleague, Senator McConnell. Four of our other colleagues who played \nmajor roles in the passage of this landmark law, Senators McCain, \nFeingold, Snowe, and Jeffords, have intervened to join in defending the \nact. Recognizing the significant constitutional issues presented by the \npassage of this landmark legislation, the Senate acted to ensure that \nSenators on both sides of the constitutional questions would be able to \npresent their views in court.\n  Since these lawsuits were filed shortly after the law was signed, \nthere have been comprehensive pretrial proceedings under the \nsupervision of the three-judge court that is handling this case. The \ncourt is aiming to decide this case as soon as possible after the law \ntakes effect after the mid-term elections in November, and in time for \nthe Supreme Court to hear the inevitable appeal in its forthcoming \nterm.\n  As part of the proceedings in the discovery phase of the case, the \nMembers who are participating on either side of the controversy have \neach been asked to give deposition testimony. Accordingly, at the \nMembers' joint request, the enclosed resolution would authorize them to \nprovide testimony in these cases, except, in keeping with Senate \npractice, when a privilege should be asserted under the speech or \ndebate clause or when their presence is required on the Senate floor.\n  Finally, in order to ensure that the Senate's interests are protected \nin connection with the discovery process in this matter, the resolution \nauthorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to appear in this litigation as an \namicus curiae in the name of the Senate to assist in the presentation \nof views, to the parties, and, if necessary, the court, of the \napplicability of the principles of legislative privilege to discovery \nissues arising in this litigation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand the preamble be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that a statement by the majority leader be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 323) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res 323\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Senator Mitch McConnell, et al. v. \n     Federal Election Commission, et al., No. 02-CV-582, and \n     consolidated cases, pending in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia, notices for the taking of \n     depositions have been served on Senator Mitch McConnell, who \n     is a plaintiff, and Senators Olympia Snowe, James Jeffords, \n     John McCain, and Russell Feingold, who are intervenor-\n     defendants;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(c) and 706(a) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, who has introduced this \nlegislation to honor Thomas E. Burnett, Jr., a true hero who gave his \nlife on September 11 on the flight that was returning to Washington to \ncause enormous destruction to either this building perhaps or the White \nHouse. No one will ever know for sure. What we do know is the plane was \nprevented from its intended destructive course by the heroism of Mr. \nBurnett and others who were on that flight. We know that because on \nthree or four occasions he called his wife, Deena. He spoke with her on \na cell phone and communicated his intention and the intention of other \npassengers to intervene and wrest control of the plane from the \nhijackers who had commandeered that plane.\n  It was an act of enormous courage. It saved hundreds, perhaps \nthousands of lives, most likely in our Nation's Capitol. Tragically, it \ncost Mr. Burnett and the other passengers on that flight their lives. \nAll of us in this body owe a debt of unspeakable gratitude to those \nincredibly courageous men and women.\n  I had occasion to visit Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Burnett, Sr., the parents \nof Mr. Burnett, in Minnesota to express our gratitude and share briefly \nthe enormous grief they bear, as well as the grief of Mr. Burnett's \nwife and three children, which they will carry for the rest of their \nlives.\n  In a few minutes, we will pass this act to name the post office in \nMr. Burnett's honor. Again, I thank Senator Wellstone, my senior \ncolleague, for his thoughtful initiative in this regard, and I thank \nthe Members of the Senate who I anticipate will vote in support of this \nmeasure. It is such a small measure of our eternal gratitude to this \nbrave man. May he rest forever in peace and in the annals of the great \nheroes of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The bill (H.R. 5207) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/05/senate-section/article/S8328-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8328-S8329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nJOSEPH CURSEEN, JR.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to H.R. \n3287, recently received from the House, and now at our desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (H.R. 3287) to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 900 Brentwood Road, NE, in Washington, DC, as \nthe ``Joseph Curseen, Jr. and Thomas Morris, Jr. Processing and \nDistribution Center.''\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. REID. These two individuals were killed by anthrax. They worked \nat the post office on Brentwood Road, northeast Washington. Their \nfellow employees felt it was appropriate to name this facility, when it \nreopens, after them. It is very appropriate that it be done.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3287) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has passed H.R. \n3287/S. 2907, a bill to rename the Brentwood postal facility after \nJoseph P. Curseen, Jr. and Thomas L. Morris, Jr. I can think of nothing \nmore appropriate to honor the memory and tireless service of these two \nmen. Our action today clears the way for the President to sign the bill \ninto law. I especially recognize Celeste Curseen and Mary Morris. While \nnothing can erase the suffering of the Morris and Curseen families, I \nhope that the building will stand as a permanent reminder of the \nultimate sacrifice made by Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen.\n  It has been said that ``neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of \nnight stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed \nrounds.'' On October 15, 2001, that list was expanded when an anthrax-\ntainted letter was opened in my office. We later learned that its \nspread was far greater than first expected. A second letter addressed \nto the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, was discovered weeks later. The \nHart Senate Office Building was closed for more than three months. It \ntook nearly six months to remediate and renovate my own office in that \nbuilding. In the end, nearly a dozen people nationwide contracted \ninhalation anthrax, and five people, including Thomas Morris and Joseph \nCurseen, died as a result of this senseless act of bioterrorism.\n  Today, nearly a year later, the Brentwood facility where the letter \nwas processed remains closed, with plans underway for a complete \nremediation and reopening of that building. Never again can anyone take \nthe delivery of their mail for granted.\n  My staff and I feel a special kinship with the postal workers and \nothers affected by these attacks. While the uncertainty and horror of \nOctober 15--the day the letter addressed to me was opened in my \noffice--and the ensuing months were very real for us, the suffering of \nthose struck by the disease was even greater. We can only imagine the \npain experienced by Thomas Morris, Joseph Curseen, and their families, \npain shared by the families of Robert Stevens, Kathy Thi Nguyen, and \nOttilie Lundgren, who also lost their lives as a result of this \nterrorist act. Fortunately, LeRoy Richmond, Norma Wallace, ``George \nFairfax,'' David Hose, and Ernesto Blanco survived their battles with \ninhalation anthrax, but we know how terrifying their experience must \nhave been and that they continue to suffer the physical and emotional \nafter-effects.

Mercury.''.\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Solid \n     Waste Disposal Act to reduce the quantity of mercury in the \n     environment by limiting the use of mercury fever thermometers \n     and improving the collection and proper management of \n     mercury, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate is considering, and will \nshortly pass, the Mercury Reduction Act of 2002. This legislation \naddresses the very serious problem of mercury in the environment and \nmercury disposal. It takes special aim at one of the most common and \nwidely distributed sources of mercury; and that is, mercury fever \nthermometers. At the same time, the legislation will also create a \nnationwide policy for dealing with surplus mercury.\n  I introduced this bill quite some time ago. It has bipartisan \nsupport. I am delighted that the Senate will be approving it this \nevening.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is widespread in the environment \nand is particularly harmful to developing children. In fact, a National \nAcademy of Sciences report released last year attributed mercury \nexposure to birth defects and brain damage in up to 60,000 newborn \nchildren each year.\n  Mercury takes on a highly toxic organic form known as methylmercury \nwhen it enters the environment. Methylmercury is almost completely \nabsorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to all the tissues in the \nbody, including the brain. Of course, with young children this is \nparticularly problematic because their brains are still developing.\n  This organic mercury can accumulate in the food chain and become \nconcentrated in some species of fish, posing a health threat to people \nwho consume the fish. For this reason, 40 States have issued freshwater \nfish advisories that warn certain individuals, such as pregnant women, \nto restrict or avoid consuming fish from infected bodies of water.\n  One prevalent source of mercury in the environment is, as I said, \nmercury fever thermometers. Many of us know from personal experience \nhow easy it is to drop a mercury thermometer and see it break. In fact, \nin 1998 the American Poison Control Center received 18,000 phone calls \nfrom consumers who had broken mercury thermometers.\n  One mercury thermometer contains about 1 gram of mercury. That does \nnot sound like much, but let me tell you what the consequences are of \njust 1 gram of mercury. Despite its small size, the mercury in one \nthermometer, if released annually into the environment, is enough to \ncontaminate all the fish in a 20-acre lake. That is how powerful a \nneurotoxin mercury is.\n  The bill we are about to pass calls for a nationwide ban on the sale \nof mercury fever thermometers. It would also provide grants for swap \nprograms to help consumers exchange mercury thermometers for digital or \nother alternatives. Digital thermometers are easier to read. They are \nmuch quicker to use. They do not break easily. And, most of all, they \ndo not contain mercury.\n  My bill will allow millions of consumers across the Nation to receive \nfree digital thermometers in exchange for their mercury thermometers. \nBy bringing mercury thermometers in for proper disposal, consumers will \nalso help to ensure that the mercury from their thermometers does not \nend up polluting our lakes and threatening our health. It will also \nreduce the risk of breakage and contamination inside the home.\n\n  An important component of my bill is the safe disposal of mercury \nthat is collected from these thermometer exchange programs. Many States \nhave started these kinds of exchange programs--communities have as \nwell--but then they are left with the mercury from them, and they don't \nreally have a good means for disposing of them.\n  My legislation directs the EPA to ensure that the mercury is properly \ncollected and stored in order to keep it out of the environment and out \nof commerce. After all, if we collect all this mercury from fever \nthermometers but then it is sold back to India and then shipped back to \nthe United States in other products, we are really not solving the \nproblem. We want to make sure this mercury does not reenter the \nenvironment so that it will not be sent to India, one of the largest \nmanufacturers of mercury thermometers.\n  The mercury collected from thermometer exchange programs is only part \nof the problem. There is a bigger problem, and that is the global \ncirculation of mercury. Let me give an example.\n  When the HoltraChem manufacturing plant in Orrington, ME, shut down 2 \nyears ago, the plant was left with over 100 tons of unwanted mercury \nand no known way to permanently dispose of it. In total, about 3,000 \ntons of mercury is held at similar plants across the United States.\n  In addition, large amounts of mercury are still being mined around \nthe world. For example, in 1999, Algeria mined 400 tons of virgin \nmercury. In total, approximately 2,000 tons of new mercury is mined \nevery year. Moreover, the Department of Defense currently has a \nstockpile of over 4,000 tons of mercury that it doesn't want but \ndoesn't know what to do with. Why are Algeria and other countries still \nmining large amounts of an element that is a neurotoxin, when the \nUnited States and other countries are doing their best to remove this \nextremely toxic element from the environment? And how will the United \nStates dispose of the huge amounts of mercury at chlor-alkali plants \nand other no longer needed sources?\n  My bill creates an interagency task force to address these very \nquestions. The task force will be chaired by the Administrator of the \nEPA and comprised of members from other Federal agencies involved with \nmercury.\n  Specifically, my bill directs this task force to find ways to reduce \nthe mercury threat to humans and the environment, to identify a long-\nterm means of disposing of mercury, and to address the excess mercury \nproblem from mines as well as from other industrial sources.\n  In sum, this task force is directed to identify comprehensive \nsolutions to the global mercury problem. In one year, the mercury task \nforce will make recommendations to Congress for permanently disposing \nmercury, for retiring mercury from plants and other sources, and for \nreducing the amount of new mercury that is mined every year. At that \ntime, it will be up to Congress to act upon the recommendations of this \ntask force.\n  In the meantime, this bill will make significant progress toward \nreducing one of the most widespread sources of mercury contamination in \nthe environment by banning the sale nationwide of mercury fever \nthermometers.\n  I am very pleased the Senate will pass my legislation shortly. I \nthank the members of the Environment and\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nPublic Works Committee for their strong bipartisan support of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is a modest bill, in many ways, but it addresses a very \nserious problem. It will help make our environment a safer place and \nhelp our children avoid exposure to one of the most toxic elements in \nour environment.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding Senators Jeffords and Smith of New \nHampshire have an amendment. It is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent \nit be considered now, that the amendment be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
