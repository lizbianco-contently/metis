Mr. President, in this morning's paper I was stunned to \nread a headline but more stunned to read the story itself. It is in the \nWashington Post, titled ``GOP Monitoring Lobbyists' Politics.''\n  Among other things, the article says:\n\n       Republicans are researching the party affiliation and \n     political contributions of hundreds of lobbyists in \n     Washington, part of a campaign that could deny government \n     access and prime lobbying jobs to Democrats. . . . Copies of \n     the bulky dossier, being compiled . . . will be given to top \n     White House officials. . . . Early drafts of the report are \n     already in the hands of a few senior administration officials \n     and lawmakers . . . The report, dubbed the K Street Project, \n     has been evolving in fits and starts over the past few years, \n     but has been expedited and expanded now that Republicans \n     control the White House and Federal agencies. Several \n     Republican lobbyists have complained that they aren't getting \n     the access to Federal agencies they feel they deserve.\n       Republicans involved in the effort said they plan for it to \n     be used by White House officials, lawmakers and staff to \n     determine who can meet with party leaders in discussions of \n     policy matters.\n\n  If there was ever anything that was immoral, wrong, and scandalous, \nthis was it. To think that people who have jobs--you can pick any \ncompany you want--they hire somebody or they have worked for a number \nof years and they are going to check to see what party they belong to \nas to whether or not they can meet with a Federal agency, that is \nreally bad. I do not think it is criminal, but I think it is on the \nverge of being criminal.\n  This sets a very dangerous precedent. This, in my opinion, is \ntantamount to McCarthyism. It involves the practice of compiling a new \nenemy's list to be circulated out of the administration and the Hill. \nMaybe we should include, rather than just McCarthy, Nixon. This appears \nto be something that would have happened during the Watergate \nyears. Enemies are those who belong to or support the Democratic Party. \nThey are targeted.\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n  President Bush, during the campaign, said he wanted to change the \ntone of things in Washington. The tone has not been changed. Someone \nshould get to the President and say this has got to stop. I cannot \nimagine President Bush liking this. If he does, it speaks volumes.\n  Top White House officials have said he wanted to change the tone in \nWashington, but today we learn he is working in tandem with those \nkeeping secret lists of people's personal activity for intimidation, \nprofessional retaliation, or maybe even character assassinations.\n  It is not enough they block access to all non-Republicans. The story \nindicates that the ``chief aim is to prod trade associations, lobbying \nfirms, and corporations to hire more Republicans to represent them in \nWashington.''\n  It is somewhat ironic the party most opposed to affirmative action \nsupports its application when it comes to hiring lobbyists. They \nsupport affirmative action when it comes to the hiring of Republican \nlobbyists but oppose it when it comes to helping a minority gain entry \nto college.\n  The person behind this secret list is a frequent adviser and a \nvisitor to the President. His name is in this story. The President \nshould pick up the phone, call his friend, and denounce it and tell him \nthat President George W. Bush will not tolerate what amounts to \nNixonian-McCarthyism.\n  I don't know this President as well as I know his father, but I \nguarantee the first President Bush would not condone this. I guarantee \nthat. One thing about the previous President Bush, he was a very \npragmatic man. This is so wrong. It is extraordinarily disappointing if \nthe President is complicit in these secret lists, lists designed to \nsuppress workers' liberties in order to protect special interests. This \nis a witch-hunt, tracking and documenting people's personal choices \nwith invasive tactics to threaten and intimidate freedom in the \nworkplace.\n  If you have someone who represents a company or a trade association, \nwill they now, each time there is an election where there is a \nturnover, have to fire all Republicans or fire all Democrats until all \nthe lobbyists are of the same party as the person who is President of \nthe United States? I hope not.\n  We have lobbyists, advocates, and consultants talked about in this \narticle. Does it mean that next they will go after researchers, maybe \nteachers, doctors, or lawyers? Or maybe people from Hawaii? Pick any \ngroup. Where will it end? Will the Republican lawmakers be told not to \nmeet with Democratic constituents? For a party that defined itself \nduring the cold war as the enemy of communism, their new playbook would \nbe the envy of one of the Communist dictators. Every elected official, \nRepublican and Democrat, should denounce this. This is wrong.\n  Every person should call upon the President, a lawmaker, and say, \nstop this. Today's story about his supporters secretly compiling a new \nenemies list changes both the tone and the clock, but it changes it in \nthe wrong direction. We do not want to turn the clock back to Nixonian-\nMcCarthyism.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak a \nlittle about an issue that is current: homeland defense. It is not new \nto be current. Of course, homeland defense has been a very high topic \nin all of our minds since September 11, and will continue to be, \nindeed, for a very long time. I think the war we are in requires a \ngreat commitment from all of us to continue to provide homeland defense \nand security and the new prospects for us. I think we are unaccustomed \nto that. I want to take a few minutes to talk about that, and \nparticularly about the President's proposal.\n  I think there is no question that homeland defense has become one of \nour most important issues, and that, of course, is coupled with what we \nare doing overseas. There is also no question about the best method of \nhomeland defense, partly because it is something we haven't done in the \npast. It is particularly difficult to develop, and it is hard to \ndetermine the best way to do it. It is a domestic activity about which \nwe haven't had to be concerned, particularly in the past, and we \nhaven't dealt with it certainly to the extent we are now and which we \nmust in the future.\n  I will admit--as you will probably detect--that I am not an expert on \nthis at all. As a matter of fact, I am not on committees that are \nbasically involved with it. But I am a bit disturbed about the reaction \nto the President's Cabinet-level plan he announced last week. The \ncritics have been very vocal about not having a plan. We have been \nhearing that now for a number of months--that Tom Ridge has not been \ndoing what we need to do; that he doesn't have the authority which we \nneed to have for him to be able to accomplish what is going on here. \nFairly high level criticism has been taking place. It is interesting. \nThe critics for not having a plan are now just about as vocal about the \nplan the President has provided. I think that certainly is a strange \nkind of thing and one that is not helpful to accomplishing what we want \nto accomplish.\n\n  I think there is no question that a plan of this size and of this \nimportance will be altered before it is put into place. I do not know \nof any plan this size that has come before the Congress that isn't \nchanged, polished, and accommodated before it is finally agreed to. But \nthe point is there has to be one to begin. I think it is really \nimportant that we deal with it now. It is there, and it is what the \ncritics wanted. I don't know why they continue to criticize.\n  I am surprised and am a little dismayed that the media has continued \nto use this proposal as a way to create controversy. I guess the \nmedia's job--whatever the issue is--is to pick on that part which is \nreflected on by a minority of the people who have been critical rather \nthan a majority. Indeed, 72 percent, according to the polls, are \nfavorable. It is kind of interesting that this moves their way, and I \nguess that is the media's way of doing things.\n  One of the complaints is that the plan came out overnight--it came \nout very quickly. I think that is not the case. Tom Ridge did an \ninterview the other day in which he indicated that he has been in place \nnow for quite some time and has not, of course, been a Cabinet member. \nHe has not had anything but his own office to handle. But he has been \nworking on this for a long time, including a lot of people. The idea \nthat it came out overnight from people in the President's little group \nis not the case. There has been a great deal of talk about it within \nthe administration and a great number of ideas as to how this might \nbest be done, as I think it should be. I think it would be sort of \nridiculous to be talking about something publicly before it comes out. \nThat is why it came out now, and that is why this is the time to talk \nabout it publicly.\n  I must confess I get a little impatient sometimes with the way these \nthings are handled. It is easier to sit up in the\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\ngrandstands and be critical than to be on the field and have to call \nthe plays. That is, of course, what the President has to do.\n  I think it deals with a problem. The problem, of course, is that all \nof us are concerned about security. There is no one in government or \noutside government who doesn't want to try to detect what is going on \nand do something about it, whether it is a highway patrolman in Wyoming \nor a CIA agent or an FBI agent. Sometimes it is objective, sometimes it \nis seen, or sometimes it is suspected; then what do you do?\n  We haven't had a central place to accumulate all of these \npossibilities so they can be evaluated and so something can be done \nabout them. There are as many as 100 different government agencies that \nhave some responsibility for homeland security. I suspect it is almost \nevery agency. No one has had the final accountability. No one has had \nto say there is something that really should be investigated and should \nbe turned over to people to further investigate.\n  The Coast Guard has several missions: Research, rescue, maritime \ntreaties. It, of course, reports to the Transportation Department. Its \nprimary responsibilities are rails, bridges, and airways.\n  There is really sort of a lack of continuity.\n  The Customs Service, among other duties, collects tariffs, prevents \nsmuggling. It is part of the Treasury Department whose primary \nresponsibility is not regular security but indeed physical security.\n\n  We have not had a central place for this information until recently. \nNow we do. Times have changed.\n  Absolutely now, there will be someone in charge. The bureaucrats are \nunchangeable, it is said. I don't believe that. I believe change can \ncome when the leadership shows the way and insists upon change. That is \nwhat it is all about. That is why there are heads of departments. It is \nwhy someone is a Cabinet member--to take the policy of their leader, \nthe President, and to ensure it is implemented. I have never worked in \nthe bureaucracy, but I suppose where there are thousands of people, it \nis a little bit difficult to do. But that is their task. That is their \njob. I think it can bring about change.\n  It would be too bad if the Congress failed to change. I read about \nsome of the congressional committees being concerned about their \njurisdiction and that this might change that. Change is inevitable. \nChange is something we ought to look at and accept, if it has merit. \nThe idea of being resistant to change is a little hard, and it is not \nvery helpful. I suspect there is some of that in the Senate. We hear \nall kinds of voices coming out here.\n  I am no expert, as I mentioned before. I suspect that maybe this \ndepartment could be smaller. You could have a little more selective \ngroup that comes together, if indeed then the things that are \ndetermined by this smaller homeland security group could be brought to \nthe President and to his Cabinet, and the President would ensure that \neach of these Cabinet people caused their departments to do what is \nnecessary; that is, to support the central agency. Even today I \nunderstand that. But when you are talking about hundreds of thousands \nof people, of course, it is less easy. I understand that.\n  But I do think there has to be a central but real war to a large \nextent--both domestically and overseas--carried out by intelligence, \nand carried out by centralized information, and by knowing what is \nhappening. This is an entirely different kind of war than we have ever \nhad in the past. We will have to have different arrangements to do it.\n  I think if you are a frontline worker for the FBI, CIA, or some other \nlaw enforcement or intelligence agency, and you see something that \nraises suspicions, you need to have a place to report it immediately, \nand you should expect your supervisors to treat it with the seriousness \nit deserves. Information must be fully shared so that we can follow all \nof those leads and hopefully prevent a tragedy such as happened to us \nbefore.\n  I hope we can consider the President's recommendation and make the \nchanges we believe we need. I think we should see what weaknesses we \nhave had so we can change those. Certainly there have been some. I \nsuppose some of them were not necessarily weaknesses. There is a \ndifference in the climate, there is a difference in the atmosphere, a \ndifference in the challenge. When that happens, there has to be a \ndifference in the way we behave.\n  I look forward to that. I hope we can come out with something better \nthan what we received.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, the front page of today's New York Times \nhas an article with a title that reads ``Enthusiasm Ebbs for Tough \nReform in Wake of Enron.'' That headline points out a political \nchallenge that those of us in Congress have to deal with over the next \nfew months; that is, the challenge to enact meaningful legislation \nwhile this terrible catastrophe which befell many employees and \ninvestors in relation to Enron is still fresh in mind.\n  I, for one, am not ready to concede that we cannot take legislative \naction to make sure the country's workers are not protected from the \nnext Enron-type meltdown. We need to take that legislative action. It \nneeds to be a priority of the Congress. I rise to speak about some of \nthe elements that legislative action ought to contain.\n  Hardly a day goes by when we are not hearing about the collapse of \nanother corporation. It is not just Enron.\n  I think we have all come to recognize the problem of corporate \nmismanagement, the problem of questionable accounting, or actual \ndishonest accounting, the problem of misuse or abuse of the tax \nprovisions early in the law. All of that is, unfortunately, more \nwidespread than just the Enron example.\n  These corporate misdeeds, executive malfeasance, accounting \nchicanery, unfortunately, provide grist for virtually every front page \nwe see these days. These stories will not stop on their own. The \nproblems will not go away on their own. Apparently, the system we have \nhad in place for a long time is not working as it should. We need to \npass legislation to address these recurring themes or else we will \njeopardize a long-term economic recovery, which I know we are all \nhoping very much is in place and scheduled to occur.\n  I have referred to a New York Times article. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WYDEN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as noted in the article, Senator Daschle \nhas indicated he would like to bring a bill to the Senate floor dealing \nwith these issues before the August recess. I think that is an \nadmirable goal, one that the entire Senate needs to join. \nUnfortunately, the administration and the House and some colleagues in \nthe Senate have not shown the kind of zeal for these necessary reforms \nthat is going to be required. I certainly hope the delays and obstacles \nthat have arisen so far do not prevent us from bringing meaningful \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  Let me refer to a couple other articles while I am on the subject. I \nwas reading these articles over the weekend in Business Week. One is an \neditorial in the current edition of Business Week, entitled \n``Accounting: Stronger Reforms, Please.'' It is a very interesting \narticle, one that I think deserves the attention of everyone. Let me \nread a couple of paragraphs from it because I think it does make a \npoint on which all of us need to focus. It says:\n\n       If you hoped that the Enron/Andersen scandal would provide \n     an opportunity for just\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n     those sort of farsighted regulatory improvements, start \n     worrying. There are signs that the Bush Administration, under \n     pressure from the accounting lobby and business groups such \n     as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is willing to support only \n     mild changes in the current system. And there's a danger that \n     Congress will acquiesce. The House of Representatives has \n     already passed a very watered-down bill.\n       That's wrong. Halfhearted reform is bad for the public, bad \n     for the economy, and even bad for the accounting industry, \n     which needs to reestablish its credibility. Instead, we think \n     the best bet for strong accounting and financial reform is \n     the legislation proposed by Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat \n     from Maryland, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n       Sarbanes' draft legislation--which is opposed by Senator \n     Phil Gramm, the ranking GOP member of the Banking Committee, \n     and the Bush Administration--would set up a strong private-\n     sector board to oversee public-company accounting.\n\n  It goes on to detail what is in the legislation and to urge that the \nlegislation be considered and passed by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from \nBusiness Week's current edition be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me also call the attention of my \ncolleagues to another section in the same magazine called The Barker \nPortfolio. It is entitled ``A Three-Point Plan for SEC Reform.'' It is \nby Robert Barker, and he goes into some detail about what he believes \nis an appropriate set of reforms for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in order that these kinds of problems can be avoided in the \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before leaving this general subject, let \nme talk a little about a subject on which I have focused in recent \nweeks, which is part of this overall corporate mismanagement problem \nthat we have been talking about, and that is the problem of pensions. \nWhat do we do to preserve the retirement of workers in these companies \nthat turn out to have cooked the books or to have engaged in some kind \nof practice that causes the value of that company to go away?\n  There are essentially four major issues that I think need to be \nfocused on regarding retirement security for Americans. Let me put that \nchart up and go through the list once more for those who are interested \nin this subject.\n  There are four major areas where we need to concentrate our attention \nand where I believe we can legislate in a constructive fashion. First, \nwe need to have a goal of providing some type of retirement or pension \nplan for all workers in our society. There is no reason why a person \nshould work 25, 30, 35, even 40 years at a job--or a series of jobs, \nwhich is much more common in this day and time--and wind up with no \npension, no income, nothing they can depend on other than Social \nSecurity once they get to retirement age.\n  Pensions and retirement coverage have not increased as a percentage \nof the workforce in the last 30 years. We have recent studies that have \nindicated that. About 50 percent of private sector workers actually \nhave some sort of pension plan today. That is nationwide. The statistic \nis 50 percent. My home State of New Mexico, unfortunately, has the \nworst statistic of any of the 50 States. The percentage is 70 percent \nhave no pension plan and are not expecting to have a pension; whereas, \nonly 30 percent of private sector employees do have some sort of \npension plan.\n  I can remember the discussions in previous years around here where we \ntalked about a three-legged stool when it came to retirement security. \nWe said, when a person gets to retirement, they are going to have three \nthings to depend upon, including Social Security payments--and we all \nwant to see those continue. They are going to have their savings, and \nthey are going to have their pension. The reality is very different \nfrom that model or that ideal that we have described for many years.\n  The reality is that most people who have worked through their entire \ncareers--at least in New Mexico where 70 percent have no pension--most \npeople do not have three legs on the ``stool'' on which they are \nplanning to sit. They have most likely one leg because they have not \nbeen able to save a significant amount, and they don't have any sort of \npension or 401(k) plan. That is the first issue and the first item on \nthe chart.\n  All workers need a retirement or pension plan of some sort. We can do \nmuch more to expand pension coverage to make it more attractive for \nemployers to provide pension coverage and to make it more available to \nworkers in our society. We need to get about the business of doing \nthat.\n  Second, all workers should have a right to a secure retirement \nsavings. The problems we have seen with Enron, the problems we have \nseen with other corporations, where retirement savings have been \nessentially frittered away, or put into stock by employers which turned \nout not to have value, need to be fixed. There is legislation that \nSenator Kennedy has proposed, which has been reported out of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that I supported. That \nlegislation is awaiting consideration on the Senate floor. I hope very \nmuch that we can move to consider that legislation.\n  In the Finance Committee, we are also looking at legislation which \nwould help ensure that people who have these pension savings, or who \nhave a 401(k) plan, can be guaranteed those funds will be there when \nthey actually retire.\n  We need to protect employees from conflicts of interest that allow \naccountants, analysts, investment advisers, and, in some cases, \nemployers to act in their own self-interest, rather than in the best \ninterest of the employee who is supposed to benefit from that \nretirement plan.\n  Third, all workers must have pension portability. One of the problems \ntoday in our workforce and our work careers is that most people will \nmove from job to job, and over the period of 30, 35, 40 years of work, \nan average worker may have 8 or 10 jobs. We need to be sure they do not \nlose their pension benefits as they move from job to job. We need to be \nsure they can take those benefits with them and that the benefits will \nbe portable.\n  Again, we need to change the laws to make that occur on a more ready \nbasis. I hope very much we can move to legislation to accomplish that.\n  The fourth item I want to mention is all workers should be treated on \na comparable basis as regards to retirement benefits. We are just now \ntrying to understand all of the various mechanisms that have been used \nin some of these companies to get us to a result which we have seen \nover and over where the top executives of a corporation, when the \ncorporation essentially collapses as a financial matter, where the top \nexecutives walk off with tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars \nin deferred compensation, in executive compensation of one kind or \nanother; whereas the workers for that same corporation may wind up with \nnothing in their retirement accounts.\n  We need to find out what those abuses are. We need to find out ways \nto correct them. We need to plug those loopholes in the existing law, \nand I believe we can.\n  Mr. President, let me stop with that. I see other colleagues are \nwaiting to speak. I believe very strongly this issue of retirement \nsecurity needs to be on the agenda of this Congress. I know Senator \nDaschle is trying to put together a series of proposals coming from \nvarious committees so that we can consider it before the August recess. \nRetirement security is one of the provisions that we would hopefully \ngive attention to as a result of or in the wake of the Enron scandal. I \nhope we can do that. I think the people of the country want to see us \ndo that.\n  I close with the article with which I began my discussion, \n``Enthusiasm Ebbs for Tough Reform in Wake of Enron.'' We need to prove \nthat headline wrong and demonstrate that this Congress is committed to \ntough reform, and one of those reforms is in the area of retirement \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 10, 2002]\n\n           Enthusiasm Ebbs for Tough Reform in Wake of Enron\n\n             (By Stephen Labaton and Richard A. Oppel, Jr.)\n\n       Washington, June 9.--Six months after the collapse of \n     Enron, a wave of enthusiasm for\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\n     overhauling the nation's corporate and accounting laws has \n     ebbed and the toughest proposals for change are all but dead.\n       A powerful group of lobbyist, playing on partisan \n     disagreement in Congress, appears to have killed efforts to \n     impose tight new controls on corporate conduct. And while \n     some Democrats hope to turn the inaction to their advantage \n     in the fall elections, other lawmakers say that--barring more \n     business meltdowns that deepen the stock market's two-year \n     slump--voters are unlikely to care enough to influence their \n     ballots.\n       Bills imposing more stringent accounting standards, \n     changing the tax and accounting treatment of employee stock \n     options and setting tougher conflict-of-interest rules for \n     stock analysts and accounting firms have all fallen victim to \n     political gridlock.\n       Corporate America and the stock markets have not waited for \n     Washington. Instead, they have undertaken a host of changes \n     in response to the problems highlighted by Enron and \n     reinforced by corporate and accounting failures in the \n     telecommunications, cable and energy industries. Investors \n     have fled companies whose accounting or governance practices \n     fail to measure up to post-Enron standards. Some Republicans \n     say all this is evidence that the system is working without \n     heavy-handed interference by lawmakers.\n       Congress did much to focus attention on flaws in the \n     nation's corporate and accounting practices with a series of \n     investigative hearings earlier this year, the most dramatic \n     of them conducted by committees in the Republican-led House. \n     Even so, with the debate over Enron at full boil, the House \n     adopted a measure in April that rejected the toughest \n     proposed changes.\n       Senate Democrats now predict that they will have the votes \n     to get a broad measure of their own out of the Banking \n     Committee later this month on a party-line vote, but only by \n     tempering it to win the support of moderates. Senator Tom \n     Daschle, the majority leader, is said by lawmakers and his \n     aides to be committed to trying to move a bill to the Senate \n     floor before the August recess, in hopes of using the \n     Republicans' opposition to the measure against them in fall \n     campaigns.\n       Even if that bill survives a filibuster threatened by \n     Senate Republicans, lawmakers and lobbyists say that there is \n     little chance of reconciling the differences between the \n     House and the Senate this year.\n       All of Washington has not been paralyzed. Federal \n     regulators--spurred in part by state prosecutors--have become \n     more aggressive on the enforcement front.\n       In Congress, meanwhile, legislation to modify pension \n     laws--a response to the enormous losses in the retirement \n     funds of employees at Enron and other troubled companies--\n     might have a better chance of passage.\n       Still, even lawmakers who favor a tough response to the \n     seeming explosion in business misconduct detect little fervor \n     among voters for a Washington crackdown. Absent a spate of \n     further disclosures, they say, the issues may remain too \n     remote to change many voters' minds.\n       ``The politics will be determined by the circumstances,'' \n     said Senator Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey and a \n     former top executive of Goldman, Sachs & Company. ``If we \n     continue to see an erosion of the stock market and more cases \n     like Adelphia and Tyco, then it will be significant. If we \n     see less, then it may have less of an impact, because these \n     can become issues that are hard for people like my mom to \n     understand.''\n       Other lawmakers, particularly Republicans, say Enron's \n     moment as a galvanizing issue has quickly passed.\n       ``The feeding frenzy is pretty much over,'' said Senator \n     Phil Gramm of Texas, the ranking Republican on the banking \n     committee, who has worked closely with industry lobbyists to \n     kill many of the Democrats' proposals. ``People started \n     looking at making all these radical changes and decided there \n     was a real cost involved and that it would not solve the \n     Enron problem.''\n       Mr. Gramm said regulators and the marketplace are already \n     correcting the excesses exemplified by Enron and its auditor, \n     Arthur Andersen, relieving Congress of the need to enact \n     comprehensive legislation.\n       ``A lot of progress has already been made,'' he said. ``The \n     president has put forward a strong program, the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission is moving forward, and the exchanges \n     are changing their rules. No one who sits on an audit \n     committee will be the same after Enron.'' Mr. Gramm's wife, \n     Wendy, a onetime government regulator who serve on Enron's \n     audit committee, resigned from the company's board last week.\n       Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who \n     held hearings on Enron's collapse, agreed with Mr. Gramm's \n     appraisal, but he said it will still vital for Congress to \n     act, even though the prospects for legislation are not \n     strong.\n       ``It's all very iffy,'' he said. ``There is a huge rift \n     between where the Senate believes these issues ought to go \n     and what the House has already passed. I don't know if it \n     gets worked out in time.''\n       Both Democrats and Republicans have already begun to \n     consider strategies to make the best political use of the \n     issue in the November elections. The Republicans are relying \n     heavily on the rule-making and enforcement actions of the \n     S.E.C.\n       On the Democratic side, one idea under discussion by \n     advisers to Senator Daschle is to bundle disparate proposals \n     into one package, making it more efficient to both confront \n     recalcitrant Republicans in the House and make a polticial \n     issue in the fall of the legislation's defeat.\n       In any event, politicians and lobbyists say that any change \n     in the accounting treatment of stock options is dead for the \n     year--largely because of the perception that Silicon Valley, \n     where such options are as ubiquitous as the Internet \n     itself, is up for grabs in the 2002 and 2004 elections.\n       Proposals have been made to force companies to account for \n     options as a compensation cost--now they are not charged \n     against corporate earnings--and to limit the ability of \n     companies to take tax deductions for issuing options. But \n     technology companies, financial firms and corporate trade \n     groups--with the backing of President Bush--have lobbied \n     lawmakers around the country to maintain the current system.\n       For now, lawmakers say, they have trumped the arguments of \n     such people as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, \n     and the multibillionaire investor Warren E. Buffett that the \n     current treatment of options contributed to corporate \n     overreaching in the 1990's.\n       The Bush administration has not been a visible force in the \n     legislative battles, relying instead on likeminded allies--\n     notably Senator Gramm--to bottle up the most ambitious \n     legislation. He has met repeatedly with corporate lobbyists \n     and urged them to press sympathetic Democrats or those facing \n     tight races, like Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, Evan Bayh of \n     Indiana and Zell Miller of Georgia, to block legislation from \n     reaching the Senate floor.\n       Democrats say that effort appears to have failed and that \n     Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, appears to \n     have the support to get a bill approved by the banking \n     committee. It would sharply curtail the consulting work \n     performed by accounting firms, create a relatively \n     independent oversight board for the accounting profession, \n     require large corporations to rotate their auditors every \n     five years, and impose tighter conflict of interest \n     restrictions on stock analysts than the measure that was \n     passed by the House.\n       Mr. Gramm has been working closely with the administration \n     on an alternative measure that does not tighten conflict of \n     interest regulations for analysts or auditing firms. His \n     wife's Enron ties seem to have produced no political pressure \n     on Mr. Gramm--who has announced his intention to retire from \n     the Senate after this year--to shy from the debate.\n       The post-Enron proposals prompted scores of industry \n     associations and hundreds of corporations to retain lobbyists \n     and use their own employees to try to weaken or kill the \n     measures. They include the American Institute of Certified \n     Public Accountants, which is dominated by the largest firms. \n     Hundreds of companies, including Oracle and Intel, have \n     fought against changing the treatment of stock options. And \n     many of the largest Wall Street firms have lobbied against \n     changes in the laws governing stock analysts.\n       The drift in Congress largely reflects the power of the \n     accounting profession. Accounting firms ranked as three of \n     President Bush's top eight campaign donors in 2000, and over \n     all, the industry made $14.7 million in campaign donations to \n     both Democrats and Republicans during the last election \n     cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The \n     profession has influential members in many congressional \n     districts and has been known to use lawmakers' own \n     accountants to lobby them.\n       Pension legislation may stand a better chance in Congress, \n     although its prospects remain cloudy.\n       The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus of \n     Montana, is crafting an alternative to a bill by Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, that drew \n     strong opposition from business lobbyists and Republicans.\n       On some points, Mr. Baucus's bill is likely to contain \n     provisions similar to those in the House bill, like \n     permitting workers to sell company stock awarded as a 401(k) \n     match three years after they receive it. Senate aides say the \n     bill may also place limits on certain forms of executive \n     compensation. Mr. Daschle is warming to the provisions that \n     are expected to form the Baucus proposal, Senate aides say.\n       But they say the Baucus plan is unlikely to include the \n     Kennedy proposal's provision prohibiting most companies from \n     both offering their stock as a 401(k) investment option and \n     using it to match employee contributions. This was designed \n     to keep employees from putting too much retirement money in \n     their own stock, as happened at Enron.\n       One major issue that remains unresolved is how to give \n     employees better access to investment advice. Investment \n     management companies have been lobbying to permit firms that \n     administer retirement plans to offer advice to participants. \n     Among other things, they would be permitted to recommend \n     investments for which they could receive a fee.\n       Senate aides say the Baucus proposal may instead contain a \n     provision encouraging employers to hire independent firms to \n     provide advice.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                          [From Business Week]\n\n                  Accounting: Stronger Reforms, Please\n\n       Perhaps the only benefit of a major scandal is that it \n     creates pressure for reforms. Politicians who would otherwise \n     listen to special interests are forced by public pressure to \n     make long-needed changes. Often, the\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\n     legislative and regulatory changes that follow a scandal can \n     help build a strong foundation for economic growth.\n       If you hoped that the Enron/Anderson scandal would provide \n     an opportunity for just those sort of farsighted regulatory \n     improvements, start worrying. There are signs that the Bush \n     Administration, under pressure from the accounting lobby and \n     business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is \n     willing to support only mild changes in the current system. \n     And there's a danger that Congress will acquiesce. The House \n     of Representatives has already passed a very watered-down \n     bill.\n       That's wrong. Halfhearted reform is bad for the public, bad \n     for economy, and even bad for the accounting industry, which \n     needs to reestablish its credibility. Instead, we think the \n     best for strong accounting and financial reform is the \n     legislation proposed by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), \n     chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n       Sarbanes' draft legislation--which is opposed by Senator \n     Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), the ranking GOP member of the Banking \n     Committee, and the Bush Administration--would set up a strong \n     private-sector board to oversee public-company accounting. It \n     would severely limit consulting services that accounting \n     firms can offer the companies they audit. And, not the least, \n     the bill would require CEOs and CFOs to sign their company's \n     audit reports and forfeit a year's worth of bonuses, \n     incentive-based pay, and profits on stock sales if the \n     company has to materially restate its earnings. That would \n     reduce the aggravating sight of CEOs claiming they had no \n     idea what kind of wrongdoing their company was engaged in.\n       Equally important, the Sarbanes bill would authorize more \n     money for the Securities & Exchange Commission and permit the \n     agency to hire at least twice as many professionals as the \n     Bush Administration is willing to fund. These additional \n     resources are essential for the SEC to do its regulatory \n     duty. According to a report from the General Accounting \n     Office, the SEC's workload increased by 80% in the 1990s, but \n     its staffing rose only 20%. In 2001, for example, the SEC \n     reviewed only 16% of all annual reports--way below the \n     desirable level.\n       No business or profession likes closer oversight. But \n     finding the right balance between markets and regulation is \n     essential for a well-functioning economy. Reform is never \n     easy--but history suggest that it's essential.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                   [From Business Week, June 3, 2002]\n\n                   A Three-Point Plan for SEC Reform\n\n                           (By Robert Barker)\n\n       A specter is haunting Wall Street--the specter of Main \n     Street retreating from investments and toward savings, going \n     from stocks to CDs. That's why, as the late, lamented bull \n     market nears its 20th anniversary this summer, ``we are on \n     the verge of the greatest overhaul of securities regulation \n     since the SEC was created,'' Securities & Exchange Commission \n     Chairman Harvey Pitt said recently. ``Nothing is off the \n     table.''\n       Pitt was addressing an Investor Summit that the called on \n     May 10 in Washington to air investors' concerns and answer \n     questions. I listened, via the Web, to more than three hours \n     of talk, most of it pertinent (box). Yet some specific \n     investor demands need amplification. Here's a short list of \n     concrete fixes. If Wall Street and its regulators can't deal \n     with this simple stuff, their reform effort will have failed:\n       FASTER. A CEO today can dump a ton of his company's stock \n     on the first day of the month and need not report it until \n     the 10th day of the next month. Not only should that \n     disclosure be made much sooner--within a day or two of the \n     sale, as now is being discussed--but such insider trades \n     should be disclosed for free via the SEC's Web site, which is \n     not the case today.\n       Quarterly and annual corporate reports, now required 45 and \n     90 days, respectively, after each period, will likely be \n     accelerated to 30 and 60 days. That's good, but faster filing \n     should not end there. Mutual-fund holdings should be \n     disclosed at least quarterly instead of every six months, the \n     current rule. Opponents say faster disclosure will make it \n     harder for funds to trade without tipping their hand and \n     ultimately hurting investors. But companies that manage $100 \n     million or more--including most fund advisory firms--already \n     must disclose portfolio holdings 45 days after the close of \n     each quarter. Cut that to 30 days, tops. Short positions, now \n     exempt should be required as well as longs.\n       FAIRER. The SEC's regulation FD, or Fair Disclosure, seems \n     to have helped put individual investors on a more equal \n     footing with professionals when companies disclose \n     potentially market-moving information. Before its adoption in \n     August, 2000, the public routinely was barred from \n     management's conferencecalls with stock analysts. Not so now. \n     There remains, however, a forbidden zone--the ``road shows'' \n     put on for institutional investors by companies preparing to \n     sell securities, particularly initial public offerings of \n     stock. Just as the SEC was able to invite the public via the \n     Internet to its own recent Investor Summit, investors small \n     as well as large should be asked to attend and pose questions \n     at these pre-IPO presentations. It's one thing to read a \n     prospectus laden with legalese; it's better to hear how \n     management discusses what's in the prospectus.\n       PLAINER. Speaking of legalese, regulators have long \n     encouraged the use of ``plain English'' in securities filing. \n     A charitable assessment of this initiative would be to say it \n     has achieved limited success. To any who doubt this, I point \n     to the 749-page proxy statement (including Annexes A through \n     N) filed recently by AT If you own AT, you're supposed \n     to use this to decide how you'll vote by July 10 on the \n     company's plan to restructure and merge its cable unit with \n     Comcast. Meanwhile, regulators--while trying to make investor \n     communications clear to more than just the securities bar--\n     might also try setting a good example. In SEC lingo, the AT \n     proxy is a ``DEFM14A.'' A mutual fund's annual report is an \n     ``N-SAR.'' A tender offer may be a ``13E-4'' or a ``14D-1.'' \n     Our government can do much better.\n       Only a fool would expect Washington to solve every problem \n     in today's stock market. As SEC Commissioner Isaac Hunt put \n     it: ``The burden rests with individual investors to research \n     the information and make intelligent investment decisions on \n     their own.'' Fair enough. At the same time, investors don't \n     have to buy what Wall Street is selling. So the burden is \n     equally on Wall Street to show honestly that what it's \n     offering is worth buying. Otherwise, I'd say the intelligent \n     investment decision is a bank CD.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to an excellent exhibit that opened last week at the \nSmithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building, entitled, \n``Kaho'olawe; Rebirth of a Sacred Hawaiian Island.'' The exhibit \nchronicles the rich history of the island of Kaho'olawe from its \nmythical beginnings to current efforts towards its protection and \nrevitalization. The exhibit is a project of the Bishop Museum Native \nHawaiian Culture and Arts Program, and is sponsored by the Smithsonian \nAsian Pacific American Program, Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Community \nDevelopment Pacific, and Protect Kaho'olawe `Ohana/Fund.\n  I was deeply moved by the exhibit and its eloquent reflection of the \nHawaiian value of ``aloha aina,'' which means love for the land, which \nserves as a foundation for the culture of Hawaii's indigenous peoples; \nthe Native Hawaiians. The profound appreciation for Hawaiian culture \nand its values is reflected in Hawaii's state motto, 'Ua mau ke'ea `o \nka `aina `i ka pono, ``the life of the land is perpetuated in its \nrighteousness.'' The exhibition celebrates Hawaii's culture and people \nin telling the story of Kaho'olawe.\n  Ancient chants--plaintive and poetic oral histories of Hawaii--along \nwith archaeological evidence indicate that Kaho'olawe was inhabited by \nNative Hawaiians who fished and farmed in coastal and upland \nsettlements scattered across the island. In ancient times, the island \nwas referred to as Kanaloa for the god of the ocean and the foundations \nof the earth.\n  From 1941 to 1994, Kaho'olawe and its surrounding waters were under \nthe control of the United States Navy. Both the island and the waters \nof Kaho'olawe were used as a live-fire training range. In 1990, \nPresident George Bush directed the Department of Defense to cease using \nthe island of Kaho'olawe as a training range. In 1993, Congress enacted \nlegislation that recognized the cultural significance of Kaho'olawe, \nrequired its return to the State of Hawaii, and directed the Navy to \nconduct unexploded ordnance cleanup and environmental restoration in \npartnership with the State of Hawaii. Congress authorized Federal \nfunding through 2003 for the cleanup of Kaho'olawe. We continue to work \nwith the Navy to ensure that this funding is utilized for maximum \ncleanup of the island before access is turned over to the State of \nHawaii in late 2003.\n  The restoration of Kaho'olawe is more than the cleanup of ordnance. \nNative Hawaiians also referred to Kaho'olawe as ``Ko Hema Lamalama,'' \nthe Southern Beacon, in reference to the island's use as a navigational \naid, or shining beacon, for long-distance voyagers returning to Hawaii. \nFor many Hawaiians, the vision of a fully restored Kaho'olawe serves as \na guiding light to the revitalization of Native Hawaiian culture.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues and their staff to visit this \nexhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building. \nI always welcome\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nthe opportunity to share the true essence of Hawaii with my colleagues \nand our fellow citizens on the U.S. mainland. We have the honor and \nprivilege of showing you a bit of Hawaii in Washington, DC, until \nSeptember 2, 2002, and I invite you to share in this wonderful \nexperience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5267-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 625, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 625) to provide Federal assistance to States and \n     local jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Biden) amendment No. 3807, to provide reliable \n     officers, technology, education, community prosecutors, and \n     training in our neighborhoods.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me begin on a point of common ground. \nWe can--each and every one of us--agree that the actions constituting \nhate crimes are wrong in all respects. Let me state, unequivocally, \nthat as much as we condemn all crimes, a hate crime can be more \nsinister than a non-hate crime. And let me state, with equal conviction \nand clarity, that I care about stamping out hate crimes as much as any \nmember of this body. I think everybody know that.\n  A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but in order to \nsend a message of hatred to an entire community is appropriately \npunished more harshly, or in a different manner, than other crimes. \nThis is especially true when the targeted community is defined on the \nbasis of immutable traits. The brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, \nTX, and Matthew Shepard, in Laramie, WY, among others, remain seared \ninto our Nation's conscience because of the savagery they suffered \nsolely because of their attackers' irrational and hateful prejudice. \nThe worse a criminal's motive, the worse the crime, and a unanimous \nSupreme Court recognized as much in upholding Wisconsin's sentencing \nenhancement for hate crimes. These same considerations also prompted \nthe U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish a sentencing guideline that \nprovides an enhanced sentence for a Federal defendant whose crime was \nmotivated by hate. These decisions are ones we can all applaud.\n  Not only are the offenses themselves worse, but hate crimes also are \nmore likely to provoke retaliatory crimes. They inflict deep, lasting \nand distinct injuries--some of which never heal--on victims and their \nfamily members. They incite community unrest. And, at bottom, they are \ndownright un-American. The melting pot of America is the most \nsuccessful multiethnic, multiracial, and multfaith country in all of \nrecorded history. We should keep our proud heritage of diversity in \nmind as we consider the atrocities routinely sanctioned in other \ncountries committed against persons entirely on the basis of their \nracial, ethnic, or religious identity.\n\n  So we all should be able to agree that the battle against hate crimes \nis and must be America's fight. And despite the often contentious \npartisan rhetoric surrounding the issue of Federal hate crimes \nlegislation, there exists widespread agreement on these fundamental \npoints: Hate crimes are insidiously harmful, they should be vigorously \nprosecuted, and the Federal Government has a role to play in reducing \nthe incidence of these crimes in our Nation. The dispute, then, centers \nnot on whether Congress should act in this area, but rather on what \nshould be done at the national level.\n  There is no dispute that hate crimes themselves often involve \nparticularly horrific facts. They rivet our attention and move us to \nconsider almost any measure that would appear to check such bigotry. \nBut the proposed legislation introduced by my good friend from \nMassachusetts, S. 625, also brings us face to face with the foundations \nof our constitutional structure--namely, bedrock principles of \nFederalism that, for more than 2 centuries, have vested States with the \nprimary responsibility for prosecuting violent crimes committed within \ntheir boundaries. And on this point we must be crystal clear: every \nhate crime--every bit of criminal conduct that S. 625 proposes to \nfederalize--is, and always has been, a crime in every jurisdiction \nthroughout our Nation. The question is not whether these crimes can be \nprosecuted, but who should prosecute them under our constitutional \nframework.\n\n  In other words, S. 625 brings us to a difficult intersection between \nour well-intentioned desire to investigate, prosecute, and, hopefully, \nend these vicious crimes, and our unequivocal duty to respect the \nconstitutional boundaries governing any legislative action that we \ntake. We, who are trusted with the awesome responsibility of making our \nNation's laws, must scrupulously abide by the rule of law in this \nprocess. Congress has a duty to make sure that the legislation it \nenacts is constitutional. To shrug off that duty is more than just \nnegligent; it invites trouble and may even solicit scorn. A Supreme \nCourt Justice for whom I have the greatest respect, Justice Scalia, \nsaid the following just a few years ago:\n\n       My court is fond of saying that acts of Congress come to \n     the court with a presumption of constitutionality. But if \n     Congress is going to take the attitude that it will do \n     anything it can get away with, and let the Supreme Court \n     worry about the Constitution, perhaps the presumption is \n     unwarranted.\n\n  So, while all of us would agree that hate crimes are a problem with \nwhich Congress must deal, our focus must be on the appropriate and \nconstitutional means to best accomplish that objective.\n  In the face of some of the recent hate crimes that have riveted \npublic attention--and have unfortunately made the name James Byrd \nsynonymous with Jasper, TX; and the name Matthew Shepard synonymous \nwith Laramie, WY--I am committed in my view that the Senate must speak \nout and act against hate crimes.\n\n  I have long been on record with my view that the Federal Government \ncan play a valuable role in responding to hate crime. In fact, I \nsponsored the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990. But any Federal \nresponse--to be a meaningful and lasting one--must abide by the \nconstitutional limitations imposed on Congress, and be cognizant of the \nlimitations on Congress's enumerated powers that are routinely enforced \nby the courts. I was a prime sponsor of that bill, and I am proud that \nI was. It was a bill with a lot of controversy at the time. This is \nmore true today than it would have been even a mere decade ago--ever \nsince the U.S. Supreme Court revisited the Federalism doctrine in a \nstring of decisions beginning in 1992.\n  Having consistently checked the expansion of Federal jurisdiction in \nareas traditionally reserved to the States over the past decade, the \nSupreme Court has cast grave doubt over the legitimacy of S. 625. I am \nnot alone in believing that this bill, if passed into law, will be \nstruck down as an unconstitutional invasion into States' rights. I take \nno pleasure in holding this view. In fact, I was the primary co-sponsor \nof the Violence Against Women Act of 1994--a law that created Federal \njurisdiction over certain serious acts of violence directed at women. \nSenator Biden was a prime sponsor as well and deserves an awful lot of \nthe credit for that particular bill. I felt strongly about that \nlegislation, and I certainly was not happy to see the Supreme Court \nstrike down a portion of that law as unconstitutional. But I respect, \nas we all must, the Supreme Court's ruling, and we have a duty to take \nits lesson to heart--whether or not we personally like them.\n\n  So there is a serious constitutional concern with S. 625. But, in the \nfrightening climate of terrorism that we live in today, there is a \npractical consideration that we also cannot ignore. We must ask \nourselves what role our Federal law enforcement agencies should play in \nviolent crimes that historically have been prosecuted by State and \nlocal officials. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently has \ncommitted a large number of its agents to work exclusively on terrorism \ncases. The FBI has shifted its focus away from the investigation of \ngeneral crimes to the\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\nprotection of our homeland security. In my view, this is a step in the \nright direction. I sincerely hope that everybody in this body, and both \nbodies, can all agree about that.\n  Now, more than ever, we can see the line between what is truly \nnational and what is truly local. The question is not just what can we \ndo, but rather, how should we allocate our scarce Federal resources? \nAnd what message will we be sending the FBI--who has committed to focus \non terrorism--by passing, as historians will no doubt conclude, the \ngreatest expansion of Federal power over crimes traditionally \nprosecuted by State and local governments?\n  I have given a great deal of personal thought to this matter in \nattempting to create a Federal response to hate crimes that would be as \neffective as possible without implicating the very serious concerns \ncreated by S. 625. The amendment I intend to propose before this matter \nis over is one that I believe would not only solve the problem \neffectively and pragmatically, but also has the virtue of resting on \nunquestionably sound constitutional ground.\n\n  I care deeply about this issue and am committed to a strong, \nworkable, practical, and constitutional Federal solution. It is \nprecisely because of my commitment to this issue that--in the 2 years \nsince this issue last came to the Senate--I have changed certain \naspects of my amendment to strengthen the Federal Government's role in \nthe investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. So, while S. 625 \nremains in precisely the same form as it was when it was offered as an \namendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill in June \n2000--despite the concerns that were raised about its scope and \nconstitutionality--I have worked to change my proposal to make it more \naggressive and more acceptable to the supporters of S. 625.\n  There are two main components to my amendment. First, I would propose \ncreating a meaningful partnership between the Federal Government and \nthe States in combating hate crimes. My amendment would permit the \nJustice Department to assist State and local authorities in \ninvestigating and prosecuting hate crimes by providing Federal manpower \nas well as financial assistance. The original version of my amendment \nhad capped the amount of Federal grants at $100,000 per case, but the \nversion I propose today removes that ceiling when the need is greater. \nMy amendment contains a completely new provision that would require the \nAttorney General to designate one Federal prosecutor in every district \nto act as the Federal liaison for the State and local prosecutions of \nhate crimes. That Federal prosecutor, will take an active role in \nhelping States prosecute hate crimes, from seeking Federal wiretaps to \nFederal search warrants. There simply is no reason to believe that \nState and local law enforcement officials could not prosecute these \nsorts of cases effectively with the type of Federal assistance that my \namendment provides.\n\n  My amendment directly remedies the primary concern of those who \nadvocate broad Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes. Such a broad \npower grab is required, the argument goes, because State and local \njurisdictions often lack adequate funding or resources to effectively \nprosecute hate crimes. While the record would seem to indicate that \nStates have effectively shouldered the oar on prosecuting hate crimes, \nI certainly accept the fact that such highly publicized prosecutions \nmight strain a smaller community's resources. My amendment directly \ncures that potential problem without displacing States from their \ntraditional role in law enforcement.\n  Let us not fail to note that the overwhelming successful record of \nlocal prosecutions of hate crimes--many in jurisdictions where the \ndeath penalty not only was available, but also played a central role in \nsecuring justice--should stand as a testament to the fact that \nwholesale Federal intervention is not warranted. There has never been a \nshowing that State and local law enforcement officials have been \nignoring or neglecting--much less intentionally failing--their duty to \nprosecute these heinous offenses. The truth seems quite to the \ncontrary. State and local authorities effectively investigated \nand prosecuted those who perpetrated the reprehensible murders of \nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. No Amount of federalization--much \nless the measures called for in S. 625--would have made these \npersecutions any more successful.\n\n  This raises a point that I frankly find somewhat puzzling. During the \nlast floor debates on this issue, Senators Kennedy, Durbin, my good \nfriend, and Senator Reid from Nevada--good people who I know genuinely \ncare about this issue--kept bringing up the tragic cases of Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd as reasons to support S. 625. Yet those \noffenders were prosecuted efficiently and effectively and, in my view, \nappropriately with the death penalty, which was actually the sentence \nimposed on two of the killers of James Byrd. That is something that \njust couldn't happen under S. 625, which doesn't even provide for the \npossibility of the death penalty. So, if anything, the Matthew Shepard \nand James Byrd cases stand as testament to the fact that federalization \nof hate crimes is both unwarranted and in the case of S. 625, less \neffective than current state laws.\n  In any event, before we take the decidedly broad step of making every \ncriminal offense motivated by hatred a Federal crime, we ought to equip \nStates and localities with the resources necessary so that they can \nundertake these criminal investigations and prosecutions on their own.\n  The second major component of my amendment proposes to define the \nproblem more precisely. Before we swing a broadsword into the \nconstitutionally sensitive area of States' rights, we ought to consider \ncarefully whether a scalpel might do the trick. There is a pile of raw \ndata that has been collected pursuant to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics \nAct, including a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--\nsome with hate crime laws, others without. We need to undertake a \ncomprehensive analysis of that data to determine whether there is, in \nfact, a problem in certain States' prosecution of hate crimes.\n\n  Some 45 States and the District of Columbia already have enacted hate \ncrimes laws, and by any measure, they are aggressively and effectively \nprosecuting these cases. I am certainly open to being persuaded that \nthe States are failing to prosecute these crimes. But neither S. 625 \nnor the record developed in support of this legislation appear to make \nsuch a case. Analyzing the statistics that already exist to see whether \nthere is a real, verifiable problem with state and local enforcement of \nhate crimes is a simple, efficient and responsible first step that we, \nas lawmakers, should take before enacting such sweeping legislation.\n\n  In sum, we have widespread agreement that the Federal Government must \nplay a role in our Nation's efforts against hate crimes. The role we \ndefine must also respect the Constitution and the structure of our \ngovernment--a structure that, since the inception of our country, \nassigns to the States the primary role in criminal law enforcement.\n  Rather than take a precipitous step that would potentially make every \ncriminal offense motivated by a hatred a Federal offense, we should \nequip States and localities with the resources necessary to undertake \nthese criminal investigations and prosecutions on their own. At the \nsame time, we should undertake a comprehensive analysis of the raw data \nthat has been collected pursuant to the 1990 act.\n  My amendment is a measured legislative response that would accomplish \nthe goal of letting no hate crime go unpunished--without bearing any \nrisk of being struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It \nis legislation that could and probably would pass into law. We know \nthat S. 625, as written has no chance of enactment. The House will not \ntake this amendments. It simply has too many problems. I hope it is not \npresented just for political reasons. Instead of having a political \nissue, we should take a realistic and responsible step toward \naddressing this problem, which would be passing my version of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, as we know, on Friday, immediately after calling up S. \n625, the hate crimes bill, the Democratic leadership filed for cloture. \nThis was done for the sole reason of thwarting any meaningful debate on \na bill that seeks to overhaul and expand thoroughly the role the \nFederal Government plays in law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly that Senator Kennedy's bill, S. 625, is an \nimportant piece of legislation that deserves consideration in the \nSenate. In the past, I too have introduced competing legislation \naddressing hate crimes. As someone who has remained as involved in this \nissue as Senator Kennedy, at a minimum, I deserve the opportunity to \noffer amendments relevant to the discussion of hate crimes and to \nimprove this bill. I believe my amendments will in fact improve this \nbill as it reads currently. Moreover, I believe that a majority of my \ncolleagues not only want to consider these amendments, I believe they \nwould approve of my amendments.\n  Protecting the safety and rights of all Americans is of paramount \nconcern to all Senators. There are, however, many thoughts as to how to \nprovide this protection. No one is threatening to filibuster this bill. \nMy colleagues and I are honestly trying to force a debate on an issue \nthat affects all Americans. It is curious to me why the Democrats are \ntrying to prevent a substantive debate on hate crimes from going \nforward. By preventing amendments from being offered and considered, \nthe Democrats are shutting the door on any Republican ideas or \nalternatives, however constructive they may be.\n  All Senators have the right to consider thoughtfully legislation that \nwill impact significantly how serious crimes are prosecuted in this \ncountry. By filing for closure prematurely, the Democratic leadership \nis prohibiting Senators the right to debate and have a vote on issues \nthat are important to them and the constituents of their States. It is \nunconscionable to prevent debate on such an important issue. I ask the \nDemocratic leadership to rethink this position, and I ask Senators to \noppose cloture and allow us to consider a reasonable amount of \namendments to improve this bill.\n  I will certainly make every effort to keep the amount of those \namendments very limited so that this particular debate does not have to \ngo on and on. I hope we will be able to get that done. I noticed S. 625 \nnot only substantially expands current authority over hate crimes, it \nadds a number of provisions over what we had at least attempted to do \nbefore.\n  Under current Federal law, it is important to note that it is \nunlawful to injure, intimidate, or interfere with any person because of \nhis or her race, color, religion or national origin. That is the law \ntoday. That has been upheld as constitutional. If the person is \nparticipating in certain federally protected activities such as \nattending school, serving as a juror, traveling in interstate commerce, \nusing public accommodations, or working, that person is protected \nagainst injury, intimidation, or interference because of race, color, \nreligion or national origin.\n  Since 1994, Federal law has required a heavier sentence for persons \nconvicted of hate crimes. We have already gone a long way to do that.\n  We will put in the Record before this debate is over some of the \nstatistics that have been presented as to whether or not hate crimes, \nas defined narrowly, are really a significant percentage of crimes that \nare committed in this country. My attitude is, if one is committed, it \nis a significant percentage, but we have to be practical as well. It \nseems to me, since there is no showing--at least there has not been up \nto this date--that the State and local law enforcement jurisdictions \nare failing to prosecute hate crimes and prosecute them with vigor, it \nseems to me we are going too far with S. 625.\n  I hope our colleagues will pay attention. I think we could really \nwind up not doing as much against hate crimes as we could if we would \nmake a real effort to try to bring both bodies together. I would like \nto get this problem solved once and for all, and I would like to do it \nin a way the vast majority of us can support because I think the vast \nmajority of Members of Congress will support a reasonably written, \neffective hate crime statute that does not take away the \nresponsibilities of the State and local governments and law enforcement \npeople to prosecute these matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah, this legislation has already passed the House--232 Members \nvoted for it; in the Senate, 61, almost identical legislation.\n  The question was raised as to why there was an effort made to move \nforward on cloture on this bill. We have lots of things to do. When it \nwas reported in the Congressional Quarterly last Friday morning that \nthey, the Republicans, were going to file 40 to 50 amendments just to \nslow down the train on this legislation, and they had a wide range of \nsubject matters on all the amendments they were going to file, none of \nwhich were related to this hate crime legislation, the majority leader \nfelt we had to move on. That is why the cloture motion was filed.\n  I also say to my friend, the former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, someone who is certainly knowledgeable of things legal in \nnature, if cloture is invoked, there is still every opportunity, up to \n30 hours, to file any germane amendments. I would say if the Senator \nwants to improve this legislation, it would have to be with germane \namendments, not nongermane amendments. So I hope we can move along. I \nhope cloture is invoked. The majority leader would be happy to work \nwith the Republicans to come up with legislation they believe is \nbetter. But this is a matter that has already moved in both bodies of \nCongress. We should move forward with it.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3807 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw amendment No. 3807.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nnow withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak to this legislation. \nFirst of all, I compliment the ranking member on the Judiciary \nCommittee for the points he made, with which I am in agreement. Recall, \nthis bill federalizes two new hate crimes, adding gender and sexual \norientation and disability to existing law. It is a far-reaching \nproposal.\n  I am sorry, I cannot accept the excuse that has just been proffered \nby the assistant majority leader with respect to why cloture was filed \non this bill some 14 minutes after the bill was brought to the Senate \nfloor. This is unprecedented. With all due respect, I characterize it \nas a gag rule on Senators, unprecedented in the way the Senate \nordinarily, traditionally acts.\n  As a matter of comity to Members, it is traditional that Members are \nallowed to debate and offer amendments to legislation. Only rarely is \ncloture filed--ordinarily, after there has been an attempt to \nfilibuster a bill. The majority then rightly has the opportunity to \nbring that debate to a close if enough Members are in agreement to do \nso. It is very rare cloture motions would be filed immediately after \nbringing the bill to the floor. This does not give Members enough time \nto debate the bill or offer amendments and have those amendments voted \nupon. The reason proffered by the distinguished Senator from Nevada was \nthat they had read in a publication that Republican Senators intended \nto file some 40 amendments to the bill. I suggest that is not \nappropriate as a reason for immediately invoking cloture. To my \nknowledge, it has never been done when the Republican majority \nintroduced bills to the floor.\n  I remember on one occasion a cloture motion was filed almost \nimmediately and there was a great hue and cry from the other side, as a \nresult of which my recollection is the Republican majority, by \nunanimous consent, extended the time for debate an additional day.\n  It is, frankly, a breach of the comity that heretofore has \ncharacterized the opportunity for debate in this body, to file that \ncloture motion some 14 minutes after the bill was brought to the \nfloor--especially because this is such controversial legislation. The \ntwo votes that previously were cast here were like 50 to 49, and I have \nforgotten exactly what the other vote was, but this is a highly \ncontentious issue and one which deserves a great deal of thought and \ndebate. I, therefore, am very hopeful our colleagues--whether they \nagree with the ultimate legislation or not--will agree it is simply \nunfair to close off debate and amendments at this very early stage of \nthe consideration of such important legislation.\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\n  One reason the Senate should not rush to consideration of this bill \nis because of the very controversial change that it makes to \ncriminalize not a defendant's actions alone, but the defendant's \nthought process. Think about this for a minute. This legislation \nfocuses not on the defendant's conduct, or even on his intent--on \nwhether he acted purposefully or with knowledge of risk. Rather, this \nbill criminalizes the defendant's subjective motive. We are moving \nperilously close, down the path of creating a penalty for thought \ncrimes.\n  This is not as distant as you might think, considering, for example, \nthe FBI data that is used by advocates of hate crimes laws to justify \nthis bill. In 1999, they report there was a total of 9,430 hate crimes \nin the United States. Of these, only 19 were murders. By far, the \nlargest category of actual hate crimes against persons, including \nproperty crimes and crimes against society, was the crime of \nintimidation. Yet this crime is so vague and so inchoate that the FBI \ndoes not even bother to calculate incidents of intimidation in its \noverall crime reports.\n  What exactly does intimidation mean? Does it simply mean something \nthat is perceived as offensive by the hearer? Some groups, in fact, \nincreasingly invoke terms such as ``hostile speech'' or ``climate of \nviolence'' to describe speech in favor of traditional morality on \nsocial and sexual issues. Would a traditional viewpoint on \nhomosexuality or transsexualism be hostile speech and thus a hate \ncrime? It very likely could be under the definitions here.\n  One organization, the largest organization of women in the country, \nthe Concerned Women for America, has cited an example of a pastor in \nNew York whose billboard advertisement with a Bible verse on it was \ntaken down by city officials who cited hate crimes principles as the \nrationale. The CWA also cites a recent incident in San Francisco. The \nboard of supervisors officially approved a resolution urging local \nmedia not to run an advertisement by a group.\n  Again, even those who do not agree with the message of traditional \nvalues should at least recognize these groups' right to be heard and to \nexercise their first amendment right of speech. With this type of \nlegislation, we risk criminalizing this speech.\n  In addition, it is wrong to treat some victims of violent crimes as \nmore special than others. All victims of violent crime should be equal \nin the eye of the law. When such a crime occurs, the police should not \nfirst have to ask, for example, what the victim's race, religion, or \nsexual preference is. Nor do the 19 murders classified as hate crimes \nin the year 2000 nor the 17 in 1999 provide much justification for the \nlegislation when more than 15,000 other murders occurred each year--all \ncrimes under State law. It is not as if we have to add this crime in \norder to assure there is punishment for people who commit violence.\n  Congress should be concerned about all of these victims, not about \njust a subset constituting one-tenth of 1 percent of the total. Yet \nthat is what we spend our time on in this body.\n  I note that one of the bill's provisions attempts to justify or \nprovide a constitutional rationale for the bill. I note that section 2 \nstates that Congress has found ``the incidence of violence motivated by \nthe actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \nsexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a serious \nnational problem'' and that the ``prominent characteristic of a violent \ncrime motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \nvictim and family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages the \ncommunity sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected.''\n  I would like to focus on that in two respects.\n  First of all, it says this is a national problem. But I note that not \nall national problems are Federal problems. People are murdered every \nday in this country. That is a national problem. But States provide the \nlaws under which people are prosecuted, and it is ordinarily by a local \nor county prosecutor. In other words, not every national problem is a \nFederal problem.\n  As I will note later, no less than the Chief Justice of the United \nStates has warned Congress against federalizing every crime and finding \na Federal solution to every national problem.\n  But even more important is the suggestion that only certain kinds of \ncrime victims ought to be of concern to us. It said here that this kind \nof crime devastates not just the actual victim but frequently savages--\nand I am not exactly sure what the word ``savages'' means--the \ncommunity sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected. I \npresume that is the class of victims--people such as the victim.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, Senator Feinstein and I have \nhad a constitutional amendment before this body for several years to \ngrant rights to victims of crime. We have argued all of these years \nthat victims of violent crime feel themselves frequently savaged by a \nsystem which gives a lot of rights to the defendant but, at best, \nignores their rights, and sometimes actually results in them being \nvictimized a second time by the judicial system by not getting notice \nof key hearings and procedures in which they would have an interest in \nattending, or by not even being able to sit in the courtroom sometimes. \nThis clearly is activity that savages the community that has been \nvictimized.\n  Anybody who has been a victim of domestic violence can empathize with \nthe other victims of domestic violence. I have gone to many meetings at \na lot of centers at which women who have been abused are sitting in a \ncircle sharing their experiences in order that they be able to cope \nwith and eventually rise above the problem and to understand that they \nthemselves are not the cause of the crime that has been perpetrated \nagainst them. They are savaged, all right. They are a group of people \nto whom we ought to be paying attention. Yet we can't get the support \nin this body to grant them the rights that are at least somewhat equal \nto the rights of the accused perpetrators of the crimes upon them. The \nnumerous constitutional amendments which have granted defendants rights \nshould at least be equal in the constitutional rights of these victims \nof crimes.\n  I am going to state this in a rather blunt way. It seems to me to be \ninconsistent, at best, for people to be very concerned about a couple \nof specific groups of people--transsexuals or homosexuals, for \nexample--that they would believe that other members of their group \nwould feel savaged when someone else in their group has a crime \nperpetrated upon them but we wouldn't extend that same feeling and that \nsame support and that same kind of action to a vast and much larger \nnumber of people who are victimized by crimes every day and for whom \nthere are no victim's rights. We don't designate them hate crimes, and \ntherefore these people have no such rights. I find it discriminatory.\n  In this Senate body, we never characterize the motives of \nlegislation. It is a very dangerous thing to do, and I resent it. In no \nway do I characterize the motives of anyone offering this particular \namendment. But I ask them to stop and think for a moment about whether \nit is fair to single out a very small group of people who have a very \nlarge lobbying voice for special protection as victims of hate crimes \nbecause the group they are a part of feels savaged when they are the \nvictim of a crime. That is the Federal nexus. That is the basis upon \nwhich the constitutionality of this action rests, and I submit it is \ninadequate under our Constitution. But that is the alleged basis. We \nwill do it there, but we will not give rights to the vast majority of \npeople who are victims of violent crime in this society.\n  Do we not believe or do we not understand that they feel savaged as \nwell? Is their lobbying voice just not as strong? I don't know what it \nis. But it is unfair.\n  Let me turn to two other points before I close.\n  It is obvious to me from the legislative history--I am not elaborate \nat this point but just to note this--that using the word ``gender'' \nrather than ``sex'' is a very intentional and very specific choice of \nwords. The bill is intended to take the unprecedented step of making \ntranssexuals and transvestites a federally protected class. There are \nthose who think this is a good idea. I cannot imagine what the \nFounders--the people who wrote our Constitution--would think of such a \nprovision. But I believe Congress should accept that not all\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nhuman impulses are necessarily healthy, that not every desire should be \npursued, and that, in any event, these kinds of activities should not \nbe singled out as constitutionally protected given the large number of \npeople in this country who have very different points of view of what \nis right and wrong. We single out minority action I gather as being \nconstitutionally protected because we are concerned about what the \nmajority would do. In so doing, I believe we pervert the language of \nthe Constitution.\n  That gets to the next point: the constitutional overreach of this \nbill. The bill is almost certainly unconstitutional and beyond \nCongress's powers. The first new offense, justified as an exercise of \nCongress's 13th amendment power to outlaw the incidents of slavery, \nfails because it is not tied to the exercise of civil rights or access \nto public accommodations. The second new offense, justified under the \ncommerce clause, goes too far when it punishes noneconomic violent \ncrime simply because of the use of a weapon that has allegedly traveled \nin interstate commerce.\n  The bill also unnecessarily contributes to Congress's federalization \nof criminal law--a point to which I alluded earlier and on which I said \nI would expand. This is a process that places great burdens on our \nFederal courts and undermines their role as a forum for addressing \nuniquely Federal issues.\n  I mention the Chief Justice of the United States, Justice Rehnquist. \nHe has repeatedly warned the Congress against unnecessarily creating \nnew Federal criminal offenses, especially where the matter has \ntraditionally been addressed and can be addressed by State courts. The \nChief Justice expounded on this problem in his 1998 Year-End Report of \nthe Federal Judiciary. I believe this is important enough to quote at \nlength.\n  He said:\n\n       The number of cases brought to the Federal courts is one of \n     the most serious problems facing them today. Criminal case \n     filings in Federal courts rose 15 percent in 1998--nearly \n     tripling the 5.2 percent increase in 1997. Over the last \n     decade, Congress has contributed significantly to the \n     rising caseload by continuing to federalize crimes already \n     covered by state laws.\n\n  The trend to federalize crimes that traditionally have been handled \nin state courts not only is taxing the Judiciary's resources and \naffecting its budget needs, but it also threatens to change entirely \nthe nature of our federal system. The pressure in Congress to appear \nresponsive to every highly publicized societal ill or sensational crime \nneeds to be balanced with an inquiry into whether states are doing an \nadequate job in these particular areas and, ultimately, whether we want \nmost of our legal relationships decided at the national rather than \nlocal level. Federal courts were not created to adjudicate local \ncrimes, no matter how sensational or heinous the crimes may be. State \ncourts do, can, and should handle such problems. While there certainly \nare areas in criminal law in which the federal government must act, the \nvast majority of localized criminal cases should be decided in the \nstate courts which are equipped for such matters. This principle was \nenunciated by Abraham Lincoln in the 19th century, and Dwight \nEisenhower in the 20th century--matters that can be handled adequately \nby the states should be left to them; matters that cannot be so handled \nshould be undertaken by the federal government.\n  As is very clear by the language of the statute itself, that is not \nthe test used for determining whether or not prosecutions will be held \nby the Federal Government for these crimes.\n  The Federal courts are already overwhelmed with existing Federal \noffenses, at the same time that this Senate is dragging its feet on \nfilling the Federal court vacancies that currently exist, or even \nholding votes on new judges. Yet here we go creating a whole new set of \nFederal offenses for crimes that are already proscribed by State law. \nNo doubt the Federal judiciary is watching this debate and thinking to \nitself, about the Congress, ``there they go again.''\n  It bears emphasis that the States not only already punish the crimes \nwe are dealing with here as violent crimes; in addition, 45 States and \nthe District of Columbia already have laws punishing hate crimes. What \nwe are doing is creating a double redundancy, a new Federal offense for \nhate crimes that are already punished in two different ways at the \nState level.\n  Nor is it fair to accuse the States of inadequately enforcing their \nlaws in this area. For example, consider the first and third incidents \ncited in the committee report for this bill involving murder in \nHumboldt, NE, and in Yosemite Park, CA. The committee report relies on \nthese incidents to supposedly show the need for a new Federal law. But \nwhat these incidents show, instead, is how this law is unnecessary and \nredundant. Indeed, it would punish these offenses less severely than \nthey have been punished under State law.\n  In the Nebraska crime, prosecutors sought and obtained the death \npenalty. In the Yosemite case, they are currently seeking the death \npenalty. Yet had either of these offenses instead been prosecuted under \nthe law envisioned by this bill, the death penalty would not have been \nan option. The bill provides for no death penalty, even for the most \nbrutal murders. And we call this an appropriate reaction to something \nwe detest so much, something we call a hate crime, that we are willing \nto bend the Constitution to make it a new Federal offense.\n  The death penalty would not have been available under this bill, \neither as a deterrent or as leverage to secure a life sentence during \nplea bargaining, which is frequently why the death penalty can be \nsuccessful. So why do we need a Federal law to provide less punishment \nthan is already available under State law?\n\n  Finally, this bill would explicitly allow the same defendant to be \npunished twice for the same crime, based solely on a Federal official's \ndetermination that the State sentence that the defendant is already \nserving has somehow left Federal interests ``unvindicated.''\n  Although the Supreme Court has been willing to ignore such double \nprosecutions, Congress, at least, should recognize the unfairness of \nallowing a defendant to be tried twice punished twice, by two different \ncourts, for the same crime.\n  Since I see my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin in the Chamber, \nand because I have such respect for him, for the sense of fairness that \nhe has exhibited over and over in the Judiciary Committee, on which we \nboth sit, while I know he is an ardent supporter of the legislation, I \nwould just ask him, and other colleagues, with whom I have had good \ndealings over the years, to acknowledge the fact that it is \ninappropriate for us to have debate on this important matter cut off so \nsoon after the filing of the bill--14 minutes after the bill was \nbrought to the floor, cloture was invoked--to have very little \nopportunity to present amendments and to have the nature of those \namendments restricted.\n  I could be wrong, but I have been told by staff that even making \nthese crimes' punishment subject to the death penalty would be ruled \nnot germane. I cannot believe that. But if that is true, it shows you \nhow restrictive the cloture rule would be.\n  I would ask my colleague, and any others who are supporters of this \nbill, to consider, on something so important, that we should not be \ninvoking cloture so soon in the process but should allow those of us \nwho have constructive suggestions--as in the case of the alternative \nmentioned by the Senator from Utah--that those of us who have \namendments, including those which I would like to offer, to have an \nopportunity to debate and offer those amendments, and have them acted \nupon in the way that has traditionally been done in this body.\n  If it is the case, as the distinguished assistant majority leader \nsaid, that we have a lot of other business that we need to get to, then \nmaybe we should not have brought this particular bill at this time. If \nit is so important, then we need to have the time to debate it. If it \ntakes a back seat to issues that are more important, then we should not \nhave brought it up at this point. I do not think we can have it both \nways.\n  I would ask my colleagues for the same kind of fairness that has been \noffered to them when the majority was held by another party, and to \ngive us more time to debate and consider amendments on this \nlegislation, and not to proceed with cloture at such an early time in \nthe legislative process.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis kind words. I am in the Chamber with regard to another matter, but \nI look forward to discussing this issue at a later time.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I join my colleagues today to speak in \nsupport of S. 625, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act.\n  In every corner of our country, communities have been trying to \nrespond to hate crimes. Despite great gains in equality and civil \nrights throughout the last century, too many Americans are subjected to \ndiscrimination, violence, and even death because of who they are. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation has documented over 8,000 incidences of \ncrime motivated by bias in the United States in 2000. Crimes motivated \nby the victim's race, color, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, \nnational origin, disability, or gender. These crimes attack the values \nand rights of every American, yet today there is no federal law \nstopping these crimes.\n  Passing the bill before us will give us more tools to fight this \nspecial brand of crime. I am pleased to join with many of my colleagues \nas a co-sponsor of this important legislation. The legislation we are \nconsidering would expand the definition of a hate crime and improve \nprosecution of those who act out ``their hate'' with violence. If \nsomeone harms any person because of the victim's race, gender, \nethnicity, color, religion, national origin, disability or sexual \norientation, they will be punished.\n  It is important to note that the prosecutor would still have to \nconvince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal act was \nmotivated by prejudice, and states would be involved in helping to \ndetermine whether a defendant would be charged with a Federal hate \ncrime. The bill would also importantly require the FBI to document and \nreport hate crimes committed against women.\n  Previously the FBI was only required to collect data from crimes \ncommitted because of a person's race, religion, sexual orientation, \ndisability and ethnicity. This bill will allow us to know the ``who,'' \n``what'' and ``why'' so we can work to end these crimes against women.\n  I know some of my colleagues have argued that the states are doing an \nadequate job of handling hate crimes on their own, and I commend the \nStates for their efforts, but I believe the Federal government has an \nimportant role in this as well. At the Federal level, we already \nprosecute many crimes that are motivated by prejudice. We need to \nstrengthen these Federal hate crimes laws and increase the role of the \nfederal government in ending this violence.\n  It wasn't that many years ago that we stood up for equality and \njustice by forcing the States and private citizens to end segregation \nand discrimination. Now we must do the same for hate crimes against our \ncitizens.\n  Madam President, we are a Nation of laws. We are a Nation that \nrespects the individual and individual liberty. We are a Nation that \nrewards hard work. We are a Nation that tolerates and celebrates our \ndiversity. These are some of our most cherished values. We cannot allow \nhate crimes to threaten our fellow citizens and undermine our \ndemocracy. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3824\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3824 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3824.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the penalty section to include the possibility of \n                           the death penalty)\n\n       On page 10, strike line 14 and all that follows through \n     page 11, line 23, and insert the following:\n\n     both;\n       ``(B) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, fined in accordance with this title, or both, if the \n     offense includes kidnaping or an attempt to kidnap, \n     aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated \n     sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill; and\n       ``(C) shall be punished by death or imprisonment for any \n     term of years or for life, or both, if death results from the \n     offense.\n       ``(2) Offenses involving actual or perceived religion, \n     national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Whoever, whether or not acting under \n     color of law, in any circumstance described in subparagraph \n     (B), willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through \n     the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive or incendiary \n     device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, \n     because of the actual or perceived religion, national origin, \n     gender, sexual orientation, or disability of any person--\n       ``(i) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, fined in \n     accordance with this title, or both;\n       ``(ii) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, fined in accordance with this title, or both, if the \n     offense includes kidnaping or an attempt to kidnap, \n     aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated \n     sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill; and\n       ``(iii) shall be punished by death or imprisonment for any \n     term of years or for life, or both, if death results from the \n     offense.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, it remains my view that S. 625 is a \nmisguided invasion into an area historically and constitutionally \nreserved to State and local law enforcement authorities. But let me say \nnow S. 625 is also flawed on its own merits. One of S. 625's most \negregious shortcomings is that while it purports to send a message the \nFederal Government is going to be tough on hate crimes, it actually \nthreatens to weaken the punishment currently available under many State \nlaws for the perpetrators of violent hate crimes.\n  In the successful State and local prosecutions of the killers of \nJames Byrd, Matthew Shepard, and Billy Jack Gaither, prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement officials in Texas, Wyoming, and Alabama were able to \nconsider seeking the death penalty. So they did. Let's pause to \nconsider why they did so.\n  James Byrd, who was African American, was beaten unconscious, chained \nto the back of a pickup truck, and dragged 4 miles down rural roads by \nmen who had links to a white supremacist group.\n  Billy Jack Gaither, who was gay, was bludgeoned with an axe handle, \nhad his throat slit, and then was thrown on a pile of tires and set on \nfire by men who cited Gaither's sexual orientation as their motivation \nfor the killing.\n  Matthew Shepard, who was gay, was kidnapped, beaten so severely that \nhis skull was fractured a half dozen times, tied to a fencepost, and \nleft to die by two men who hated homosexuals.\n  I have no hesitation in concluding that State and local officials \nacted appropriately in seeking the death penalty for these most heinous \nof crimes. In the case of James Byrd, they successfully obtained the \ndeath penalty for two of the three defendants. In the case of Matthew \nShepard, the possibility of the death penalty led to an early plea \nbargain that resulted in life sentences for both defendants. And in the \ncase of Billy Jack Gaither, the possibility of the death penalty caused \none of the two defendants to plead guilty and testify for the \nGovernment at the trial, after which he was sentenced to life in \nprison. The other killer was eventually convicted and ultimately \nsentenced to life in prison after the victim's family requested that \nthe death penalty not be imposed.\n  Right now, in a case currently pending in northern California, State \nprosecutors are pursuing capital charges against two brothers charged \nwith murdering a gay couple. And there is more. I could go on. I have \nthree charts that show just some of the hate crimes cases prosecuted by \nState and local prosecutors where the death penalty was used \nsuccessfully.\n  The facts speak for themselves, and I will not go through these cases \none by one. I ask unanimous consent that the crimes noted on these \ncharts be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Victim               Defendant             Jurisdiction              Facts                 Penalty\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJames Byrd...........

Madam President, none of these results--none of these \ndeath-penalty-eligible cases shown on these charts--would have been \npossible under S. 625--not one of them. This legislation, while \nfederalizing hate crimes, would not allow capital punishment for those \nwho murder savagely out of bigotry, prejudice, or hatred. The practical \neffect of S. 625 is to substantially weaken existing State law. In \nfact, even 18 U.S.C. section 245, the current Federal law that \nspecifically addresses hate crimes, provides for the death penalty.\n  It is truly ironic that S. 625's failure to provide for the death \npenalty actually represents a decided benefit to those who would commit \nthese heinous crimes, and it takes away some of law enforcement's most \nimportant pretrial bargaining techniques in order to get one or more \nwitnesses to these crimes to testify or one or more participants to \ntestify against the others. Not only would this legislation undermine \nexisting State laws, but it would substantially weaken their \nprotections and weaken law enforcement's ability to get to the bottom \nof some of these crimes. In consequence, this legislation would be less \nlikely to deter future hate crimes as well as many State laws on the \nbooks today.\n  If we as an institution are serious about addressing the problem of \nhate crimes, then we must permit for the possibility of the death \npenalty as being the appropriate punishment in some of these cases. If \nwe are to take these sorts of cases away from State and local law \nenforcement officials who have been doing such a thorough and effective \njob prosecuting them with the possibility of the death penalty, then \nour Federal prosecutions must be equally well equipped and prepared to \ndo as good a job as State and local officials have done.\n  That is why it would only make sense to support my amendment to \nprovide for the possibility of the death penalty in appropriate cases \nif you support the underlying bill.\n  I noticed the distinguished Senator from Oregon is here, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I have every day put into the \nCongressional Record the details of a hate crime. These are always \nviolent, they are always sickening, but they also happen to an American \ncitizen. They happen sometimes because the victim is black, gay, \ndisabled, female, or even of Middle Eastern descent. And yet they are \nall Americans. So they ought to have the concern of all in the Senate.\n  I wish to speak again on the Senate floor about another crime. It is \ngruesome. It happened just a year ago, and it involved a young Navajo \nboy by the name of Fred Martinez, Jr. He had gone to a local rodeo. He \nwas openly gay; apparently also transgender; again, of Navajo descent. \nHe was found south of Cortez, CO. He had died after being repeatedly \nhit on his head with a rock and left in a small canyon, possibly \nsuffering for an extended period of time before dying.\n  Police investigated this murder as a hate crime. The perpetrator of \nthis crime, who was recently sentenced, allegedly bragged he ``bug-\nsmashed a fag.''\n  The victim's mother told the press that she believes her son was \nkilled because he identified himself as transgender. He occasionally \ndressed as a girl. In the mind of his murderer, Fred deserved to die \nfor such conduct.\n  I believe the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens \nagainst hatred, against the harms that flow from a hate-filled heart. I \nstand in support of the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 \nto make sure that should it ever happen again to a Fred Martinez, or \nanyone else, it will not go unresponded to by law enforcement at every \nlevel. That is really what this bill is about.\n  I have listened to my colleagues and their concerns about this \nlegislation, and I stand to express my disagreement with parts of what \nthey say.\n  What is the role of the Federal Government? Some have suggested that \nwe have no place here, that this is the role of the local and State law \nenforcement. I believe the role of the Federal Government is whatever \nis necessary to make sure that justice is done, not to overtake local \nand State authorities but to help, to contribute, to backstop, to \nprovide resources, to provide skills that sometimes are uniquely had by \nthe Federal Government.\n  I just came from a press conference with Sheriff David O'Malley from \nthe State of Wyoming. He was the local law enforcement official who \npursued and ultimately helped in the prosecution of the murderers of \nMatthew Shepard. It was, frankly, his visit to my office, with the \nmother of Matthew Shepard, Judy Shepard, that persuaded me to take \nanother look at this issue.\n  Sheriff O'Malley made clear to me that he was a conservative \nRepublican, but he was for Federal hate crimes legislation because he \ncould have used the help. The horror of that young man's murder so \ngalvanized national opinion and the focus of the media that their \nlittle Laramie, WY, law enforcement was overwhelmed by the national \nscope of this tragedy. Frankly, they did end up prosecuting it well, \ndoing it right, convicting these murderers, but his point was the \nFederal Government should have been able to show up: We could have used \nthe help.\n  In the case of James Byrd in Texas, another hideous case, where a \nblack man was dragged to death, in that case, because our Federal hate \ncrimes law already covered issues of race, the Federal Government was \nable to show up to work and were exceptionally helpful in the pursuit \nand the prosecution of the murderers of James Byrd.\n  My response then is, what role is there for the Federal Government? \nWhatever role is necessary to assure that justice is done. I would like \nto see the Federal Government show up to work and express the great \nheart and the values of the American people.\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\n  As I listen to some of my colleagues' complaints, I frankly think \nthey make, on occasion, some very valid points. But their point should \nnot be against including gays, gender, and the disabled. Their argument \nis really against the whole category of hate crimes, this Federal law \nwe have had for over 30 years. Since 1968, we have had Federal hate \ncrimes legislation. As I pointed out, it helped in the case of pursuing \nthe murderers of James Byrd. It did not help in the case of Matthew \nShepard.\n  My point to them is, why oppose its expansion? Why don't they go \nafter race, religion, and national origin? If it is good for those \ncategories, why is it not good for these new categories? That is a \nquestion I simply have not yet had answered.\n  Questions as to constitutionality have been raised, and there may be \na point I am missing, but this issue has been fully vetted by the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  In two cases, RBA v. The City of St. Paul, and Wisconsin v. Mitchell, \nthese cases clearly demonstrate that a hate crimes statute may consider \nbias motivation when that motivation is directly connected to a \ndefendant's criminal conduct. We are not going after speech. We are not \ngoing after thought. We are going after conduct.\n  As with any criminal law, in any criminal act there are elements of \nthe crime. This is yet another element. It is not the crime, but it is \nan element in making up the category of the crime. By requiring this \nconnection to criminal activity, these statutes do not chill protected \nspeech and do not violate the first amendment. In Wisconsin v. \nMitchell, the Supreme Court made clear that:\n\n       The First Amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use \n     of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove \n     motive or intent.\n  So it seems clear to me that one can say whatever they want about \ngays, transgenders, and women. They are not prohibited from doing that. \nIf they act on it, that can be an element in determining whether this \nfalls under the Federal hate crimes law.\n  So those who oppose this, I really think their argument is not \ntowards its expansion but against the law as a category itself. So \ntheir amendment should be to get rid of this as a category. I will not \nbe voting for that. I would not suggest anyone do that because I \nbelieve our hate crimes law truly does reflect the big heart of the \nAmerican people. All crime is hateful. That is a given. We grant that. \nBut when an attack is made on a Navajo homosexual boy, and he is \nthereby a part of a crime which victimizes a much larger community, \nwhat is wrong with our saying, as a people, we want every level of \ngovernment--the local, the State and the Federal Government--to help to \npursue and prosecute such crime? I cannot see the problem with it.\n  I think the argument that is being made is against the whole statute \nof hate crimes. It should not be made against gays and lesbians, but it \nis.\n  I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the case of \nMark Bangerter from Boise, ID. He was the victim of a brutal attack, \nand he wrote the Justice Department and asked for help in pursuing \nthose who had been hurtful to him.\n  The Justice Department writes back to him saying:\n\n       Dear Mr. Bangerter: This letter is in response to your \n     report that on April 15, 1998, you were the victim of a \n     vicious attack by an unidentified individual who apparently \n     believed that you were homosexual. According to the \n     information you provided Special Agent Joseph W. Hess, Jr., \n     on May 12, 1998, the attack caused you severe facial injuries \n     and total blindness in your left eye. Your case was \n     thoroughly discussed with the United States Attorney's office \n     in Boise, Idaho, in an effort to explore prosecutive \n     possibilities under existing Federal hate crime laws. I must \n     regrettably inform you that as a result of those discussions, \n     it was determined that sexual orientation does not fall \n     within the listed elements of hate crimes. Therefore, the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation lacks the statutory authority \n     to investigate the attacks against you. I strongly encourage \n     you to recontact the Boise Police Department and request that \n     an investigation be fully conducted. Sincerely yours.\n\n  Had Mr. Bangerter said, please pursue these criminals because I am \nblack, they would have been able to do that. He said, please pursue \nthem because I am gay, and the Federal Government was not able to do \nthat.\n  I think that is wrong, and the overwhelming heart of the American \npeople calls upon us to expand an existing constitutional law and to \ncover these people who, because of their minority status, are more \nlikely victims of crime. Again, if there is a problem with this, it \nsays to the whole category of crime it should not be a problem just \nbecause we would include these newly identified minority groups in \nAmerica; they are certainly deserving of the protection of this law, \nthe values behind this law, which frankly are denied to them now and \nought not to be any longer.\n  I am sorry I have to bring our attention to yet another hate crime in \nthis country, but I suggest it is another reason we ought to act and we \nought to do so quickly.\n  Senator Hatch raises a valid point. I am loathe to see this \nlegislation slowed up. I hope the House will take it up. Perhaps the \npoint he is raising can be resolved then. It is important for this \nSenate to act this week on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, 95 percent of all criminal activities are \nprosecuted by State and local law enforcement and are prosecuted well. \nThat is the way it ought to be done. That is what is expected to be \ndone. Our laws already cover virtually everything, from a civil rights \nstandpoint, that I mentioned earlier today; that is, race, color, \nreligion, and national origin. Do I think gay people ought to be \nattacked, brutalized, and mistreated? Heavens, no. I believe these \nmatters have been taken care of at the State and local law enforcement \nlevels. If they are not, they should be. We should do that. My \namendment that I will offer provides the money, the facilities, and the \nability for the State and local law enforcement people to do it if they \nneed extra help.\n  I do not think a case is made that we should give protective status \nto anyone other than for race, color, religion, or national origin, \nunless we can show that State and local law enforcement is not doing \nits job. If they are not doing the job, I am the first to support, the \nfirst to come out and say nobody should be mistreated. The law should \ncover everyone.\n  I made the point, however, that under current law, the Matthew \nShepard case and the James Byrd case--two of the most flagrant examples \nof vicious, unforgivable conduct--these cases were handled well by \nState and local law enforcement. And, because the prosecutors had the \ndeath penalty to hold over these defendants, these criminals, these \nvicious racists, they were able to force some of the witnesses to \ncooperate, which helped result in a conviction in one of the trials.\n  In the case of Matthew Shepard, they obtained a guilty plea \nimmediately, and thus, preserved judicial resources and saved taxpayers \nextensive amounts of money. The guilty plea was entered into to avoid \nthe death penalty. Having that bargaining tool is a crucial part of law \nenforcement.\n  This bill does not preserve this tool. That is one of the most \nglaring defects in this bill.\n  There are no demonstrated problems with State and local enforcement \nof hate crimes.\n  I am aware of only one time when hearings were held on this \nlegislation. Those are the ones that I, as chairman, scheduled in 1999. \nDeputy Attorney General Eric Holder conceded in his testimony that an \nanalysis of the hate crimes statistics that have been collected needs \nto be conducted to determine whether State and local authorities are \nfailing to combat hate crimes. Eric Holder testified that the \nstatistics we have are, to use his term, ``inadequate.''\n  In fact, there has been never been a showing that state and local law \nenforcement officials have been ignoring or neglecting--much less \nintentionally failing--their duty to prosecute these heinous offenses.\n  Because we don't know the real facts on this critical issue, we have \na duty to find out before we pass such sweeping, constitutionally \nsuspect legislation.\n  I have only learned of a handful of cases--less than a dozen, some of \nwhich stretch back almost two decades--where state and local officials \nare alleged to have failed to investigate or\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nprosecute hate crimes. This is far from compelling evidence in a system \nof justice where, according to the most recent FBI statistics, citizens \nreport some 11 million criminal complaints in one year, and state and \nlocal law enforcement officials make some 14 million criminal arrests.\n  These numbers make another important point. State and local law \nenforcement officials process the overwhelming majority of all crimes--\nsome 95 percent of all criminal activity. There are good reasons for \nthat. Frankly, they do every bit as good a job as Federal prosecutors.\n  If we really want to do something about hate crimes, on a Federal \nlevel, we should at the least allow for the death penalty so law \nenforcement and prosecutors can obtain immediate cooperation and guilty \npleas, and so defendants will have an incentive to testify against \nfellow perpetrators, which results in bringing these matters to an end \nquickly without high costs.\n  In most cases, the death penalty would probably not be imposed, but \nthe fact that it could be imposed is a very important element in \ngetting to the bottom of a lot of these cases.\n  We are talking about a very important set of issues. It is nice to be \nemotional; it is nice to talk about how big our hearts should be. I \ndon't think anyone can claim they have a much larger heart than I have. \nI have proven it through all the years. The fact is, there is a reason \nour Founding Fathers wanted State and local law problems prosecuted by \nState and local prosecutors. They are the people closest to them; they \nare the people who understand the neighborhoods; they are the people \nwho understand the cities; they are the people who understand the \npeople. They do every bit as good a job as the Federal prosecutors do.\n  I feel deeply about these matters. I don't want anyone to be hurt by \nhate crimes. It is not right. No one should care what their orientation \nis. It is just not right. I have to say, if the State and local law \nenforcement people were not doing their job, it would be another \nmatter.\n  My colleague, Senator Smith of Oregon, cited an incident in Idaho \nwhere the victim asked the FBI to step in and assist in the \nprosecution. They said they could not because there was no applicable \nfederal statute. As I understand it, there is no allegation that the \ncrime was not prosecuted by State officials. In fact, I understand they \nreceived a conviction in that case.\n  A lot of this is based on emotions. I would like to address the issue \nfrom a law enforcement basis that makes sense, that really does the \njob. That is why I filed this amendment on the death penalty, because \nthat is one of the great tools Federal and local prosecutors have. The \nvery fact that they might have to face the death penalty if they roll \nthe dice and go to the jury, it is one of the great tools that forces \npeople to come clean. It is also a great tool in causing others to \ntestify against their co-perpetrators. Take that tool away and I \nsuggest we will be harming the efforts to try to solve the problems of \nhate crimes and criminal activity.\n  What is wrong with this bill? It goes way beyond what is necessary \nand makes almost every case that is now prosecuted at the State and \nlocal level a Federal crime. The fact is that almost all crime involves \nhatred. I know the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts tried to \nprevent including every rape as a hate crime. But the bill is written \nso broadly that it looks to me as though they are making all rape \ncases, all cases with sexual allegations, hate crimes, prosecutable by \nthe Federal Government, even though the State and local prosecutors are \ntotally capable of prosecuting these cases.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I would like to state for the \nrecord my belief that there is not a Senator in the Senate with a \nbigger heart or better heart than Orrin Hatch. It is a great privilege \nto serve with him. He and I just differ about the appropriateness of \nthe Federal involvement.\n  I think the Federal involvement in the statute we proposed will be \nminimal, but it will be allowable. It will be rare that the Federal \nGovernment is brought in. But, again, it took a Republican from \nWyoming, Laramie, WY, the sheriff, to come and tell me, just in a \npractical way, how helpful it would have been if Federal resources and \ninvolvement had been included in the prosecution of the Matthew Shepard \ncase.\n  If in the case of James Byrd it was appropriate, why not in the case \nof Matthew Shepard? Moreover, why should we not, at this time in our \nNation's history, say to the gay and lesbian community: We care. We do \nhave a big heart. We have a way to include you. And this is the barest \nof minimums that we ought to do in their behalf.\n  I think if you are a Navajo gay boy in a lonely Colorado canyon near \na small town where local law enforcement is ill-equipped to assure \njustice is done, that it is entirely appropriate for us now to make \navailable the law enforcement arm and resource and authority of the \nU.S. Government.\n  I do not wish to subvert in any way the local law enforcement that is \nthe bulwark against crime in this country. Indeed, that is why we call \nthis the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act. We are simply trying to \nenhance the pursuit and prosecution and punishment of those who would \ncommit the most malignant kinds of crime in America.\n  At a time when this Nation is in a war against terrorism abroad, it \nis not inappropriate for us to focus as a Congress upon terrorism \ncommitted at home. What happened to Matthew Shepard was terrorism. I \nthink it is appropriate for the Federal Government to say it can help \nin this instance as well.\n  So if there are flaws in this bill, let's fix them in conference. But \nlet's advance this bill because it is the right time and it is the \nright way in which to do it.\n  Again, I deeply respect the motives of the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. I know his heart. It is as good a heart as there \nis in the place. I know he feels as I do when people are victimized. I \nthink he is genuinely trying to find the right procedural way to get \nthe Federal Government involved in helping.\n  But all you have to do is go to small town America where many of \nthese horrible acts are committed and ask them if they couldn't use the \nhelping hand of the Federal Government. I think they will tell you \noverwhelmingly: Yes, and it is about time you showed up to help.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 625. Now is the time and it is \nabout time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the remarks of my distinguished friend about \nthe way he feels about these matters. I feel precisely the way he does. \nWe are very close friends. I don't think you can find closer friends in \nthe Senate. I think most people who know me know that I have very deep \nfeelings that no one should be brutalized in our society, regardless of \nwhat their sexual orientation is.\n  But this is a big step. If we take this bill without the death \npenalty, then we are actually reducing the ability of law enforcement \nto go after these people and to get cooperation from other witnesses \nand from co-perpetrators.\n  One of my favorite programs on television happens to be ``Law and \nOrder.'' If you watch that, you will see the prosecutors regularly use \nthe death penalty as a tool. While fictional, this television show is \nbased substantially on what goes on in real life. Most attorneys who \nwatch the show are pretty impressed with the program. I am one of them. \nYou will notice in many cases that they will use the potential of being \nsubjected to the death penalty to get one or more of the perpetrators \nto testify against the others. Frankly, it is very effective on this \nshow and in real life.\n  I, for one, believe that the death penalty should be used only in the \nmost narrow of circumstances. But I believe it is a tool that would \ncertainly help in prosecuting hate crimes. It would certainly help \nalmost every prosecutor who wants to go after violent criminals who act \nin concert. It certainly helps our State and local prosecutors, and it\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nwould help the Federal prosecutors. But in this particular bill that \nhas been introduced by my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, the \ndeath penalty is taken out of the hands of Federal prosecutors.\n  So all we are doing in this intellectual, political exercise, in many \nrespects, is tying the hands of Federal prosecutors, while immensely \nexpanding the Federal jurisdiction over virtually all crimes that are \ncalled ``hate'' crimes--in complete disregard for the fact that 95 \npercent of all prosecutions are prosecuted at the State and local \nlevel, and are prosecuted well.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Oregon cited the Bangerter \ncase. The people who attacked Bangerter and hurt him were prosecuted \nand convicted, as I understand. There are bound to be maybe four or \nfive cases over the last decades that weren't prosecuted. But that \ndoesn't justify giving this wholesale expansion of state authority to \nthe Federal prosecutors.\n  One of the things I personally chatted about with the current Chief \nJustice and other Justices on the Court--one of the things I personally \ndiscussed with them--is their concern about the continual increase of \nthe number of statutory Federal crimes when there is no evidence that \nthe State and local prosecutors are not doing their job. The amendment \nI intend to file at a later time, which will be a substitute for the \nbill of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, provides for the \ntools and the help for those small communities, such as the one in \nColorado that distinguished Senator from Oregon referred, to prosecute \nthese crimes.\n  Although there is no evidence that they can't do it or that they \naren't doing it, my amendment makes sure that hate crimes will and can \nbe prosecuted by providing resources.\n  If my friend from Oregon is truly only concerned with enhancing local \nlaw enforcement--this bill, ironically, is called the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act. This bill takes away the authority of \nlocal law enforcement and puts it in the hands of Federal prosecutors \nwhen there is no evidence they need to do that. Nor is there any \nindication that we should turn over this kind of responsibility to \nFederal prosecutors, nor that they should have the right to come in and \noverrule local prosecutors in the process who are doing the job.\n  If my colleague from Oregon is truly only concerned with enhancement \nof local law enforcement, I hope he will vote for my substitute which \nwill be offered later in this debate.\n  That is what my substitute will do--enhance and not supplant local \nState prosecutors. I will discuss that in detail later, and hopefully \nwe will be able to bring it up and get a time agreement whereby we have \na limited number of amendments. And that will certainly be one of them. \nIf we win, we win. If we lose, we lose. But at least we will have \ndebated it, and we will have had a chance to improve this bill by leaps \nand bounds.\n  During our last debate on hate crimes, Senator Kennedy criticized me \nfor arguing against the federalization of hate crimes when I have \nsupported providing Federal jurisdiction in other, completely unrelated \nareas, such as computer fraud or class actions. This is the classic \napples versus oranges argument.\n  In those other cases, there has never been any serious question that \nthe proposed Federal jurisdiction would be constitutional. I consider \nevery piece of legislation on its own merits.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, a noted opponent of the \ndeath penalty, nonetheless has voted in the past for legislation that \nprovides for the death penalty. My conviction that S. 625 is \nunconstitutional is in no way inconsistent or contradictory.\n  Whether or not a State may have a specific law prohibiting hate \ncrimes does not mean that they are failing to vigorously prosecute \nthem. Every hate crime, every bit of criminal conduct that S. 625 \nproposes to federalize is and always has been a crime in every \njurisdiction throughout our Nation, crimes which have been effectively \nprosecuted by State and local prosecutors.\n  When we challenged the Clinton administration and the then Deputy \nAttorney General, Eric Holder, to come up with any examples where local \nprosecutors were not taking care of these problems, they could not do \nit.\n  In fact, prosecutors sometimes do not like to charge a crime as a \nhate crime--especially when the penalties are no different because they \nhave to prove an extra element: The motive of the defendant to commit \nthe crime based on bias. That is an extra element that would have to be \nproven, and it makes it tough to get convictions in some of these \ncases.\n  It is no answer to say that a State may not have a hate crime or may \nnot be charging enough cases under a specific hate crime law. The real \nquestion is, Are States failing to prosecute hate crimes? The answer is \na resounding no.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 282\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, in 3 days' time, the United States \nwill withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And it \nappears that we will do so without a significant debate on this issue \nin the Senate. For 30 years, the ABM Treaty has been the foundation \nupon which our strategic relationship with Russia has rested. So I am \ntroubled that this historic treaty is about to be dissolved without so \nmuch as a hearing or even any debate in this body. I also regret that \nthe President made this important decision without consulting with the \nSenate. I find this troubling on both constitutional and policy \ngrounds.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states that the President \n``shall have the Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, to make Treaties, provided that two thirds of the Senators \npresent concur. * * *'' The Constitution is silent on the process by \nwhich the United States can withdraw from a treaty, and the record of \nthe Congress and the executive branch is mixed.\n  But, the intent of the Framers, as explained by Thomas Jefferson, is \nclear. In section 52 of Jefferson's Manual, he writes, ``Treaties are \nlegislative acts. A treaty is the law of the land. It differs from \nother laws only as it must have the consent of a foreign nation, being \nbut a contract with respect to that nation.'' And article II, section 3 \nof the Constitution states that the President shall ``take Care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed. . . . ''\n  Jefferson continues, ``Treaties being declared, equally with the laws \nof the United States, to be the supreme law of the land, it is \nunderstood that an act of the legislature alone can declare them \ninfringed and rescinded. This was accordingly the process adopted in \nthe case of France in 1798.'' It is worth noting that four signers of \nthe Constitution were serving in the Congress when this first treaty \ntermination occurred--by an act of Congress--in 1798,\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\njust 11 years after the Constitutional Convention.\n  So it is clear to me, as obviously it was to Thomas Jefferson, that \nCongress has a constitutional role to play in terminating treaties. If \nadvice and consent of the Senate is required to enter into a treaty, \nthis body should at a minimum be consulted on withdrawing from a \ntreaty, and especially from a treaty of this magnitude, the termination \nof which could have lasting implications on the arms control and \ndefense policy of this country. Today the ABM Treaty is the supreme law \nof the United States. The Senate should not stand by while the \nadministration unilaterally abrogates this treaty.\n  I am concerned about the message that the Senate's inaction sends to \nthis administration and future administrations about how seriously we \nwill take our constitutional responsibilities with regard to the \ntermination of treaties. As Jefferson noted, a treaty is equal with a \nlaw. A law cannot be declared to be repealed by the President alone. \nOnly an act of Congress can repeal a law. Action by the Senate or the \nCongress should be required to terminate a treaty.\n  Momentarily, I will seek to bring up a resolution on this issue. The \nresolution is very simple. It just expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat the approval of the Senate is required to terminate any treaty and \nstates that the Senate shall determine the manner by which it gives its \napproval to such a proposed termination. Finally, the resolution \ndisapproves of the withdrawal of the United States from the ABM Treaty.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. Res. 282, which I submitted earlier today, that \nthe resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I was not surprised, but I do regret \nthat there has been an objection to the Senate taking up this \nresolution and expressing its will on this important issue.\n  I am troubled that the Congress appears willing to cede its \nconstitutional responsibility on this matter to the executive branch. I \nam concerned about the signal that the Senate's refusal to act sends to \nthe executive branch and what it could mean for the future of other \ntreaties with which this or other administrations may not agree.\n  The Senate does not grant its advice and consent to ratify treaties \nlightly, and we should not abrogate our responsibility to express the \nwill of this body on whether the United States should withdraw from \ntreaties. By failing to act on this important issue, we are granting \nthe executive branch undue license to trample on the constitutional \nprerogatives of the Senate and to blur the separation of powers and \nsystem of checks and balances. I am concerned that the Senate's \ninaction today tips the scales dangerously in favor of the executive \nbranch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the course of the last few \ndays, I have learned some rather disturbing news about U.S. servicemen \nbeing used as human guinea pigs. It is a project that was carried out \nin the 1970s aboard ships, the ships in the Pacific, a project known by \nthe acronym of SHAD--S-H-A-D. It was basically using various biological \nand chemical agents to expose our sailors, supposedly, in an attempt to \nhave a readiness should that kind of an attack occur upon our troops. \nAt that time we were still involved in the Vietnam war.\n  But with the information that I have received, it is unclear if, in \nfact, the troops--in this case, the sailors--were told about the test \nand were, in fact, given the appropriate warnings to get the proper \nprotective gear.\n  The reason this has come to light--and I want to give credit where \ncredit is due--there is a brave and courageous Congressman in \nCalifornia, Congressman Thompson, who has been railing about this \nissue. But it has recently come to my attention because several of \nthose now retired sailors are being notified by the U.S. Government \nthat they should come in and get examined medically, and some of those \nformer sailors are in the State of Florida.\n  Now, here is the extent of it. There were some 113 tests that were \nmade. The only ones that have been released thus far are some 12 of the \n113 tests. According to the sources I have, in those 12, there were a \ntotal of 4,300 sailors who were exposed to these chemical and \nbiological agents that were sprayed on or over the ships in the Pacific \nin the 1970s. Of those 4,300 sailors, only 622 have been notified and \nhave been notified by mail.\n  By the way, how it came to my attention is 51 of those 622 happen to \nreside in the State of Florida.\n  This, in and of itself, portends some very serious consequences for \nour country. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I want \nto know, now some three decades later, that we are contacting these \nsailors to come in and get checked medically. I want to know the \ndetails.\n  I want to know who were the military personnel, were there any \ncivilian personnel, and were there any substances we should know about \nso that we could give the kind of medical care that would be important \nas the U.S. Government ought to be protecting the people, particularly \nthe people who served in uniform trying to protect this country.\n  When this came to my attention last week, I wrote to the Secretary of \nDefense and asked him for an explanation. I have written to our \nwonderful chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and \nasked him to conduct an inquiry and hearing, if necessary, and if it \nneeds to be classified, then we can operate in the Armed Services \nCommittee in a classified manner to find out what the degree of \nexposure was and what the degree of medical attention should be in \norder to protect these American citizens.\n  If that is not enough, I have also had my suspicions aroused because \nin the 1950s there was a test going on in the old Boca Raton airbase. \nThis was an airbase that during World War II was a training base for \nflyers. After World War II, in the 1950s, there was research going on \nat this particular airfield to develop a toxin that would attack and \nkill the Soviet wheat crop.\n  Remember, in the 1950s we were immersed in the cold war. We didn't \nknow what to expect. We had the two nuclear superpowers. We were \ninvestigating: Could we develop a toxin that, if the United States were \nattacked, with which we would be able to attack their agricultural \nsupply.\n  Why was that done in Florida? Well, we don't raise wheat in Florida. \nSo that is one of the reasons Florida was chosen. But in addition to \nthe Boca Raton location, there were other field tests made not only for \nwheat but perhaps for other substances that I have been able to find \nout about just in the State of Florida, in locations such as Belle \nGlade, Fort Pierce, Avon Park, and Panama City.\n  A couple of months ago, I wrote to the Department of Defense and \nasked for information about this matter, along with the same line of \ninquiry which I have just spoken about with regard to SHAD, the gassing \nof the sailors in the 1970s. I wanted to know: Were people at risk? \nWere military personnel exposed? Were civilians exposed? And on the 85-\nacre parcel to the north of what is now Florida Atlantic University, \nbuilt on the Boca Raton airport, a part of the old airbase, an 85-acre \narea to the north where this testing was going on, were there toxins \nthat were dumped there? Were there toxins buried there?\n  Basically, to my inquiry to the Department of Defense a couple months \nago, they said they could not tell me because it was classified. Well, \nthe Senate Committee on Armed Services is not only capable but is quite \nexperienced in handling highly classified matters of the Government. \nThe Defense Department had better be forthcoming to let us know if \nthere is a problem, and if there is, what we are going to do about it.\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\n  These two issues have come up in the last few days and have certainly \naroused my suspicions. I call on the good offices of the Secretary of \nDefense, who I think personally is doing a very good job, to see that \nhis organization snaps to and produces the documentation the Senate \nneeds in its oversight capacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5278-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VARELA PROJECT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Those 11,000 courageous \ncitizens, operating under the Constitution of Cuba, stepped forth under \nthe constitutional provision that says if over 10,000 petition the \nGovernment, the Government will take up the matter in the National \nAssembly to act on those four freedoms I just mentioned.\n  I want to bring to the attention of our colleagues the fact that \nthese people have put their lives on the line.

But today the Senate will send a strong message \nof support for these courageous citizens of Cuba who are playing by the \nrules and who want to see the winds of change and the fresh breath of \nfreedom suddenly start to be realized in Cuba.\n  I am so grateful to the chairman of the full committee and the \nchairman of the subcommittee that they have brought forthwith so \nquickly this resolution so that the Senate can stand on record to \ncommend these citizens in Cuba.\n  I see my colleague, the chairman of our subcommittee, ready to speak. \nFew people knew about this project called the Varela Project until \nPresident Carter went to Cuba. When he had that chance to speak live to \nthe Cuban people by radio and TV, he spoke about the Varela Project and \nhow courageous these folks were. All the people of Cuba now know what \nit is.

Mr. President, there are only a few minutes before the \nvote. What time is the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 5:45.\n  Mr. DODD. I see my colleague from the State of Washington who wants \nto address another matter. I will be brief.\n  I commend our colleague from Florida for crafting this resolution, \nwhich will be voted on shortly, by the Senate. He is absolutely \ncorrect, it did come out of our committee with a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 272. All too often when \nwe have engaged in debate on matters related to Cuba, there have been a \ngreat deal of polemics--a lot of heat but very little light shed on the \nsubject matter under debate. That is not the case with the resolution \nwe are considering this afternoon.\n  I have been critical in the past on various policies the US has \npursued regarding Cuba. The audience we ought to listen to most are the \npeople behind the projects like the Varela Project, the people who have \nstayed in Cuba to try to bring about change there--those who have been \nincarcerated for 15, 20, 25 years, in some cases longer--because of \ntheir political views. Those who have authored this Varela Project \ndeserve a great deal of credit for having the courage to round up \n11,000 signatures, which is remarkable considering some of the \npressures they will be under.\n  I commend Senator Bill Nelson of Florida for crafting this \nresolution. He has attempted to stick to the facts and to keep the \nspotlight on what is actually happening on the Island of Cuba.\n  This resolution recognizes a remarkable occurrence--the fact that \n11,000 Cubans have petitioned their government for the holding of a \nreferendum on civil, political and economic changes they wish to see. \nIt is also refreshing that, thus far, the government of Cuba has taken \nno action against the organizers of this effort.\n  Thanks to the recent visit of former President Jimmy Carter to Havana \nlast month, the Varela project now has international visibility. More \nimportantly, because President Carter's speech, including references to \nthis effort, was broadcast on Cuban TV and radio, and reprinted \nverbatim in the official Cuban newspaper, the Cuban people are now \naware of this as well.\n  The organizers of Varela have chosen to exercise their rights under \nthe Cuban Constitution to submit legislative proposals to the National \nAssembly for its consideration. Some in the Cuban exile community have \nbeen critical of this effort because they believe it legitimizes the \nCuban constitution and therefore it should be opposed. I reject that \nargument.\n  For too long we in the United States have tried to tell the Cuban \npeople what is best for them. We did so at the time of Cuban \nindependence from Spain and we did so again during the Batista regime. \nThe result was the 1959 Cuban revolution and the Castro Government.\n  Let's listen to the voices inside Cuba. Let's listen to those who \nhave stayed in Cuba and sought to change it from within.\n  Those voices have called for the United States to engage with Cuba. \nThose voices have called for an end to the travel ban.\n  If the Carter visit demonstrated anything, it demonstrated that the \npresence of Americans in Cuba offers opportunities for more political \nspace in Cuba not for shoring up the Castro regime.\n  Mr. President, the Varela project was inspired by Cuban citizens. \nThese citizens have taken advantage of rights provided to them under \nthe Cuban Constitution. The Cuban government should honor those rights \nand give serious consideration to this request.\n  We in the United States should demonstrate self restraint and allow \nCubans to retain ownership of this initiative. We need to be careful \nnot to appropriate these internal efforts inside Cuba. If we give it \ntoo much of a label of ``made in the U.S.,'' then this project will be \nhurt and the effort will be hurt. We have been warned repeatedly by \ndissidents and human rights activists inside Cuba that, too often, if \nwe become associated with efforts there, they are seen as nothing more \nthan tools of United States foreign policy with regard to Cuba. We \nshould try not to give the Castro government any opportunities to \nsuggest that this is just another plot by the United States to attack \nthe Cuban people.\n\n  I commend the organizers of the Varela initiative and all who have \njoined with them in their effort to seek peaceful change in Cuba. I \nstand ready to listen to their voices and assist them in any way they \nbelieve will be helpful in bringing their aspirations to fruition.\n  What is most important is not what we do, but rather what they are \ndoing in Cuba, what they are showing by their tremendous sense of \ncommitment to democracy and freedom. For those reasons, we are \nendorsing their effort with this resolution, and I strongly support it \nand urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5278-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5278-S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE VARELA PROJECT'S COLLECTION OF CERTIFIED SIGNATURES IN SUPPORT OF A \n NATIONAL REFERENDUM AND THE DELIVERY OF THESE SIGNATURES TO THE CUBAN \n                           NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I would like to address one of \nthe most complicated but ultimately one of the most important \nconstitutional questions confronting this country as we respond to the \natrocities of September 11: that is, the question of how America \ndecides to go to war. This is no easy issue, but it is one that \nCongress is duty-bound to address.\n  As we know, war powers are purposefully divided under our \nConstitution. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the \nresponsibility to declare war, and to raise and support the Armed \nForces. The President, under Article II, Section 2, is the Commander in \nChief, which gives him responsibility for leading the Armed Forces. The \nWar Powers Resolution of 1973 fulfills the intent of the Framers of the \nConstitution by providing a framework for balancing these powers, and \nthereby ensuring that the collective judgment of both the Congress and \nthe President will apply to the introduction of the Armed Forces into \nhostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in \nhostilities is likely.\n  In April, I had a chance to chair a hearing in the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee to consider this balance of war \npowers authority under the Constitution, particularly as we move \nforward with our fight against terrorism. In the hearing, there was \nmuch praise for the respect demonstrated by President Bush, this \nPresident Bush, for both the Congress and the Constitution in seeking \ncongressional authorization to respond with appropriate force to the \nattacks of September 11. The language in that authorization, Senate \nJoint Resolution 23, paralleled some of the careful oversight \nprovisions contained in the use-of-force resolution that former \nPresident Bush obtained before launching Operation Desert Storm in \n1991. In those two cases, both Presidents took the important and \nconstitutionally mandated step of obtaining congressional approval for \nan expansive new military operation. And in both cases, I do believe, \ncongressional support strengthened the President's response.\n  History demonstrates that respect for our Constitution and for the \nshared war powers authority of Congress is politically practical. \nIndeed, as our Founders and many subsequent commentators have \nrecognized, the separation of war powers between the two branches of \ngovernment wisely forces us to develop a broad national consensus \nbefore placing our Nation's young people in harm's way. And as we have \nseen time and again, the United States is indeed the most formidable \nmilitary force on this planet, provided our soldiers are entrusted with \na clear military goal, and through congressional authorization, with \nthe popular mandate that is needed to back them up.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 23, which was passed by both Houses of \nCongress and signed into law by the President in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, provides the President with statutory authorization to \nprevent related acts of terrorism. In adopting the use-of-force \nresolution, the President recognized that Congress he said, ``acted \nwisely, decisively, and in the finest traditions of our country.'' The \nresolution demonstrated that Congress has the capacity to fulfill its \nconstitutionally mandated responsibility, and in so doing Congress can \nhelp unify the nation in a time of national crisis.\n  Under the careful structure of S.J. Res. 23, the President now has \nstatutory authority to prevent future terrorist attacks by responding \nwith force against any nations, organizations or persons responsible \nfor planning, authorizing, aiding or harboring the terrorists who were \nresponsible for the September 11 attack. Now, given the unprecedented \nnature of the threat, this provides a pretty broad mandate to the \nPresident to respond militarily.\n  But this Congressional action, while admittedly broad, is not a blank \ncheck. The Resolution limits the President's authority in two essential \nrespects.\n  To begin, the authorization is limited to situations where there is a \nconnection to the events of September 11. The hearing in the \nConstitution Subcommittee considered the scope of such a limitation. As \nI will discuss at greater length, there was widespread agreement in the \nhearing that absent a clear finding that a state such as Iraq \nparticipated in, aided, or otherwise provided support for those who \nattacked the United States on Sept 11, the President would not be \nauthorized, under the terms of S.J. Res. 23, to take new military \naction against Iraq. Senate Joint Resolution 23 does not provide \nunlimited authority to the President to take military action against \nall bad actors. At the same time, the authorization does foresee broad \nactions against those responsible for the September attack on the \nUnited States.\n  It is also important to recognize that S.J. Res. 23 states in no \nuncertain terms that the 1973 War Powers Resolution will continue to \napply to our military operations against terrorism. This conforming \nlanguage is identical to Public Law 102-1, which provided the \nauthorization to use military force to oust Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. \nIn all cases, the War Powers Resolution requires the President to \nconsult with Congress on an ongoing basis on the status, scope, and \nduration of the hostilities. These consultations need not and should \nnot provide Congress with what would be somehow a meddlesome and \nunacceptably dangerous role in determining tactical aspects of an \nactive military campaign. But the required consultations must \nnonetheless assist Congress in its continuing responsibility to \nevaluate and make ongoing decisions about the broad objectives of an \nunfolding military operation.\n  The war powers consultations to date, in my view, have been \ninadequate. While the administration has taken significant steps to \nincrease the frequency of briefings for Members of Congress, and we do \nappreciate that those consultations have been conducted as \ninformational briefings, with little opportunity for substantive policy \ndiscussions or meaningful give-and-take. As such they do not in most \ncases reach the threshold level of consultations under the terms of the \nWar Powers Resolution.\n  The House Report on the 1973 War Powers Resolution notes that ``a \nconsiderable amount of attention was given to the definition of \nconsultation.\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\nRejected was the notion that consultation should be synonymous with \nmerely being informed. Rather, consultation in this provision means \nthat a decision is pending on a problem and that Members of Congress \nare being asked by the President for their advice and opinions and, in \nappropriate circumstances, their approval of action contemplated.'' The \nincreasingly frequent meetings with Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary \nPowell, and others, while welcome and appreciated, do not reach this \nlevel of consultation.\n  In addition, under the War Powers Resolution, the need for additional \nnotification is triggered whenever U.S. Armed Forces are equipped for \ncombat and introduced into a new foreign territory, or if additional \nArmed Forces are equipped for combat and introduced in numbers that \nsubstantially expand existing, previously authorized troop strengths. \nThis is obviously relevant to some of the concerns coming up today.\n  These and other requirements do not apply to military training \nexercises, which is why the President must be clear about the precise \nrole of U.S. forces in a number of ongoing counterterrorism training \nexercises in different countries. These requirements do not apply to \nthat. In some cases, these counterterrorism training programs may cross \nthe line into counterterrorism combat support, which would trigger the \nWar Powers Resolution. So the President must provide clear information \nto help distinguish between these two types of antiterrorism \nactivities. United States interests are not served through a \nshortsighted attempt to dodge congressional oversight by characterizing \ncounterterrorism support as routine military training.\n  In the hearing before the Constitution Subcommittee, we also \ndiscussed the important provision within the War Powers Resolution that \nrecognizes the immediate flexibility provided to the President to \nintroduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities in the case of a national \ncrisis created by an attack on the United States, or its territories, \npossessions, or Armed Forces. This provides the President with the \nflexibility to respond immediately to defend United States interests \nduring an emergency.\n  But again, this is a limited exception. The War Powers Resolution \nspecifically requires the President, ``in every possible instance,'' to \nconsult with Congress before introducing Armed Forces into situations \nwhere hostilities appear imminent. And even within this exception for \nemergency situations, the President must still seek congressional \nauthorization within 60 days to sustain the operation.\n  My conclusion from the hearing on war powers authority within the \ncontext of our fight against terrorism is that to date the President \nhas shown respect for Congress in seeking authorization to respond to \nthe attacks of September 11. But the ongoing level of consultation on \nour military campaign has not been adequate. In particular, additional \nattention must be given to the distinction between counter- \nterrorism training and counter- \nterrorism support for foreign troops during these consultations. It is \nclear that our national interests would be well served by sustained and \nforthright consultations between Congress and the President over these \naspects of our military response to September 11.\n  The hearing also touched on one of the most important military \ndecisions on the horizon. Several witnesses questioned the authority of \nthe President to take military action against Iraq. The witnesses \ngenerally assumed that any strike against Iraq would be designed to \ndefend the United States against Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and \nthat the President would not assert a direct link between Iraq and the \nSeptember 11 attacks. As I have indicated, absent such a link between \nIraq and September 11, witnesses suggested that the President might \nadvance two legal justifications for taking up arms against Iraq \nwithout further, additional congressional authorization. But both \njustifications ring hollow, and rest on highly questionable legal \ngrounds.\n  During the hearing, a witness from the Justice Department joined \nother witnesses in highlighting the authority of the President to \nlaunch military attacks as a form of preemptive self-defense. This \nexpands the national emergency exception under the War Powers \nResolution by asserting that the President must have the authority to \nact quickly and decisively to prevent a potential attack on United \nStates interests. Now, few would disagree with the assertion that the \nPresident must have the authority to launch a preemptive strike in \nadvance of an imminent attack on the United States. This understanding \nI think fits within the overall spirit and intent of the 1973 War \nPowers law, and it would be irresponsible to suggest otherwise. But the \npreemptive self-defense argument does not necessarily fit squarely with \nthe situation in Iraq today.\n  Various press reports suggest that President Bush is considering \nplans for a new military campaign against Iraq sometime next year. If \nthe President does plan to take such action next year, there is still \nplenty of time for the administration to initiate meaningful \nconsultations with Congress over the necessity and scope of this new \nmilitary campaign.\n  Some have also argued, unconvincingly to me, that consultation with \nCongress would be impossible because a preemptive strike against Iraq \nwould require a high degree of stealth. But the administration has \nalready spoken publicly of the need for regime change in Iraq, and \nunnamed officials have consistently leaked information to major news \nsources describing the scope of the proposed operation.\n  Moreover, it is now widely assumed that the operation would require a \nrobust ground assault, and that our military build-up in the region \nwould be both deliberate and plainly obvious to any careful observer. \nSo this would not be a purely stealth operation. There would be ample \ntime for congressional consultation as we move forward with fairly \nobvious military preparations for such a large offensive.\n  The second argument that is sometimes advanced to support a future \nmilitary operation in Iraq is that Public Law 102-1, authorizing the \nuse of force in 1991 to respond to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, still \nprovides ongoing congressional authorization for a major new strike \nagainst Iraq. Now, this is a more complex legal argument, but it fails \non both legal and public policy grounds. To begin, the congressional \nauthorization for Operation Desert Storm authorizes the President to \nuse military force pursuant to United Nations Security Council \nResolution 678. The clear intent of the Security Council in adopting \nResolution 678 was to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, not to bring \nabout regime change in Iraq. Moreover, United Nations Security Council \nResolution 687 implemented a final cease-fire between Iraq, Kuwait and \nthe United Nations Member States that participated in Operation Desert \nStorm. Although Iraq has certainly failed to comply with the terms of \nthe cease-fire, that failure does not in itself provide automatic \nauthority for the President to launch a significant new military \ncampaign, with the entirely new objective of regime change in Baghdad.\n  My conclusion, then, is that absent a clear finding that Iraq \nparticipated in, aided or otherwise provided support for those who \nattacked the United States on Sept 11, the Constitution requires the \nPresident--it requires the President--to seek additional authorization \nbefore he can embark on a major new military undertaking in Iraq.\n  Since it is clear that Iraq has not adequately complied with weapons \nof mass destruction resolutions adopted by the Security Council, and \nthat the Iraqi leadership continues to commit gross human rights \nviolations against its own people while encouraging terrorist attacks \nabroad, the consultation and debate over our response to an Iraqi \nthreat may well convince a majority in Congress that the United States \nmust in fact take all necessary steps, including military action, to \nlimit Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction. My guess \nis that such a resolution would succeed, after a good Congressional \ndebate. If this emerges as the shared decision of Congress and the \nPresident, the President would act from a strong and constitutionally \nunified position in launching a new military campaign. Indeed, the \nConstitution and the American people must demand such a unified \nresponse.\n  Why would I raise these issues today? Why are these war powers \nquestions so\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\nimportant? Why should following the letter of the War Powers Resolution \nbe so important in the midst of this national crisis? I think it should \nbecause Congress and the President have a chance to carry out their \nduties with regard to war and peace in the way the War Powers \nResolution dictates, and also in the way the Framers of the \nConstitution intended.\n  That kind of cooperation preserves our constitutional structure. It \nalso increases the moral authority of the President to act forcefully. \nGiven the unprecedented nature of the threats confronting us, and the \ncomplex environment within which we must respond to those threats, a \npowerful and constitutionally unified response remains essential. We \nmust also remember that constitutional unity presents both a stronger \ninternational image of the United States to our friends and foes, and, \nat the same time, a more comforting image of U.S. power to many of our \nclose allies in the campaign against terrorism. When we best honor our \nConstitution and our laws as they relate to the powers of war and \npeace, we also best prepare our Nation to defend that Constitution and \nthose laws. We owe our Nation no less.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5282-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICA'S COMMITMENT AGAINST BIOTERRORISM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, our vulnerability to a bioterrorist \nattack was highlighted by the events that unfolded last October, when \nanthrax took the lives of innocent Americans and put thousands more in \njeopardy. How we address our vulnerabilities and respond to \nbioterrorism will be radically improved as a result of new legislation \nsigned by President Bush. The greatest tool that terrorists have in \ntheir arsenal is to play on America's vulnerabilities and fears. This \nlegislation makes great strides to significantly improve our ability to \nrespond to bioterrorist threats. Yet it is critical that we provide the \nappropriate information so that families can prepare and protect \nthemselves in the event of a potential attack. Information is power, \nand by better preparing ourselves, we can avoid being paralyzed by \nfear.\n  Many news organizations have already begun to do their part by \nproviding the necessary information for communities to feel safe. Good \nHousekeeping, which is read by thousands of readers each month, is a \ngood example. In its April edition, Good Housekeeping answered the \nquestions readers often have about bioterrorism, gave suggestions \nfamilies could use to protect and prepare themselves, and provided \ninformation on what Congress is doing to lessen our vulnerability to \nbioterrorist attack. The magazine went a step further by providing a \nform readers could fill out urging Congress to act quickly to address \nbioterrorism. I was pleased that thousands of readers did respond with \ntheir views on this issue and the importance of passing legislation \nthat would keep American families safe.\n  Last fall's anthrax attacks changed the way America looked at \nbioterrorism. Overnight, the fear of bioterrorism moved from a remote \npossibility, to a reality for which we must be prepared. The \nbioterrorism bill, which will soon be signed into law, will greatly \nimprove our ability to respond to a biological threat, equipping \ncommunities with the tools they need to strengthen our local health \ncenters and educate those first responders, the doctors, nurses and \nemergency personnel on the front lines. But information for the general \npublic is also key to improving our readiness. I commend the many news \norganizations that have recognized this fact and continue to get \nAmericans the information they need to feel safe and secure. The unique \nnature of terrorism requires all of us to work together. While the \nevents of September 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have changed \nthe world we live in, coming together to meet a common challenge \nremains the American way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5282-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5282-S5283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ESTONIA'S ROLE IN THE HOLOCAUST\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask that an article \nwritten by the U.S. Ambassador to Estonia, Joseph M. DeThomas, be \nprinted in the Record. Ambassador DeThomas outlines important steps for \nthe Estonian government to undertake to address Estonia's role in the \nHolocaust.\n  The article follows.\n\n                        Past, Present and Future\n\n                   (By Ambassador Joseph M. DeThomas)\n\n       In every interview I have had with the press since I \n     arrived in Tallinn, I have been asked in one form or another, \n     ``What has surprised you about Estonia?'' I have always \n     answered by noting that some aspect or another about Estonia \n     was even more positive than I expected. Early May, however, I \n     was surprised in a different way. A report in a Russian \n     weekly claiming that Simon Wiesenthal advocated a boycott of \n     the Baltic States and Ukraine produced a firestorm of comment \n     from the press, political circles, and some members of the \n     public. The comments were angry, defensive, and--with regard \n     to my government's position--erroneous. The Wiesenthal Center \n     has categorically denied that Mr. Wiesenthal ever even gave \n     this interview. I did not intervene in this discussion. Since \n     arriving here, I have learned a very useful Estonian proverb, \n     ``Think nine times, speak once.'' I have used the intervening \n     days since the story broke to think nine times about the past \n     and what would be useful to do about it in the present. I \n     would like to share my views.\n       First, let me make clear my own government's position. We \n     believe there is more for all of us to do to deal with the \n     crimes of the past, and the Holocaust is a crime of unique \n     proportions. A prominent political leader here implied last \n     week that the United States is satisfied that Estonia has \n     done all it needs to do to deal with the Holocaust. Just last \n     month, however, Heather Conley, the Department of State's \n     senior official responsible for the Baltic States called on \n     the Baltic States to do more to deal with the damage from the \n     Holocaust. The same is the case for the U.S. Senate. For \n     example, recently, Senator Biden, the Chairman of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, made a very strong statement \n     about his concern about the resurgence of anti-Semitism in \n     Europe and called on all countries aspiring to NATO \n     membership to ensure that ``the very ugly remnants of war-\n     time fascism . . . be totally and permanently suppressed.''\n       Estonia's World War II past was uniquely painful. The \n     country and its people were not given the freedom to choose \n     between good and evil. Terrible choices had to be made. \n     Estonia suffered terribly under two periods of Soviet \n     occupation as well as the Nazi German occupation. The fact \n     that the Soviet occupation did more direct harm in Estonia, \n     however, does not negate the fact that the Holocaust happened \n     here too. As the conclusions of the Estonian International \n     Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity \n     demonstrated, some Estonians bear responsibility for \n     participating in this evil. I believe all countries that \n     lived through the nightmare of the last century need to deal \n     with their crimes honestly and completely so that they cannot \n     be repeated in the future. We must face history, not hide \n     from it.\n       What does this mean with regard to Estonia's approach to \n     the Holocaust? I suggest the following very modest steps:\n       1. Do justice where justice is needed. Since \n     reindependence, no Estonian has been prosecuted for crimes \n     committed during the Holocaust. In part, that may be because \n     many were prosecuted during the Soviet period. But, there are \n     still Estonian candidates for prosecution. These individuals \n     should be pursued with the same vigor with which the state \n     still pursues those suspected of Soviet crimes. And the time \n     for this is now. The World War II generation is passing from \n     the scene. Witnesses to the crimes are dying. Both the \n     victims and the victimizers should see justice done before it \n     is too late.\n       2. Recognize the Holocaust is part of Estonia's history. \n     Compared to the other Baltic States, the states of Central \n     Europe and even some neutral states during World War II, the \n     Holocaust is less recognized as a part of the national \n     history in Estonia. The Holocaust took place here. About one \n     thousand Estonian Jews and even more non-Estonian Jews were \n     murdered in this country. Yet, the day of remembrance for the \n     Holocaust, Yom Hashoah, receives almost no notice in this \n     country. Many sites involving Holocaust crimes here are not \n     marked or remembered. A few sites have recently been \n     commemorated. This should continue.\n       3. Teach our children about the past. I have been told \n     Estonian school textbooks treat the Holocaust in about one-\n     and-a-half pages. If this is true for most of Estonia, I \n     would suggest that history texts on this subject already in \n     other states in this region be translated into Estonian for \n     use here. I understand such a step is already under \n     consideration by the government. I hope that the Estonian \n     Government follows the call of some Estonian NGO's to be more \n     involved in the Task Force for International Cooperation on \n     Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research, to which 11 \n     nations belong.\n       The evil of racism and anti-Semitism does not grow again \n     and again because the decent majority advocates it actively. \n     It returns because it is ignored or trivialized by the \n     majority until it reemerges in a new generation. Estonia has \n     emerged from a desolate past into a present full of promise, \n     thanks to the work of its people. But, to ensure a positive \n     future, I believe it essential that the\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\n     country address all aspects of the past soberly, \n     respectfully, honestly and with justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5283-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRANSITION TO DIGITAL TELEVISION\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to direct my \ncolleagues attention to the technological changes and developments \ngoing on in the television industry. Many people have said that the \ntransition from analog to digital television broadcasts is the biggest \ninnovation in TV since color television. Having seen a digital \nbroadcast, it is as if you are watching the program or sporting event \nin person. I believe consumers will want to bring this technology into \ntheir homes.\n  I do not believe that we have yet discovered the full use of digital \nbroadcast signals, but I do know that it has the potential to change \nthe way people interact with their TVs. Imagine being able to \nparticipate in realtime with a game show on television or being able to \n``chat'' with other viewers from around the country during a show. DTV \nmay provide the platform for a more interactive television experience.\n  I am particularly interested to see how these technologies can be \nemployed to allow local stations to better serve local communities. For \nthe past half-century, local broadcasters have provided valuable \nservices to their local communities. When disasters strike, important, \nlife saving information is often disseminated over the airwaves. Local \nstations also keep residents informed of community political issues, \nthereby engaging citizens in the local democratic process.\n  Since its inception, the broadcasting industry has been founded on \ntwo important concepts: the idea of localism and the idea that \nbroadcasting should be free, and over-the-air. I am proud to say that a \nnumber of Georgia stations are working to ensure that they continue to \nserve local communities with free, over the air signals in the digital \nera.\n  In my state, we have digital television stations up and broadcasting \nin four communities. In Atlanta seven stations have digital signals on \nthe air: WAGA, WATL, WGCL, WPXA, WSB, WTBS, and WXIA. In Savannah WTOC \nis on the air in digital; in Augusta WFXG and WRDW-TV are broadcasting \nin digital, and in Columbus, WLTZ and WXTX are serving Georgia viewers \nwith digital television. These Georgia broadcasters have taken the next \nstep in television, and for that I commend them. The transition to \ndigital can be expensive, particularly for smaller stations.\n  To broadcast in digital, these businesses have invested in new \ntransmission equipment and, in some cases, new broadcast towers. If \nthey choose to produce their own digital content, like digital local \nnews, they must invest in digital cameras and editing equipment. \nFinally, once their digital signal is on-the-air, the stations must pay \nthe bills to transmit two signals simultaneously to ensure viewers can \nreceive both a digital and analog broadcast.\n  Despite the expenses, these Georgia stations have recognized that \ndigital television is the future. I am confident that their investment \nin digital television will pay off and I commend them for leading the \ndigital television charge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5283-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE CARDINAL CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I thank and honor the \nCardinal Chapter of the American Red Cross of Henderson, Kentucky for \nthe selfless and tireless work they performed in aiding the victims of \nthe April 28th tornado which tore through Webster County, Kentucky.\n  Early Sunday on the morning of April 28th, an F3 classified tornado, \nwith winds up to 200 miles per hour, violently forced its way through \nProvidence, KY hitting at least 114 homes, completely destroying 32. In \nthe end, 26 people were taken to the hospital. In just a few moments, \nMother Nature had struck a blow against this normally quiet and \npeaceful town. People were left without homes and without adequate \nclothing and food supplies. They were also left without a sense of \nhope. However, this empty and lonely feeling would be short-lived. \nVolunteers from the Cardinal Chapter of the American Red Cross of \nHenderson, KY arrived on the scene just a few hours after the tornado \npassed through Providence.\n  Once on the scene, these volunteers wasted no time in setting up two \nshelters in Providence, providing victims with a roof, a hot meal, and \na shoulder to cry on. They also sent food trucks to the nearby town of \nIrvington once they found out its residents were still without \nelectricity hours after the storm had passed. Without the immediate \nassistance of the American Red Cross, many would have been left hungry \nwithout a home or clothing.\n  I aks that my fellow colleagues join me in thanking these men and \nwomen for their unwavering dedication and commitment to their fellow \ncitizens. They willingly gave up their time and left their families in \norder to be there physically and emotionally for people they have never \nmet before. I believe we all can learn something from their exemplary \nbehavior. Sometimes it takes the worst to bring out the best, and I \nthink this was the case on April 28.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5283-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING SOUTH CAROLINA'S DEBORAH CHAMBERS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

I am pleased one of \nour state's own was tapped as the 2001-2002 president of this \nprestigious organization.\n  The AANA represents 28,000 practicing Certified Registered Nurse \nAnesthetists. They administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics \ngiven to patients each year in the United States. They provide \nanesthesia for all types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia \nprovider in over two-thirds of rural hospitals.\n  Debbie has been a nurse anesthetist since 1981. She received both her \nanesthesia training and master's degree at the Medical University of \nSouth Carolina, in Charleston. She has been a solo practitioner since \n1993 at the Microsurgery Center in Anderson, as well as in both the \nGreenville Memorial Medical Center and the Saint Francis Bon Secours \nHospital System in Greenville. She also was the Clinical Coordinator at \nthe Medical University of South Carolina School of Nurse Anesthesia at \nGreenville Memorial Medical Center from 1988-2000. Even with her \ndemanding schedule, she has continued to be active on pharmaceutical \nadvisory panels to advance the practice of anesthesia.\n  Debbie has held various leadership positions in the AANA, and has \nused her experience and knowledge to help others.

Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe dauntless history, honor, and tradition of the 3rd Reconnaissance \nBattalion, U.S. Marines, whose lineage traces back nearly 60 years of \nvaliant service to our great Nation.\n  The contribution of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion is embodied in \nthe sign placed on top of the Battalion Mess Hall at Camp Reasoner \nwhich reads: ``We Lead the Division--Where the Division Goes We've \nBeen!''\n  While enjoying brief periods of respite, it was formed in September \n1942. It was sent immediately to the Pacific Theater and participated \nin World War II campaigns at Bougainville, Solomon Island, Guam, and \nIwo Jima. It was reactivated in March 1952 and deployed to Camp Gifu, \nJapan and later to Camp Hauge, Okinawa. Being reactivated again in \nApril 1958, it was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division, Fleet Marine \nForce. During Vietnam the unit was highly decorated with four Medals of \nHonor, 13 Navy Crosses, 86 Silver Stars, and many Purple Hearts awarded \nto Marines and Sailors. Additionally, the unit itself was awarded \nPresident Unit Citations, the Navy Unit Commendation, the Meritorious \nUnit Commendation, and earned other praise and recognition, as well.\n  While the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion has existed under different \ndesignations, its adherence to whatever\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nmission assigned is without question. We cannot take lightly their \nmeritorious service to our Nation. Nor, can we ever forget their \nadmirable and routinely valiant actions both individually and \ncollectively. They were not only pivotal to a successful combat effort, \nbut to establishing and maintaining the legacy for which the 3rd \nReconnaissance Battalion may be justifiably proud.\n  I join in expressing the respect, admiration, and grateful \nappreciation of our nation as members of the 3rd Reconnaissance \nBattalion Association gather for their reunion next month in Arlington, \nVA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5284-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FDA CONSOLIDATION AT WHITE OAK\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to continue to work for full funding of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, consolidation and improvement at White Oak, MD in \nfiscal year 2003. I strongly believe that ensuring the safety of \nAmerica's food and drug supply is a matter of national security. \nYesterday, Senator Hatch and I offered then withdrew an amendment that \nwe hoped would have provided the funding needed for this project which \nis vital to ensure the safety of America's food and drug supply. We are \ntold that the our amendment would have increased the cost of the \nhomeland security supplemental appropriations bill. However, we have \nbeen assured that Senators Dorgan and Campbell, the chair and ranking \nmembers of the Treasury General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, \nare committed to looking at trying to help to continue to find a way to \nfund the FDA consolidation at White Oak as a part of the fiscal year \n2003 appropriations process.\n  Why is completing this project vital? FDA's mission is to review and \nregulate more than $1 trillion worth of products, many of which are \nvital to human health. FDA cannot fulfill its mission because FDA has \nto work in obsolete facilities that are not equipped to handle today's \nadvanced laboratory and administrative functions. Currently, over 6,000 \nFDA employees are scattered among 40 different buildings at 20 \ndifferent locations in the Greater Washington, D.C. area. These \nfacilities are being consolidated into one integrated facility at the \nformer U.S. Naval Surface Weapons Center. Not only will the \nconsolidation greatly improve FDA's operating efficiencies, but timely \nconstruction of the new facilities also will save approximately $32 \nmillion per year in commercial lease costs. We need consolidate FDA on \none campus, just like the NIH and the CDC, in order for the FDA to take \nits place alongside these institutions as a world class health and food \nresearch and safety facility.\n  What is FDA's role in national security? The recent anthrax attacks \non U.S. citizens have heightened FDA's critical role in ensuring the \nsafety of our food and drug supplies. Indeed, the FDA is on the front \nlines of this effort and must have proper, modern facilities to enable \nthem to best perform their mission. The consolidation will provide \nstate-of-the-art laboratories and facilities for that mission.\n  What is the status of the project? Congress has already appropriated \n$146 million for the first phases of this vital project, fiscal year \n2000, $35 million; fiscal year 2001, $92.1 million; fiscal year 2002, \n$19.06 million. Construction has started on phase I, the laboratory for \nFDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. However, approximately \n$450 million is still needed to complete this vital project.\n  Why is full funding important? This project has already been delayed \ndue to funding cutbacks. If the General Services Administration's \nfiscal year 2003 construction request for FDA consolidations is not \nfully funded, completion of the consolidation will be delayed even \nfurther. These delays will add considerably to the overall cost of the \nproject due to inflation and other factors. For example, scheduled to \nbe constructed in phase III is the Center for Devices and Radiological \nHealth, CDRH. The CDRH laboratories are badly in need of improvements, \nbut FDA has been holding off such work in anticipation of building new \nlaboratories as part of the consolidation. Further delay, we are \nadvised, would likely necessitate FDA's spending several million \ndollars renovating the existing CDRH laboratories. These would be non-\nrecoverable costs.\n\n  What is the next step? We hope that your colleagues will agree that, \nfrom the perspectives of public safety and fiscal responsibility, we \ncan not afford to delay the timely completion of this project. We hope \nthat our colleagues will support full funding for FDA consolidation in \nfiscal year 2003. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch, Dorgan, and Campbell toward completing this \nproject which will provide better security of two of the most essential \ndaily needs of all Americans, our food and drugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5284-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM MAYER\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a man whose \nleadership is only surpassed in value to me by his friendship. Twenty-\nfive years ago, Mr. Jim Mayer played an important role in the creation \nof an innovative pilot program called ``Leadership VA.''\n  The program is designed to identify 70 leaders in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs each year, and to provide an enrichment of their \ncareer development through an intense leadership training experience. \nIn its 25 years of existence, Leadership VA has laid a foundation for a \nnetwork of VA leaders who share a deep commitment to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and to public service in its broadest sense. Today, 63 \npercent of all Central Office Senior Executive Service members have \ncompleted the program, as have 73 percent of all field leaders.\n  This success, though, did not happen by chance. Rather, it is a \ntribute to the hard work and forward thinking of Jim Mayer. Jim began \nhis VA career as Special Assistant for Vietnam Veterans Affairs to \nAdministrator Richard L. Roudebush in 1974, six years after beginning \nhis service in the U.S. Army as an infantry man in the 25th Division in \nVietnam.\n  Jim joined the Leadership VA staff as its Executive Director in April \nof 1998, but his relationship with LVA goes back to his time on the \nfirst Selection Committee in 1978.\n  Throughout his years at the VA, Jim has spent countless hours working \non behalf of veterans, striving to better conditions by improving the \nVA from within, but his accomplishments are not limited to his time at \nthe VA. He is a recipient of numerous awards including: 1977, VA \nMeritorious Service; 1981, VA Exceptional Service; 1991, Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Outstanding Volunteer; and, 1993, George Washington \nHonor Medal from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge for work as a \nvolunteer with Desert Shield/Desert Storm injured at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center.\n  For as long as I have known him, Jim Mayer has exemplified the term \n``public servant.'' He is a selfless individual who has always thought \nof his country before thinking about himself. In this day and age, few \npeople live that type of life, but, as President Theodore Roosevelt \nsaid, ``The test of our worth is the value of our service.''\n  I would like to thank Jim for his service, his dedication, and, above \nall else, for his friendship. He is an inspiration and a great \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5284-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5284-S5285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHAPLAIN TONY FIRMAN RETIRES FROM FLANDREAU INDIAN SCHOOL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Chaplain Tony Firman on the occasion of his retirement as \nChaplain at the Flandreau Indian School in Flandreau, SD.\n  Chaplain Firman has completed 35 years as Chaplain at Flandreau \nIndian School. After receiving his training at Blue Cloud Abbey in \nMarvin, South Dakota, Tony served at Flandreau Indian School as Student \nCoordinator of Religious Activities, a boys counselor, and as a \nreligious liaison between the students, staff and administration, area \nchurches and the Flandreau community.\n  He was selected as Flandreau Indian School Chaplain by \nrepresentatives from the Association of Christian Churches, which is \nmade up of representatives from each of the following denominations: \nUnited Presbyterian Church, United Church of Christ, United Methodist \nChurch, Lutheran\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nChurch in America, Episcopal Church, Catholic Church, Rapid City and \nSioux Falls Dioceses, Reformed Church in America, and Christian Church \nDesciples. The Flandreau Chaplaincy program was the first project to be \nsponsored by the Association of Christian Churches.\n  On the occasion of his retirement as a school Chaplain, I want to \ncongratulate Tony Firman for his tireless dedication to Flandreau \nIndian School, his commitment to finding the best in students, for \nhelping others with spiritual guidance, and for coordinating and \nsupporting religious activities. I also commend him for his valuable \nservice to the community over the years.\n  The lives of countless young people have been enormously enhanced by \nTony's talent and skill as Chaplain. The State of South Dakota is a \nbetter place because of his commitment to and passion for working with \nlocal youth. His achievements will certainly serve as a model for other \ntalented religious leaders throughout our State to emulate.\n  I wish Tony Firman the best on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5285-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING THE LADY GAMECOCKS FOR WINNING THE NCAA TRACK TITLE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, my colleagues who have heard me \ndebate fast track trade negotiating authority in the last month may be \nsurprised with what this senator from South Carolina is about to say. \nBut I rise today wishing to scream my lungs out in favor of fast track \nthat is the fast track of the University of South Carolina women's \ntrack and field team, who just won the NCAA title earlier this month. \nIt only goes to show you that fast track is alive and well in my state, \nso long as it's the right fast track.\n  I have followed Gamecock sports for more than seven decades. This day \nis particularly pleasing in that, as hard as this is to believe, it is \nthe first time South Carolina was won a national championship ever, in \nany sport, women's or men's.\n  I wish to congratulate the entire team of incredible athletes who \nworked hard all year to prepare for this. They won relays. They won \nindividually. They set new records, piling up points with depth in \nseveral of the events. It was a real team effort, as it should be.\n  I especially want to congratulate the Gamecock coach, Curtis Frye, \nwho recruited all these talented women and turned the program into a \ntrue powerhouse. He was just named the women's track coach of the year, \nand us faithful will obviously expect him to win that title every year \nnow.\n  One last point, as the Gamecocks are showing their best ever \nperformances on the field, they also are showing their best ever \nperformances in the classroom. It is important that we have champions \nacross the board, in academics and athletics, and I salute all \nUniversity of South Carolina athletes who have improved their academic \nperformance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5285-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar.\n\n       H.R. 2143.

We need to make sure that Medicare is strong, secure and \nimproved for the future.\n  The biggest gap in Medicare's coverage is it's lack of help with the \nhigh costs of prescription drugs. I feel strongly that we must move \nforward to provide seniors with an affordable, reliable Medicare \nprescription drug benefit this year. I call on our leadership to bring \nlegislation to the floor so that we can provide seniors with much \nneeded relief.\n  Another area that is in urgent need of improvement is the fairness of \nthe distribution of Medicare's payments and costs throughout the \nstates. The Medicare program is placing seniors and health care \nproviders in certain States at a severe disadvantage compared to other \nStates. There are currently unjustifiable inequities in the system that \naffect the way in which both seniors and health care professionals are \ntreated. Rather than rewarding States with healthy populations, that \nhave efficient, high quality health care practices, and practice health \ncare cost containment, the Medicare system is punishing these States.\n  For example, seniors enrolled in the Medicare program pay monthly \npart B\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\npremiums of $54 across the United States. Medicare part B premiums are \nset by law to cover 25 percent of total national Part B spending \nregardless of where one lives or how many services one uses. However, \ndata provided by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Medpac, \nshows that the amount of part B services seniors use state by state \nvaries significantly, from 70 percent of the national average to 128 \npercent of the national average. This is because in States like Iowa \nseniors lead healthier lifestyles and use fewer health care services \nand we have excellent health care providers who have always practiced \nefficient, conservative medicine. I believe that a health \npopulation, and an efficient health care system, should be rewarded \nunder the Medicare program; however the system has been established to \nachieve quite the opposite.\n\n  Not only do seniors in my State have higher Medicare part B premiums \nbecause of the higher number of services seniors receive in other \nstates, health care providers in my State are receiving the lowest \nreimbursement levels in the country. Iowa health care providers receive \n$3,053 on average per beneficiary, while the national average is \n$5,490, and the highest state receives over $7,000 per beneficiary. \nSenator Craig and I, along with a host of our colleagues, have \nintroduced a bipartisan bill called the Medicare Fairness in \nReimbursement Act, S. 1020, that would reduce this unjustified \ndisparity that serves to punish the health care providers in our states \nyear after year. Under the FAIR Act, no state would be under 95 percent \nof the national average, and no state would be over 105 percent of the \nnational average. A similar adjustment would be made for the part B \ngeographic payment indices.\n  We must work to alleviate the disparity that exists between states \nunder the Medicare program, before we drive those states into a crisis. \nWe can no longer ignore the direct and critical connection between \nprovider reimbursement under the Medicare program, and access to high \nquality health care for our seniors.\n  That is why today I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator \nCraig of Idaho in introducing legislation to increase fairness in \nMedicare part B premiums for seniors. Monthly Medicare premiums would \nbe set at 25 percent of projected total Medicare Part B costs for each \nstate, rather than nationally. For example, Minnesota seniors utilize \nthe least amount of part B services, 70 percent of the national \naverage. As a result, under our bill seniors in Minnesota would pay a \nmonthly premium of $38, instead of the current national premium of $54. \nSeniors in my home State of Iowa use 75 percent of the national average \nof part B services, and therefore, under this bill they would pay a \nmonthly premium of $41, rather than $54.\n  Our legislation is budget neutral. It would simply set Medicare \npremiums based on state level costs rather than an aggregated national \ncost figure.\n  It is common sense. If a person in Iowa goes out and buys car \ninsurance, or health insurance for themselves, they will pay different \npremiums than someone buying insurance in New York or California. It's \ntime for the Medicare program to stop punishing those States that have \nhealthy seniors and efficient health care providers.\n  We need to restore greater fairness in Medicare's payment among the \n50 States. However until we achieve greater equity, seniors in low cost \nStates should not have to bear an unfair portion of health care costs. \nSenator Craig and I will be working to get this issue addressed as a \npart of Medicare reforms this year. I urge my colleagues to review this \nimportant new proposal and to join us in working to achieve its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2606. A bill to require the Secretary of Labor to establish a \ntrade adjustment assistance program for certain service workers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake truckers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA. A similar \nprovision was in the original Finance Committee package of trade \nlegislation that we recently considered in the Senate. Unfortunately, \nthis provision was removed in last minute negotiations.\n  Currently, Mexican trucks bring goods into the United States must \ntransfer those goods to an American truck at the border. On June 30, \n2002, that will change. Mexican trucks will be allowed into the \ncountry, and as a result, hard-working Americans will lose their jobs. \nFuture trade agreements may make the problem even greater. However, \nthese laid-off truckers will not be eligible for TAA.\n  TAA exists out of recognition that our decision on trade in \nWashington cause very specific groups of American workers to lose jobs. \nTAA provides those workers with the assistance they need to \nsuccessfully transition to new jobs.\n  New trade rules that allow foreign truckers to operate in the United \nStates beginning June 30, 2002 will cause an American trucker to lose \nhis or her job just as much as new trade rules cause a textile worker \nto lose his or her job. Providing TAA assistance to both of these \ngroups of workers is right because neither lost their job through any \nfault of their own--both will have lost their job as a result of new \nrules we create in Washington.\n  American union truck drivers are some of the hardest working and \nfinest paid in the world. They make about $50,000 a year as a starting \nsalary and receive great benefits. And nonunion drivers make $35,000 to \n$40,000 a year plus benefits. Compare these figures with the salaries \nof foreign truckers that will now operate in the United States or going \nto operate in the United States in the near future. Mexican drivers \nmake dramatically less than American truckers, about $18,000 a year at \nbest and few benefits. They are also allowed to drive recklessly long \nhours at that low pay. American truckers cannot compete with that. \nThose who lose their jobs as a result of this new competition allowed \nfor by trade law should have access to TAA assistance.\n  The legislation I am introducing will direct the Secretary of Labor \nto establish a program to provide TAA assistance to any domestic \noperator of a motor carrier who is adversely affected by competition \nfrom any foreign owned or operated motor carrier. The act also directs \nthe Secretary of labor to report to Congress within 2 years on \nadversely affected service workers and recommend legislation that the \nSecretary considers appropriate for extending TAA to service workers as \nwell.\n  The TAA program will remain inadequate as long as any workers are \nlosing jobs directly as a result of trade agreements and not getting \nthe help they need to participate in the new economy. The trade debate \nhas not adequately considered the fate of those who lose from trade. It \nis our responsibility to make sure that these hard-working Americans \nhave a voice in this debate and that they and their families are able \nto reap the rewards of trade instead of just suffer its consequences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\n     United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. ____02. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.\n\n       A health care lawsuit may be commenced no later than 3 \n     years after the date of injury or 1 year after the claimant \n     discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should \n     have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no \n     event shall the time for commencement of a health care \n     lawsuit exceed 3 years, except that in the case of an alleged \n     injury sustained by a minor before the age of 6, a health \n     care lawsuit may be commenced by or on behalf of the minor \n     until the later of 3 years from the date of injury, or the \n     date on which the minor attains the age of 8.\n\n     SEC. ____03. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, the \n     full amount of a claimant's economic loss may be fully \n     recovered without limitation.\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care \n     lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered may be \n     as much as $250,000, regardless of the number of parties \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit, an award for future noneconomic damages \n     shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not \n     be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. \n     An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall \n     be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by \n     amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such \n     reduction shall be made before accounting for any other \n     reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards are \n     rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the \n     combined awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic \n     damages shall be reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility. A separate judgment shall be \n     rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to \n     such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact \n     shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each \n     party for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. ____04. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to \n     Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall \n     supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect \n     against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of \n     reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid \n     to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in \n     which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in \n     the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall \n     have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage \n     recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to \n     the claimant based upon the interests of justice and \n     principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all \n     contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health \n     care lawsuit exceed the following limits:\n       (1) 40 percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (2) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (3) 25 percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (4) 15 percent of any amount by which the recovery by the \n     claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.\n       (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall \n     apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, \n     mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative \n     dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a \n     minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to \n     authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum \n     permitted under this section.\n\n     SEC. ____05. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n       In any health care lawsuit, any party may introduce \n     evidence of collateral source benefits. If a party elects to \n     introduce such evidence, any opposing party may introduce \n     evidence of any amount paid or contributed or reasonably \n     likely to be paid or contributed in the future by or on \n     behalf of the opposing party to secure the right to such \n     collateral source benefits. No provider of collateral source \n     benefits shall recover any amount against the claimant or \n     receive any lien or credit against the claimant's recovery or \n     be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the \n     claimant in a health care lawsuit. This section shall apply \n     to any health care lawsuit that is settled as well as a \n     health care lawsuit that is resolved by a fact finder.\n\n     SEC. ____06. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise \n     permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded \n     against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is \n     proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person \n     acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that \n     such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury \n     that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain \n     to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for \n     compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no \n     punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in \n     such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be \n     included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court \n     may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive \n     damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a \n     finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing \n     affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, \n     that the claimant has established by a substantial \n     probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for \n     punitive damages. At the request of any party in a health \n     care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate \n     proceeding--\n       (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (2) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages, the trier of fact shall consider only the \n     following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may be up to as much as two times \n     the amount of economic damages awarded or $250,000, whichever \n     is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this \n     limitation.\n       (c) No Civil Monetary Penalties for Products That Comply \n     With FDA Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--No punitive damages may be awarded against \n     the manufacturer or distributor of a medical product based on \n     a claim that such product caused the claimant's harm where--\n       (A)(i) such medical product was subject to premarket \n     approval or clearance by the Food and Drug Administration \n     with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance \n     of the aspect of such medical product which caused the \n     claimant's harm or the adequacy of the packaging or labeling \n     of such medical product; and\n       (ii) such medical product was so approved or cleared; or\n       (B) such medical product is generally recognized among \n     qualified experts as safe and effective pursuant to \n     conditions established by the Food and Drug Administration \n     and applicable Food and Drug Administration regulations, \n     including without limitation those related to packaging and \n     labeling.\n       (2) Liability of health care providers.--A health care \n     provider who prescribes a drug or device (including blood \n     products) approved by the Food and Drug Administration shall \n     not be named as a party to a product liability lawsuit \n     involving such drug or device and shall not be liable to a \n     claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, \n     distributor, or product seller of such drug or device.\n       (3) Packaging.--In a health care lawsuit for harm which is \n     alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or \n     labeling of a\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n     drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging \n     under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (including labeling regulations related to such \n     packaging), the manufacturer or product seller of the drug \n     shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless such \n     packaging or labeling is found by the trier of fact by clear \n     and convincing evidence to be substantially out of compliance \n     with such regulations.\n       (4) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any health \n     care lawsuit in which--\n       (A) a person, before or after premarket approval or \n     clearance of such medical product, knowingly misrepresented \n     to or withheld from the Food and Drug Administration \n     information that is required to be submitted under the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) \n     or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     262) that is material and is causally related to the harm \n     which the claimant allegedly suffered; or\n       (B) a person made an illegal payment to an official of the \n     Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of either \n     securing or maintaining approval or clearance of such medical \n     product.\n\n     SEC. ____07. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO \n                   CLAIMANTS IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of \n     future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling \n     or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient \n     insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such \n     a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, \n     enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by \n     periodic payments in accordance with the Uniform Periodic \n     Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National \n     Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.\n       (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions \n     which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the \n     effective date of this title.\n\n     SEC. ____08.

Sense of the Senate on Compensation to Producers \n     of Poultry Affected by Avian Influenza. It is the Sense of \n     the Senate that the Secretary of Agriculture act \n     expeditiously to provide compensation through the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation to producers of poultry that have been \n     affected by outbreaks of avian influenza in Virginia, West \n     Virginia, and other States which have resulted in the \n     destruction of poultry flocks in order to contain this \n     disease.\n       Sec. 104. (a) Findings.--(1) Of the 40 million people \n     living with HIV/AIDS, nearly 2.7 million are children under \n     15, and 11.8 million are young people aged 15-24, more than \n     540,000 children were infected in mother-to-child \n     transmission in 2000, and a baby born to an HIV-positive \n     mother has a 25 to 35 percent chance of becoming infected.\n       (2) Targeted provision of dairy products for HIV/AIDS \n     mitigation provides an economical and efficient means to \n     strengthen nutrition, ward off infectious diseases and extend \n     the lives of HIV-positive individuals.\n       (3) Good nutrition including dairy products is critical to \n     programs that provide and enhance anti-retroviral drugs to \n     prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, and \n     nutrition experts recommend the use of dairy products with \n     anti-retroviral drugs to combat mother-to-child transmission.\n       (4) In the diets of young children, growing adolescents and \n     pregnant women, milk has been proven to provide a \n     concentration of critical nutritional elements that promote \n     growth and robust health, and the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) recommends that dairy products be used to boost \n     the nutrition of HIV-positive young children.\n       (5) It is imperative that attempts to improve the \n     availability of dairy products to the HIV/AIDS afflicted do \n     not undermine the security and stability of the indigenous \n     dairy production and processing sector.\n       (6) The United States has more than 1 billion pounds \n     (450,000 metric tons) of surplus non-fat dry milk in storage \n     that has been acquired at an average cost of over 90 cents \n     per pound for a total cost approaching $1,000,000,000, and \n     storage costs are $1,500,000 per month and growing.\n       (7) This huge amount of milk overhangs the United States \n     and world markets and deteriorates rapidly, going out of \n     condition in about 3\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\n     years when it must be sold for a salvage value of only a few \n     cents per pound.\n       (8) The impacts of breast-feeding on mother-to-child \n     transmission remain controversial and appropriate \n     interventions are not yet scientifically proven, especially \n     in low-income communities where appropriate alternatives are \n     not available and may be unsafe.\n       (9) There is a need for non-fat dry milk in international \n     relief to use in human feeding programs that target the most \n     vulnerable in society, particularly those affected by HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of Agriculture should--\n       (1) utilize the existing 416(b) authority of the \n     Agricultural Act of 1949 to dispose of dairy surpluses for \n     direct feeding programs to mothers and children living with \n     HIV/AIDS and communities heavily impacted by the HIV/AIDS \n     pandemic;\n       (2) make available funds for the provision of 100,000 \n     metric tons of surplus non-fat dry milk to combat HIV/AIDS, \n     with a special focus on HIV-positive mothers and children, to \n     include ocean and inland transportation, accounting, \n     monitoring and evaluation expenses incurred by the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, and expenses incurred by private and \n     voluntary organizations and cooperatives related to market \n     assessments, project design, fortification, distribution, and \n     other project expenses;\n       (3) give careful consideration to the local market \n     conditions before dairy products are donated or monetized \n     into a local economy, so as not to undermine the security and \n     stability of the indigenous dairy production and processing \n     sector; and\n       (4) Use none of these funds or commodities in any programs \n     that would substitute dairy products for breast-feeding.\n       Sec. 105. (a) Rescission.--The unobligated balance of \n     authority available under section 2108(a) of Public Law 107-\n     20 is rescinded as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Appropriation.--There is appropriated to the Secretary \n     of Agriculture an amount equal to the unobligated balance \n     rescinded by subsection (a) for expenses through fiscal year \n     2003 under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1721-1726a) for commodities \n     supplied in connection with dispositions abroad pursuant to \n     title II of said Act.\n       Sec. 106. Section 416(b)(7)(D)(iv) of the Agricultural Act \n     of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431(b)(7)(D)(iv)) is amended by striking \n     ``subsection.'' and inserting in lieu thereof the following: \n     ``subsection, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this \n     subsection.''.\n       Sec. 107. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     may use an amount not to exceed $12,000,000 from the amounts \n     appropriated under the heading Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service under the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \n

Director of the Office of Management and Budget based on \n     documentation provided by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n                               CHAPTER 2\n\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\n     David Scheffer stated that the United States could not sign \n     the Rome Statute because certain critical negotiating \n     objectives of the United States had not been achieved. As a \n     result, he stated: ``We are left with consequences that do \n     not serve the cause of international justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. 3003. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   TITLE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections 3005 and 3007.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 3005 and 3007 for a single period of \n     1 year. A waiver under this subsection may be issued only if \n     the President at least 15 days in advance of exercising such \n     authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court has entered \n     into a binding agreement that--\n       (A) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) covered United States persons;\n       (ii) covered allied persons; and\n       (iii) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n       (B) ensures that no person described in subparagraph (A) \n     will be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or \n     on behalf of the International Criminal Court.\n       (b) Authority To Extend Waiver of Sections 3005 and 3007.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 3005 and 3007 for successive periods \n     of 1 year each upon the expiration of a previous waiver \n     pursuant to subsection (a) or this subsection. A waiver under \n     this subsection may be issued only if the President at least \n     15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court--\n       (A) remains party to, and has continued to abide by, a \n     binding agreement that--\n       (i) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n\n       (I) covered United States persons;\n       (II) covered allied persons; and\n       (III) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n\n       (ii) ensures that no person described in clause (i) will be \n     arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf \n     of the International Criminal Court; and\n       (B) has taken no steps to arrest, detain, prosecute, or \n     imprison any person described in clause (i) of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (c) Authority To Waive Sections 3004 and 3006 With Respect \n     to an Investigation or Prosecution of a Named Individual.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 3004 and 3006 to the degree such \n     prohibitions and requirements would prevent United States \n     cooperation with an investigation or prosecution of a named \n     individual by the International Criminal Court. A waiver \n     under this subsection may be issued only if the President at \n     least 15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (A) a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 3005 and 3007 is in \n     effect;\n       (B) there is reason to believe that the named individual \n     committed the crime or crimes that are the subject of the \n     International Criminal Court's investigation or prosecution;\n       (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for \n     the International Criminal Court's investigation or \n     prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and\n       (D) in investigating events related to actions by the named \n     individual, none of the following persons will be \n     investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned \n     by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) Covered United States persons.\n       (ii) Covered allied persons.\n       (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons.\n       (d) Termination of Waiver Pursuant to Subsection (c).--Any \n     waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 3004 and 3006 shall \n     terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection \n     (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections \n     3005 and 3007 expires and is not extended pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (e) Termination of Prohibitions of This Title.--The \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 3004, 3005, 3006, \n     and 3007 shall cease to apply, and the authority of section \n     3008 shall terminate, if the United States becomes a party to \n     the International Criminal Court pursuant to a treaty made \n     under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3004.

RURAL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Rural \n     Service Improvement Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State of Alaska is the largest State in the Union \n     and has a very limited system of roads connecting \n     communities.\n       (2) Alaska has more pilots per capita than any other State \n     in the Union.\n       (3) Pilots flying in Alaska are often the most skilled and \n     best-prepared pilots in the world.\n       (4) Air travel within the State of Alaska is often hampered \n     by severe weather conditions and treacherous terrain.\n       (5) The United States Government owns nearly \\2/3\\ of \n     Alaska's landmass, including large tracts of land separating \n     isolated communities within the State.\n       (6) Such Federal ownership has inhibited the ability of \n     Alaskans to build roads connecting isolated communities.\n       (7) Most communities and a large portion of the population \n     within the State can only be reached by air.\n       (8) The vast majority of food items and everyday \n     necessities destined for these isolated communities and \n     populations can only be transported through the air.\n       (9) The Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system, created by \n     Congress and operated by the United States Postal Service \n     under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code, with \n     input from the Department of Transportation, connecting \n     hundreds of rural and isolated communities within the State, \n     is a critical piece of the Alaska and the national \n     transportation system. The system is like a 4-legged stool, \n     designed to--\n       (A) provide the most affordable means of delivering food \n     and everyday necessities to these rural and isolated \n     communities;\n       (B) establish a system whereby the Postal Service can meet \n     its obligations to deliver mail to every house and business \n     in America;\n       (C) support affordable and reliable passenger service; and\n       (D) support affordable and reliable nonmail freight \n     service.\n       (10) Without the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system--\n       (A) it would be difficult and more expensive for the Postal \n     Service to meet its obligation of delivering mail to every \n     house and business in America; and\n       (B) food, medicine, freight, and everyday necessities and \n     passenger service for these rural and isolated communities \n     would cost several times the current level.\n       (11) Attempts by Congress to support passenger and nonmail \n     freight service in Alaska using the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail \n     system have yielded some positive results, but some carriers \n     have been manipulating the system by carrying few, if any, \n     passengers and little nonmail\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\n     freight while earning most of their revenues from the \n     carriage of nonpriority bypass mail.\n       (12) As long as the Federal Government continues to own \n     large tracts of land within the State of Alaska which impedes \n     access across these lands to connect isolated communities, it \n     is in the best interest of the Postal Service, the residents \n     of Alaska and the United States--\n       (A) to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system \n     remains strong, viable, and affordable for the Postal \n     Service;\n       (B) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated \n     communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, \n     and safe passenger service;\n       (C) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated \n     communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, \n     and safe nonmail freight service;\n       (D) to encourage that intra-Alaska air carriers move toward \n     safer, more secure, and more reliable air transportation \n     under the Federal Aviation Administration's guidelines and in \n     accordance with part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, where such operations are supported by the needs \n     of the community; and\n       (E) that Congress, pursuant to the authority granted under \n     Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution to \n     establish Post Offices and post roads, make changes to ensure \n     that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system continues to be used \n     to support substantial passenger and nonmail freight service \n     and to reduce costs for the Postal Service.\n       (c) Selection of Carriers of Nonpriority Bypass Mail to \n     Certain Points in Alaska.--\n       (1) Definitions.--Section 5402 of title 39, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (e);\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (a) through (d) as \n     subsections (b) through (e), respectively;

Madam President, I will have more to say about the so-\ncalled hate crimes legislation tomorrow.\n  This is a very important cloture vote we are having tomorrow. I am \ndisappointed that we have not had more opportunities to debate \namendments. This bill has been pending, yet no one has come forward to \noffer amendments.\n  It makes my point as we file cloture. We indicated a concern for the \nreports that had been shared with us that some of our colleagues wished \nto offer--I think the phrase was--``hundreds of amendments'' to the \nhate crimes bill. We are working under very tight time constraints.\n  It is my belief that we ought to have an opportunity to offer \namendments, to have the debate on the amendments, to bring those \namendments to closure, and then have a vote on the hate crimes bill. I \nhave heard colleagues in the Chamber on the other side of the aisle say \nthis has never happened before. If it has not been submitted, tomorrow \nwe will submit for the Record the number of times our Republican \ncolleagues did exactly what we did. I think it was 34 times--34 times \nthe bill was offered, and cloture was filed immediately. I do not know \nhow many of those times the Republican leader--the majority leader at \nthe time--chose to fill the parliamentary tree as well, denying and \nprecluding Democrats and others from offering amendments to the bill. \nThis is by far not the first time.\n  I announced at the very beginning of my tenure as majority leader \nthat I would never fill the tree to preclude amendments. And I am going \nto hold to that promise. But there are times when in order to move \nlegislation along, filing cloture on a bill is important. I intend to \ndo that again this afternoon. It is unfortunate. But we are going to \nhave to increase the debt limit. The administration has made its case \npublicly. They have talked to me privately on numerous occasions about \nthe importance of increasing the debt limit.\n  We can go into all the reasons it is necessary. But in an effort not \nto at least now politicize the issue, I think it is important for us to \nget the job done. It is the responsible thing to do.\n  We are going to take up the debt limit and send it to the House as \nquickly as possible because time is running out. We are told that we \nonly have a couple of weeks. We have to address this issue in that \nperiod of time.\n  If we fail cloture tomorrow on hate crimes, it will be my intention \nto move as quickly as possible to the debt limit legislation. That will \nrequire procedural cooperation. I am hopeful that we can get procedural \ncooperation. The Republican leader and I talked today. It would be my \nhope to get a unanimous consent agreement to take it up. Failing that, \nof course, we would then have to go through the motion to proceed, and \nthen the bill itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/10/senate-section/article/S5316-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5316-S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INCREASING THE PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
