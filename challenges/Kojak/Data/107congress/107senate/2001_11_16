In the midst of the \nproblems we face at this time, we need the refreshing rejuvenation that \ncomes when we turn from our trials and focus on thanksgiving for all \nblessings. You have shown us that gratitude is not only the greatest of \nall virtues but the parent of all others. Any achievement without \ngratitude limps along the road of life; anything we accomplish without \ngiving thanks becomes a source of pride. You desire our gratitude \nbecause You know it helps us grow; other people never tire of feeling \nthe affirmation that is communicated when we express our thankfulness \nfor them; and we require gratitude to avoid being self-serving and \narrogant.\n  O God, we praise You for this Nation of freedom and democracy. We \nrepent of our pride that entertains the idea that we are in charge of \nthe destiny of this land. Grant us the true humility that comes from \nacknowledging that You are the source of all we have and are. Now we \nare ready to thank You in advance for Your help in the resolution of \nthe problems we face in this present crisis.

Mr. President, we are all awaiting the bill that we \nhave all worked so hard to produce this week, the Aviation Security \nAct. I will not speak about that act because, obviously, we have others \nwho have worked very hard on the bill. We want to make sure that \neveryone is able to speak for or against it before we pass it. But the \ngood news is, we are going to pass it.\n  I did want to take this opportunity, though, during morning business \nto mention a bill that passed last night. It is a bill that was \ncosponsored by every woman in the Senate. There are 13 women in the \nSenate. All of us cosponsored this bill. It is to make sure that the \nCongress speaks on the priorities that we believe are imperative as we \ngive aid to Afghanistan, that women be included in that aid.\n  As so many of us know, the Taliban treated women especially cruelly, \nnot allowing them access to health care. Not allowing a male doctor to \nsee a woman effectively kept women out of the system because women are \nnot allowed to work, and therefore female doctors are not allowed to \npractice under the Taliban.\n  In addition, women have not been able to go outside their homes \nwithout a male escort, so many times a widow would not be able to get \nthe food necessary to feed her children or the health care for her \nchildren.\n  Women were not allowed to be educated under the Taliban, so we see 5- \nand 6-year-old girls who have had no education whatsoever because they \nhave lived under the Taliban regime.\n  The bill that passed unanimously in the Senate last night spoke to \nthose issues to say we want United States aid to be especially there \nfor the people of Afghanistan as we rebuild the country.\n  We are seeing the Taliban flee. Thank goodness they are fleeing. But \nwe want to make sure that we start playing catchup, that we give women \nand young girls the chance to be educated along with the young boys, \nthat we bring women doctors in especially to give access to health care \nfor the women of Afghanistan.\n  The mortality rate of children in Afghanistan is stunning. It is 25 \npercent. The mortality rate for children in that country is 25 percent. \nThe major cause of that mortality rate, in the 21st century, is \ncontaminated food and water. That is the most stunning statistic of \nall. In the 21st century, when clean water and uncontaminated food is \nuniversally available throughout the world, that 25 percent of the \nchildren would be dying from dysentery and contaminated food and bad \nwater is just the saddest of all statistics.\n  So we do want to go in fast and try to stem the tide of the mortality \nof children and women, and make sure that young boys and young girls \nare treated equally in education, that women have a chance to \nparticipate in a new government that hopefully would be a government of \nthe people of Afghanistan that includes all of the tribes of that \ncountry.\n  I am very proud that the women of the Senate came together to speak \nespecially forcefully on this issue. We did pass the bill last night. \nSo I am very pleased that we were able to persuade Senator Wellstone to \nraise his hold on the bill, which I thought was an unfair hold. I did \nnot appreciate that he would take a bill such as this hostage for \nanother bill that he had, but, nevertheless, he did, and so it took us \n2 weeks to pass a bill which should have been passed in minutes.\n  Having said that, I do want to say, I am very proud of the women of \nthe Senate for coming together to highlight this issue, to speak with \none voice, and to say that U.S. aid will always be there for women as \nwell as men on an equal basis, for girls as well as boys on an equal \nbasis.\n  So I am proud that we passed the bill. It now goes to the House \nRepresentative Deborah Pryce is working with Democratic and Republican \nwomen on the House side to try to see that this bill goes through on an \nexpedited basis to support our President in putting forth more aid for \nAfghanistan that will be equally distributed among the population.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici and Mr. Bond pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1717 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this Senator be recognized following the remarks of the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak and use whatever time I may consume. I do not think I will go \npast 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, it is not my intention \nto object except that I understand Senator Dorgan sought, by unanimous \nconsent, to be recognized. The bill is now here. I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be no more than 10 minutes for each of the speakers \nso that we can get to the bill in due course.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the current order. The \nSenator from Montana sought to modify that order. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Montana \nwill agree to speak for no more than 10 minutes, as will the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. Do they agree to speak no more than 10 minutes so we \ncan get to the bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree to that request. I also want to speak on the \nbill. I understand when the bill arrives there will be comments by the \nchairman, by Senator Hutchison, and others. I want to make a comment \nabout the farm bill. In fact, I will be glad to keep that to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is important when the bill is ready that we \nproceed to it so we can pass it back to the House to stay on time.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the airport security bill is \nready. I am going to be speaking on something else, but it is my intent \nto allow the committee to proceed so the Senate can consider this bill. \nI am going to speak on the airport security legislation, but I will \nmake the remarks on the farm bill following this action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11974-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11974-S11985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Under a unanimous consent agreement, I call up the \nconference report on the bill, S. 1447, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1447), ``to improve aviation security, and for other \n     purposes,'' having met have agreed that the Senate recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the House, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nNovember 16, 2001.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nnow 90 minutes of debate evenly divided between the chairman and \nranking member.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I first want to thank Sam Whitehorn, who is now changing clothes to \ncome to the Chamber, and Kevin Kayes. Both Sam Whitehorn and Kevin \nKayes are on my Commerce Committee staff. They have been working hard \nall night\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nlong, even with the breakdown of the computer at 5 a.m., to get these \ndocuments ready for consideration. They have been working over the past \n6 weeks, ever since September 11.\n  Secondly, I thank the New York Times. The headline today is: \n``Congress Agrees to U.S. Takeover For Air Security.'' In a line, this \nwill do more to stimulate air travel and rejuvenate the economy than \nany one single thing, and that is what we have been trying to do as \nwell as institute safety.\n  I thank my distinguished counterpart, Senator McCain, who has been \nsticking with us. We fought a good fight right down to the wire, and in \na general sense we prevailed in that it is not a compromise on safety.\n  There is an old Roman canon, XII, salus populi suprema lex esto, \n``the safety of the people is the supreme law,'' and that is the way we \napproach this. We were not concerned about contractors; we were not \nconcerned about flexibility; we were concerned about accountability; we \nwere concerned about safety. There is just no way, and should not be, \nto compromise safety. That was the difficulty of this particular task.\n  It has been a long, hard road. I started on this effort over 20 years \nago, back in the late 1980s with Pan Am 103, TWA 800, and on and again. \nThere were commissions, hearings, more hearings and commissions, \nstandards, more training, more testing, more oversight, and on \nSeptember 11 we ended up with criminals doing the screening and 5,000 \ndead.\n  So that sobered us up. Senator McCain and I went right to work. We \nhad a full day of hearings. We now have a measure before us in this \nconference report sought for by the airline pilots, the flight \nattendants, the Air Transport Association, the airport managers, the \nBusiness Airline Coalition, the mayors, the Governors and everyone \nelse. The media have been wonderful in that respect because we have the \npeople behind us.\n  They have said time and again they were willing to pay up to $25 or \nmore per ticket to get airline security. This is only $2.50 with a cap \nof $5 on any one flight.\n  But I think the people ought to understand what has been going on for \nyears on end. The FAA thought its task was in the main to promote air \ntravel and, on many occasions, sacrificed safety. For instance, the \nInspector General attested before Congress the day before yesterday, \nless than 5 percent of the baggage is screened.\n  We have seen only today at Logan Airport they had to fire, or \nsuspend, I should say, the security contractor because his screener \nwent to sleep at the switch and they do not know how many people got \nthrough during that slumber. They had to call everybody back in from \nthe planes and go through security again. Security lapses have \npersisted, but they will not persist any longer because we now have \nfederalization.\n  At our hearing, we called in El Al. We had testimony from the Israeli \nsecurity agency, the chief pilot of El Al. I can hear that chief pilot. \nHe said: Senator, when we secure that cockpit door, and it is a secure-\ntype door, it is never to be opened in flight.\n\n  He said: Even if my wife is being assaulted in the cabin, I don't \nopen the door. I land that plane and law enforcement is there to meet \nme.\n  That has stopped hijacking at El Al. They have not had one for 30 \nyears. All these folks running around hollering about the European \nmodel--in the last 8 years they have had 20. We didn't model this after \nEurope. We modeled it after El Al.\n  You can see the comprehensive nature, when you listen to their \nparticular procedure. They not only screen the passengers and screen \nthe baggage and everything else, but they have a double-check at the \ntime of enplanement. They have a total background check and security of \nthe tarmac itself. This approach prevents someone from getting a \nticket, having their seat assigned and then calling some plant out on \nthe tarmac that has been working there and say: Tape a loaded pistol on \nflight so-and-so, and go out there. So you have to use absolute care \nwith the caterers, the mechanics, those who have access to the planes, \nand the perimeter of the airport itself. It is a sort of seamless web.\n  When the news media talks of compromises between the House and \nSenate--let me put it this way: There is no compromise on safety. That \nis my emphasis now. With respect to the particular items, since others \nwant to be addressing the body at this time, I encourage Senators and \nthe public to review the content of the conference report in the \nCongressional Record following passage by the House of Representatives.\n  Let me just say this. I will never forget it. We were taught at law \nschool that Jackson told Marshall: The Court has made its decision. Let \nhim enforce it.\n  I don't want to sound abrupt, but the Congress has made its decision. \nNow let the administration, the President, enforce it.\n  I say that advisedly because our Chief Executive has been all over \nthe lot. That is one of the disturbances we had. We were told he would \nsign our bill that passed 100 to 0. Then they put the entire White \nHouse in behind Mr. Delay, changing the votes, changing the votes over \nhere on the Senate side. Although Senators just had voted as a group of \n100, part of that group changed their votes and everything else of that \nkind. We had, momentarily, total chaos. Now the President says he signs \nit.\n  Let me make this comment: We can make it work. We are going to have \noversight. We are going to keep their feet to the fire. But he has to \nput in a hard charger, a Stormin' Norman or somebody as the Deputy \nSecretary of Security for Transportation. If you get a person of that \nilk, he will come there and he is going to get the job done. But if it \nis going to be business as usual and worrying--as I heard the Secretary \nsay in one of the conferences he had--he said: Wait a minute, now, if \nwe have that kind of security requirements in Anchorage, we will lose \nthe business in Anchorage and they will fly to Vancouver--literally.\n  I said: Come on, man, whenever they come to America, whether it is in \nAnchorage or down in Seattle or whatever, they are going to get this \nkind of check.\n  But you can see the culture, the mindset. So you have to have someone \nwith a strong mindset as the Deputy Secretary of Security in this \nparticular department to carry forward this initiative.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee with whom I have worked many years on a broad variety of \nimportant issues. I have to say, and I think the chairman would agree, \nthis is one of the more important issues that we have had the privilege \nof working on together. It has been a very long and difficult process--\na very difficult process.\n  My distinguished chairman often quotes Latin. I would like to quote \none back that would describe what we just went through: ``Illegitimus \nnon carborundum,'' which I will not translate for the Record. But the \nfact is, this was a tough process and we did come out with the \nparamount aspect of this challenge of safety being addressed.\n  The Senate bill, the major provisions, were adopted. I thank our \ncolleagues on the House side who were faced with some very difficult \npressures, too, who finally came to this agreement.\n  Madam President, this legislation will install air marshals where \nneeded on airplanes. It will call for reinforced cockpit doors. It will \nauthorize pilots to carry guns with the approval of the new Under \nSecretary and the area carriers. It will provide for a new independent \nsecurity agency for all modes of transportation, with significant \nauthority to expedite new technology. New technology is going to solve \na lot of the problems that we have today with delays and problems with \npeople being able to get on and off airplanes.\n  There will be uniform and rigorous standards. There will be a full \nfederalization over 1 year of every airport in America, unless five \nchoose to opt out, in five categories in America.\n  Law enforcement is a proper function of the Federal Government. Law \nenforcement will be carried out by Federal employees. That is the case \nin these airports.\n  What will the signature of the President of the United States do? It \nwill do\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\ntwo things: No. 1, on the substantive side we will begin a process, \nwhich will take at least a year, of increasing airport security, of \nputting in place procedures and individuals who will allow Americans \nmuch greater, dramatically enhanced safety and security in airports and \non airliners.\n  But what else does it do? We all know the reality today is many \nAmericans will not get on an airliner because they do not feel any \nconfidence that they are safe and secure in doing so. When the \nPresident of the United States signs this bill and looks the American \npeople in the eye and says we are now embarked on an all-out effort to \ndo everything your Government can to make you safe and secure, I think \nthat will have a major impact on the American people and will move \nforward in restoring the confidence of the American people.\n  So I think this legislation is both substantively and from perception \na very critical piece of legislation. We all know that unless airline \ntraffic and passengers are restored to previously levels, our economy \nis going to continue to suffer, not to mention the very vital security \nand safety aspects involved. Not everything that everybody wanted was \nin it, although I would certainly say we got about 95 percent.\n  As usually happens, sometimes we add things we should not. I want to \ntake a minute to talk about it. There are some liability provisions \nwhich are put into this bill, some of them perhaps warranted, some \nperhaps not warranted, covering aircraft manufacturers, the World Trade \nCenter, some limit on liability in New York City, et cetera. As I say, \nthere could be some beneficial aspects of these provisions, but we \nshould be addressing liability in its entirety. We should not be \naddressing liability on this issue. We need the appropriate committee--\nwhich I guess is the Judiciary Committee and also to some degree the \nCommerce Committee--to hold a set of hearings so we can address the \nentire liability problem associated with the attacks on September 11, \nrather than a rifleshot approach.\n  Do you know why we are using a rifleshot approach? Because people are \nhiring the lobbyists, and campaign money. People are coming into \nWashington; lobbyists are coming in. They bought their access and they \nare exercising their influence.\n  That is not a fair way to address the issue of liability, and there \nare legitimate issues. I am sorry those provisions were included in \nthis legislation. I don't believe in raising anyone's taxes. I have \nvoted literally against every tax increase in the number of years I \nhave been a Member of this body and the other body.\n  There is an increase in costs associated with this airport security. \nWe need to pay for this. The $2.50 may not do it. It may not be enough. \nIt may require more. We put a cap of $5 so that someone who gets on an \nairplane that has four stops doesn't have to pay each time. Yes, there \nare remote areas of America. There are remote areas of my State as \nwell. There are poor Navajos who want to fly from Window Rock at \nFlagstaff to Phoenix, AZ, and then on to some other place.\n  We tried to make this fair. The fact is that everybody has to pay for \nit. It has to be paid for by all Americans. It is a cost for the \nincreased security requirements as a result of this new war we are \nfighting.\n  I say to the American people and to the passengers that I think this \nis not a high price to pay when you look at the benefits that will \naccrue from the increased security and safety which are absolutely \nvital, as we all know.\n  I think we came up with a good piece of legislation. We on the \nCommerce Committee will review this legislation and its impact. It may \nhave to be fine tuned in a variety of ways.\n  I am very pleased we came together on this issue. We have now done \nsomething which, unfortunately, took too long. But certainly it is now \ngoing to be signed into law and will be a very major step forward in \nproviding security and safety to Americans, hundreds of millions of \nwhom use the airlines every year.\n  I again thank Senator Hollings and our staff for the bipartisan way \nin which the Senate acted.\n  I also thank Senator Hutchison, the ranking member, as well as \nSenator Rockefeller, chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, who played \nkey and vital roles in the formulation of this legislation.\n  This is a new day. We had our differences. It isn't a perfect piece \nof legislation, but it is a landmark piece of legislation. I think, \nsince the Congress acted, we should now move forward and try to do the \nbest we can to make sure through congressional oversight that the \nintentions and the provisions of this legislation are implemented in as \nefficient and expeditious a manner as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I would like to address a couple of \nquestions to the Senator from South Carolina, if he will yield to me \nfor that purpose.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from South Carolina: I note on page \n52 that there is a provision regarding screening of small aircraft. It \nsays that within 1 year after date of enactment of this act, the Under \nSecretary of Transportation for Security shall transmit a report to the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the House on \nscreening requirements of passengers boarding and baggage carried \naboard aircraft with 60 seats or fewer used in scheduled passenger \nservice, and recommendations for any changes to meet these \nrequirements.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina knows, my State uses an extensive \nnumber of small planes. Many of them have nine seats or fewer.\n  Can the Senator from South Carolina tell me what provision of this \nbill affects general aviation that is totally intrastate and that seats \n19 or fewer? In the interim of 1 year, what applies to the small planes \nthat board passengers only for small distances within a State?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Generally speaking, none. It does not affect the small \nplanes with passengers. We would like to spell that out, but we haven't \ngotten into that thoroughly.\n  That is our problem right here, for example, with Reagan National's \nrestrictions against private planes coming in, and these other airports \naround the country. We are trying to work that out. But we didn't think \nthat was necessarily the particular safety threat at this particular \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, as the Senator knows, our State has \nover 150 small airports, and people go distances of 100 or 200 miles \nand return, or maybe stop in several places along the line. If these \nplanes do not interline with intrastate air carriers and are strictly \nlocal carriers, are they affected by this act?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think we are trying to find the final wording because \nmost of this was in the House bill. But the answer is, I think on the \nfee you are right; it would be. The FAA safety regulations still apply \nto general aviation. There has been no repeal of that in the takeover \nby the Deputy Secretary of Security. But the general aviation \nregulations are not disturbed here with respect to safety.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, let me say this. I have had extreme \ndifficulty in dealing with this bill because I have just read it for \nthe first time this morning--and the report. I have extreme difficulty \ninterpreting it as it applies to small planes that are carrying mail \nand passengers between two places in Alaska, where they will never \nintersect interstate commerce and where they will never interline with \nanyplace that has any difficulty as far as being a threat to people \nother than people in very small villages going from place to place--\nfrom Bethel to St. Mary's, or from Bethel down to various places in the \nYukon. I am going to have to go home and tell those people that they \nare affected by this bill.\n  I tell my good friend that I can't tell from the way this bill is \nwritten whether some of the small villages--some of which do not have \nscreening devices--that the small commuters fly between have to have \nscreening devices. Are they to install screening devices?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Shalom, peace. Tell them to just calm down for the \nsimple reason that this affects the 420 hub airports and the other \nairports connecting with those hub airports. The Senator talks about \n100 or so. I know we have\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\nnearly 100. When someone gets into a political campaign in Texas or \nSouth Carolina, you have to travel back and forth on the plane. We \ndon't have machines there to test the baggage, or Federal agents.\n  I want to answer as appropriately as I can. We are going to continue \nthe safety. Small general aviators practice safety because their life \ndepends on it. No, there won't be Federal marshals there. There won't \nbe Federal screeners in all of those little airports, if that is what \nthe Senator wants to get to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask my friend: They are required to \nbuy a ticket to get on those commuters, and they pay the $2.50.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If they come right into that hub.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I cannot find any exception here for \nthose flying between villages and not a hub. They are going to have to \npay.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There is language in the bill whereby they do not \nconnect with the hub, for example, in Alaska. You can lower that fare \nin those airports.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are the hubs covered named in the bill?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. They are named in the Federal Register.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The current designation is not changed by this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is not changed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. I regret that I did not sign the \nreport. I did not have access to this report, nor to the bill.\n  I still have to say to the chairman--I have great respect for him--in \nterms of the requirements for safety, that there are a great many \nplaces in the country, as the Senator from Arizona stated, where \npassengers who are not destined for a hub and are not destined for \nareas where the safety of passengers getting on and off is concerned, \nand baggage is immaterial, and if they are going from Nome to Alakanuk \nor to Shishmaref, or somewhere up in the village country in my State, I \nam afraid someone might interpret this as having them be required to \npay for security which they don't get, and pay for or be subject to \nthese requirements which they don't need.\n  I have to tell you, I hope we can review this sometime in the future \nin a way to listen to some of these people who operate commuter \nairlines where they may intersect a hub. We have two or three hubs in \nAlaska defined on the Federal Register today. They may intersect a hub, \nbut they do not go through the screening now. And I am not sure this \nbill requires them to go through screening they never had to go through \nbefore to go from place to place in Alaska.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It does not require that, and there is no charge there.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator and appreciate the courtesy and \napologize to the Senator from Texas.\n  I have no objection to proceeding with the request.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield such time as is necessary to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Georgia, who has an airplane to catch, after which I would \nlike to claim my time as one of the cosponsors of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator from Texas, and especially thank her \nfor the marvelous work on the bill, as well as Senator Hollings and \nSenator McCain and Senator Rockefeller.\n  Madam President, this body is about to vote on an historic piece of \nlegislation that will put in place new safeguards at airports across \nthis land from Savannah to Seattle to Sacramento as families prepare \nfor the biggest travel day in the Nation, they can feel assured airport \nsecurity will be strengthened nationwide the very moment President Bush \nsigns this landmark legislation into law.\n  Aviation security will now be in the hands of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation where it belongs. The Federal Government will \nimmediately begin the process to hire, train, and deploy Federal \nscreeners, Federal security personnel, and Federal law enforcement--a \nmove supported by 80 percent of the American people.\n  We will finally have in place strict national standards for the \nhiring and training and job performance of the men and women who are on \nthe front lines of ensuring that we have safety in aviation in America.\n  Ever since the tragic events of September 11, the American public has \nbeen crying out for tougher security to ensure that the horrifying \nevents of 2 months ago will never again be repeated. This bill is our \nresponse to that call. It is a comprehensive bill, a tough bill, which \nhelps ensure the financial viability of the airline industry and \nenhances America's national security and restores confidence to the \nflying public.\n  I am proud to support it. I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, on September 11, the terrorists \nfound loopholes in our homeland security. Four airplanes were used as \nweapons of mass destruction, something we had never seen in our \ncountry. Now, 2 months later, we are closing these loopholes in our \nhomeland security. The bill we are passing today will close the \nloopholes in aviation security so the people of our country, when they \nget on an airplane, will know every conceivable means of securing that \naircraft are being utilized.\n  The bill before us today will create a comprehensive Federal system. \nThere will be Federal screeners. There will be Federal supervisors who \nare armed law enforcement personnel. There will be a Federal person in \ncharge of every airport in our country to look at the safety system, to \nmake sure it works.\n  After a 2-year period, we will then have the option for other types \nof security to be offered by an airport and approved by the Secretary. \nSo there can be private screeners or local law enforcement people \nworking in a security system with the approval of the Under Secretary.\n  We will have a pilot program in each of the five major category \nairports: Category X, categories 1, 2, 3, and 4, that will be all \nprivatized so we can test that system to see if it works. Then, after 2 \nyears of the federalized system, perhaps there will be airports that \nwould prefer to have some privatization.\n  Another element of this bill that closes a loophole is that every \nchecked bag will also be required to be screened. As soon as possible, \nbut no later than 60 days, by some means, every checked bag will also \nbe screened so that if you carry a bag onto the top of the airplane, it \nwill be screened, if it goes on the bottom of the airplane it will be \nscreened. I think that was an important loophole to close. It was my \namendment to the bill. I felt very strongly about this.\n  We are also asking the Department of Transportation to expedite the \nmanufacturing of the highest tech equipment possible for the screening \nof these bags. EDS is the code name for this electronic detection of \nexplosives. We are going to make that a priority as well.\n  We are reinforcing the cockpit doors. We know the cockpits were \ninvaded on September 11. We know that no American pilot would have \nflown an airplane into a building--not one. That is what they are \ntrained not to do, and they would never do it, but for being overcome \nand murdered by these terrorists, who did indeed fly into the Pentagon \nand into the World Trade Center.\n  So the key elements of this bill are going to greatly strengthen our \naviation security system in our country. A lot of people have asked me: \nAre we going to see a difference immediately? We already see a \ndifference immediately. We are seeing people deployed from other \nagencies, such as the National Guard, who are standing at every \nscreening area at every major airport in our country.\n  What will happen with the bill before us today is that those National \nGuard units that have been deployed will be substituted with permanent \npersonnel, permanent Federal law enforcement personnel, armed Federal \nsecurity supervisors. So we will see an immediate change, but we will \nalso see these changes being made permanent.\n  As we phase the National Guard out of their temporary locations, we \nwill be putting permanent Federal law enforcement personnel in their \nplaces.\n\n  We have now detailed air marshals from other agencies. We have FBI\n\n[[Page S11978]]\n\nagents. We have Border Patrol agents. Other detailees from other \nDepartments are now acting as sky marshals. We will start replacing \nthem with permanent replacements so there will be more sky marshals on \nmore flights throughout our country and on international flights into \nand out of our country. They will be permanent Federal law enforcement \npersonnel that will be replacing the people who have been borrowed from \nother agencies.\n  So we are going to see immediate changes. We are going to see changes \nmade through the next few weeks, through the next few months, to make \npermanent these people who have come from other agencies to lend a \nhand, to add to the security on an immediate basis. We have also added \nto what is going to be screened.\n  Another component of our bill is to require that everybody who has \naccess to an aircraft will have a security clearance. There will be a \ncriminal background check required for every person who has access to \nan airplane. Whether it is a mechanic, whether it is a person doing \nfood service, regardless of their mission on that airplane, they will \nhave to have a security clearance. That is another very important \nfeature of this bill.\n  So I think we have made great progress. I thank Senator Hollings, \nSenator McCain, Senator Rockefeller, and others who helped--Senator \nBurns, Senator Kerry--for coming together and working through this very \ndifficult piece of legislation.\n  I thank Chairman Young on the House side, and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Chairman Mica; and Mr. Oberstar. These are people who \ncontributed greatly to coming together and getting something that I \nbelieve is going to significantly improve the security of the flying \npassengers in our country.\n  I think it is going to tighten many of the loopholes that we had in \nour system before September 11. No longer is the American flying public \ngoing to rely on the honesty of every person who gets on an airplane. I \nthink we have had to become a little less optimistic in our outlook, \nand now we have to provide for concrete solutions. We cannot just rely \non the good will of every person in the world. We are going to have to \nprotect our people. That is what homeland security is, and that is the \nfunction of the U.S. Congress.\n  In the Constitution of our country, we are required to provide for \nthe security of our country.\n  Security is not something you can contract out to the lowest bidder. \nSecurity is not something you can take a chance and hope that maybe we \ncan devise a system that we can maybe make work. That is not an option \nfor the Congress.\n  We have one option. We have one responsibility. That is to provide \nthe security to the people of this country who are flying in airplanes \nand believing that everything has been done to make them safe.\n  The bill before us today, that we will pass very shortly, is a bill \nthat is going to secure the people to every human extent possible \nagainst the kind of terrorist attack we saw on September 11 or other \nterrorist attacks that could be made in other ways. We are securing the \ntop of the airplane. We are securing the bottom of the airplane. We are \nsecuring the cockpit of the airplane. We are securing the airports \nthrough which people go.\n  We are going to beat the terrorists. We are going to secure the \npeople of our country so we can travel in freedom. That is our \nresponsibility. We are doing it today.\n  I thank Chairman Hollings once again and Senator McCain, all those \nwho came together, along with my staff, Joe Mondello, who contributed \ngreatly, to the staff who stayed up all night last night who could \nbarely even make it here this morning because they were taking a shower \nafter trying to make sure that this bill was written.\n  I thank everyone who contributed so much to doing this for the \nAmerican people, something they deserve and something we are giving \nthem today when we pass this bill to the President of the United \nStates.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we will agree to the conference report to \naccompany the airport security bill in a few moments. It is a terrible \nthing; I lost my voice. That is fatal for auctioneers and for those of \nus who try to make a living in the cave of the winds, which is this \nChamber, but I will try to get through. I will make my points as \nquickly as I can.\n  We had an opportunity to pass a good bill, and I think we have a \nbill. I will pledge to my colleagues in this Senate and also to the \nflying public that I will do everything I can to make it work because \nwe have spoken.\n  If we really wanted to maximize security at airport facilities across \nthe Nation, we took a wrong turn in this bill. That is what we do. I \noffered an amendment to allow the bright line of accountability, \nauthority, and responsibility of jurisdiction of enforcement of those \nlaws to reside with the Department of Justice. When I offered that \namendment, it was immediately accepted by a voice vote. No debate was \nheld on that part of the bill. Some of that was my fault because we \nwere trying to deal with the bill and move it through the Senate.\n  As we consider this legislation, I ask the question: Whom are we \ntrying to protect? I will tell you whom we protect more than anything \nelse. We protect Government jobs. We are building up a bureaucracy \nwithin the Department of Transportation to which even the Congressional \nBudget Office cannot put a figure. We do not know what this is going to \ncost yet.\n  What happens after we pass this bill today? The rules of \nadministration will be written. That will take considerable time. Those \nof us who are concerned about this bill were told we had to pass \nsomething before Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving is the most highly \ntraveled time of the year. I suggest we are not going to have any more \nprotection this Thanksgiving, and I am not sure we are going to have \nthe protections in place next Thanksgiving.\n  If we try, as a legislative body, to suggest to the rule writers how \nwe want the bill to work, we will be given the old story of separation \nof powers, that we cannot do that. So now it goes into the hands of the \nbureaucrats who have a habit of writing the rules for their benefit and \nsometimes disregarding the real reason why we passed the legislation.\n  Every time one flies, they are going to be charged to pay for this \nbig bureaucracy, and every taxpayer in this country will also be paying \nfor it.\n  Why did I decide the Department of Justice is better than the DOT in \nthe areas of enforcement? I will say why. It is enforcement. Before we \ncan expect load factors to go up and return to the levels prior to 11 \nSeptember, the flying public must feel secure and safe. Symbolically, \nfor no other reason, I suggest the Department of Justice do that.\n  Let us take a look at the areas of responsibilities and the \nchallenges ahead of us: passenger lists, intelligence, baggage and \ncargo, check-in areas, boarding areas and, yes, the security of the \naircraft. All personnel who have anything to do with maintenance, \ncleaning, fueling, or catering must be screened.\n  These are challenges of great dimension, and it is a big job ahead. \nYes, we are asking to build a new bureaucracy in order to take care of \nthis. Who is best equipped to handle that challenge? I suggest the \nDepartment of Justice because they have the intelligence in front of \nthem and they know how to handle secured areas.\n  Who deals with security every day and has the experience to do it? \nWho can best be put to work the quickest and have people on the ground \ndoing the business the fastest, without creating a new bureaucracy? The \nmodel is in front of us.\n  As we discussed, this was not allowed to be discussed in conference, \neither. There was no debate so the American people were not given a \nreal choice between a new bureaucracy and a bureaucracy that is already \nin place.\n  How are we going to pay for it? I will leave with this thought. \nAgain, I will pledge my support to make sure this law works. It would \nbe unwise to be any other way.\n  We have come through the World Series, a great World Series, and we \nwatch football almost every day on our television sets. Do you know \nwhat makes that game a great game and why it garners all the \nspectators? It is because we do not let the teams referee their own \ngames. In football, there are 22 men on the field, the most heavily \narmored, mobile, hostile, bent on killing one another, and 6 old men in\n\n[[Page S11979]]\n\nstriped shirts have very few problems. Why? One, because there is only \none rule book, and No. 2, we do not allow them to referee their own \ngames.\n  I contend we are making a big mistake. I did not sign the conference \nreport, but I will pledge to make sure the law works. I also warn my \ncolleagues we will be back in less than a year to deal with this \nproblem again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I add my appreciation for the work of \nthe Senator from South Carolina and Senator McCain of Arizona. As \nchairman and ranking member of the Commerce Committee representing our \nside on this issue, they did outstanding work.\n  We do big and small things in the Congress. This is a big thing. This \nisn't testing the water. This is making waves. This is really a \nprofound change in many ways with respect to security on airlines that \nserve our country.\n  I rise to talk a bit about some of the things we are doing and why.\n  First the why. We know that September 11 caused great concern among \nthe American people about the risks of taking airplane flights. They \nsaw jetliners used as bombs, as missiles full of fuel, taking down two \nof the largest buildings in our country.\n  The site of that kind of tragedy, that act of mass murder, that \nterrorism has persuaded many Americans to feel queasy and jittery about \nflying. What kind of security exists with respect to the airlines?\n  Then they read in the newspaper in recent weeks stories about a \nperson who comes to an airport in Chicago and is screened. They \ndiscover two knives on the person. They send the person to the boarding \ngate, and they do an enhanced screening there. He has seven more \nknives, a stun gun, and a can of mace. People ask: How can this happen? \nIt further erodes the confidence of the American people with respect to \nsecurity.\n  In the last couple days, a fellow with two meat cleavers gets through \na screening process. Here we have nine knives, two meat cleavers, a can \nof mace, and a stun gun. The other day a woman is discovered to have a \n.22-caliber pistol in her purse. After she gets through the screening \nprocess, she says: I don't understand that. I got it through when I \ntook other flights. She is walking through screening in other \ncircumstances with a loaded .22-caliber pistol.\n  Does it give people pause? Of course, it does. The screening that has \nexisted by some of the companies has not been good at all. One of the \ncompanies named Argenbright was fined by the U.S. Government $1.5 \nmillion, put on probation and then violated their probation, hired \npeople with criminal backgrounds, didn't train them properly, certified \nto the Federal Government false documents. It does not work. We know \nthat.\n  The question confronting Congress is, What do we do to give people \nsome confidence about the system? The answer is obvious: improve \nsecurity. How do we do that? This legislation puts sky marshals on \nairplanes in significant quantity. That gives people some confidence. \nIt strengthens the cockpit doors, requiring airlines to take action to \ndo so. That will give people some confidence, especially with respect \nto baggage screening, airport perimeter security, and a range of other \nthings.\n  This legislation says what we have been doing has not worked and we \nwill do it differently. This establishes a process by which we have \nuniform standards. We will hire Federal screeners at airports. They \nwill be managed and trained effectively and consistently. They will \nprovide a level of security the country deserves and needs.\n  Let me mention that in this legislation is a provision I added which \nI have been trying to add for some long while. It will finally become \nlaw with the President's signature. It deals with something called the \nadvanced passenger information system. I have added it to three bills \nin the Senate. It has been kicked out because of jurisdictional \ndisputes with one of the committees of the House of Representatives. I \nput it in this bill, and it will be signed by the President. It is \ngoing to get done.\n  What does that mean? It means that airlines bringing people into this \ncountry as guests of ours with visas must provide us advanced passenger \nlists of who is coming so we can run those lists of passenger names \nagainst the FBI list, against the Customs list, and 21 Federal agencies \nthat have lists about people that we don't want coming into this \ncountry, those who are terrorists, known or suspected, that we don't \nwant to allow into this country.\n  We have had, since 1988, something called the advanced passenger \ninformation system. Most airlines around the world comply with it. When \nthey land in the United States prior to coming here, they have given us \nan advanced list of who they are bringing to the United States as \nguests with a visa.\n  Some airlines have refused to comply. Some airlines refuse to comply \nwith this voluntary system. Let me share which airlines: airlines from \nPakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait. Do we want to know the \nnames of passengers coming from those countries? You bet your life we \ndo.\n  I have proposed an amendment that is now in this legislation that \nwill require the advanced passenger lists be sent to this country. Our \nmessage is very simple: Do what all the other airlines have voluntarily \ndone since 1988 or land somewhere else. Don't land in the United \nStates. If you want to land here, send us the advanced passenger list \nof who is on the airplane so we can run them against the 21 Federal law \nenforcement agencies to see whether there is a passenger on this flight \nor that flight that is a known or suspected terrorist or someone who \nassociates with terrorists who we have decided we will now not allow to \nvisit the country.\n  It is sensible. It should have been done before. It was not. As I \nsaid, this is the third time I have put it in legislation, and I put it \non two other appropriations bills.\n  This bill is going to get signed by the President of the United \nStates. Finally, this will be done. It is not a small matter. It is a \nbig issue and an important piece of adding security with respect to \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I particularly thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and his staff. They worked with us around the clock. That \nis why we are here today.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, great credit goes to our distinguished \ncolleague from South Carolina for his chairmanship and leadership to \nget this piece of legislation through, as well as our distinguished \nranking member, Senator McCain, and Senator Hutchison, who have worked \nhard to get this done.\n  I want to make two points. Virginia was struck in this tragic episode \non what is referred to as 9-11, September 11. As a consequence, \nNational Airport was closed down and still is operating at less than \nhalf capacity. The economic consequences to our area in Northern \nVirginia has been very substantial.\n  Senator Allen and I, together with other members of the Virginia \ndelegation, are working to do our very best to provide funding for the \npeople who have suffered as a consequence of closing the airports down. \nI have followed this debate and I, again, congratulate our chairman for \nthe manner in which he and others conducted that debate on the floor of \nthe Senate, and for the strong vote they had for their bill, and for \nthe fact that much of the Senate bill has survived this important \nconference. But in the course of this debate, I think mainly in the \nother body, there were inferences raised that Government employees were \nperhaps not first-class citizens but second-class citizens. I resented \nthat. I am privileged to represent many of them, and I myself have had \nabout eight or nine different Government positions in my lifetime.\n  I have often said I am privileged to be a Senator because of the \ntraining and so forth I received from many of my supervisors in the \ncourse of long Government service. The Federal employees are a very \nvaluable asset to the United States of America. Now this piece of \nlegislation even trusts to them the safety of our passengers. I believe \nthey will live up to this challenge and that there will be no basis for \never saying that Government employees are\n\n[[Page S11980]]\n\nsecond-class citizens. They are first class just like the rest of us.\n  Again, I am talking about any number of Federal people who are \nworking throughout our system, whether it is the FBI, U.S. Marshals \nService, and all types of people who have provided security.\n  I am very pleased House and Senate negotiators have reached agreement \non an airline security package to fully federalize security at every \nairport in the United States.\n  By approving this conference report today, the Senate is saying to \nthe American people that the Federal Government is doing everything in \nits power to protect them when they travel by air.\n  While this agreement is not a total solution to our aviation security \nproblems, it is a strong first step.\n  The problems with the current private security system are well \ndocumented and I will not repeat them here.\n  Suffice it to say the current system is not giving the American \npeople the protection they need in this era of terrorist threats, and I \nbelieve the action the Senate is taking today is the type of bold \naction necessary in these times of uncertainty.\n  In every area except passenger and baggage screening at airports, \nprotecting the public is performed by sworn law enforcement officers. \nLocal police and sheriffs protect our cities and neighborhoods, State \ntroopers patrol our highways, the FBI fights crime and prevents \nterrorism nationwide and the U.S. Border Patrol guards our borders. Why \nshould passenger security at airports be a glaring exception to this \nrule?\n  Federal Air Marshals are protecting passengers in the air.\n  U.S. Customs agents conduct passenger and baggage screening for \ninternational flights to prevent contraband from entering or leaving \nthe country.\n  U.S. Department of Agriculture agents inspect baggage for dangerous \nplants and animals at our airports.\n  U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents monitor foreign \nnationals entering the United States at our airports.\n  U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agents search for illegal drugs at our \nairports.\n  Why shouldn't Federal law enforcement perform other security \nfunctions at our Nation's airports?\n  With the economy potentially heading for recession and the airline \nindustry on the verge of bankruptcy, the U.S. Government must do all it \ncan to revive the air transportation system.\n  We have already passed the Air Transportation Safety and System \nStabilization Act. This important legislation provided $5 billion in \ncapital and $10 billion in loan guarantees to keep the airlines \nfinancially viable.\n  Now we are taking the next step which is to restore public confidence \nin the security of our aviation system.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member and others for this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to support the conference committee report on \naviation security and, particularly, to congratulate the chairman, \nSenator Hollings, the ranking member, Senator McCain, and all of the \nmembers of the committee and their staffs who have worked so hard to \nbring about this very critical result today.\n  Since September 11, when we saw the worst of human nature in those \nwho attacked us, I think here in America we have seen the best of human \nnature. That is particularly so in the unity that we have all felt \namong the American people and that unity that has been reflected in the \nCongress of the United States as we have worked with more \nnonpartisanship over a sustained period than I have seen in the 13 \nyears I have been privileged to be a Senator.\n  Until this morning, the one unfortunate exception to that was the \ncritical area of aviation security, where the Senate, I am proud to \nsay, acted more than a month ago and stood shoulder to shoulder in, \nagain, a nonpartisan fashion to adopt 100 to 0 a strong aviation \nsecurity bill. Of course, what followed was a different approach in the \nHouse. Time went on, and now more than 2 months ago our aviation system \nwas used by terrorists to strike a terrible blow at our people. But, \nhappily, the gap that existed between the Senate and the House has now \nbeen closed in a most positive fashion.\n  I cannot thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Hollings, and \nall who are on it, enough for the persistence to principle and what \nwould be effective here when there could have been compromises that \nwould have gotten a bill passed earlier, but really would not have done \nwhat the American people want us to do, which is to make flying just as \nsafe as it can possibly be.\n  I say to Senator Hollings, who has had an extraordinary career in the \nSenate, I think this is one of the high points today. It is something \nthat will not only protect the traveling public for years and years to \ncome, and protect literally the lives of the American people, but also \nat this moment in our economic history, when our economy is certainly \nsliding in recession, he has brought to the Senate and helped us to \npass today a bill that will probably do as much to stimulate our \neconomy as most parts of that economic stimulus plan that we haven't \nquite yet agreed on--maybe more than all of them--because air travel is \nso critically important to our commerce and particularly important in \nthe areas of the country that rely on tourists.\n  I congratulate the leaders of the committee and say just a few words \nabout the bill and why I think it is so critically important. The \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to chair, \nhas held two oversight hearings on aviation security since September \n11. One was on September 25, and the other was on this past Wednesday, \nNovember 14. The picture that emerges is that for too long, and with \ntoo many warnings from the GAO, from the inspector general at the \nDepartment of Transportation, from Members of Congress and committees \nof Congress, we lowered our guard; we allowed such weaknesses to \npersist in our aviation security system that created the \nvulnerabilities that the terrorists took advantage of, with the \ndreadful consequences on September 11.\n  The measures that have since been taken have definitely improved the \nsituation. The measures that are called for by this legislation we \npassed today will not only make aviation security so much stronger, but \nas I look back, and considering the two oversight hearings our \ncommittee has held, I would say that if this legislation had been in \neffect before, it would have been very hard for the terrorists to have \ndone what they did on September 11.\n\n  Let me mention a few of the weaknesses in the system that our \nhearings showed. This one struck me. It just came out 2 days ago at the \nhearing. We asked about the bomb detection equipment that is in some of \nour airports, how much of the baggage that is checked on to the planes \nis scanned for bombs. The inspector general, Mr. Mead, of the \nDepartment of Transportation stunned me by saying that today, 13 years \nafter Lockerbie, and more than that after the earlier hijackings, less \nthan 10 percent of checked baggage nationwide is being screened for \nexplosives prior to being loaded on the aircraft. Of course, we all \nknow and have heard screeners are underpaid, overworked, and \nundertrained. Screening, therefore, has been haphazard.\n  The technologies being used for the screening and other \nidentification functions at the airports are outdated. Some machines--\nbomb scanning particularly--are sitting idle at airports. In one test \ndone about a year ago by the inspector general of the Department of \nTransportation to see how secure the allegedly security areas of the \nairports were, more than 80 percent of his testers got through to the \nbehind the scenes parts of the airports, where they were not authorized \nto be, and where so much critical to the security of the planes goes \non. Obviously, the cockpits were unsecured. Database connections \nbetween law enforcement agencies, the FAA, and the airlines were \nminimal or nonexistent.\n  A recent spot check just last weekend, Veterans Day weekend, of bomb \ninspection machines at selected airports in the country, found that \nfewer than 30 percent of the machines were in continuous use, despite \nan FAA directive ordering more usage.\n  Again, just last weekend, more than 2 months after September 11, \nscreeners at passenger checkpoints were observed leaving their \ncheckpoints while passengers were passing through. The system was \nplagued--and, unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\nstill is--by tremendous inconsistencies in the level of scrutiny across \nairports and even within airports.\n  Every one of these problems can be, and I believe will be, solved by \nthe legislation we will adopt today. I particularly thank Senator \nHollings and the Commerce Committee for the accepting two amendments \noffered by three members of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Senator Durbin and I offered an amendment that, among other things, \nprovides $50 million a year for the next 5 years to speed up research \nand development of airport technology so that the public can be better \nprotected. It creates a 6-month effectiveness assessment and a 12-month \ndeployment of improvements to methods of preventing unauthorized access \nto sterile areas of the airports--that is, those areas the public is \nnot supposed to go--including biometrics, increased surveillance, \nairport exit systems, and prevention of so-called piggybacking.\n  It expands the use of computer-assisted passenger prescreening to \ntrigger additional screening of passengers and their carry-on items.\n  It adds $20 million for long-term research and development.\n  That is the amendment Senator Durbin and I offered.\n  Senator Thompson offered an amendment which was accepted by the \ncommittee that deals with performance standards being regularly applied \nto aviation security. It is up to us to pay attention to the \napplication of these standards, and the Department of Transportation \nwill report to us how well the airports and airlines are achieving what \nwe want them to achieve and what is expressed in this legislation. This \nis an extraordinary step forward. It shows that we have learned the \nlessons of September 11.\n  Finally, this bill sets a standard for us as to what we must do \nregarding other parts of our critical infrastructure. We naturally have \nfocused on the aviation system because that is where we were hit and \nhurt so badly on September 11. But I fear that similar vulnerabilities \nwhich we found in aviation security will be found in other forms of our \ntransportation system or hubs in other forms of transportation, \nutilities, communications, cyberspace, and financial systems on which \nwe all depend. I could go on and on.\n  Basically, this is the urgent work with which Governor Ridge and the \nOffice of Homeland Security has to deal, with the help of Congress.\n  A high standard of public service and public protection has been \nachieved in this conference committee report. Again, I extend my \nsincere thanks to Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, and all who worked \nto make this happen. They have advanced the security of the American \npeople and the well-being of the American economy. I thank them, and I \nthank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There are very important inclusions in this airport \nsecurity bill. They were made, in essence, by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut. The Governmental Affairs Committee worked with our \ncommittee, and we were glad to have his leadership in this regard. I \nthank him publicly for his good leadership which helped us get to this \npoint.\n\n\n          Technical Corrections to the Aviation Security Bill\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as is understood, we had a computer \ncrash early this morning, the result of which was that a significant \namount of agreed to text in this bill was lost. In order to meet filing \nrequirements, the staff was forced to work quickly to reconstruct \nportions of the bill that had been carefully negotiated. Unfortunately, \nsome mistakes were made in this process. In particular, I am referring \nto Section 145 of the bill, entitled ``Air Carriers Required to Honor \nTickets for Suspended Service.''\n  It had been agreed to by all parties that the conditions under which \nair carriers would be required, to the extent practicable, to honor the \ntickets of passengers who had purchased tickets on other airlines would \nbe: ``Acts of war, terrorism, insolvency, or bankruptcy.''\n  Unfortunately, in a drafting error, the language neglected to include \nthe conditions for acts of war or terrorism.\n  I want to make clear, now, that I will ensure that these conditions \nwill be included as part of a technical corrections bill before the end \nof the first session of this Congress.\n  I ask my colleague from South Carolina, will he join me in making \nthis commitment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, I join the Senator in committing to ensuring that \nthese changes will be included as part of a technical corrections bill \nbefore the end of the first session of this Congress.\n\n\n            Ensuring Cockpit Safety During Smoke Emergencies\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, Senators Hollings and McCain have done \nan outstanding job of bringing this important legislation to a final \nconclusion. Hopefully, this measure will help fully restore consumer \nconfidence in air travel and prevent any future use of airplanes as \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  This measure includes critical provisions to ensure cockpit security. \nIn addition to the specific measures identified, this measure also \nauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration to take additional \naction as may be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the \naircraft.\n  One additional safety concern that I wish to raise relates to \npotential threats caused by smoke in the aircraft, including smoke \nresulting from small incendiary devices which could affect the cockpit \ncrew's ability to see and operate essential instruments to safely \ncontrol and land airplanes.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to ask Chairman Hollings \nwhether the language in section 104(a)(1)(B) will authorize the FAA \nAdministrator to consider whether safety and security procedures may be \nnecessary to ensure the integrity of the flight deck during smoke \nemergencies.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I, too am concerned about aircraft safety \nduring smoke emergencies and join him in his question.\n  In addition, I also commend Senators Hollings and McCain for their \nefforts to complete this important legislation and believe that this \nmeasure will help to restore confidence in air travel.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senators from Hawaii for raising this \nimportant concern. Section 104(a)(1)(B) would authorize the FAA \nAdministrator to take action as may be necessary to ensure the safety \nand security of the aircraft from smoke emergencies.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, more than 2 months ago we witnessed the \nworst ever terrorist attack on American soil. The horrific sights of \nSeptember 11, 2001, will be with us forever. Our Nation has come \ntogether during this difficult time and we will continue to strengthen \nour resolve in the days to come.\n  I am pleased that Senator Hollings through his leadership and the \nhard work of his staff is able to present to the Senate this very \nimportant Aviation Security Act. Thanksgiving is just a few days away \nand millions of Americans will be traveling to visit family and \nfriends. I am proud that we are able to return home and report to our \nconstituents on the progress we have made in regards to strengthening \nour aviation security system.\n  The conference report before the Senate brings a safer and more \nsecure aviation network for the thousands of Americans who fly every \nday. Tougher safety standards, federalization of screening of \npassengers and their luggage, increased presence of sky marshals on \nflights and strengthening of cockpit doors are just a few of the \nimportant measures that take us in the direction of a new Federal and \ncomprehensive safety network for our airports. I am also pleased that \nall who have access to aircrafts will be required to pass a background \ncheck. We have reached this very important agreement and now these new \nregulations and safety standards must be implemented fairly and \nconsistently.\n  Again, I congratulate Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain on their \nleadership on this issue and strongly support the conference report.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Madam President, more than 2 months have passed since \nthe horrific events of September 11, when we watched as our Nation's \naircraft were hijacked and used against us as weapons of mass \ndestruction. More than a month has passed since the United States \nSenate stood together and unanimously passed an aggressive, \ncomprehensive Aviation Security Act, solemnly resolving that we\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\nmust never again see a day like the 11th because of inadequate security \nmeasures at our Nation's airports.\n  Today we keep that promise made to the American people: This aviation \nsecurity bill is simply a huge win for passenger safety, in every part \nof the Nation.\n  The legislation we approve today will require numerous new security \nfeatures, including full Federal law enforcement at all airports, \nexpansion of the Federal Air Marshal program, and screening of all \npassengers, baggage, and employees.\n  This bill will revolutionize security at our airports and in our \nskies. Every person and every bag, at every airport, big and small, \nwill be screened by Federal law enforcement personnel, no exceptions.\n  The traveling public want and deserve safe and secure airports and \nairplanes, and this legislation gives them the confidence they need to \nkeep flying.\n  As we learned after the attacks on September 11, we can no longer \nignore the security needs at our Nation's airports. We can no longer \nallow the lives of our citizens to be placed into the hands of private \ncompanies. Airport security is no longer just a transportation issue, \nit is a national security concern, and the Federal Government will now \ntake on this critical responsibility.\n  Additionally, the bill requires dramatic security increases in and \naround airplanes. This includes the securing of all cockpit doors; \nscreening of everything that is put on an airplane including \n(beverages, food, mail, etc.); background checks of every employee that \nservices the flight, including catering company workers; and anti-\nhijack training for pilots and flight attendants.\n  I am extremely pleased to join in bringing to the Senate floor a \nfinal conference report that will so dramatically improve the safety of \nour Nation's skies. The road to final legislation has been harder and \nlonger than the unanimous Senate vote may have led some to predict. \nThat is, as we all know, because the House of Representatives passed an \naviation security bill far different from our own, particularly on the \nquestion of whether screeners on the front lines of national security \nshould be Federal law enforcement officers or private companies.\n  This final conference report resolves that issue firmly on the side \nof Federal law enforcement and represents a great victory for passenger \nsafety. The American people deserve to be safe and to feel safe when \ntraveling in our skies. Now more than ever, aviation security is \nnational security, plain and simple. Like all other aspects of national \nsecurity, it must be entrusted to Federal law enforcement personnel.\n  The House and Senate bills both contained a number of important \nprovisions that we were able to quickly agree upon. As I stated \nearlier, we will now move to fortify cockpits, dramatically expand the \nsky marshal program, provide flight crews with the best anti-hijack \ntraining possible, and ensure that every single bag, every person, and \nevery item boarding a plane is screened. These steps alone offer an \nenormous improvement in aviation security.\n  In addition, we have agreed on a bipartisan and bicameral basis to \n``federalize'' airport screeners and reorganize the Department of \nTransportation around security priorities. Federalization of the \nscreening process is a necessary step in strengthening the flying \npublic's faith in our Nation's air transport system. In many ways, the \nAmerican people have shown their clear preference that the screening of \npassengers and bags become a Federal law enforcement responsibility. \nThis conference report answers their demands and ensures that the \nsafety of our skies is given the same priority as the safety of our \nstreets and borders.\n  The Federal Government will implement a program to place law \nenforcement officers at every single airport screening station in \nAmerica. These men and women will be public servants of the highest \nquality, having been subject to background checks, skill assessments, \nand intensive training in classrooms and on the job.\n  The 2 years after the screening system has been fully upgraded \nnationwide, the conference report provides airports the flexibility to \nconsider bids from private screening companies. If an airport believes, \nand the Secretary of Transportation agrees, that a private company can \noffer security equivalent to that provided by Federal law enforcement, \nthen they can choose that approach. Certainly, this will be a high \nhurdle, as well it should be. But this compromise represents the best \nof what America has to offer, the unquestionable competency and \nprofessionalism of our Federal law enforcement and the ability for \nindividual airports to be responsible for meeting tough Federal \nstandards by an alternative means.\n  In addition, we will allow the Department of Transportation to \ninitiate a pilot program for privatizing screeners at no more than five \nairports, each in a different size category. Importantly, those \nairports must themselves seek to be part of this pilot program, the DOT \ncannot force a private company approach on anyone. This will give us a \nchance to evaluate and reevaluate what works and what does not. I \nwelcome the opportunity to engage in a continuing review process, \nadjusting our original plan as necessary to make sure it works as well \nin the real world as we believe it will today. It certainly will not \nmatter who manages security at our Nation's airports if we are not \nvigilant in maintaining the quality of the program once in place.\n  As chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I take real pride in the \nwork of the conferees to reach a final agreement on aviation security. \nI must also say, however, that I was disappointed that some of my House \ncolleagues tried to turn this into an anti-government and anti-union \ndebate. This bill is about safety, plain and simple. It has nothing to \ndo with the size of government or unionization of workers.\n  In the end, national security prevailed, but the misplaced focus on \nunionization meant that the House would not yield on including the most \nbasic rights of Federal workers: health care, worker's compensation, \nand civil rights and whistleblower protection. These critical matters \nare left to the discretion of the Department of Transportation, and it \nis my hope and expectation that the Secretary will have no choice but \nto offer a good package to fill so many positions so quickly. In fact, \nDOT has assured us that they will offer rights and benefits at least as \ngood as those afforded other Federal workers, and I intend to hold them \nto that promise.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that much of my effort on this bill, \nlike all of the aviation bills I work on, was aimed at ensuring that \nrural communities have the best possible options for security and \nservice. In the face of so may House proposals to federalize only at \nthe large airports, and privatize only at the small airports, I held \nfirm to the principle that small airports must be served by true law \nenforcement. Now, within a matter of months, all West Virginia \ntravelers will have the security of Federal screeners, Federal \nsupervisors, and Federal and local law enforcement on hand to protect \nthem.\n  I urge all parties, public and private, to move swiftly to implement \nthe new security measures as soon as the President has lifted his \nsignature pen from the paper. The sooner the actual provisions of the \nlaw are implemented, the sooner the public's confidence will be \nrestored. When Americans once again feel safe in the sky, we will have \nclaimed a major victory in our war against terror.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would like to be among the first to \ncongratulate Senators Hollings and McCain for their leadership in \ngetting us to this point. Without their leadership we would not have a \nconference report, so I thank them for their fine work.\n  The conference report that we have signed off on, and to which the \nfull Senate is about to agree, is historic legislation. Our legislation \nwill immediately put an end to the unacceptable state of airport \nsecurity. Everyone knows the technical aspects of the bill by now. But \nour bill will, for the first time, guarantee uniformity in our Nation's \naviation security. The bill creates a seamless web of improved \nsecurity, so that passengers boarding a plane in Worcester will have \nthe same level of heightened security as someone boarding a plane in \nChicago. This\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\nis critical to Americans in places where small airports are the norm. \nIt would have been unacceptable to create a two-tiered system of \nsecurity.\n  Our bill also provides accountability in aviation security. For too \nlong the FAA, airports, airlines and private security companies have \nbeen able to point fingers at one another without any real improvements \nbeing made in security. The Congress has passed law upon law designed \nto improve things, but these laws never seemed to be fully implemented. \nThat all ends with the passage of this legislation. It is my hope that \na message has been delivered clearly to anyone with any security \nresponsibilities at our airports. The Congress has empowered the \nFederal Government to make serious and lasting improvements in airport \nsecurity. We have provided all the necessary tools to improve the \nscreening of people and their bags. We must now use those tools to make \nthe American people as safe as possible when they fly.\n  We have also placed, through passage of this bill, a renewed \nconfidence in the Federal Government to perform vital national security \nfunctions. No one questions the superior job that the 36,000 men and \nwomen of the Coast Guard do in protecting our ports. No one doubts that \nthe Customs Bureau does a fine job of inspecting trucks, planes and \nships that unload cargo in the United States. But many people will be \nwatching closely as Federal managers, supervisors and, ultimately, \nscreeners, begin to protect our airports. They must know that the \nflying public will be watching them closely, and they must not fail.\n  Equally important as improving the quality of screeners, we recognize \nthe need to improve the technology used in airport security. Technology \ncan be a great ally to us, and this legislation places a great emphasis \non investing in research and development. We authorize grants for the \ndevelopment of new technology to improve security. With new \ntechnologies, we enhance our ability to authenticate passenger and \nemployee identification, our ability to control access to secure areas \nand the way we screen checked baggage.\n  Our bill dramatically improves the screening of checked baggage. We \ncurrently only screen about 3 percent of all baggage that goes into the \nbelly of a plane. Our legislation will take immediate steps to screen \nall baggage for explosives, ultimately ensuring that all baggage is \nscreened with the most sophisticated technology available. During \ndebate on the Senate bill, I filed an amendment that would have \nrequired the screening of all checked baggage by 2005. This bill sets \nthe deadline a year earlier. I believe that this is an extremely \nambitious target, but it is one that we must be prepared to meet. The \nCongress must follow through by providing critical financial resources \nto help acquire and deploy explosive detection systems so that the \nDepartment of Transportation can meet this deadline.\n  Finally, I thank our House colleagues who were invaluable in \nbrokering this deal. Chairman Don Young and Ranking Member Jim Oberstar \nwere key players in this process and the entire Senate must owe them \nour gratitude.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation before the Senate which is designed to overhaul aviation \nsecurity in this Nation.\n  This is an issue of vital national importance in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 tragedy. As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, and a conferee on the aviation security \nconference, I fought for the strongest possible enhancements to our \nexisting system. I believe we succeeded in this endeavor.\n  Going into the conference, I felt we needed to confront the issue of \nfederalization head-on, and I believe we have done that. We needed to \nsend an unequivocal message to the American people that the government \nis taking control of security, and it is safe to fly. I believe we have \naccomplished that. When this bill is signed into law, the status quo is \nhistory.\n  The agreement before us will federalize virtually all security \nscreeners. The Federal Government will take immediate control of the \nsystem. Once the Federal system has been imposed and we have had a \nchance to evaluate it, individual airports that meet strict federal \nstandards will have the flexibility to deploy law enforcement personnel \nor contract screeners. This is very similar to an approach I had \nsuggested to the conference committee leadership, under which all \nscreeners would be Federal employees, and then after 4 years, a review \nof the system could be done.\n  The Federal Government will provide direct management and oversight, \nset strict new standards, ensure that they are followed, and will have \nthe power to fire screeners who don't measure up to the standards. We \nwon't have a system where anybody's financial ``bottom line'' is a \ncompeting priority with protecting the flying public. We will have a \nreliable, professional force of security screeners. This is what \nAmericans have been calling for in airport after airport. And it is \nwhat they are going to get.\n  The system will be seamless. There will be no gaps in control or \noversight. It will be uniform. The Senate version of the bill would \nhave transferred control of the screening system to the Department of \nJustice. The conference agreement gives control to a new Transportation \nSecurity Under Secretary. I would have preferred that we vest this \ncritical security responsibility with an agency with a historic law \nenforcement function. Nonetheless, passengers will know that they can \ncount on the same level of security throughout the system, whether they \nare boarding at LAX, Chicago O'Hare, or the Portland, ME, Jetport. \nThere will be no question about who is accountable. And it won't be a \nprivate for-profit company--it will be the Federal Government.\n  Furthermore, this package meets the critical goal of addressing the \ninterlocking rings of aviation security, from the perimeter to the \nairport to on-board security, because ultimately, the system is only as \nstrong as its weakest link. It will address the gamut of critical \nissues, including baggage screening, additional air marshals, and \ncockpit security.\n\n  In addition to imposing Federal control on security screening \noperations, there are a number of provisions in the bill that I worked \nhard to secure. For example, the bill will ensure the screening of all \nchecked baggage within 60 days, and all checked bags will be screened \nwith highly sophisticated explosives detection equipment by the end of \nnext year under the deadline set forth in the agreement, a top priority \nof mine.\n  The legislation will increase the number of air marshals as well. \nShortly after the tragic attacks in September, I cosponsored \nlegislation by Senator Hutchison to boost the Air Marshal Program, and \nI believe this is a critical step. It will ensure that any potential \nterrorist will know they could be flying with one or more armed \nmarshals, trained to take control in the event of an attempted \nhijacking.\n  The bill provides for background checks for students enrolled in \nflight training. I introduced legislation to require background checks \nfor foreign nationals seeking such training. A background check \nprovision was included in the Senate bill, and a similar provision is \nincluded in the conference agreement. This will ensure that federal law \nenforcement authorities are alerted in the event that an individual \nwith known ties to terrorist groups attempts to obtain flight training.\n  The bill also includes provisions I worked for directing the new \nTransportation Security Under Secretary, created in this measure, to \nfocus on the critical mission of better coordinating all modes of \ntransportation nationwide particularly in preparation for emergencies \nsuch as the events that unfolded on September 11. And I would like to \nthank Senators Hollings and McCain, in particular, for working with me \nand for their support on this important issue.\n  I am very pleased we were able to come together in a bipartisan way \nto send a comprehensive package to the President that will restore the \nconfidence of the American people. Because the images of the \nunspeakable horrors of the recent terrorist attacks will be etched in \nour minds forever. When the ``devil incarnate'' hit the United States, \nhe attacked not only America, but freedom-loving nations everywhere. We \nare going to need the resources of the United States coupled with the \ncooperation of our global neighbors in order to wage the fight against \nterrorism. For it is a fight we must win, and will win.\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\n  But there should be no mistake, victory will not come overnight. We \nare voting on this bill today because, as we continue to mourn the \ntremendous loss of life both of those in the air and on the ground, we \nalso know that our transportation system must endure and must be secure \nif we are to move the Nation forward, and also ensure that we are in a \nposition of strength to be able to wage the kind of war necessary to \neradicate terrorism. And we cannot remain strong if we cannot remain \nmobile.\n  Our goal was to restore the confidence of the American people in the \naviation security system. I believe the measure before us will \naccomplish that goal. The fact of the matter is, if the flying public \ndoes not have confidence in the security, they will remain reluctant to \nfly, with severe long-term repercussions in the aviation sector and in \nour economy. Imposing stringent Federal control and oversight over \nairport security will go a long way to helping instill confidence in \nthe flying public, and will enable the government to exercise much \ngreater control over the quality of screening.\n  We found common ground on a very complex issue, and I am pleased that \nboth sides were able to come to agreement so quickly in the name of \nsafety, to ensure that Americans have complete confidence in the men \nand women who form the last line of defense.\n  In the end, we did come together--as we did on a resolution \nsupporting the use of force to combat terrorism, as we did on \nlegislation providing emergency funding for the recovery and relief \neffort after the September 11 attacks, as we did on a financial relief \npackage for the airline industry, as we did on counter-terrorism \nlegislation--to develop an agreement to address the gaps in aviation \nsecurity and restore the confidence of the American people in our \naviation system. So I urge all my colleagues to offer a strong show of \nsupport for this important legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, the Senate passed an \namendment by myself and Senator Conrad Burns of Montana to allow for \narmed pilots as the first line of deterrence and the last line of \ndefense for cockpit security.\n  The first line of deterrence because terrorists will know that armed \npilots will be able to defend the cockpit and defend the aircraft from \na hijacking.\n  The last line of defense, because, when all else fails, including the \narmed air marshals and the reinforced cockpit door, an armed pilot will \nbe in the cockpit to defend the cockpit from terrorist hijackers.\n  The pilots support this amendment. The Bob Smith/Conrad Burns \namendment had the endorsement of the Airline Pilots Association and the \nAllied Pilots Association. In addition, The National Rifle Association \nand Gun Owners of America supported the amendment. And most importantly \nthe American people supported our efforts.\n  According to a draft provided to myself, section 125 of this \nconference report, titled flight deck security provides that the pilot \nof a passenger aircraft is authorized to carry a firearm if four \nconditions are met.\n  First, ``the Undersecretary of Transportation for Transportation \nSecurity approves.''\n  The will of the Congress is clear that the Department of \nTransportation should approve a reasonable program to arm pilots.\n  Second, ``the air carrier approves.'' The air carriers should not use \nthis provision as a veto to prevent properly trained pilots from using \nfirearms to protect themselves and the aircraft from terrorism, that \nwould be a mistake and would adversely affect air safety.\n  Third, ``the firearm is approved by the Under Secretary.'' It should \nbe clear from this language that the Under Secretary of Transportation \nshould approve a firearm, not a stun gun, not a taser, a firearm with \napproved ammunition that would not compromise the integrity of the \naircraft.\n  The final provision of this section provides that ``the pilot has \nreceived proper training for the use of the firearm, as determined by \nthe Secretary.''\n  The Smith/Burns amendment provided that the agency ``shall establish \na voluntary program to train'' and ``make available appropriate \ntraining'' for pilots.\n  I hope the Department of Transportation will utilize the many private \norganizations that provide excellent training in the proper use of a \nfirearm.\n  My home State of New Hampshire has the Manchester International \nAirport and I know the passengers and pilots of New Hampshire are \nlistening to this debate today.\n  On September 27, 2001, I met with New Hampshire pilots from United \nAirlines, Northwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Continental \nAirlines. Those pilots reinforced my belief that a firearm is \nappropriate to protect a commercial aircraft from terrorism. Airline \npilots are crying out for guns to protect themselves, the plane and the \npassengers.\n  The Department of Transportation and the air carriers must be \nreasonable about this new law or Congress will speak again on the issue \nof armed pilots.\n  This legislation is a good first step and it is my hope and desire \nthat the Department of Transportation will work with the air carriers \nto provide pilots with training to possess a firearm in the cockpit of \ncommercial aircraft.\n  Please remember that we arm our Capitol Police with firearms, we arm \nour FBI and DEA with firearms, we arm our Air Marshals with firearms.\n  We also need to arm our commercial pilots with firearms. Armed pilots \nare a first line of deterrence and the last line of defense against \nterrorist hijackers.\n  We trust our commercial pilots to fly commercial aircraft, please \ngive our pilots the tools to protect the cockpit of these aircraft from \nany future act of terrorism.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to address an issue of the \nutmost importance. While I am deeply committed to increased safety and \nsecurity at our Nation's airports and on airplanes, I am greatly \nconcerned about how that security is paid for in this bill.\n  While I commend Senators Hollings and McCain for this much-awaited, \nmuch-needed piece of legislation, I disapprove of putting the burden of \nthis increased security on the passenger.\n  It's critical to our Nation's economy that we restore the flying \npublic's confidence in the safety of the aviation system. We need to \nget more planes in the air and we need to make sure they're full. \nLegislation that improves and expands security at our airports and on \nplanes is essential to getting citizens back in the air.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee I am deeply concerned \nabout restoring our underwhelmed economy. And securing our flying \npublic is a giant step closer to securing our economy.\n  As important as that is, I am very unhappy to say that this otherwise \nexcellent security bill as a ticket tax levied on airline passengers. A \nnew tax.\n  I don't believe that this is the time to raise taxes. Consumers need \ntax relief--not more taxes. We're trying to pass an economic stimulus \nbill. I note that we don't raise taxes in that bill, we give folks tax \nrelief. We're taking one step forward and two steps back in this \nCongress.\n  I enthusiastically supported the airline relief package Congress \npassed several weeks ago. We needed to assist the airlines for the good \nof our traveling public and the good of our economy.\n  But relief to the airlines won't do anyone any good, if they don't \nhave passengers to fly in their planes. Raising ticket prices surely \nwon't help get people to fly.\n  In my State of Montana, people believe they pay enough to fly around \nthe country. Since we are relieving the airlines of the security \nresponsibilities, if makes perfect sense that the $2.50 per passenger \nuser fee be assessed to the airlines, not the passengers.\n  I'd like to close by once again voicing my concern about how we pay \nfor this much-needed security bill. We need increased security in our \naviation system. That is clear. What we don't need is increased costs \nfor our flying public.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased that Congress has finally \nacted on this extremely important issue.\n  Even if the terrible plane crash earlier this week wasn't necessarily \nterrorism, everyone in Congress had to feel in the pit of their \nstomachs that tomorrow it could be a bomb. Congress needed to act to \nensure the American public that our Nation's aviation security system \nwill be the best it can be or Americans will not fly.\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\n  On September 11, our Nation's aviation system was transformed into a \nterrorist weapon. The United States was caught off-guard. Sadly, with \naviation security, we should not have been. That is why we needed to \npass this legislation.\n  All four planes hijacked were headed for my State of California. \nConsequently, many Californians who were simply trying to make their \nway home lost their lives in these attacks.\n  That is why I am particularly pleased that this legislation will \nensure that all high risk flights will have air marshals aboard them. \nAnd, the Secretary of Transportation is to give priority to long-\ndistance flights--such as those targeted on September 11. That is \nextremely important for Californians.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation will allow airports to be \nreimbursed and to use grant funds to pay for security costs. Our \nairports have been hit hard to meet new Federal security standards. For \nexample, between September 11 and the end of October, Los Angeles \nInternational Airport spent $15.3 million on increased security costs. \nThe funds in this bill will allow our airports to continue to operate \nour aviation infrastructure while providing the highest levels of \nsecurity.\n  This bill also makes a significant improvement in passenger \nscreeners. Federal law enforcement personnel will conduct passenger \nscreening, instead of private low-paid workers. We could not allow the \nsame companies to continue to be in charge of passenger screening.\n  This bill makes great strides forward in making our skies more secure \nand ensuring that the events of September 11 never happen again.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto elaborate upon the air travel security compromise reached yesterday \nby Congress--particularly the provisions in the bill that incorporate \nthe amendment authored by Senator Durbin and myself.\n  Consistent with the recommendations we made, the bill calls for the \nindividual named to the newly established position of Under Secretary \nof Transportation for Security to, within 6 months, review and \ndetermine which immediately available new technologies can be used to \nmore effectively restrict access to sensitive areas of our airports, \nincluding the tarmac, maintenance facilities, baggage handling centers \nand catering facilities. Such technologies may include biometrics, card \nor keypad-based access systems, and increased monitoring of emergency \nexit systems. The Under Secretary is directed to outline a strategy for \ndeploying these technologies within 12 months at all major airports.\n  The bill strengthens our recommendation to ensure that all checked \nbaggage is screened for explosives by requiring that, within 60 days, \nall bags be either checked or matched to a boarded passenger and that, \nby the end of 2002, airports deploy equipment to detect explosives in \nall checked baggage.\n  To meet new and unprecedented threats without delay, we must as a \nnation harness the power of innovation to improve transportation \nsecurity. That's why I was also pleased to see included in the \ncompromise our recommended authorization of $50 million in each of the \nnext 5 years for the public and private sectors to accelerate \ndevelopment and testing of new aviation security technologies--\nincluding faster, better, and cheaper passenger and baggage screening \nequipment; systems capable of detecting components of weapons of mass \ndestruction; systems for screening catering and cargo items; advances \nin training of security personnel; and new methods of ``hardening'' the \naircraft in the event of an in-flight explosion.\n  As called for by Senator Durbin and myself, the compromise also \nincludes $20 million for longer term research into state-of-the-art \nweapons detection systems, advanced biometrics, secure networking for \nsharing of threat information, and other groundbreaking technologies to \nprevent acts of terrorism in aviation.\n  I am also pleased to see included in the final bill my provision \nrequiring criminal background checks of all currently employed airport \nsecurity personnel. Given recent breaches of security and growing \nanxiety about the baggage screening process, Americans deserve every \nreassurance that screeners will be reliable and trustworthy.\n  I hope these measures and others begin to make the urgent and \nimmediate improvements necessary to secure our skies for the American \ntraveling public. With the holidays coming and the economy moving \ntoward recession, this legislation could not come at a better time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we are trying to get the bill over to \nthe House as promptly as we can. I am prepared to yield back our time, \nif the Senator from Texas as well is willing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, our side yields back all time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I stood in this place last Friday to warn \nCongress that we must not allow the administration to arrogate to \nitself the full authority to determine the trade policy of the United \nStates, that we must not be asleep at the wheel as the one-sided trade \njalopy goes rumbling down the fast track--the fast track. There we go \nagain.\n  For what this Congress calls fast track, the administration uses the \neuphemistic term ``trade promotion authority.'' Trade promotion \nauthority--it certainly has an innocent enough sound. It is a sound \nthat is rather sweet to the ears--trade promotion authority. But lift \nup the cover of this euphemistic term, lift the cover, just peep a \nlittle under it, and you will find the real villain: fast track, fast-\ntrack authority.\n  So last Friday I stood in my place here and said to Congress that we \nmust not allow the administration to arrogate to itself the authority \nto determine the trade policy of the United States, that we must not be \nasleep at the wheel ``as the one-sided trade jalopy'' goes rumbling \ndown the fast track. I was referring, of course, as I say, to the \nadministration's request, its wolf in sheep's clothing request for \nspecial authority to negotiate trade agreements that would not be \nsubject to normal rules of debate and amendment.\n  I was also referring to the penchants of Presidents, both Republican \nand Democrat, in these more recent years to offer our trading partners \nunilateral concessions in exchange for the mantle of global leadership. \nAs Jackie Gleason used to say, ``How sweet it is''--to wear the mantle \nof global leadership.\n  The news from Doha, Qatar, confirms my worst fears. According to the \nWall Street Journal, our trade negotiator, Ambassador Robert Zoellick, \n``led the way in making extraordinary concessions to developing \ncountries,'' including ``agreeing to renegotiate America's anti-dumping \nlaws.''\n  I quote a little further from the Wall Street Journal news story.\n\n       U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Zoellick faced a stark choice when \n     he arrived in Doha, Qatar, last week: He could win either \n     fast-track negotiating authority from Congress or a new round \n     of trade talks.\n       To get a World Trade Organization deal, Mr. Zoellick would \n     have to make concessions to poor countries that would so \n     infuriate Congress that lawmakers wouldn't grant fast-track \n     authority. To get fast track, which would allow President \n     Bush to negotiate trade deals that Congress could approve or \n     reject, but not amend, he would have to\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\n     make concessions to liberal Democrats that would so anger \n     poorer countries that they wouldn't open new trade talks.\n       On Monday, Mr. Zoellick announced his decision to a group \n     of ministers and delegates at the convention center in Doha, \n     where the WTO was meeting. The U.S., he said, would cede to \n     their demands to allow negotiations on America's hated \n     antidumping laws, which punish other countries that ``dump'' \n     products on the U.S. market at below cost.\n       Before going to Qatar, Mr. Zoellick said he was fed up with \n     Democrats' demands for more concessions on fast track. He \n     pointed to his decision to allow a big steel trade case to go \n     forward, which could temporarily shutter the U.S. market to \n     some foreign steel. He said his fast-track proposal also \n     addressed labor and environmental concerns of Democrats. ``At \n     some point, people are going to have to decide if they can \n     take yes for an answer,'' Mr. Zoellick said.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire story from the \nWall Street Journal of November 16 be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1).\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, so you see Mr. Zoellick, according to the \nWall Street Journal, ``led the way in making extraordinary concessions \nto developing countries,'' including ``agreeing to renegotiate \nAmerica's anti-dumping laws.'' Among the big winners, according to the \nJournal, were foreign steel makers and big multinational manufacturers. \nThe big losers? Guess. I will give you one guess. U.S. steel makers and \nauto makers are the big losers.\n  Our trading partners, who often protect their home markets by turning \na blind eye to anticompetitive practices by their big manufacturers, \nhypocritically call our trade laws ``protectionist,'' and they find \nallies here in the United States among those who claim for themselves \nthe banner of ``free trade.'' Let us be clear: the American people \ndemand that the fruits of their labor be able to compete without fear \nof foreign predation. They want trade that is both free and fair.\n  Let us also clear away--once and for all--the cant about \n``protectionism.'' Our antidumping law is based on a very simple \nrequirement for foreign manufacturers. What is it? Do not injure \nproducers in our market by selling below cost or charging less here \nthan you charge in your home market. The plain fact is that foreign \nproducers of certain products, such as steel and autos and lumber, dump \nin America year after year after year, and put all of their efforts \ninto weakening our antidumping laws. Their home governments, whose \nmarkets are much less open than ours, work fist-in-glove with these \npredators.\n  Our countervailing duty law, which the Administration has also placed \non the negotiating table, is no more protectionist than our antidumping \nlaw. The law is based on a very simple requirement for foreign \ngovernments: Do not seek trade advantages by subsidizing the production \nof merchandise that your companies sell in the United States. Hands \noff. If you do, we will apply an offsetting tax to the unfairly traded \ngoods that come into our country.\n  Why should we permit our trade laws to be eviscerated by foreign \ninterests? What possible rationale could there be for putting our \nantidumping and countervailing duty laws on the negotiating table? Is \nit to further distort competition to the disadvantage of U.S. \nproducers?\n  Let me give you an example of what passes for a so-called \n``legitimate'' trade dispute in the eyes of many of our trading \npartners. In many countries, government-owned steel companies have been \nthe beneficiaries of massive subsidization over a period of decades. \nWithout these subsidies, the steel companies would simply not exist in \nthose countries. They would be gone with the wind. After pouring \nbillions of dollars into a government-owned company, the foreign \ngovernment then sells it off for pennies on the dollar--pennies on the \ndollar, or pennies from heaven. The newly privatized company, which \nwants to sell its subsidized overcapacity in the United States, then \nhas the audacity to claim a ``privatization exemption'' from U.S. \ncountervailing duties. Mind you, there is nothing in any agreement to \nwhich we are a party that gives privatized companies such an exemption. \nNevertheless, under current international rules, the United States must \nfight like the dickens to apply countervailing duties in these \nsituations. What will happen after we put our trade laws on the \nnegotiating table?\n  In short, the United States must not capitulate, Mr. President, to \nthese foreign predators. More to the point, Congress--the body which is \nclosest to the people--must not cede its authority over foreign \ncommerce to the Chief Executive.\n  The Framers of the Constitution did not cede that authority to the \nExecutive, no. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress \nthe exclusive authority over such matters.\n  Let's take a look at article I, section 8, of the Constitution, which \nI hold in my hand. What does it say? Section 8:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power--\n\n  It does not say the executive branch; it does not say the President \nof the United States; it does not say that vaunted title: The Commander \nin Chief--\n  The Constitution says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations--\n\n  Aha, there it is. There it is in black and white. Read it and run.\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with \n     the Indian Tribes. . . .\n\n  Well, you say, Congress can delegate certain authority. Well, that is \ntrue. But can it delegate the authority given to the Congress by the \nConstitution to debate and amend? And that is what we do. That is what \nwe do when we support something like fast track.\n  So, Mr. President, the Constitution is what I have just read.\n  Let the Constitution, our Nation's shining glory, be our guiding \nlight. Let us demand that our trade negotiators take a strong stand for \nAmerican jobs and American values. All countries benefit from \ninternational trade, and all countries must share in the costs of \nconstructing the framework of that trade.\n  Now, as I have said many times on this floor--I ought not have to \nrepeat it--I am not suggesting that Congress get involved in the \nminutiae of international trade agreements. I am not suggesting that we \ninject ourselves into each little teensy-weensy, itsy-bitsy tariff \ndetermination. Our trade laws, however, are not minutiae. They \nrepresent the sole hope for companies that are being picked apart by \nvulturous foreign trading practices.\n  Communities across America, all across the land--the East, the West, \nthe North, and the South--are waiting to see whether we are strong \nenough to stand up for their interests--their interests--the people's \ninterests.\n  They are waiting to see whether the United States will once more be \nduped by those whose unabashed--unabashed--motive is to gut the \nframework of fair trade. If we stand by the Constitution--if we stand \nby the Constitution--that magnificently balanced instrument of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people, we will not fail our \nconstituents. As well, we will herald a trade policy for the new \nmillennium, a trade policy according to which we do not sacrifice hard-\nworking Americans at the altar, at the altar, at the ``Golden Calf,'' \nif you please, of nebulous foreign policy objectives, a trade policy \nthat is based on the pursuit of mutual benefit among sovereign nations.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is not protectionism. If it is, then I am \nfor it. That is not protectionism. It is a policy based on the \ntraditional principles of national sovereignty as well as the absolute \nrespect of each law-abiding nation for every other such nation. It is a \npolicy the American people expect, and it is one that we--the elected \nrepresentatives of the people--have a constitutional duty to uphold.\n  May God bless America. But in doing so, may God bless the \nConstitution of this Republic. Thank God for that Constitution. I hope \nthe administration will read it over the Thanksgiving holiday. It might \nbe well if we ourselves all read it again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 16, 2001]\n\n                           Politics & Policy\n\n  Zoellick's Trade Concession Wins WTO Talks But Could Cost Bush Fast-\n                            Track Authority\n\n                 (By Helene Cooper and Shailagh Murray)\n\n       Washington.--U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Zoellick faced a stark \n     choice when he arrived in Doha, Qatar, last week: He could \n     win\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\n     either fast-track negotiating authority from Congress or a \n     new round of trade talks.\n       To get a world Trade Organization deal, Mr. Zoellick, would \n     have to make concessions to poor countries that would so \n     infuriate Congress that lawmakers would't grant fast-track \n     authority. To get fast track, which would allow President \n     Bush to negotiate trade deals that Congress could approve or \n     reject, but not amend, he would have to make concessions to \n     liberal Democrats that would so anger poorer countries that \n     they wouldn't open new trade talks.\n       On Monday, Mr. Zoellick announced his decision to a group \n     of ministers and delegates at the convention center in Doha, \n     where the WTO was meeting. The U.S., he said, would cede to \n     their demands to allow negotiations on America's hated \n     antidumping laws, which punish other countries that ``dump'' \n     products on the U.S. market at below cost.\n       Bill Klinefelter, the United Steelworkers of America \n     representative who sent to Doha to keep Mr. Zoellick from \n     negotiating on U.S. antidumping laws, was furious. Mr. \n     Zoellick, he said, could ``kiss fast track goodbye. He's \n     never getting it now.''\n       The irony is that without fast track, Mr. Zoellick won't be \n     able to conclude the trade talks launched at the WTO meeting. \n     Trade envoys hope to wrap us the talks in three years, though \n     few really believe they will finish that early.\n       Thursday, lawmakers were still digesting the details of the \n     Doha agreement. Republicans praised it and said they still \n     plan to try to get fast track. House Speaker Dennis Hastert \n     (R., Ill.) said he still hopes to bring fast-track authority \n     to a vote the week after Thanksgiving. But there is little \n     chance of passage without some support from moderate \n     Democrats--and few were cheering.\n       Mr. Zoellick's fast-track proposal ``was not tenable before \n     Doha, and it's even less tenable after Doha,'' said Rep \n     Sander Levin, (D., Mich.) the only lawmaker who attended the \n     WTO meeting.\n       House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) told \n     reporters Mr. Zoellick's concessions were ``negative in terms \n     of getting agreement on'' fast track. ``They put on the table \n     for negotiation our antidumping laws,'' he said. ``We are in \n     the middle of a steel crisis now in terms of losing sales and \n     losing capacity in our steel system.''\n       The U.S. steel industry is one of the biggest beneficiaries \n     of antidumping laws, so lawmakers from steel states don't \n     want to see those laws weakened. Mr. Zoellick's decision ``is \n     a stunning betrayal of America's workers,'' said Rep. Peter \n     Visclosky (D., Ind.) vice chairman of the Congressional Steel \n     Caucus. ``Putting our trade laws on the table flies in the \n     face of fair trade and totally disregards the expressed will \n     of Congress that our trade laws not be negotiated away.''\n       Before going to Qatar, Mr. Zoellick said he was fed up with \n     Democrats' demands for more concessions on fast track. He \n     pointed to his decision to allow a big steel trade case to go \n     forward, which could temporarily shutter the U.S. market to \n     some foreign steel. He said his fast-track proposal also \n     addressed labor and environmental concerns of Democrats. ``At \n     some point, people are going to have to decide if they can \n     take yes for an answer,'' Mr. Zoellick said.\n       Some moderate Democrats defended Mr. Zoellick's concessions \n     on steel and said they still hope to salvage fast track. \n     ``The challenge is making sure everyone understands the \n     provisions,'' said Rep. Calvin Dooley (D., Calif.).\n       In Doha, Mr. Zoellick steadfastly protected America's \n     textile industry. He repeatedly turned down demands from \n     India and Pakistan that the U.S. import more clothing. That \n     decision was looking almost fortuitous, but it clearly won't \n     be enough to bring about converts on fast track: Burlington \n     Industries Inc., Greensboro, N.C., filed for Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy protection and blamed it on cheap imports. \n     Burlington Chief Executive George W. Henderson specifically \n     cited the U.S. government as a culprit, saying it used the \n     textile industry as a bargaining chip in international \n     relations.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the Senate earlier today approved a \nconference report that will increase security substantially at our \nNation's airports. And this is a good step--a good step--toward \nrestoring the American people's confidence in their own safety. And it \nis a good step forward in rejuvenating our economy, the American \neconomy.\n  This is very fine legislation. But I wish to remind ourselves that a \nfew days ago we had a golden opportunity to enact other very fine \nlegislation that would go far in rejuvenating the hope, the faith, and \nthe confidence in the minds of the American people that the Government \nwas looking out for their security, for their welfare. And I refer to \nthat amendment which Senator Harry Reid, the distinguished Democratic \nwhip in this body, and the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Daschle, \nand Senator Hollings, and other Senators and I offered, to guarantee, \nto a much greater extent than I have to explain today, the defense of \nour homeland, homeland defense.\n  That legislation was rejected by the minority in this body. So while \nwe congratulate ourselves--and rightly so--on enacting legislation \ndealing with safety at our airports, safety to the travelers on \nairplanes, that does not bring an end to the threat of bioterrorism.\n  The legislation we passed today will not provide for smallpox \nvaccines and anthrax antibiotics. My amendment a few days ago, the \nhomeland defense amendment to the so-called stimulus bill, would \nprovide for smallpox vaccine, would provide money, $4 billion, to end \nthe threat of bioterrorism.\n  Our Republican friends rejected it. I hear that some of the House \nconferees don't want to have any conferences over there in which the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, or Senator Robert Byrd are in \nattendance. They don't want to hold any conferences, I hear. I read \nthat in the paper, that certain Members of the other body have said: We \ndon't want Senator Daschle and Senator Robert Byrd to be in the room \nwhen we are talking about homeland defense.\n  Will this legislation provide for smallpox vaccine and anthrax \nantibiotics? No. But our legislation which we offered the other day \nwould have. It was turned down. The Republicans said: No, no, no.\n  The bill we passed today doesn't improve the training of our doctors \nand nurses, but that $15 billion homeland defense amendment would have \nimproved the training of our doctors and nurses, would have expanded \nthe capacity of local hospitals and medical labs.\n  The legislation we passed today is good legislation, but it leaves \nmuch work to be done. Of course, nobody ever told us that that \nlegislation was the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, of \nhomeland security legislation. I am not making that charge. But I am \ntalking about some other homeland security provisions that were in the \namendment which I offered at the time Mr. Max Baucus, the Senator from \nMontana, was offering his tax legislation.\n\n  Does the legislation we passed today provide counterterrorism \ntraining for our local police and fire departments? Does it give them \naccess to new resources and equipment so that they are prepared to \nrespond to possible future terrorist attacks? Does it tighten security \nat our borders and at our shipping ports? Does it provide for better \nprotection of our food supply against possible biological attack? \nSadly, the answer to these questions is a resounding no, no, no.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to provide for the common \ndefense. That is what the preamble to the Constitution mentions, among \nother things: Provide for the common defense. We have a responsibility \nto provide resources to prevent future potential terrorist attacks and \nto ensure rapid response should another attack, God forbid, occur. We \nhave a job to do.\n  While we are at home on Thanksgiving Day, we should give thanks for \nour many blessings, but we should also be thinking about the job that \nis still left undone. We have work to do.\n  To date we have been unable to do that job because of partisan \ngridlock. What a sad commentary on the Senate. What a sad commentary on \nthe Congress. When we return from the Thanksgiving break, we will \nrefocus. We will be back, Lord willing. We will be back. We will \nrefocus on homeland security, homeland defense. I hope we can make the \nsame kind of rapid bipartisan progress to improve our defenses here at \nhome as we have achieved today in airport security.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we have watched on television the \nimages of women in various places in Afghanistan, in cities, towns, \nrunning into the streets without male relatives and throwing away their \nburqas. I was here a week ago talking about how women were treated in \nAfghanistan. I brought with me the eyeshade they must wear, which is \nnetting they can barely see out of and people can see nothing beyond. \nAll over Afghanistan, women can wear these if they want, but they are \nnot required.\n  A week ago, women would have been beaten publicly, or even executed, \nfor these acts. Under the Taliban's rule, women could not work outside \nthe home, receive an education, or even leave their home unless \naccompanied by a close male relative--brother, father, or husband.\n  The defeat of the Taliban means that Afghan women are now free from \nthe Taliban's brutal rule. As we begin the peace process and \nreconstruction of the Afghan Government, we cannot forget about the \nwomen who, in spite of the Taliban's harsh edicts, risked their lives \nto run home schools and health clinics. That is just not a matter of a \nfew words. They actually risked their lives by taking care of sick \npeople and teaching kids how to read.\n  We have to remember that, prior to the Taliban's rule, Afghan women \nwere scientists, professors, Members of Parliament, and university \nprofessors. They led corporations and nonprofit organizations. In fact, \nwomen were 70 percent of the nation's schoolteachers, 40 percent of the \ndoctors, 50 percent of the civilian government workers, and 50 percent \nof the college students in Kabul.\n  These women must play a role in the rebuilding of post-Taliban \nAfghanistan. In particular, the education system must be rebuilt with \nthe help of the women, who once comprised the majority of the nation's \nteachers. I hope that we, at the first opportunity, move in an army of \nPeace Corps workers. They will teach people English and how to read \ngenerally.\n  I hope the United Nations will focus on the problems of education in \nAfghanistan. We have to direct our humanitarian aid to the specific \nneeds of the Afghan women and girls who suffered major setback after \nmajor setback as a result of this tyrannic rule. For example, over 90 \npercent of Afghan girls are illiterate. Rebuilding the country's \neducational system is the only way to repair the damage Afghan women \nand girls have suffered at the hands of the Taliban. Women will be key \nto this event.\n  We also cannot let misconceptions about a very good religion, Islam, \nguide our efforts in the reshaping of a post-Taliban Afghanistan. \nNowhere does the religion say women cannot be educated or employed. In \nfact, the president of the world's largest Islamic organization in \nIndonesia is a woman.\n  As I said, 70 percent of Afghanistan's teachers were women prior to \nthe Taliban regime. Afghanistan first adopted a constitution in 1964 \nthat included universal suffrage, equal rights for women, and \nseparation of powers with an independent judiciary. Afghan women were \nmembers of the judiciary, Parliament, and Cabinet, and 30 percent of \nAfghan's civil service workers were women.\n  If we are truly committed to restoring the human rights of the Afghan \npeople, and we are, then we must be truly committed to restoring the \nrights of Afghan women because then women will be given from the start \na seat at the table of the peace process and the establishment of the \nfuture Government of Afghanistan. Only then will we be truly able to \nsecure the rights of the Afghan women.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Mr. President, before we adjourn for the week, I want to \ncomment about the Agriculture Committee's action yesterday here in the \nSenate. I'm very pleased that they passed the farm bill out of the \ncommittee, which will, I hope very soon, come to the floor of the \nSenate. I want to make a few comments about it, about the importance of \nit to family farmers.\n  We deal with a lot of issues in the Senate. I know everyone has a \nfavorite issue or a most important issue from their State or from their \nperspective. I come from a farm State. The subject of family farming is \nvery important to me.\n  I know some say: But the family farm in America is largely gone. In \nany event, the notion of family farms is just old nostalgia. It is not \nrelevant to today. Today we need big, mechanized corporate \nagrifactories. The family farm is like the little old diner that got \nleft behind when the interstate came through. It is kind of nice to \nlook back at what it was and think about it, but it is really not \nrelevant in today's terms.\n  Those who believe that are just dead wrong. Family farming remains a \ncritically important part of this country's economy.\n  Will Rogers said, many years ago:\n\n       You know, if one day all the lawyers and accountants in \n     America failed to show up for work, it really wouldn't mean \n     very much. But if one day all the cows in the United States \n     failed to show up to get milked, now that would be a problem.\n\n  He was in his own, simple, interesting way describing the importance \nof agriculture. It is the case, it seems to me, that our country has \nbeen blessed by not being hungry as a nation. We have had some pockets \nof hunger to be sure, but we have not been hungry as a nation for many \ndecades. So we forget from time to time the contribution made by family \nfarms.\n  I think most people in a highly urban setting just think of butter as \ncoming from a little box that you pick up at the grocery store. Cereal? \nWhy that comes from a box as well. Pasta? That comes from a box with a \ncellophane window so you can see the size of the pasta you are buying. \nBut, in fact, it all comes from a field somewhere, a\n\n[[Page S11989]]\n\nbarn somewhere. It comes from the sweat of the brow of a family farmer, \noften a man and woman who decided to latch their dreams to running a \nfamily farm, to being independent, and to producing from the land.\n  It is true they have had a pretty difficult time in recent years. I \nhave had calls from farmers over the years, especially in recent years. \nA woman called me. She said: My husband and I got married shortly after \nhigh school, and for 18 years we have run a dairy farm. We milk 80 \ncows, milk them every morning and every night. If you know anything \nabout milking cows it is a tough job.\n  She began to weep on the phone as she described the financial \nhardship they were facing and the fact they were going to have to sell \ntheir farm because they couldn't make their payments because the price \nof milk had collapsed.\n  She said: It's not our fault. We don't go to town on Saturday night. \nWe don't spend money in a way that is extravagant. When my children say \nthey need a new pair of jeans for school, I have to say we have to wait \nbecause we don't have the money to buy jeans right now.\n  She said: The fact is, we have done everything we possibly can. We \nhave worked as hard as we can to make this dream come true and we are \nlosing our farm. And through tears she described the death of this \ndream that she and her husband had.\n  That is happening across our country these days as the price of \ncommodities collapse and families, one by one, confront this terrible \ndilemma. One fellow wrote to me and he said he was sitting at his \ndinner table at 1:30 in the morning. He said: I am writing this letter \nto you at 1:30 in the morning, telling you about where I live and where \nI farm. It is spooky quiet around here. Most of my neighbors are gone. \nThey left family farming because they couldn't make it. I go to town, a \nsmall town, and the Main Street is spooky quiet. There aren't any \nvehicles on Main Street anymore.\n\n  He described in a passionate way his belief about wanting to pursue \nhis dream, of continuing to farm the land and raise America's food, but \nnot being able to when the price of their commodities is below the cost \nof production when they take them to the elevator.\n  We have passed a farm bill through the Agriculture Committee and we \nneed to get it to the floor of the Senate. We need to get it to the \nPresident and he needs to sign it. Why? Because we need a farm bill \nthat says to family farmers: During tough times, when you run into \nprice valleys, we have a bridge that takes you across those price \nvalleys. Why? Because this country believes you are an important part \nof our economy and because we believe both economic and national \nsecurity rests on our having a network of people who produce our food \nacross this country.\n  It is true that we could probably have a country without family \nfarmers and giant agrifactories would produce our food. From California \nto Maine, the largest agrifactories in our country would produce food. \nThey would milk 3,500 cows three times a day, as some dairy operations \ndo in California. They would drive tractors in one direction until they \nare out of gas and then gas up and drive back. We all understand about \ngiant agrifactories It is just that family farms produce more than just \nfood, and that is what people forget. The agrifactories produce just \nfood. Family farms produce communities. They produce a culture. They \nproduce family values. Those family values move from the family farm to \nsmall towns to big cities, nourishing and refreshing family values in \nAmerica. It has always been the case, and it is not old-fashioned to \nthink that should be part of our future as well.\n  How do we make that a part of our future? We as a Congress and we as \na country say to family farmers: You matter. You are an important part \nof our future. We are going to pass farm legislation that reflects the \nurgency, reflects our desire to address this problem of collapsed \nprices, this problem of tough times for America's economic All Stars. \nWe produce the best quality food for the lowest percent of disposable \nincome of anyone in the world. In the spring, family farms in North \nDakota or elsewhere in the Farm Belt, they borrow money to buy the \nseed, the fuel and the fertilizer; fix up the tractor; and then plow \nthe ground and plant the seed. Then they hope, hope above hope, that it \nwon't hail, that it will rain enough, that it won't rain too much, that \nthe bugs won't come, or disease won't hit. Finally in the fall, they \ngrease up the combine and go out and take that crop off the field, put \nit in the back of a 2-ton truck and haul it to the country elevator. \nAfter all this, if everything falls into place and works, they are told \nby the grain trader: By the way, that food you have produced doesn't \nhave value. And that family farmer scratches his or her head and says: \nDoesn't have value? A half billion people go to bed at night with an \nache in their belly and the food we produce in such great abundance has \nno value?\n  The farmer is told what they do is not valuable to this country. And \nthe farmer wonders--in a country where the saying goes, two-thirds of \nthe people are on a diet and a substantial portion of the world is \nhungry, and those who are producing America's food are told that their \nfood has no value--farmers rightly wonder whether there is a connection \nmissing someplace, whether there are some wires hooked up wrong.\n  Clearly, if you look at this world and evaluate what this world needs \nto produce peace and stability, and to help people live a better life, \nthe first item would be to say we need to alleviate hunger.\n  Just as a note, One of my friends many years ago was a singer named \nHarry Chapin. Harry was a wonderful man. When I announced I was going \nto run for Congress, he flew to North Dakota and did a concert; \nwouldn't even allow me to pay for his airline ticket. He showed up, \nborrowed a Martin guitar from the local music store, and did a 3-hour \nconcert to 2,400 people who filled the Chester Fritz Auditorium in \nGrand Forks, ND. What a wonderful guy he was.\n\n  The reason I talk about Harry Chapin is that he donated one-half of \nthe proceeds of his concerts every year to fight world hunger. He used \nto say that hunger is not headlines. It just isn't, because people die \nevery single day. Every single day, 45,000 children die from hunger and \nhunger-related causes around the world, and you won't read a thing \nabout it in tomorrow's paper. He said if 45,000 people died in New \nJersey tomorrow from one terrible calamity or another, it would be \nheadlines. But every day, the winds of hunger sweep across this globe, \nand children die, people die, and somehow it is not headlines.\n  Then our farmers in North Dakota go to the elevator with a load of \ngrain that they prayed they would be able to raise against all the odds \nto be told that grain has no value, that food has no value. They have a \nright to wonder whether the wires are not connected somewhere with \nrespect to our priorities.\n  In the midst of all that background, we wrote a farm bill. This \nCongress wrote a farm bill a while back called Freedom to Farm. It \nshould have been titled ``freedom to fail.'' It was a terrible piece of \nlegislation. It didn't work.\n  We have done an emergency bill every year to try to fill the vacuum \nthat was created by this piece of legislation that didn't work, and \nthis law has one more year to go.\n  Next year, the Freedom to Farm bill expires. We believe that this is \nthe time to write a bill so that when farmers go into the field next \nyear, they will know there is a better farm program.\n  Congressman Combest in the House, against the advice of the White \nHouse and the President, wrote a bill. They said: Don't do it this \nyear. He said: It doesn't matter what anybody says; I am going to do \nit; it needs to be done. Good for him.\n  Senator Harkin yesterday in the Agriculture Committee said we are \ngoing to write a bill. It was reported out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and now our challenge is to bring it to the floor of the \nSenate immediately when we return. I understand there are some here \ntalking about blocking it. As we know, it takes 60 votes to overcome \nthose who want to block legislation. I think we can do that, if we \nmust, but I hope they will not try to block it.\n  We have a responsibility. In my judgment, we ought to write this farm \nbill this year. Even if you do not care much about family farmers--I \ncan't conceive\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\nof people who do not--you ought to care about food security in this \ncountry.\n  How do you best provide food security in America? You do that by \nhaving a broad network of dispersed producers producing America's food. \nIf you are concerned about bioterrorism harming America's food supply, \nyou should be concerned about feedlots with 200,000 animals run by the \nbig agrifactories. In contrast, widely dispersed family farms that dot \nthe Nation and which represent the network of producers across the \nprairie, they are much less at risk, when it comes to bioterrorism.\n  If this country wants to do something for its economic future, for \neconomic recovery, for food security, for national security, then it \nought to decide it will stand up for family farmers and pass a decent \nfarm bill.\n  Let me make a comment about the legislation that passed the House and \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee. That legislation is not perfect. It \nis not what I would write were I to write it myself. However, it is \nbetter than the than Freedom to Farm. Each hurdle is a hurdle that we \nhave to get past. We got past a hurdle yesterday by getting this out of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee. The next hurdle is to get it on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n\n  I urge my Colleagues to bring this farm bill up as soon as we return \nfrom the Thanksgiving break. I hope to offer an amendment that will \nimprove the safety net in this bill. I hope we pass this farm bill \nafter some improvements on the floor. Then we can have a conference \nwith the House, and then send the bill to the President.\n  We cannot fail in this job. We have a responsibility to pass a farm \nbill, and to do it now and do it right.\n  As I said, I know a lot of people have a lot of different interests. \nI come from a farm State. Yet I stand on the floor of the Senate and I \nsay to people, I support Amtrak. I am a strong believer in Amtrak. Why? \nBecause I think this country needs a rail passenger system. Amtrak \ncomes to North Dakota, and it is important to us. But it is not the \nbiggest issue in the world. To me, the national issue of having rail \npassenger service in this country is a very important issue. I support \nmass transit in the cities. We don't have mass transit in my home \ncounty. My home county has 3,000 people.\n  I support mass transit because, as a national matter, this country \nneeds it. I hope my colleagues will understand as well that when I \nsupport those issues for the major urban centers of America, they will \ndo themselves and this country a favor by supporting the rural \ninterests which also contribute to America's security and which \ncontribute to America's enterprise and economic health.\n  I thank the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin and others \nwho led the way to get a bill out of that committee yesterday, and \ntheir staff who worked so hard to get this done. Next week we will not \nbe in session because of Thanksgiving. But the week following, it is \nthe desire of Senator Daschle, myself and many others, including \nSenator Harkin, that we will bring that bill to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We very much want to put a farm bill on the President's desk and get \nthat legislation signed. We want our farmers in this country to go into \nthe fields next spring and plant next year's crops under a farm bill \nthat has a better support level than the current bill, one that gives \nthem the hope that if they do the right thing and things work well for \nthem, they will be able to make a living on the family farm next year.\n  Mr. President, I see colleagues waiting to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about a program \nfor vaccinating Americans, particularly as the country heads towards \nthe season when many have the flu.\n  This is an area I have a great interest in since my days as director \nof the Oregon Gray Panthers. Obviously, older people are particularly \nvulnerable. This year, certainly there is going to be considerable \nfocus on the flu vaccination program.\n  Given the new threats of bioterrorism that have been widely \ndiscussed, certainly many are going to be particularly interested in \ngetting the flu vaccination. It is important that we reevaluate how flu \nvaccinations are provided in light of the unfortunate, significant new \nhealth concerns of many Americans.\n  Certainly the threat of bioterrorism has increased demand for flu \nshots. In my view, it has caused considerable confusion. In recent \ndays, my office has canvassed State health departments and many senior \ncitizens programs around the Nation. We have found that while no \nshortage currently exists, there are delays and certainly a substantial \namount of misinformation about the various programs and services that \nare available for older people. There have also been problems with one \nmanufacturer that may be exacerbating delays in getting vaccine doses \nout to the public.\n  Even more important, my sense is there isn't yet a clear, \nunderstandable system in place for ensuring that high-risk Americans, \nparticularly the Nation's older people, are vaccinated early and first.\n  My sense is that more needs to be done in addition to prioritizing \nthe concerns of high-risk, vulnerable Americans to put in place a \nbetter distribution system for getting out vaccines. There needs to be \na better plan to make sure that there are processes in place, if there \nare problems or snafus of one manufacturer. It is extremely important \nthat there be a uniform message coming from all health officials with \nrespect to the flu vaccine program.\n  For example, while CDC and others have told Americans to get \nvaccinated later, others in the health system have urged Americans to \nget vaccinated quickly against the flu because of the anthrax threat.\n  Since anthrax has been in the news so much, it is logical for people \nto think they should get vaccinated immediately. But because people \ncannot get their shot the day they want it or the day a clinic is \nscheduled, some people may think there is an immediate shortage.\n  On the basis of the survey we have just done of the State health \ndepartments and many senior citizen centers, it does not appear there \nis a shortage with respect to the vaccine. But there are delays. There \nare instances where mixed messages have been sent by public health \nofficials. This has certainly contributed to the confusion that exists.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Breaux, the Senate Aging Committee \nhas been looking into this issue. At Senator Breaux's request--and let \nme also state the ranking minority member, Senator Craig, on the Aging \nCommittee has been considerably interested in this in the past as \nwell--our Aging Committee held a hearing that I chaired to look at the \nflu vaccine program.\n  We have worked with Secretary Thompson. I think he has made a number \nof steps that are constructive and have moved the program in the right \ndirection, but certainly there is more to do.\n  For example, our survey found that in Indiana they received about 10 \npercent of the order the counties have placed, but it will have 50 to \n100 percent of their order in 4 to 6 weeks. And, obviously, if \nshipments don't arrive on time, don't arrive in line with the plans \nthat the programs and the senior citizen centers are putting out to \ntheir members, there is going to be a great deal of confusion.\n  So as we move to this crunch time for vaccinations, health officials \nin this country still cannot tell us if all the high-risk patients are \nbeing vaccinated, or if there are plans to vaccinate them. I think we \nneed to develop a better system, for example, to track seniors who are \nin these programs. Many are signed up, and there are others who should \nbe vaccinated early. This can be done if the public health system wants \nto do it.\n  So around the country there are concerns. I mentioned Indiana. In the \nState of Oregon, one large provider of public health clinics has \nreceived only about 40 percent of their order.\n  In Michigan, health officials are concerned that by the time they get \nthe rest of the order they need in December, the public will not come. \nDoses may actually have to be dumped. So there are a variety of \nconcerns about the flu vaccine program.\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in yesterday's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2001]\n\n                       Longer Lines for Flu Shots\n\n\n          Increase Attributed in Part To Anxiety About Anthrax\n\n                            (By Leef Smith)\n\n       Regional health care providers are reporting a 20 to 30 \n     percent increase in the number of people lining up at grocery \n     stores and community clinics for flu shots, and attribute \n     part of the surge to widespread anxiety about anthrax.\n       The early symptoms of inhalation anthrax--fever, cough and \n     muscle pain--resemble those of the flu. As a result, doctors \n     say, many people are getting vaccinated in hopes of staving \n     off the flu and thus making anthrax easier to diagnose should \n     it occur.\n       ``We're seeing a lot of first-time flu shots,'' said Susan \n     Randall, a registered nurse and clinical manager for Inova \n     HealthSource, which is spearheading the Fight the Flu \n     campaign in Northern Virginia and plans to administer 80,000 \n     flu shots this season. The campaign plans to provide 50,000 \n     shots in Maryland and the District. ``If you ask people why \n     they're getting the vaccination . . . some will say they're \n     afraid of anthrax,'' she said.\n       But Randall said flu is serious enough on its own for \n     people to consider being inoculated. ``While it's tragic \n     we've had four anthrax deaths, over 20,000 people die of the \n     flu each year,'' she said. ``People should take the flu \n     seriously.''\n       The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     issued the same advice, noting on its Web site that numerous \n     viruses cause flu-like symptoms. The site also discourages \n     people from getting a flu shot simply to reduce concern about \n     anthrax exposure.\n       ``You should get a flu shot to avoid the flu, and the \n     symptoms of the flu, not to avoid anthrax,'' said CDC \n     spokesman Curtis Allen. ``They're two different issues.''\n       Flu seasons begins in November, with cases generally \n     peaking in January and February.\n       Health care providers strive to vaccinate high-risk \n     groups--people 65 and older, those with chronic medical \n     conditions, medical workers and some pregnant women--by the \n     end of October. But a delay this year in the delivery of flu \n     vaccine from manufacturers--some of whom are upgrading their \n     equipment to increase productivity--has hampered that effort.\n       CDC officials say there is more vaccine being manufactured \n     this year than ever before--about 85 million doses--and \n     insist that there will be enough to meet the rising demand.\n       A little more than half the supply was sent to distributors \n     and health care organizations by the end of October, and \n     another large batch is expected this month. The rest is due \n     in December, although officials with the Food and Drug \n     Administration, as well as the CDC, say the timetable could \n     change.\n       Because of a supply delay, only about half of the 14,000 \n     high-risk patients treated by Johns Hopkins Community \n     Physicians, a coalition of 18 private medical practices, have \n     received their vaccinations. The group had planned to \n     vaccinate all of its at-risk patients by the end of October.\n       ``We thought we were so smart,'' said physician Barbara \n     Cook. ``We put up posters telling people if you're 65 or \n     older, come in and get your shots. We had to take them all \n     down because we ran out of vaccine almost immediately.''\n       Likewise, the Fairfax County Health Department, which \n     usually aims to begin its vaccination program for high-risk \n     patients in early November, has received only 10 percent of \n     the 5,800 doses of vaccine it ordered. While delays are not \n     uncommon, officials said this year's has forced them to \n     postpone many of their vaccination clinics.\n       ``It would be our preference to immunize as early as \n     possible, but without vaccine, we can't do that,'' said \n     Rosalyn Foroobar, assistant director of patient care services \n     for the Health Department. ``Hopefully, we'll be able to \n     provide [the shots] before the flu season really does hit. \n     We'll get it. It's just late.''\n       Even if everyone who wants a vaccination gets one, Randall \n     of Inova HealthSource isn't sure that will be enough to \n     prevent panic when flu season strikes in earnest.\n       ``I think that underlying anxiety out there will cause \n     people to wonder'' about anthrax, she said. ``Even if they've \n     gotten a flu shot, I think our emergency rooms are going to \n     be very, very busy.''\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to work with public \nhealth programs in their communities. I certainly intend to do that in \nOregon, at home, during this high-risk season. I think it is possible \nto get clearer, more understandable messages out to the public about \nthis program. I do think there needs to be a better system in place for \nmaking sure that high-risk persons, particularly older people, get \nthese vaccines. I think we also need to take steps to make sure there \nare backup plans if there are problems with a manufacturer, both this \nwinter and in the future.\n  Secretary Thompson has worked with us in a constructive way. Progress \nhas been made. I certainly do not think there is a need for people to \ngo out and panic. But I think there are steps that do still need to be \ntaken so we do not have frustrated older people, health care providers, \nand others who want to take steps to protect their health and that of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11991-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11991-S11993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VICTIMS OF TERRORISM RELIEF ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFinance Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n2884, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2884) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide tax relief for victims of the terrorist \n     attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, as Members of the Senate proceed to \nThanksgiving Day celebrations with our families, there is little we can \noffer to the victims of September 11 but our prayers and our good \nhopes. But in this final act of the Senate, before we recess, perhaps \nthere is something of this world we can do of some meaning for the \nchildren and the widows and the widowers who remain.\n  For these families, September 11 is the crisis that never ends. Even \nas the dead are buried and families reconstitute themselves, they are \nfaced, every day, with the living reality of life without someone they \nloved--a father, a mother without a paycheck or savings or a financial \nfuture. They need our prayers. They need our support and our \nencouragement. But they also need our help.\n  I think H.R. 2884, as amended by the Senate Finance Committee, for \nthis holiday, offers the hand of the American people to our neighbors. \nIt very simply extends current American policy which waives Federal tax \nliability to the families of American soldiers or civilian employees of \nthe U.S. Government who are killed in combat or in terrorist actions. \nThis extension would now include American citizens whose family members \nwere killed on September 11, 2001, in New York and Virginia.\n  First, liability for Federal income taxes will be waived for this \nyear and last year. Any moneys previously paid will be refunded. This \nmoney is simply better used to pay mortgages and rents and to feed \nchildren than it is to be contributed, at this point, to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Second, we are mindful that many people of moderate means were killed \nin the Pentagon and the World Trade Center who may not have paid \nFederal income taxes. They worked in the restaurants or they cleaned \nthe buildings or they performed other valuable services. Their families \nmay be in the most dire circumstances of all. They will no longer be \nliable for payroll taxes and will be refunded taxes previously paid.\n  Third, for those nonworking spouses and children who may have now \nbeen in a position to inherit the earnings of a father or a mother who \nis deceased, they, of course, receive that money knowing no more will \nbe earned. Whatever money is inherited must carry them through a \nlifetime--to educate the children, house the family. There will be \nnothing else arriving. This legislation provides significant estate tax \nrelief from all State estate taxes on assets of up to $3 million and \nFederal estate taxes on assets of up to $8.5 million.\n  Fourth, there are those who did not die on September 11 but whose \nphysical wounds may be with them for a long time. Many are now eligible \nfor disability benefits. Those benefits are theirs, all of them. No \nmatter how long it takes for the scars to heal--the people to be able \nto walk or to see or to hear--the Federal Government should have no \npart of their disability funds. Taxes on them will be waived.\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\n  Fifth, and finally, through the extraordinary generosity of the \nAmerican people, hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised from \nschoolchildren and families and neighbors, corporations, churches and \nsynagogues and mosques. It has been a wonderful expression by the \nAmerican people, revealing much about ourselves as we help those in \ndesperate need. None of those payments from governments or charities or \ncorporations should be taxed. By virtue of this legislation, taxes on \nall such payments will be waived.\n\n  This evening in New Jersey I will meet with hundreds of the widows \nand widowers of people who died in the terrorist attack. I know of no \nbetter expression by this Senate to those who have survived the loss of \npeople they loved in the terrorist attack than to offer not merely \nwords of sympathy or an expression of understanding that it was not \nthose families who were attacked but America than for the \nrepresentatives of America, assembled in this Chamber through this \nlegislation, to express our solidarity with this simple act.\n  This is not all we will do. It is not even the beginning of what we \nshould do. But it is something we can do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, September 11, 2001, is a date that changed \nAmerica forever. The Nation has endured a terrible tragedy. The human \nsuffering is immense and our sense of invulnerability shattered. The \nterrorist strike on that date took the lives of thousands of U.S. \ncivilians, and we will spend many months and years trying to come to \ngrips with the magnitude of the day's attack on our freedom.\n  We have been left with searing images of a horror that could not be \ncontained--acts of terrorism that unfolded before our eyes, gripping \nthis Nation and the world in raw and vivid devastation, touching all of \nus with feelings expressed in public and in private; from panic to \nhelplessness; helplessness to anger; and anger to loss.\n  Members of Congress have stood as one to condemn these attacks, \ncomfort the victims and their families, and commit our full support to \nbring those responsible to justice. Our heartfelt thoughts and fervent \nprayers continue to go to those who have been lost.\n  Today we bring before the Senate a bill to help those victims and \ntheir families through some of the financial crises they will face as a \nresult of the terrorist's actions.\n  Throughout our history, Congress has provided Federal tax relief to \nsoldiers who die while serving in combat zones, and to service members \nand other individuals who have been affected by hostile actions outside \nof combat zones. But in the past, legislative relief bills have been \nlimited in scope, because the actions they were intended to address \nwere themselves limited.\n  The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, changed our perception, \nas a nation, of the nature of terrorist activity. Our Tax Code simply \nhas no frame of reference for the unprecedented scope of destruction \nand the inconceivable loss of civilian life on American soil that \nresulted form the terrorist attacks.\n  The events of September 11 have been characterized by the President \nas an act of war, and in the hearts and minds of most Americans, those \nwho died in the attack should be treated like American soldiers who pay \nthe ultimate price on the field of battle.\n  Because of this, the House passed H.R. 2884, a bill which extends the \nbenefits available to those who die in combat zones to all of the \nindividual killed as a result of the September 11 attacks. It provides \nsignificant income tax and estate tax relief to the victims of the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  The bill before you builds on the House legislation, because we \nacknowledge that the overwhelming loss of life in the September 11 \naction was civilian, and civilian victims tend to have different tax \nissues than soldiers.\n  This bill provides relief to all of the victims of the September 11 \nattacks--the brave firefighters who lost their lives trying to save \nthose trapped in the destruction, employees who worked in the targeted \nbuildings, tourists who were just visiting, as well as those on the \nairplanes converted into weapons by the terrorists. The bill also \nprovides relief to the families of the victims of the post-September 11 \nanthrax attacks, and to those who died in the bombing of the Alfred P. \nMurrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.\n  Under this legislation, all of the victims will have their Federal \nincome tax liability, and any self-employment tax liability, forgiven \nfor the year of their death and at least 1 previous year.\n  To achieve a measure of tax equity and recognize the different taxes \npaid by individuals, our bill also provides relief from payroll taxes \nthat parallels the income tax relief.\n  In the case of the estate tax, our bill modernizes the application of \nthe statute and creates a special formula that shields the first $3 \nmillion in assets from both Federal and State estate taxes, and $8.5 \nmillion in assets from Federal estate tax for 2001.\n  In the wake of the explosions, the Treasury Department quickly waived \nan extensive list of deadlines for those affected by the disaster.\n  However, the Department was unable to extend all Federal deadlines, \nin some cases because they had no clear authority and in others because \nof the need to coordinate with other agencies. Those other agencies \nhave themselves been confronted with a lack of clear authority in \nwaiving deadlines under their jurisdiction.\n  Our bill clarifies and expands upon the Government's ability to \nextend deadlines in case of any disaster, including the ability to \nwaive interest for payments that are delayed.\n  There are also special exclusions for some types of death benefits in \ncurrent law. For example, worker's compensation benefits and life \ninsurance proceeds to beneficiaries are not taxed, nor are payments \nfrom a government retirement plan for a public safety officer killed in \nthe line of duty. The first $3,000 of death benefits paid to soldiers \nkilled in combat are also not taxed.\n  Our bill expands this nontaxable list to include all death benefits \npaid on account of a death resulting from this terrorist action.\n  Current law also excludes disability benefits from income if they are \nmade under workers compensation laws in certain limited circumstances. \nOur bill expands those eligible for the exclusion to include anyone \ninjured in a terrorist attack.\n  The Senate bill before us also includes provisions making it clear \nthat payments made by FEMA to individuals affected by any disaster are \nnot subject to income tax.\n  In the wake of the attacks, a number of employers who had workers \nkilled in the World Trade Centers, in the Pentagon, and in the \nairplanes used as weapons stepped up to the plate with generous offers \nof help to their lost colleagues' families.\n  Under current law, payments such as these would typically be taxed, \nwhich would reduce the amount of help going directly to the surviving \nfamilies. Our bill exempts these payments from Federal income tax \nliability.\n  We are also aware that some financial institutions are considering \nforgiving outstanding credit card balances of those who died in the \nattacks. Our bill makes sure that any such debt forgiveness is not \nitself subject to tax.\n  To protect those victims' families who elect structured settlements \nin order to ensure they have a stream of payments for as long as they \nneed them, our bill makes sure anyone acquiring these payment streams \ngoes through a court process designed to protect the families.\n  And for those families who set up special disability trusts in the \nwake of the attacks, a personal exemption is provided.\n  The charitable community has also responded overwhelmingly to the \nneeds of the victims and their survivors. For example, in my home State \nof Montana, members of the higher education community, including the \nUniversity of Montana, have helped to establish the ``September 11 \nCollege Fund.''\n\n  The money donated to this fund will provide assistance, based on \nneed, to cover higher education expenses for dependents and survivors \nof those lost at the institution of their choice. One hundred percent \nof the donated funds will go directly to the students--none of the \nprincipal will be used for administrative expenses.\n  The charitable community is playing an important role in helping our \nNation recover from this tragedy. Our bill makes it easier for \ncharitable organizations to make disaster relief payments to victims \nand their families.\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\n  Our bill also makes it easier for companies to establish private \nfoundations to help the survivors with both short-term and long-term \nneeds, such as scholarships for the victim's children.\n  In the days following this attack, as well as in the days following \nother natural disasters such as fires and floods, we have seen a great \ndeal of confusion among our citizens about their responsibilities and \nbenefits under the Tax Code.\n  For this reason, the Senate bill also requires the Internal Revenue \nService to establish a permanent Disaster Response Team whose \nresponsibility it will be to help taxpayers clarify and resolve Federal \ntax matters associated with any natural disaster or terroristic or \nmilitary action.\n  In addition, the bill clarifies a provision in the recently enacted \nAir Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act relating to the \ndates certain excise tax deposits are due.\n  I don't claim that this bill is perfect, I am sure there are specific \ntax situations that have arisen because of these attacks that we may \nnot have addressed in this bill. If we took the time to identify and \naddress all of them, we would never complete this legislation, so we \nbelieve the best course of action is to move forward with what we have, \nand continue to look for opportunities to provide more assistance in \nthe future.\n  I also am well aware of the fact that no legislation passed by this \nCongress can ever truly compensate the victims of this horrible attack \nand their families for everything they have lost--the love, warmth and \ncompanionship of those who have died. Nor can we ever replace the \nfeeling of security we once had as a nation. But we can help make the \nroad to recovery for the families of these victims a little smoother \nwith the provisions of this bill, and make it easier to respond to \nother disasters in the future.\n  This is a good piece of legislation, and it will help thousands of \nfamilies facing an uncertain future. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Baucus has a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the act, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed, the amendment to the title be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating thereto \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2163) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 2884), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief for victims of the terrorist \nattacks against the United States, and for other purposes.''.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11993-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11993-S11994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THANKSGIVING\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate is in its final moments \nbefore the Thanksgiving recess. I am mindful that most Senators have \nleft to be with their families and return to their States. All of us \nhaving now lived through one of the most extraordinary periods in the \nlong and proud history of our country, I wanted, if only for my own \npurposes, to take a moment to reflect on the day, its meaning, and some \nthings we all take to our homes that distinguish this year and this \nThanksgiving from others.\n  I trust that we are all mindful as we travel to be with our families \nfor Thanksgiving, traveling to each of the 50 States of the Union, that \nthere are thousands of soldiers and sailors and airmen gathered in the \nhulls of ships, flying in aircraft, some huddled in trenches on the \nground--all brave, all strong, but they would not be human if some were \nnot afraid.\n  They are far from home at a time when all Americans want to be at \nhome. They are in a strange land, often with people they do not know, \nat a time when Americans want to be with family and people they love.\n  I know all Americans will remember them in our prayers this \nThanksgiving and be grateful not just to them but to the great good \nfortune of providence which with every generation, every time our \nNation has been threatened for more than two centuries, has produced \nmen and women of such extraordinary courage, so willing to sacrifice \nfor our Nation and its freedom.\n  I do not know how America has been so fortunate through each \nsucceeding generation to have produced such men and women, but I, as \nwith all of my colleagues, have a gratitude that cannot be fully \nexpressed.\n  I am reminded that President Lincoln, during another troubling period \nof our history, reminded us that as great armies were on the field of \nbattle against each other, they prayed to the same God. Each invoked \nhis name against the other. The prayers of each could not be answered.\n  Indeed, as our soldiers have prayed for their lives and their country \nand victory, so, too, have our adversaries. It is of no small comfort \nto know that the prayers of our soldiers and our citizens have to date \nbeen so fully answered.\n  Victory is not yet assured, but we have moved more swiftly, more \ncertainly, and more skillfully than we most probably had a right to \ndream. In the most remote corner of this Earth, thousands of American \nsoldiers, and sailors, and airmen descended within weeks of the tragedy \nof New York and Virginia. No place could have been more distant, no \narea of the globe more hostile, no cities, no towns, no country more \nremote than Afghanistan. Our own forces not only found their way but \nestablished themselves and with extraordinary ability, with skill and \ncourage, mounted an offensive to hold those accountable who would \nstrike our country and our Government and kill our citizens with wanton \nabandon, without any sense of decency.\n  I know the terrorists who struck America on September 11 intended to \nteach us a lesson. We have learned many lessons. They may not be what \nwas intended, but the lessons are real and I hope they are lasting. We \nlearned again the extraordinary strength of our Nation, measured not \nonly in our military power or economic resilience but our faith, our \nbelief in each other, our willingness to overcome obstacles and \ndivisions for common purpose. It is this which has sustained us for 200 \nyears.\n  There are moments of comfort and without challenge when we have \nprobably wondered whether they were still alive with us. We don't need \nto be concerned anymore. Those qualities still live in America. We \ntaught not only ourselves but the world a good deal about the goodness \nand kindness in America. Indeed, what other people in all of history \nwould drop bombs on our adversaries by day and distribute food to their \nchildren and widows by night? What other country in all the annals of \nhistory would conquer an army but not conquer the land, meet our \nmilitary objectives but state from the outset and commit our resources \nfully to leaving the people of that land in peace, with more prosperity \nand a greater freedom than they knew before?\n  These things we learned about ourselves and, perhaps, we reminded the \nworld about the United States of America. We all hope they are lessons \nthat, having been taught before, will never be forgotten. We have given \nup believing that there are any final wars. We are no longer naive \nenough to believe there are wars to end all wars. Every generation has \nits own challenges.\n  It was said by Jefferson that ``eternal vigilance is the price of \nfreedom.'' We have always known that freedom is not free. So now this \ngeneration, in this decade, has paid the price again, knowing it will \nbe paid again in the future. But we have a hope that finally the world \nwill remember, even if sometimes we forget, those essential elements \nabout our country that seem to lead to our vulnerability; that because \nwe are kind, people perceive us as sometimes being weak; because we are \ngenerous, people sometimes believe we lack resolve; because we have \nbeen prosperous, some believe we have lost the will or the ability to \nfight to defend ourselves.\n\n[[Page S11994]]\n\n  History is littered with people who have made those miscalculations \nbefore. Now the Taliban and al-Qaeda are about to share their fate. The \nbattle is not yet fully won, though victory, at least in this first \nbattle of this new war against terrorism, has taken sufficient form \nthat we can see the outlines of success.\n  Before this war on terrorism targets new adversaries, there will be \nthe matter of how to bring to justice those who created these crimes, \nmurdered our people, and attacked our Nation. President Bush has \nsuggested a military tribunal that would hear the evidence and render \njustice. It is an important decision for our country. We have always, \nin dealing with criminal cases in our country, taken enormous pride in \nthat the accused is afforded every right and assumed to have every \ninnocence until convicted in full accord with our Constitution.\n\n  After declarations of war and military campaigns, in those instances \nwhen people have committed either atrocities against humanity or \nengaged in military hostilities outside of the conduct of the rules of \nwar, they have been brought to justice; they have been tried by \nmilitary justice.\n  Now we are engaged in a new kind of war. Our adversaries wear no \nuniforms. They may not belong to the army of any recognized state. Our \ncountry received no declaration of war, according to the articles of \nwar of civilized nations. So the actions of President Bush in bringing \nthe leaders of al-Qaeda, or the Taliban, to justice are precedent. But \nthey need not be controversial. The Taliban and al-Qaeda may not have \nbeen in the family of nations, but the law is not blind. By their \nactions and their words, Bin Laden and the Taliban leadership declared \nwar on the United States of America. The destruction of American \ncivilian aircraft into our greatest cities and the offices of the U.S. \nGovernment and the taking of thousands of lives was an act of war, not \na civilian crime.\n  It would have been no different had an aircraft with a foreign flag \ndropped a bomb on New York or Washington. The orders given would have \nbeen the same, the consequences identical, and should stand before the \nlaw on an equal basis. The leaders of the Taliban and al-Qaeda are \nentitled to military justice, to be heard before a military tribunal of \neither the U.S. military or the assembled military leadership of the \nallies in this endeavor. But they are not entitled to sit in a civilian \ncourt provided for American citizens under the Constitution of this \ncountry for the rights of our people and those who enter our shores.\n  The level of justice may not be the same in a military tribunal as in \na civilian court, but it is justice. They can be heard as any other \nmilitary adversary.\n  Before leaving on this Thanksgiving holiday, I wish to say how proud \nI have been of this Congress, my country, and our Armed Forces. This is \nnot what any of us wanted for the 21st century. We all believed that \nsomehow only months ago as the 20th century came to a close, our time \nwas going to be different.\n  Through all the ravages of the 20th century, the disappointment, the \ndestruction, the genocide, finally men and women had come of age. We \nunderstood the foolishness of combat, the recklessness of armed \nstruggle, the uselessness of combat. We had built institutions to \nresolve our international differences. While cultures, faiths, and \nlanguages might differ, there at least was emerging some common \nunderstanding of the principles of governance, justice, and self-\nrespect.\n  It would appear that our enthusiasm for a new time was either \nmisplaced or poorly timed. Not only do these opening years of the 21st \ncentury not appear to be an improvement on all we experienced in the \n20th century, but they look remarkably similar to the 18th or 19th \ncenturies.\n  All human progress is not forward. All nations do not advance at the \nsame speed. All cultures have not learned history the same. Yet we are \npatient and hopeful. If anything characterizes the people of the United \nStates, it is our boundless optimism. From this terrible experience, \nperhaps we can at least take this to salvage those many years still \nremaining in the 21st century to make our time different. In the \ndestruction of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, a message will at least be \nreceived by those who would harbor terrorists or those who would \ncollaborate in these actions: Our kindness is not weakness; our laws do \nnot provide you opportunities to take advantage of our justice; we are \nstrong, we are resolved, and we are determined to defend ourselves, our \nchildren, and our future, as every generation before us. We are a good \nand a great people, but we are a strong and determined people. We have \nour place in the future, our role in the world, and it will not be \ncompromised. It will not be taken from us.\n  Much of this planet has decided upon some common norms of justice and \nconduct, to conduct ourselves in peace within institutions. All nations \nare welcome to join in them according to their own traditions, their \nown laws, and their own faiths, but the age when nations or \norganizations would be permitted to operate against all human \nexperience and all rules of decency are over.\n  We have only perhaps begun to defeat one terrorist organization in \none country, but surely the lessons from this experience are \nunmistakable and are heard on every corner of the globe.\n  That is my hope and my prayer for this Thanksgiving. Godspeed to \nevery American soldier wherever he or she may be on this holiday. May \nyou be home for Christmas; may we not have to call upon you again. But \nif we do, may you serve with the same distinction, courage, and valor \nthat every American has seen in your actions in these last few weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11994-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND DEDICATION OF OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

Mr. President, yesterday marked 1 month since the letter \ncontaining anthrax was opened in my office. Being at ``ground zero'' in \nthe largest bioterrorism attack ever on U.S. soil has been unsettling \nand frustrating for many of us. As our Nation prepares to celebrate \nThanksgiving, though, there is much for which we in the Senate family \nhave to be grateful.\n  On a personal note, I am deeply grateful that the members of my staff \nwho were exposed to anthrax continue to be in good health and good \nspirits and they continue to come to work every day, inspiring our \nentire staff with their courage and dedication. I am grateful, as well, \nthat the other members of our Senate family who were exposed also \ncontinue to be in good health. I am grateful to the doctors and \nscientists who have worked long hours to protect Americans from this \nthreat, not just on Capitol Hill, but in Washington, Trenton, New York \nand even as far away as Kansas City.\n  I am particularly grateful to a special group of people who have kept \nthe Senate safe and running during this unprecedented time. At the top \nof that list is Al Lenhardt, the Senate's Sergeant at Arms, and his \nstaff. If there was ever a case of the right person, in the right job, \nat the right time, it is Al Lenhardt. On September 11, Al had been \nSergeant at Arms for exactly 1 week. I don't believe he has taken a day \noff work since then. The first Saturday morning after the anthrax \nletter was opened, he was at work in the Capitol, surrounded by \nscientists and investigators. He had been at work until\n\n[[Page S11995]]\n\nlate the night before. That morning, someone asked him: ``If you had it \nto do all over again, do you think you'd still take this job?'' Without \na moment's hesitation, he replied: ``Absolutely. To be in a position to \nserve your country--what better job could there be?''\n  Al Lenhardt is helped in that job by an equally dedicated staff. In \naddition to keeping us safe, for the last month, the men and women of \nthe Sergeant at Arms Office have played an indispensable role in \nkeeping the Senate running. Only once before--when the British burned \nthe Capitol in 1814--have so many Senators been displaced from their \noffices. The staff of the Sergeant at Arms Office and the Rules \nCommittee have been faced with a huge logistical challenge, and they \nhave responded amazingly.\n  Senator Dodd and the Rules Committee Staff Director, Kennie Gill, \ndeserve special thanks for the amazing job they did relocating \ndisplaced Senate offices. Since October 18, Kennie, the Rules Committee \nstaff and the Sergeant at Arms' Office have set up 129 temporary \noffices within the Capitol, in the Russell and Dirksen Buildings and at \nPostal Square. They re-established our computer network.\n  This one task alone involved dropping 650 new LAN lines, laying over \na mile of copper cabling, and nearly half a mile of fiber cabling, \ncreating 216 new network protocol addresses for temporary PC locations, \nopening 73 routers between Senate offices and creating a new Senate \nfiber network. In addition, Rules Committee and Sergeant at Arms staff \nattached 700 PCs and 110 printers to the Senate computer network. They \nhave kept our telecommunications system up and running by connecting \nnearly 600 new telephone lines, 200 new voice mail boxes and 64 fax \nmachines.\n  Members of the Rules Committee and Sergeant at Arms staffs, and the \nvendors who support them, have worked for weeks straight without a day \noff. They have worked nights and weekends, putting in thousands of \nhours of overtime. They have refused to allow the largest bioterrorism \nattack in our Nation's history to stop the work of the Senate, and for \nthat we all owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  The 1,400 men and women of the Capitol Police force are also working \na lot of overtime. Since September 11, they have all been putting in \n12-hour days, 6 days a week. That is a minimum. Sometimes they pull \ndouble shifts. They work through colds, weekends, holidays, and their \nchildrens' birthdays. They remain at their posts, alert.\n  If you had asked me a month ago whether the Senate could carry on in \nthe middle of a bioterrorism attack, with 50 Senators locked out of \ntheir offices, I might have been a little skeptical. But Al Lenhardt \nand his staff, Kennie Gill and her staff and the men and women of the \nCapitol Police force have shown us that anything is possible. Together, \nthey have kept the Senate safe and operating in these anxious times. We \nare grateful to them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11995-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11995-S11996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNET TAX NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate decided to ban, for two \nmore years, Internet access taxes and discriminatory taxes on e-\ncommerce. For American Internet users, I fully support this decision, \nas did the vast majority of my colleagues.\n  I also supported the Senate's decision to more thoroughly consider a \nmeritorious yet deficient proposal that would have helped States \neventually require interstate retailers to collect tax on all sales, \neven to States where the retailer has no substantial presence. E-\ncommerce and brick and mortar businesses should be placed on a level \nplaying field.\n  On behalf of the important State and local government programs that \nsales tax revenue support, I firmly believe this issue needs to be \nresolved very soon. I was concerned, however, that the proposed \nlegislation had a few key shortcomings.\n  First, I believe the proposal did not give the States clear guidance \non what Congress expects them to address as they simplify their sales \ntax rules. The Supreme Court has said that the current State sales tax \nsystem is unconstitutionally complex, but that Congress can remedy that \nproblem. On one particular point, the proposal did not tell the States \nto ensure that no tax loopholes be adopted that would allow some \nsellers to avoid tax collection responsibilities. I believe that \nCongress must not allow tax discrimination among retail business \nmodels.\n  Second, I believe that Congress will need expert assistance to help \nanalyze the State's efforts to make their tax systems constitutional, \nespecially if we hope to consider their efforts quickly. For that \nreason, I believe there must be a timely federal review of the States' \neventual agreement before it is presented to Congress. Also, I believe \na federal agency is much better positioned than Congress to ensure \ncontinuing compliance with the interstate agreement.\n  I did not support the Enzi/Dorgan amendment because it would have \nadded complexity, making a retroactive change in the law, that is \nunclear, and did not go through a complete vetting process. This was a \nmeritorious but flawed amendment. The House would not have accepted \nthis legislation with this amendment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, the States, and \nindustry next year on a bill that addresses the States' legitimate tax \nrevenue needs and ensures that the simplified State tax system is fair \nto all retailers and can be efficiently considered and monitored.\n  I will not likely support another moratorium. We must take the steps \nnecessary to bring our interstate tax rules into the 21st Century.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voted in support of the Enzi Amendment to \nthe Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act because I believed that after \nnearly 2 years of working towards a compromise on this very important \nissue, it was time to move forward and provide States with guidance on \nhow to level the playing field for Internet and bricks and mortar \nretail establishments. Of equal importance is that in this time when \nState coffers are shrinking and State spending requirements are \nincreasing with the need to pay for the increased security needs each \nState now faces, we cannot in good conscience short change the States.\n  Let me be clear. I do not support a tax on the Internet. The Enzi \namendment did not tax the Internet. It simply provided a way to move \ntowards a system where States can collect taxes that are already owed. \nMoreover, I strongly support a permanent ban on Internet access taxes. \nThe Enzi amendment intended to create such a ban. If there were \nquestions as to whether that intent was fully carried out by the \nlanguage as drafted, I believe we could have addressed those questions \nadequately in conference. I oppose discriminatory Internet taxes. \nAgain, the Enzi amendment banned such taxes for 5 years and ultimately \nsuch a ban will be made permanent.\n  It is also important to point out that the Enzi amendment, had it \nsucceeded, would not have been the final word on whether States could \nbegin collecting taxes owed on Internet sales. After up to 5 years of \nworking towards a compromise, and after at least 20 States agreed to \nsimplify their tax collection systems in a uniform manner, Congress \nstill would have had the opportunity to vote down a simplification \nplan, if we believed it was unfairly burdensome to Internet or other \nremote sellers. That provision provided a critical measure of assurance \nthat States could not unfairly insist on the collection of taxes.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the Internet tax moratorium that only \nrecently expired, and I hope, with the additional 2-year moratorium \nthat we have just enacted we will enjoy some measure of success in \nforging a compromise that will have broad support. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to ensure that Internet companies are never \nrequired to divine the tax rate of a consumer in one of thousands of \ntaxable jurisdictions. In addition, I will work to ensure that uniform \ndefinitions for taxable property are part of any simplification plan, \nso that companies do not have to analyze different definitions for the \nsame item in different states. Uniformity in auditing procedures, \nfiling requirements and remittance forms will also be goals we will \ncontinue to try to reach.\n  Equity dictates that we do not treat the taxation of goods \ndifferently simply because of the method by which\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\nthey were sold. I look forward to continuing to work on this issue so \nthat we can find a way to reach that goal that is fair to States, \nconsumers, Internet companies and traditional retailers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11996-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMTRAK REFORM COUNCIL FINDING\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to explain for the benefit of my \ncolleagues some recent actions that involve Amtrak. I will begin, \nhowever, by briefly describing Amtrak's history.\n  Amtrak was created in 1971 by the Rail Passenger Service Act which \nwas enacted in 1970. The law established Amtrak in order to relieve the \nfreight railroad industry from the burden of providing ongoing \npassenger service. With capital acquired from participating railroads \nand the Federal Government providing $40 million in direct grants and \nanother $100 million in loan guarantees, the corporation was to become \nself-sustaining within 2 years. Since 1971, however, Amtrak has \nreceived nearly $24 billion in taxpayer assistance to help cover its \noperating and capital costs.\n  Today, much like when Amtrak started, Amtrak serves approximately 500 \nlocations. It carried 22.5 million passengers in fiscal year 2000. By \ncontrast, the intercity bus industry carries 744 million passengers \nannually and serves over 4,000 locations. The aviation industry carries \nmore than 600 million passengers annually. I mention this comparison \nbecause I believe we must consider Amtrak in the context of other \npassenger carrying transportation services.\n  Amtrak was most recently authorized during the 105th Congress, after \nseveral years without an authorization. The Amtrak Reform and \nAccountability Act, Public Law 105-134, was bipartisan compromise \nlegislation and enacted, in part, due to the very critical reports of \nAmtrak's financial situation at that time. During the act's \ndevelopment, the General Accounting Office, Amtrak, and others \nestimated that the rail system was on the brink of bankruptcy.\n  Taking into account the very serious financial situation facing \nAmtrak, the reform law provided the statutory operational, procurement, \nlabor and liability reforms that Amtrak requested so it could operate \nmore like a private business. It reauthorized Amtrak for 5 years, \nthrough fiscal year 2002, releasing the approximately $2.2 billion to \nAmtrak that was provided in the form of a tax ``refund'' in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, TRA, even though Amtrak has never earned a \nprofit, let alone paid income tax. It also required Amtrak to operate \nfree of taxpayer assistance 5 years after the date of enactment of the \nlaw, which is December 2, 2002.\n  The law established an 11-member Amtrak Reform Council, ARC, \nappointed by the President and leadership in both the House and the \nSenate, to oversee Amtrak and make recommendations for improvements. \nThe law provided that if at any time following 2 years after the date \nof enactment the ARC finds that Amtrak is not meeting its financial \ngoals, the Council is directed to develop and submit within 90 days to \nCongress an action plan for a restructured and rationalized intercity \nrail passenger system. Within that same time period, the law directs \nAmtrak to prepare a plan for its complete liquidation. The law provides \nfor an expedited procedure during which Congress would vote, simple \nmajority, on a resolution to disapprove an Amtrak liquidation.\n\n  What has Amtrak accomplished since the reform bill's enactment? \nAmtrak's press releases often boast about increased ridership and \nrevenues. Unfortunately, those press releases never quite tell the full \nstory. According to the General Accounting Office, any increase in \nridership and revenues has resulted in an even greater increase in \nexpenses.\n  Moreover, Amtrak's debt load has tripled since the reform bill's \nenactment to over $3.3 billion and it has spent more than $4.4 billion \nin taxpayers dollars during that same period. And, despite repeated \ntestimony by Amtrak officials this year about being on a ``glidepath to \noperational self-sufficiency,'' Amtrak entered into a creative \nagreement in June to mortgage a portion of Penn Station to obtain cash \nto allow Amtrak to continue operating past the summer. Clearly, our \nexpectation for a new and improved Amtrak when we passed the reform \nbill in 1997 has not been realized.\n  The Department of Transportation Inspector General and the General \nAccounting Office have testified repeatedly before Congress that Amtrak \nis in a very precarious financial situation. Moreover, last Friday, \nNovember 9, 2001, the ARC officially issued a finding that Amtrak will \nnot be operationally self-sufficient by December 2, 2002, as required \nby law. The ARC has found there are major inherent flaws and weaknesses \nin Amtrak's institutional design and it must be restructured. As a \nresult of this finding, the ARC will submit a restructuring plan and \nAmtrak will submit a liquidation plan to the Congress in early \nFebruary. In addition, the administration, according to testimony from \nthe Federal Railroad Administrator, is also preparing to submit a \nproposal to restructure our Nation's passenger rail system as part of \nits fiscal year 2003 budget request.\n  I understand Amtrak and others have made some very critical comments \nabout the ARC's decision. Clearly, it was a decision not taken lightly \nby the ARC members. I, for one, commend the ARC members for abiding by \nthe law and making the tough decision that they felt needed to be made. \nI only question what took them so long.\n  I look forward to a robust debate on the future of intercity rail \npassenger service in this country. I believe that passenger rail can \nand should be a part of our Nation's transportation system, but I \ncontinue to question how it should be structured and managed, knowing \nthat Amtrak has failed to meet even the lowest of expectations for 30 \nyears.\n  I find it indefensible that despite the findings of the ARC, the IG \nand the GAO, this week we were considering legislation that would have \ngiven another $9 billion to Amtrak by authorizing Amtrak to issue \nbonds. I imagine proponents of that provision will continue to seek \nenactment of their proposal prior to adjournment. I vow to do \neverything in my power to prevent such efforts from succeeding, as I \nstrongly question the logic of throwing billions of additional dollars \nat Amtrak when nearly every expert that knows anything about Amtrak and \nfinances knows, and has told Congress, that Amtrak cannot live up to \nthe promises it makes.\n  Before moving forward with any additional funding for Amtrak we need \nto address a number of tough questions: What is the future for \nintercity rail passenger transportation? Where does it attract \npassengers and where doesn't it? Does rail passenger service have to \nequate to ``Amtrak'' or should we finally accept the fact that after 30 \nyears, it is time to find a new approach? Where might high-speed rail \nservice actually attract enough passengers to be economically viable? \nHow does it fit into our national transportation system? What is the \nfinancial obligation we will be imposing on the American taxpayers and \nwhat can they realistically expect as a result of their expenditures?\n  It is simply time to have an open and honest debate on this issue. We \nneed to hear from the administration and the American public. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree that we need to allow the debate on Amtrak's \nfuture to move forward and stop the hemorrhaging of taxpayers' dollars \nby this entity. I certainly intend to do all I can to ensure the Senate \nCommerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Amtrak, steps up to the \nplate and does its part on this subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11996-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11996-S11997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001. This act represents a critically \nimportant turning point in the readiness of our public health system to \nrespond to the challenge of bioterrorism. In many places in our Nation \nthe public health infrastructure has been underfunded and understaffed. \nMany of our public health workers have been working day and night since \nSeptember 11. The anthrax attack has demonstrated that our system can \nbe overwhelmed by a bioterrorist attack. This bill provides essential \nassistance to our network of local\n\n[[Page S11997]]\n\nand State health departments, public health laboratories, hospitals and \nhealth care facilities so that they can protect all of us in the event \nof further bioterrorist attack, or of other infectious disease \noutbreaks.\n  Mr. President, we in Minnesota have long been aware of the dangers of \nbioterrorism thanks to the efforts of Mike Osterholm, head of the \nCenter for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of \nMinnesota. But since September 11, everywhere that I have traveled in \nMinnesota I have been hearing about the need for preparedness. I am \nvery glad that this bill is providing for bioterrorism preparedness.\n  This bill provides block grants to states to improve public health \ndepartments and to get the equipment they need, and to help local \ngovernments safeguard their communities from these threats. The bill \nalso provides grants to hospitals and other health care facilities to \nimprove their abilities to respond quickly and effectively to a \nbioterrorist attack. I am glad this bill emphasizes getting funds to \nthe local level. That is very important. In fact, I would have even \ngone further in setting aside funds specifically for localities.\n  I do have some reservations about the scope of the antitrust \nexemption the bill in its current form provides to the drug industry \nand others in connection with the development of countermeasures \nagainst bioterrorism. I fully understand the urgency of the situation \nand the need to create ``safe space'' for the work necessary to bring \nsuch countermeasures on line. However, I do think we need to tread \ncarefully when it comes to further insulating the drug industry from \nthe discipline of competitive market forces. I hope that my colleagues \nwill work with me as we move forward on this very important measure to \nensure the fullest possible protection for American consumers \nconsistent with the development and production of necessary \ncountermeasures\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I am \nparticularly glad that this bill recognizes the threat of bioterrorism \nin the workplace. Virtually all of the antrax attack involved places \nwhere people work, including media offices, the U.S. Postal Service and \nhere in the Congress. I am especially happy that this bill includes \nlanguage which I had suggested to direct the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health to enhance and expand research on the \nhealth and safety of workers who are at risk for biological threats or \nattacks in the work place.\n  Finally, I am particularly pleased that my provisions regarding \nmental health were included in this important bill. We know from the \noutstanding hearing on mental health and terrorism, chaired by Senator \nKennedy in the HELP committee, that the preparedness and response \nactivities for the mental health consequences of bioterrorism are as \nimportant as all other public health initiatives this Congress can \nsupport. Dr. Kerry Kelly, Chief Medical Officer of the New York Fire \nDepartment, reported at that hearing that since September 11, the men \nand women of the New York Fire Department and the families of those who \nwere lost have had to endure a tremendous sense of grief. She said \nthat, ``the emotional well-being of our department requires \nintervention to provide stress debriefing, bereavement counseling, and \ncontinued psychological support of our members, our families, and the \nchildren affected by this event.''\n  The mental health provisions in the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of \n2001 support Federal, State, and local efforts to enhance the \npreparedness of public health institutions, providers of medical care, \nand other emergency service personnel, including firefighters, to \ndetect, diagnose, and respond to the mental health consequences of a \nbiological threat or attack. Additionally, State and local emergency \nmeasures ensure that hospitals and health care providers have adequate \ncapacity and plans in place to provide mental health services to meet \nthe need of vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, \nand the disabled. Training programs are also authorized to educate \nhealth care professionals to recognize and treat the mental health \nconsequences of a biological threat or attack, including the \nconsequences for children.\n  We know one for thing for sure. It is a mistake to believe that \nbioterrorism events cannot have lasting impact on the mental health of \nthe individuals who experience them. Let us not repeat the mistakes \nthat were made in the aftermath of the Vietnam war, when the trauma \nexperienced by veterans was ignored or trivialized until well after the \noptimal time for treatment was past. We have learned from the \noutstanding research funded by the VA and NIMH of the severity of the \ndisorder and the effective ways in which it can be treated. We must \nensure that all Federal, State, and local public health efforts to \nrespond to and prepare for bioterrorist attacks take advantage of this \nknowledge.\n  I do not believe that mental health problems are a widespread or \ninevitable consequence of bioterrorist attacks. But as we heard from \nthe experts at the HELP hearing, we should not underestimate the severe \nimpact that these events have on people's sense of identity and safety, \nand how the multiple losses and horrific experiences they go through \nhas the potential to affect them for a long while. There have been many \nreports in the media of the heightened sense of anxiety and \nvulnerability throughout our country. These feelings are normal and I \nhave confidence that most Americans will be able to deal with these \ncrises. But I also firmly believe that the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments can play a major role in helping people to understand what \nhas happened to them, and establish programs for mental health services \nfor those who will need it. We in Congress are doing our part by the \ninclusion of these mental health initiatives within this bill.\n  In closing, this bill represents an essential step forward in \nsafeguarding both the physical and mental health of our Nation in the \nevent of further bioterrorist attack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11997-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to an editorial, which appeared in the New York Daily News on \nSeptember 25, 2001.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, this editorial \nproposes that Congress should convene for a special session in New York \nCity. Daily News rightly points out that a convening of Congress in New \nYork City would reaffirm the American people's steadfast resolve \nagainst the cowardly perpetrators of terrorism--and that the attack on \nNew York represented an attack on our Nation.\n  I am pleased to report that a bill, H. Con. Res. 249, calling for a \nspecial session of Congress to meet in New York City, has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives and that yesterday Senator \nSchumer and myself introduced a corresponding bill here in the Senate. \nI urge my colleagues to support this measure, which calls for a special \n1-day joint session of Congress to be held in New York City as a symbol \nof the Nation's solidarity with New Yorkers who epitomize the human \nspirit of courage, resilience, and strength.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Schumer and myself, I ask \nunanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, Sept. 25, 2001]\n\n                      Convene Congress in New York\n\n       In today's primary election--so savagely interrupted two \n     weeks ago--pundits are predicting an abysmal turnout. But \n     today, New Yorkers, you have even more reason to go to the \n     polls. Not only will you help to select candidates for one of \n     the most critical elections in the city's history, you will \n     be sending a message that our representative democracy still \n     stands tall--the democracy that terrorists are intent on \n     destroying.\n       New York was targeted because this city represents America. \n     The U.S. Congress also represents America--figuratively and \n     literally. So herewith, a proposal: Congress should assemble \n     in New York City for a special session.\n       The duration doesn't matter--a day would be enough. What \n     matters is that, by meeting here, Congress would show the \n     city, the nation and the world that it stands in solidarity \n     with New York, and that the strikes against the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon were strikes against an America that \n     has emerged stronger than ever. An America united in its \n     determination to eradicate terrorism. Indeed, the 535 members \n     of the House and Senate could use the New York session to \n     pass a resolution or legislation related to this new war we \n     are waging. For it is Congress assembled that represents \n     America.\n       Holding a special session here would be unprecedented, but \n     there is nothing in the Constitution or federal law or the \n     rules of Congress that dictates where the House and Senate \n     shall convene. In its history, the only time Congress \n     traveled was during the Revolution, when it fled the British. \n     This time, it would not be fleeing, but charging into \n     action--and doing so at the scene of the worst enemy attack \n     ever on American soil.\n       Since the terror murder of thousands Sept. 11, President \n     Bush and key members of Congress have visited the city to \n     witness firsthand the destruction, the heroism and the \n     stoicism. Forty members of the Senate came as a group. \n     Consider the emotional and symbolic impact of the entire \n     Congress assembling in New York.\n       And the meeting place? Perhaps the Javits Center or \n     Governors Island or Liberty Island. Or somewhere downtown \n     near the scene of the carnage. There would be obstacles \n     involving logistics and security, but they can be overcome, \n     as they were when the President and the Senate delegation \n     visited. This proposal can be brought to fruition.\n       In the context of U.S. history, there are strong parallels \n     for Congress coming to New York. The city was the home of the \n     Continental Congress beginning in 1785. And when the federal \n     Constitution was adopted, the first Congress met here in \n     1789. George Washington was sworn into office downtown, \n     blocks from what is now Ground Zero. The first meetings of \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate were held here.\n       Though the official seat of power remained in New York for \n     only about a year, during that time the basic functions of \n     the U.S. government were set in place. It was in New York \n     that Congress wrote the Bill of Rights and submitted the \n     amendments to the states. It was in New York that the Supreme \n     Court was established. And it was in New York, on another \n     Sept. 11--in 1789--that the Senate voted to confirm the first \n     administration's first cabinet member: New Yorker Alexander \n     Hamilton as treasury secretary.\n       In 1790, Congress moved to Philadelphia, and 10 years later \n     to its new Capitol building in the nation's new capital city \n     of Washington. The last time Congress did not meet at the \n     Capitol was during the War of 1812, when the British burned \n     the building. That was also the last time--until Sept. 11, \n     2001--that a foreign enemy struck the American mainland.\n       For generations, America was protected by two broad oceans. \n     No more. We have become a battleground. We are making history \n     anew. And with a simple, yet far-reaching action, Congress \n     can come to New York and write a new chapter in the indelible \n     ink of national fortitude. Congress already has acted to \n     assist our wounded city, approving $20 billion in aid for New \n     York, with more likely to follow. What we ask for here is \n     symbolic. Just as the terrorists chose the World Trade Center \n     and Pentagon as symbols, America should render its own \n     symbol--of unity, strength and resolve such as the world has \n     never seen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11998-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOBERING STATISTICS ON CHILDREN AND GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into the Record a few facts \nabout guns and children. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, every 7 hours a child or teen was killed in a firearm-\nrelated accident or suicide in 1999. From 1994-1999, an average of five \nchildren died every day in non-homicide firearm incidents. In the same \nperiod, more than 2,100 children were killed in firearm accidents. In \nthe 1990s, an average of 1,370 kids committed suicide with a firearm \neach year. More than 150 each year were children under the age of \nfifteen. In 1997, hospital emergency rooms treated four children with \ngun shot wounds for every child killed with a firearm. And a 1997 CDC \nstudy reported that the overall firearm-related death rate among \nchildren in the United States who are less than fifteen years old was \nnearly twelve times higher than among children in twenty-five other \nindustrialized countries combined.\n  These sobering statistics remind us of the importance of \nstrengthening our gun laws to limit children's access to guns. I urge \nmy fellow Senators to join me in support of meaningful gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11998-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL DONALD E. FLEMING\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nAmerican who has honorably served our Nation for 28 years: Colonel \nDonald E. Fleming, U.S. Marine Corps. Colonel Fleming has served with \ndistinction, throughout wartime and in times of peace. In 1990 and \n1991, during the Gulf War, Colonel Fleming served as the executive \nofficer to a Harrier Attack Squadron in support of Marine ground troops \nin Operation Desert Storm. He was involved in numerous sorties against \nIraqi forces, which enabled ground combat troops to successfully attack \nand take Iraqi forces. This was a highly dangerous task as Marine \naircraft were constantly exposed to enemy fire. Colonel Fleming was \nprepared to give his life for those Marines on the ground to be \nsuccessful in completing their missions.\n  Colonel Fleming's last assignment was as the deputy legislative \nassistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. This was a highly \nresponsible assignment in that the Colonel served not only the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nbut the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate as well. \nColonel Fleming was thoroughly involved with ensuring that the numerous \ncongressional inquiries were completed in a timely and correct manner. \nThis is a large task, especially during the hearing season, when \nMembers of Congress and their staffs address many questions and \nconcerns to the military departments. Additionally, Colonel Fleming was \nresponsible for the final coordination of significant congressional and \nstaff delegations that took place literally all over the world.\n  I thank Don for his unswerving dedication to serving the U.S. \nCongress. He has served our Nation and the U.S. Congress in the finest \ntraditions of the U.S. Marine Corps. I wish Don well in his future \nendeavors as he enters a new phase of his life. Colonel Fleming's \nservice to his country and his Corps has been laudatory. I am deeply \nappreciative that we have Marines like Colonel Fleming, who are of such \nhigh caliber and sincere conviction. May God bless Colonel Don Fleming \nand his family, and may fair winds and following seas follow Colonel \nFleming throughout his new career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11998-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11998-S11999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IN RECOGNITION OF THE EUGENE M. LANG I HAVE A DREAM FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize a \nremarkable individual whose efforts rank high among those that have \nmarked the great history of this Nation. Eugene M. Lang is a dedicated \nphilanthropist and supporter of education. His selflessness, sense of \npride, and love for his country have been demonstrated in his \ncommitment to the present and the future of young people all across \nAmerica, through his I Have a Dream Foundation. This weekend, November \n15-17, 2001, Mr. Lang and the Foundation will celebrate 20 years of \neducation achievement.\n  The path leading up to 20 years of education successes began on June \n25, 1981. It was then that Eugene Lang, a New York businessman would \nreturn to his old elementary school, P.S. 121, in East Harlem to \naddress the graduating sixth-graders. His original plan was to deliver \na standard message that if you worked hard you would succeed. However, \nafter arriving at his alma mater, he was told that his old school had \nchanged--that 75 percent of P.S. 121's children would never graduate \nfrom high school, and that even those who\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\ndid get high school diplomas would probably lack the skills needed for \ncollege. The startling news, prompted Mr. Lang to make an extraordinary \npromise to the sixth-graders that day. He made an impromptu decision \nand announced that if the 61 middle schoolers graduated from high \nschool he would provide financial assistance to help them pay for \ncollege. This wonderful benefactor told the children that they must \nhave a dream for the future, and that he would help them achieve it.\n  Having made a promise, Lang went even further to help the P.S. 121 \nsixth-graders. He provided the children with support services and hired \na social worker to work with them. With the involvement of education \nand social science professionals, Mr. Lang's vision evolved into the I \nHave a Dream program and the P.S. 121 kids became the first \n``Dreamers.''\n  In August 1985, after 4 years, all of Lang's Dreamers were still in \nschool garnering national attention including a front page story in the \nNew York Times and a segment on 60 Minutes. This spurred Lang to \norganize the national I Have a Dream Foundation in 1986 and help launch \na new generation of Foundation projects.\n  Of the 54 original Dreamers who remained in contact with Mr. Lang's \nproject, more than 90 percent earned their high school diploma or GED \ncertificate and 60 percent went on to higher education, mostly at \npublic 4-year or community colleges. In June 1991, the first Dreamers \nreceived baccalaureate degrees from colleges such as Bard and Barnard; \nothers subsequently graduated from Swarthmore, Rensselaer Polytechnic \nInstitute, Hunter, AZ, and other schools. At least two-thirds of the \nP.S. 121 Dreamers have had 2 or more years of higher education and some \ncontinue to work on earning their degrees. Almost all hold fulfilling \njobs and many have children who, they vow, will go to college.\n  Today, the I Have a Dream program is a nationally recognized model \nthat helps children stay in school, graduate, and go on to college or \nvocational education training and meaningful employment. The children, \ncalled Dreamers, participate in a year-round program of mentoring, \ntutoring, cultural exposures, and community service activities from \nelementary school through high school. Upon graduation, Dreamers \nreceive financial assistance for either a college or vocational \neducation. ``I Have a Dream'' has grown from one man's promise to 61 \nmiddle schoolers to over 175 projects in 58 cities, serving more than \n13,000 children from low-income communities, including the Dreamers \nfrom my home State of Michigan. In Michigan, the Dreamers from Detroit \nhave graduated while the Battle Creek programs support 11th graders who \nare close to achieving their dreams and in Port Huron, 7th and 8th \ngraders are well on their way to fulfilling their own goals thanks to \nEugene Lang's remarkable vision.\n  Through his hard work, dedication and unshakable belief in our \nnation's children, Mr. Lang has helped many a dreamer fulfill his or \nher educational goals with his I Have a Dream Foundation. This kind and \ngenerous man is a role model to us all and I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in congratulating Eugene Lang for his commitment and \nsuccess with his I Have a Dream Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S11999-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, for the last 60 years, National \nBible Week has been an annual observance in this country. It has come \neach year at Thanksgiving time since 1941. We were on the brink of \nWorld War II that year, and about to face the bombing of Pearl Harbor. \nThat was certainly a difficult time in our Nation's history, but this \ncountry has truly been blessed. In truth there have been only a few \ntimes since then that we as a nation have felt the need to turn to the \nworn pages of our Bibles for strength and comfort and guidance. We are \nin the midst of such a time right now.\n  This year National Bible Week runs from Sunday, the 18th of November \nthrough the 25th. I am pleased and honored to serve as one of this \nyear's Congressional cochairs for National Bible Week, which is \nsponsored by the National Bible Association. The Bible has had \nremarkable influence on American life, literature, music, art, and the \nsystem of justice that governs our laws. Inscribed on every piece of \nAmerican currency is the phrase, ``In God we trust.'' Freedom of \nreligion is guaranteed under our constitution. And despite the many \ndifferences in our religious views, we proclaim ourselves to be ``one \nNation, under God.''\n  I join the majority of Americans in believing the Bible to be the \nWord of God. For those of the Jewish faith, the Old Testament, or \nTorah, offers understanding and serves as a reminder of obligations to \nGod and country. Islamic followers consider Christians and Jews to be \n``the people of the book,'' and their Koran recognizes the Bible's \nsignificance in the development of civilization. Certainly now, as evil \npeople seek to pit one religion against another, and try to justify \nacts of hate committed in the name of God, this is the time to \nstrengthen our beliefs, and to do this, we turn to the Bible. I \nencourage believers everywhere to open their Bibles, and read the \nscriptures.

Clearly, we have, in months and years past, supplied a very \nlarge amount of the American tax dollars to provide for adequate \ndefense. This war we have waged for a few weeks against hatred and \nterrorism--while that war changed us forever, it also showed the world \nwhat a tremendous military force America is and what a great idea we \nhave with democracy and capitalism matched up, with growth and \nprosperity--what a tremendous idea it is.\n  The idea and ideal was received on the streets of cities in \nAfghanistan with cheering for the few Americans who were part of it. \nThis morning, we hear a communique from one of our military talking \nabout how they are being received.\n  At the same time that we are paying for this and asking for our \nwonderful volunteer men and women of the military, there is another \nwar, and it is a tough one. It has to do with an economy that for 11 \nyears was at the very peak of performance--almost without comparability \nin any period of economics that we note here in America. Now that \neconomy, as one might have predicted, is going into one of the normal \nand natural downturns--except each one of these recessions are \ndifferent. The qualities are different. What happened to get us there \nis different. There are also a lot of similarities. If we don't engage \nin the war that is also on our plate, called recession, in as unified a \nmanner as we attacked the war on terrorism, with a proposal to help the \neconomy, thus help our people--that is, Democrat and Republican--and \ngather together and say we each, Democrat, Republican, and the White \nHouse, have a plan--a lot of Senators have plans. We only had one vote, \nand it is pretty obvious that the Democrat plan can't muster the 60 \nvotes that is going to be required to get a tax package through the \nSenate.\n  We all know the vote. The distinguished Senator from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, has done a yeoman's job in trying to \nput together a partisan package. I have been there when you had to do \nthat, and then I have had to defend it and try to get it through, with \nthe entire party on the other side being opposed. I have listened and \nwatched and seen this distinguished Senator do his very best. If the \nRepublican plan--which may be the President's plan--is called up, I \nregret to say that I think it is going to get the same kind of \ntreatment from the other side of the aisle. I can't say why each side \nhas decided that they have a better plan, but that is what has \nhappened. Let's hope that it is nothing more than that and that both \nsides still wish to get something done, to get an economic stimulus \npackage; that is, a package that will cause America's economy to grow, \njump-start, give it a little boost.\n  I am not going to talk about the things that have already been done, \nother than to say that once the recession started--that is a long time \nago; for those who think this just came upon us, if you trace the \neconomy--and I am sure the occupant of the chair, who, for many years \nof his life, day by day, had to rely upon his ability to analyze the \neconomy and/or that of those who worked for him, and decisions had to \nbe made on the best assumptions you could put together. But it is clear \nif you look at what happened, this recession started downward about 16 \nmonths ago, before the swearing in of the new President. It started \ndown and it has been coming down a little bit at a time for all these \nmonths.\n\n  During that period, the Federal Reserve Board has, for the 12th time, \nI believe, reduced interest rates. I know if my friend from New Jersey \nwere standing here and we were discussing this issue, we would both be \nsaying that is a very good thing, reducing the interest rates. No \nquestion, America relies upon capital for growth, for investment, for \neverything we put people to work with; you have to have money to buy a \nhouse, to buy a car.\n  Incidentally, if anybody wants to know how important interest rates \nare, look at the anomaly in America today. One of the biggest anomalies \nis that we are selling more cars than ever. So we are breaking the bank \non selling cars in America in the middle of a recession. Well, I guess \none could say the people finally woke up and wanted new cars, but I \ndon't think so. I think they have wanted them all along. But guess \nwhat. The automobile companies decided it was better to sell cars and \nfinance at zero interest rate and keep people working than it was to go \nahead and cut back on production, charge interest rates so the finance \ncompanies would be turning a profit, but their factories would be \nlaying off people. What an experiment because their people kept working \nand producing automobiles, and the rate of finance is zero. They must \nhave analyzed what that does or does not do for their economic picture. \nBut in the end, cars are selling because the cost of buying them is \ncheap.\n  Now, the economy is still not recovering properly, although somehow--\nat least this Senator believes that while I understood what was \nhappening and clearly was out front saying we were moving toward a \nrecession probably 12 months before we started saying it here, I \nbelieve there is a real chance if we do something right quick that this \neconomy will start back up.\n  There are some good signs out there, but there are some not so good \nsigns that could indicate it is going to be a long recession. But I am \nputting before the Senate today a proposal. There are many Senators I \nhave talked to about it. I won't mention their names. But a few of them \nI thank profusely because they have publicly commented to papers such \nas the Wall Street Journal, and others; some Democrat Senators who have \nanalyzed it with me have said it is a very good approach.\n  The reason that it is not moving with large numbers of Senators at \nthis point is because everybody has some entanglements--and I use that \nword not pejorative--in terms of putting the packages together where \nthey have committed here and there and, of course, they can't just jump \noff those ships, they have to let normal events occur.\n  But this morning, Senator Bond, Senator Frist, and I put this before \nthe Senate and the American people because we truly believe it is \nsomething that ought to be looked at. We are not here saying it is \nabsolutely a cinch that it will work. But we are saying--three of us--\nwith gaining strength today--the Wall Street Journal quotes Dr. Lindsey \nfrom the White House. His analysis would indicate that this is a good \neconomic stimulus package. Let\n\n[[Page S12003]]\n\nme suggest that it is quick, doesn't have any administrative costs \nassociated with it. It helps city, county, States, and private sector, \nand, indeed, every working man and woman in America who pays payroll \ntax for Social Security.\n  The 6.2 percent that comes out of their paycheck will stay in their \npaycheck for whatever month we choose. The legislation is drawn for the \nmonth of December, for one month. Likewise, the employer does not remit \nto the Federal Government; they keep the money.\n  In one month, if the month of December is chosen, I say to my friend \nfrom the beautiful State of Montana, $38 billion will go into the \nAmerican economy via the wage earners and businesses, large and small, \nin one month. They will have that money close to the Christmas season \none way or the other.\n  If we do January, everybody will know it is there. If we do December, \nit will be in their paychecks. The reason I keep using one or the other \nmonth is because we have not moved with dispatch as everybody had \nhoped. As a consequence, I do not know if we can get it done in time \nfor Christmas relief.\n  It is a very simple bill. It is quick. The economic activities of it \nare immediate. It eliminates 12.4 percent payroll tax from the OASDI \nfor the month of December; $38 million in immediate relief to be spent \nfor whatever the recipient wants to do with it.\n  Self-employed workers will see their taxes reduced by 12.4 percent in \nthat month. It will be split evenly between the employer and employee \nat 6.2 percent on each side. Then, obviously, there is language putting \nthe Social Security fund back in its original posture by transferring \nfrom the general fund. That accounts for the removal and use in the \neconomy and the replenishment that one would expect. It is very simple.\n  The three of us do this not as a total stimulus package, but for the \ntax portion that has been discussed by each side as being important.\n  By a strange coincidence, the two provisions that were in the \nRepublican package, the rebate and the 2 percent, the 2-percent \nmarginal rate change, turned out to be $38 billion. This package is $38 \nbillion. It is just a coincidence, but if we are looking for a \nsubstitute, we could substitute that money.\n  Whatever the Senate wants to do about workers compensation, hospital \nand health protection--those are not part of the stimulus package in \nany event. They are part of us wanting to be helpful because people are \nhurting. Those can be worked out. Whether we fight over those or not, \nclearly, eventually, they will be worked out in both bodies.\n  There are a lot of economists who have been analyzing this. We do not \nhave a lot of them here today to talk about, but there are a lot. \nPerhaps when we return, I will print in the Record an article entitled \n``A Stimulus Package May Not Work'' by Joanne Morrison. It cites three \nor four economists who analyze where we are.\n  I say to my colleagues, there are two arguments against what we are \ndoing. One, it is taking too long, and, two, it will take too long \nafter we pass it. It may be a long-term event rather than a short-term \nstimulus. Second, without any question, there is serious doubt as to \nwhether the other packages are very stimulative. In both instances, \nthat is corrected here.\n  Is it fair? It seems pretty fair. I am not saying we can solve each \nand every problem, but it is pretty fair. I have sent the tax bill to \nthe desk.\n  I thank my two cosponsors and the Senator from Montana for letting me \npresent my thoughts on this. There are a lot of people beginning to ask \nabout it and starting to support it. We will put the names of those \ninstitutions that support this in the Record as soon as we can. The \nGovernors are coming on board. We have asked no one. They are reading \nabout it now, and we probably will ask a number of other groups in the \ncountry to give us their views.\n  I thank the Senate for giving me time. It is nice that debate can \noccur, but we are not there yet. Maybe a new idea can find its place \nhere. I hope it is new enough to receive the consideration it deserves.\n  Mr. President, we must move forward. Right now, we have a Republican \nstimulus bill that passed the House. We have the President's plan and \nthe Senate Republicans' plan. We have the Senate Democrats' plan.\n  But we don't yet have a stimulus plan that will pass the Senate and \nbe signed by the President.\n  I believe this bill can be the key to bringing both sides together \nquickly once we return from the upcoming Thanksgiving week recess.\n  Let me be clear. I support the President. I think this administration \nis right on track when it comes to an economic stimulus package. \nHowever, any existing plan has to be modified to garner enough Senate \nsupport to pass.\n  We can't wait till later to get this job done. The administration and \nCongress have promised to enact a stimulus package. The American people \nexpect a stimulus package. The markets expect a stimulus package. It \nwould be a huge mistake to wait.\n  The retail sales reported yesterday showed sales up 7.1 percent in \nOctober. However, this was almost all due to aggressive and \nunsustainable incentives in the auto sector. In effect, these \nincentives are shifting auto sales that would have been made next year \ninto this year. The economy is going to be in trouble once these \nincentives stop.\n  In order to break the impasse and move the process forward, let me \ndescribe the bill we have introduced today.\n  We propose a one-month payroll tax holiday, which would replace the \ncurrent proposals for a supplemental rebate and the speed-up of the \nmarginal rate reductions.\n  I'll tell you why.\n  IRS Commissioner Rossotti has raised administrative issues related to \nthe supplemental rebates. Because of where we are in the calendar, such \nrebates would have to be folded into the taxpayers' 2001 tax returns \nand refunds next spring.\n  A payroll tax holiday will be more effective at increasing spending \nthan the rebate checks sent out earlier this year or a new round of \nrebate checks. It will put the tax cut in paychecks automatically, \nwithout the need for special mailings.\n  Psychologically, workers are used to adjusting their spending habits \nbased on the size of their paychecks. At present, workers spend about \n95 cents for every dollar of after-tax earnings. Increasing their \nafter-tax earnings will therefore lead to more spending--if they \nperceive the tax cut to be part of their regular earnings.\n  That's why separate rebate checks don't work as well. When a worker \ngets a separate rebate check they are more likely to treat it as a \nspecial windfall gain and save the money or pay down debt. According to \nthe University of Michigan, as of October, in the midst of a recession, \nonly 30 percent of people receiving rebate checks were saying they \nwould spend the money.\n  The speed-up of the marginal rate reductions up has been criticized \nas a permanent change in tax law that benefits upper income folks most.\n  The bottom line: A payroll tax holiday is truly a stimulative, \ntemporary tax cut that is very likely to be spent.\n  All wage earners earning below $80,400, even those that don't earn \nenough to pay income taxes, would benefit.\n  Both the employee and employer share (6.2 percent each) of the social \nsecurity (OASDI) payroll tax would be suspended. Self-employed social \nsecurity payroll taxes would also be suspended. The Social Security \ntrust fund would be made whole via a transfer from the general fund.\n  Employees would have more take home pay and employers would have \nincreased cash flow.\n  A school teacher making $40,000 would see an increase in their take-\nhome pay of $207 in December. A self-employed contractor earning \n$40,000 per year (who pays both the employer and employee share of 12.4 \npercent) would see an increase in pay of $413.\n  It is most desirable to make the one-month period December 1, 2001 \nthrough December 31, 2001. A payroll tax holiday in December would be \nperfectly timed for the holiday shopping season. The whole tax cut \nwould go out in only one month. We wouldn't have to wait for a new \nround of rebate checks to go out--a process that could take months and \ninterfere with the speed of tax refunds.\n  In addition, in 2001 the payroll tax is applied to income up to \n$80,400. By December, approximately 6 percent of\n\n[[Page S12004]]\n\nwage earners have already reached the limit and would not receive the \nbenefit of the payroll tax holiday.\n  The cost of a December holiday is about $38 billion in fiscal 2002. \nIf the holiday were in January, the cost would by about $43 billion, \nbecause all wage earners would receive the benefit.\n  Mr. President, we are at an impasse here in the Senate. Let's all \nadmit that neither the Democratic plan nor the President's plan has the \nrequisite 60 votes to pass this Chamber.\n  I believe this proposal could provide us with the key component to \nreaching a bipartisan way to enact a stimulus bill quickly.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Senator Domenici has a proposal he has \ncrafted to provide immediate economic stimulus and assistance to low- \nand middle-income workers who have been suffering, as we all have, from \nthe economic downturn.\n  I have signed on with him in support of his measure because his idea, \nwhich is a payroll tax holiday for December, would be the easiest, \nsimplest, fairest, and most effective way to get a stimulus of between \n$38 and $41 billion directly into the pockets of middle and lower \nincome workers in the United States.\n  This is not a tax cut for the rich because anybody who is making over \n$80,000 a year has already finished making their Social Security or \npayroll tax, FICA tax, contributions. This would provide, if we can put \nthis in the stimulus package and pass it quickly this month, that you \nwould not send in your FICA tax withholdings or contributions for \nDecember. It is simple. Nothing goes in the mail. You don't have to \nworry about mail deliveries or all the problems we have had. Obviously, \nmost people know we haven't had mail for almost a month in Congress. \nThere are other places where security precautions have delayed the \nmail.\n  You don't have to go through a complicated system of developing \nregulations and rules or even cutting checks for a rebate. When the \nPresident proposed a rebate many weeks ago, there was time to get the \nrebate check prepared and get it out in December so we would have a \nproductive, economically thriving holiday season. Unfortunately, \nbecause of the lateness of the hour, it is likely that a rebate check \nor other assistance that has to be paid out by check from the Federal \nGovernment will be 6 to 8 weeks away and will not hit in the pockets \nwhere the working men and women can spend it until sometime in January \nor February.\n  This obviously is one part of a stimulus package. I happen to believe \nthat in addition to more generous unemployment benefits and providing \nassistance through grants to the States for health care, we also need \nto have assistance for small businesses, many of which have been \nabsolutely savaged by the economic downturn as well as the crash at the \nWorld Trade Center.\n  Those parts are important, too. I have some small business provisions \nI hope will be included in the stimulus package.\n  The great thing about the Domenici proposal for the FICA December tax \nholiday, not paying the Social Security withholding amounts in \nDecember, is that it can happen immediately. It will put the money in \nthe pockets of those who can best spend it. It helps the single mom who \nis just struggling to get by. It helps the individual worker who makes \nabout $40,000. They would have $210 more in their pockets. For a self-\nemployed person who has to pay both the employee and employer side of \nthe FICA tax, 12.4 percent, that would be about $420 they would not \nhave to send to the Federal Government in December. Of course, there \nwould be a transfer from the general revenue to Social Security so we \nwould not impact Social Security.\n  I urge all my colleagues to pay attention to the thoughtful and \neffective proposal Senator Domenici has outlined for us. This should be \nthe centerpiece. Democrats and Republicans can come together behind \nthis proposal, move it quickly; let's get moving. We are in an economic \ndownturn. It has been going on for 15 months. It got a whole lot worse \nafter September 11. This economy needs a boost. Leaving the FICA tax in \nthe pockets of the people who are working, the medium- and low-income \nworkers, and the people who employ them is the best way to get this \neconomy moving again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1718. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nsection 29 to other facilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Clean \nAlternative Fuels Incentives Act of 2001. This bill extends and limits \nthe credit of producing fuel from non-conventional sources to \nfacilities that produce qualified fuels using technologies that provide \ncertain environmental benefits, but only if such facilities produce \nenhanced value synthetic fuels from coal.\n  It is important to outline the goals of this legislation at the \noutset. The four primary goals of this bill are all very important to \nthe future of this Nation. First, the use of alternative fuels reduces \nour Nation's trade imbalance and reliance on foreign energy sources. \nSecond, the cleaner, alternative fuels emit cleaner byproduct into the \nenvironment. Third, these technologies produce jobs in the United \nStates. Fourth, they encourage the development of technologies that \nwill be economically viable after the short period during which the \nincentive is provided.\n  Starting with the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress acted on \nnumerous occasions to provide tax credits intended to develop \nalternative fuels. Prior sessions of Congress took these steps in \nrecognition of the need to encourage the development and use of \nalternative fuels, which they hoped would help lead our Nation towards \nenergy independence.\n  Today our Nation not only needs to continue its efforts to develop \nalternative fuel resources, but given our constantly growing energy \nneeds we must consider the environmental impact that conventional and \nnon-conventional fuels have on our environment, particularly in light \nof the Clean Air Act.\n  In order to maximize the most efficient use of our Nation's reserves, \nthis Congress needs to commit to the development of clean alternative \nfuels. My home State of Montana has vast coal reserves. In fact, many \ntimes our State has been referred to as the ``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' \nNot only do we have vast reserves, but also with clean coal \ntechnologies we can use these resources and do little harm to the \nenvironment.\n  Those who say that coal is not one of the answers to energy \nindependence because of its environmental impact are dead wrong. Coal-\nfired plants generate over 50 percent of our Nation's electricity. \nInterestingly, the Energy Information Administration, EIA, reported \nthat Montana's emissions of nitrogen oxide, NOx, sulfur dioxide, SO2, \nand carbon dioxide, CO2, all decreased from 1986-1996 while producing \nthe same amount of electricity. This proves to me that our coal \ntechnologies are improving. Folks, I believe the environmental \nemissions will continue to improve and if you provide incentives to \nhelp clean alternative fuels reach the marketplace, some day we will \nreach energy independence in this Nation.\n  One question that some of you may have is, ``Are these proven \ntechnologies?'' These are proven technologies, but to make the \ncontinued development of these technologies a reality, the Congress \nneeds to provide meaningful incentives. The bill that I offer today \naccomplishes exactly that, it provides clean alternative sources of \nenergy a real opportunity to bring energy independence to this Nation.\n  This bill would extend the non-conventional fuels credit for \nfacilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal using a technology \nthat results in: (1) Measurable reductions of certain emissions when \nproducing the fuel or when the fuel is burned as a fuel, not including \nany reductions caused by dilution and (2) measurable increases in the \nvalue of coal, not including any increases caused by additives. These \ntwo factors will lead to accomplishment of the four goals I stated \npreviously. First, the use of alternative fuels reduces our Nation's \ntrade imbalance and reliance on foreign energy sources. Second, the \ntechnologies provide cleaner emissions into the environment. Third, \nthese technologies produce jobs in the United States. Fourth, they \nencourage the development of technologies that will be economically \nviable after the short period during which the incentive is provided.\n\n[[Page S12005]]\n\n  I hope that Members of this body will support this important piece of \nlegislation, which helps our Nation at a time of dire need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Miller, \n        and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1722. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the application of the excise tax imposed on bows and arrows; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch, \nMiller, and Grassley, I am pleased to introduce the Arrow Excise Tax \nSimplification Act of 2001. This bill will protect funding for the \nWildlife Restoration Program, the Pittman-Robertson fund, by \nsimplifying administration and compliance with the excise tax and \nclosing an unintended loophole that allows arrows assembled outside the \nUnited States to avoid the excise tax imposed on domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  The creation of the Wildlife Restoration Program is one of the great \nsuccess stories of cooperation among America's sportsmen and women, \nState fish and wildlife agencies, and the sporting goods industry. \nWorking together with Congress, Americans who enjoy the outdoors \nvolunteered to pay an excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition to be \nused for hunter education programs, wildlife restoration, and habitat \nconservation.\n  Originally the archery industry did not participate in this program. \nHowever, the growth of bow hunting in the '60s and '70s led the archery \nindustry to decide they would support the excise tax that funds State \ngame agencies. As a result, the tax was extended to archery equipment \nin 1975. The tax on archery equipment was meant to parallel the tax \nthat hunters were paying on firearms and ammunition. The archery \nindustry and bow hunters are pleased to contribute to the success of \nthe Wildlife Restoration Program.\n  Because current law taxes components and not arrows, foreign \nmanufacturers are selling arrows in the United States without paying \nthe excise tax that is imposed on arrows made in the United States. Not \nonly are these untaxed imports unfair to American workers, they \nthreaten the integrity of the Wildlife Restoration Fund.\n  This issue is important to companies in Montana. Mike Ellig, a \nmanufacturer of archery products in Bozeman, MT, pays this tax. He \nsupports the tax, but asks that it be fair. Mike's company, Montana \nBlack Gold, and the archery industry want to support the Wildlife \nRestoration Program. But the way the tax works today, American \nmanufacturers are at a competitive disadvantage.\n  This legislation will close the loophole that allows imported arrows \nto avoid the excise tax paid by domestic manufacturers. While keeping \nthe current 12.4 percent tax on arrow components, the proposal will \nimpose a tax of 12 percent on the first sale of an arrow assembled from \nuntaxed components. U.S. manufacturers and foreign manufacturers will \nbe treated equally.\n  Since this loophole was inadvertently created in 1997, archery \nimports, mostly finished arrows, increased from $113,000 in 1997 to \n$2,600,000 in 2001 to date. If Congress does not act quickly to close \nthis loophole, domestic manufacturers will be forced to relocate \noutside of the United States. They simply cannot afford to lose market \nshare for a fifth year to competitors who do not pay the same tax they \npay. If a few more move overseas, the rest will follow. The result will \nbe a catastrophic loss of revenue for the Federal Wildlife Restoration \nFund.\n  Current law also taxes non-hunters, contrary to congressional intent. \nTo relieve non-hunters from the requirement to pay for wildlife \nmanagement, the legislation would eliminate the current-law tax on bows \nwith draw weights of less than 30 pounds. Those bows are not suitable \nor, in many States, legal for hunting. To preserve the revenue for the \nWildlife Restoration Fund, the bill would retain the current tax on \nbows that are suitable for hunting.\n  The proposal would also clarify that broadheads are an accessory \ntaxed at 11 percent rather than as an arrow component taxed at 12.4 \npercent. This will correct the ambiguity in the 1997 act that led to \nthe misclassification of broadheads.\n  In summary, the Arrow Excise Tax Simplification Act of 2001 would \naccomplish worthy objectives. It would close the loophole that allows \nforeign imported arrows to escape the tax and remove the tax on youth \nand recreational archery equipment that were never meant to be taxed. \nWe will accomplish these goals while protecting the Wildlife \nRestoration Program by ensuring that there is no significant diminution \nof revenues collected by the archery excise tax. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates the proposal will decrease revenues by $5 million \nover ten years resulting in small changes in outlays from the Federal \nAid in Wildlife Fund. Failure to close the import loophole will \neviscerate the archery tax base resulting in devastating losses to the \nfund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1723. A bill to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act with respect \nto the statute of limitations on actions; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week the U.S. Supreme Court issued a \nruling interpreting a provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that \nwill make it harder for Americans to protect their private financial \ndata from identity theft. I rise today with the senior senator from \nIowa to introduce the ``Protect Victims of Identity Theft Act'' to \nprovide consumers in Vermont and across America with the protections \nthat they need and deserve. I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership \nand look forward to working with him on this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, identity theft victimizes thousands of Americans every \nyear. Once a skilled scam artist gets his hands on a consumer's Social \nSecurity or bank account number, he can wreak unimaginable havoc on a \nfamily's finances.\n  With society conducting more and more of its business electronically, \nthe incidence of identity theft in America is on the rise. As of June \nof this year, the Federal Trade Commission reported that its identity \ntheft hotline was answering over 1,800 calls per week, up from the 445 \ncalls per week the hotline received in November 1999. These calls are \nmostly from people who have been hurt by identity theft, but thousands \nof others come from consumers worried about becoming an identity \nthief's next victim.\n  When Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act, FCRA, more than \nthirty years ago, it gave consumers important tools to ensure the \naccuracy and privacy of their credit information. The FCRA imposed \naffirmative obligations on the consumer reporting agencies that \nmaintain these reports in order to protect consumers' private \ninformation from unauthorized disclosures. The FCRA says that consumer \nreporting agencies must maintain ``reasonable procedures'' to avoid \nimproper use of a consumer's private information.\n  These safeguards are essential to protect each American's \nconfidential financial information. The FCRA demands that consumer \nreporting agencies require that prospective users of credit information \nidentify themselves, certify the purposes for which they are seeking \nthe information, and verify that they will not use the information for \nany other purpose, to name just a few examples. Consumer reporting \nagencies that fail to live up to these obligations or that are careless \nwith consumers' private information can be held liable to consumers \nharmed by their security lapses.\n  Current law provides consumers 2 years from the ``date on which the \nliability arises'' to bring suit against a non-compliant consumer \nreporting agency. This week, the United States Supreme Court concluded \nthat the term ``the date on which liability arises,'' means the day \nthat a consumer reporting agency fails to comply with FCRA's \nrequirements. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 2001 WL 1401902 (Nov. 13, 2001). As \na result, the statute of limitations clock starts ticking whether or \nnot a consumer is aware that information about his finances has been \nillegally handled or disclosed. That means that the 2-year limitations \nperiod can expire before a consumer ever even suspects that her credit \ninformation has fallen into the wrong hands.\n\n[[Page S12006]]\n\n  The 750,000 Americans who annually have their identity stolen and \ntheir credit put at risk deserve better. It is unfair for the law to \nonly protect consumers if they discover the identity theft within 2 \nyears of the crime, even if the consumer had no reason to know about \nit. That stands the normal rule of discovery for fraud on its head.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would clarify that the statute of \nlimitations for identity theft does not start until the consumer \ndiscovers the problem or should have discovered the problem through the \nexercise of reasonable diligence. The exercise of reasonable diligence \nis the traditional common law duty under fraud discovery rules and does \nnot impose any new mandate or requirement on a consumer under the FCRA. \nThis change in the law ensures that consumers have a fair opportunity \nto vindicate their rights.\n  This bipartisan legislative fix is needed to put a stop to identity \ntheft. It will encourage consumer reporting agencies to establish \nproper security measures needed to deny identity thieves access to \nAmericans' most personal financial information. It ensures that the \nFair Credit Reporting Act has real teeth to fulfill its mission of \nprotecting the accuracy and privacy of consumer credit information. And \nit will give consumers in Vermont and across America a fair shot at \nvindicating their right to keep private information away from \nunscrupulous con artists.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Victims of Identity \n     Theft Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.\n\n       Section 618 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1681p) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 618. JURISDICTION OF COURTS; LIMITATIONS OF ACTIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--An action to enforce any liability \n     created under this title may be brought in any appropriate \n     United States district court, without regard to the amount in \n     controversy, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, \n     not later than 2 years after the date on which the violation \n     is discovered or should have been discovered by the exercise \n     of reasonable diligence.\n       ``(b) Willful Misrepresentation.--The limitations period \n     prescribed in subsection (a) shall be tolled during any \n     period during which a defendant has materially and willfully \n     misrepresented any information required under this title to \n     be disclosed to an individual, and the information so \n     misrepresented is material to the establishment of the \n     liability of the defendant to that individual under this \n     title.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nVermont in introducing a bill to protect victims of identity theft.\n  This legislative remedy is prompted by the sweeping impact of the \nSupreme Court's decision this past week on the rights of more than \n750,000 Americans who annually have their identity stolen and their \ncredit put at risk. Under current law, consumers have a two-year \nstatute of limitations to sue credit reporting companies that fail to \nprotect private financial information from improper disclosures and \nsecurity lapses. The problem with the Supreme Court's decision is that \na victim of identity theft often has no idea that information about his \nfinances has been negligently handled or disclosed by a credit \nreporting company until it's too late to take any legal action. Under \ncurrent law, the two year statute of limitations begins when the \nconsumer's credit reporting company fails to comply with the law--not \nwhen the consumer discovers or should have discovered the problem.\n  Our bill, the Protect the Victims of Identity Theft Act of 2001, \nchanges that rule. As stated, it simply clarifies that the statute of \nlimitations for identity theft does not start until the consumer \ndiscovers the problem or should have discovered the problem. This \nchange in the law ensures that consumers have a fair chance to \nvindicate their rights should credit reporting companies fail to take \nreasonable steps to protect private financial and personal information \nfrom theft and misuse.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this \nlegislation to protect the American consumer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1725. A bill to require the Comptroller General to carry out a \nstudy to determine the feasibility of undertaking passenger rail \ntransportation security programs that are similar to those of foreign \ncountries; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in the last two months we have experienced \na steep learning curve as a country and as a Congress in our efforts to \nimprove homeland security.\n  As we saw with the drafting of the airline security bill, the United \nStates has not cornered the market on security innovations and \nmeasures; there is much we can learn from other countries that have \nfaced or addressed the same challenges. For this reason, I am \nintroducing legislation that would require the General Accounting \nOffice to initiate a study examining the security measures that have \nworked for other regions and countries such as the European Union and \nJapan.\n  For example, the $15 billion channel tunnel or Chunnel linking \nEngland to the European continent has been open to train service, for \npassengers and freight, since 1994 without a major security incident. \nIn 2000 alone, 2.8 million cars, 7.1 million passengers, and 2.9 \nmillion tons of freight made the 31 mile journey under the English \nChannel safely.\n  Security has always been a major concern for the Chunnel and that \nBritain, France, and Eurotunnel, the company operating the tunnel, have \nmade security a top priority without degrading passenger service. In \nfact, in addition to its private security staff provided by Eurotunnel, \nthe Chunnel is policed by a bi-national force of police, immigration, \nand customs officers with armed patrols in the British and French \nterminals. And both the company and the respective government agencies \nalso conduct routine intelligence-led security checks on both passenger \nand freight vehicles.\n  So I suspect that our friends in Europe, and in Asia, and other \nregions, may be able to provide valuable insight on how we can improve \nour rail transportation security. It is my intent with this bill to \ndirect the General Accounting Office to complete, no later than January \n2002, a study of rail transport security measures in other countries in \nan effort to seek innovative screening procedures and processes and \nother security measures that may be a benefit to the United States. \nSubsequently, an assessment of these measures would be provided to \nCongress.\n  In the hours and days after September 11, Americans discovered we are \nnot alone in this struggle and I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill that encourages the United States to reach out and learn from \nothers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1728. A bill to provide for greater security at seaports; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Maritime \nSecurity Advancement Act which is designed to mitigate the threat of \nmaritime- and seaport-related terrorism.\n  In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attacks of September 11, \nI believe it is critical that we pass the strongest possible security \nenhancements to our transportation system and do so as soon as \npossible. To this end, we have been working to enhance aviation \nsecurity, and for obvious reasons, this has been one of our first and \nhighest priorities in the wake of the recent attacks. At the same time, \nwe must also address concerns about highway safety, rail safety, \npipeline safety, and maritime and seaport security. I support efforts \nto close the security gaps in each and every mode in the vast national \nand international transportation network that is so critical to our \neconomy, our freedom, and our way of life.\n  We are going to need the resources of the United States coupled with \nthe cooperation of our global neighbors in order to wage the war \nagainst terrorism. For it is a fight we must win, and will win. The \npurpose of the legislation I am introducing today is to employ more \ntools in the fight against terrorism. Specifically, the Maritime\n\n[[Page S12007]]\n\nSecurity Advancement Act would direct the Secretary of Transportation, \nin awarding loan guarantees, grants, and other forms of financial \nsupport for research and development under the discretionary authority \nof the U.S. Department of Transportation, to give preference to \nprojects with the potential to reduce the threat of maritime- and \nseaport-related terrorism.\n  For example, the legislation would promote the development of \nprojects designed to increase the feasibility of securing cargo, \nsealing containers, and making cargo containers more tamper resistant; \nimprove cargo container content labeling technologies; and provide for \ninnovations in the physical handling of cargo in ways that could reduce \nthe threat of terrorism aimed at our maritime transportation system.\n  The bill would also direct the Secretary to identify the technologies \nwith the potential to provide the greatest security with respect to \nhandline, labeling, sealing, and transportation of cargo and report to \nCongress on its findings. And the bill authorizes the Secretary to \nissue new rules requiring deployment of such technologies and practices \nin an effort to enhance security and reduce the threat of terrorism.\n  We must leave no stone unturned in the effort to preserve the \nsecurity of this nation's transportation infrastructure, so that we \nmight both carry on the business of the Nation and ensure our continued \neconomic viability, and also ensure that we are in good position of \nstrength to be able to wage the kind of war necessary to eradicate \nterrorism. And we cannot remain strong if we cannot remain mobile. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/16/senate-section/article/S12007-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 182--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOCATE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES TO COMBAT \n                             GLOBAL POVERTY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Leahy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am here today to urge passage of a bill \nto improve the U.S. Small Business Administration's Microloan Program, \na program which makes an enormous difference to many aspiring \nentrepreneurs through very small loans of up to $35,000. The demand for \nthese loans go up when the economy slows down and people lose their \njobs or face reduced hours because they often start their own business \nor start a part-time venture to patch their income losses.\n  Senator Snowe worked very closely with me to make this day happen. We \nwish to thank Senators Bond, Wellstone, Cleland, Landrieu, Harkin, \nLevin, Lieberman, Bingaman, Enzi, Kohl, Snowe, Johnson, Daschle, \nConrad, Burns, Inouye, Baucus, and Jeffords for joining us and \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked together many times on this program, \npushing to make sure our country's smallest businesses have access to \ncapital and business assistance. In this instance, we are bringing \nbefore the Senate changes that the Senate supported unanimously as part \nof its version of last year's SBA Reauthorization bill, but were not \nincluded by the House because they had not considered them in a \nhearing. This package of changes was reintroduced this year and \nsupported unanimously by the Senate Small Business Committee. This bill \namends the Small Business Administration's Microloan Program to make it \nmore flexible to meet credit needs, more accessible to \nmicroentrepreneurs across the nation, and more streamlined for leaders \nto make loans and provide management assistance. The changes in this \nbill complement the program and technical changes made last year.\n  The program provides for microloans, of just $10,000, on average, in \norder to allow many prospective entrepreneurs to realize their dream \nand start their own business. This provides them with financial \nindependence and sometimes allows individuals to go from welfare to \nemployment.\n  Let me just run through some of the provisions of the Microloan \nProgram Improvement Act of 2001. First, it eliminates the requirement \nthat SBA microloans be ``short-term'' loans. This change will give \nintermediaries greater latitude in developing microloan products \nbecause they will be able to offer their borrowers revolving lines of \ncredit. It will also cut transaction costs for both the borrower and \nthe microlender and will generally make it easier to fund these types \nof very small businesses.\n  Why are revolving lines of credit important? Because seasonal types \nof businesses really need revolving lines of credit instead of, for \ninstance, a 90- or 120-day note. For example, if you are a building \ncontractor or painter, you may need $15,000 to front supplies and pay \nyour workers because most clients only pay when the work is done. So, \nunder the current scenario, if you were to borrow the $15,000 from a \nmicrolender, you would pay back small payments at the 30 and 60 day \nmarkers. The entire remaining balance would be due upon receipt of \npayment from your client. Then, when the next client came along, the \nborrower would have to enter into an entirely new loan\n\n[[Page S12014]]\n\ntransaction. Under the new scenario, a revolving line of credit would \neliminate the need for a new loan transaction. The contractor would pay \nthe debt upon receipt of payment from the first client and then simply \nwrite a check against his or her line of credit when the second client \ncomes along. I would like to emphasize that our Committee does not \nintend for this flexibility to be used to make loans with long terms, \nsuch as 15 or 30 years.\n  I spent a lot of time describing that provision because I want people \nto understand the needs of these very tiny businesses and how SBA's \ncredit programs evolve to meet the market. Of course, this legislation \nmakes other small but important changes. It broadens the eligibility \ncriteria for potential microintermediaries, which would allow more \npeople to benefit from the program and stimulate the creation of \nadditional new businesses to start up. This is accomplished by deeming \nintermediaries eligible if they have one year of equivalent experience \nrather than only actual experience in making loans to startup, newly \nestablished, or growing small businesses.\n  Third, this bill expands the program's flexibility for intermediaries \nto subcontract out technical assistance and offer pre-loan technical \nassistance. The bill eliminates the restriction on how much technical \nassistance funding an intermediary can use for pre-loan assistance and \nallows the intermediary to use its discretion to determine the \nappropriate amount. Currently, intermediaries are limited to using up \nto 25 percent of their funds to assist prospective borrowers. This \nchange allows an intermediary to allocate as much technical assistance \nas appropriate. The bill also increases the percentage of technical \nassistance grant funds that an intermediary can use to subcontract out \ntechnical assistance. Currently, intermediaries can only subcontract 25 \npercent, and this legislation would raise it to 35 percent.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a new peer-to-peer mentoring program to \nhelp new intermediaries acquire the basic knowledge needed to run a \nbusiness from experienced mentors. The bill will authorize up to $1 \nmillion of annual appropriations for such purposes.\n  Support for the Microloan Program is not only bipartisan but \nnationwide--it has support from all parts of the country. By removing a \nnumber of barriers to entry, this bill will be a great advantage to new \nmicrointermediaries, who, in turn, will improve their ability to assist \nmicroentrepreneurs, thus, increasing the opportunities for the \nentrepreneurs, their businesses and their communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Microloan Program Improvement Act \nof 2001.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table without any \nintervening action, and that any statements relating thereto be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I support \nthis resolution in support of the Words Can Heal Campaign to promote \nmore responsible and civil speech to reduce conflict and build \nunderstanding between all peoples.\n  The Jerusalem Fund has launched a Words Can Heal Campaign on \nSeptember 4, 2001, to reduce verbal violence and gossip and to promote \nthe value and practice of ethical speech in order to improve our \ndemocracy, build mutual respect, honor, and dignity in our country.\n  The ability to express views freely and resolve differences through \ndialogue and education is fundamental to American democracy. For that \nprocess to work well, our words must reflect mutual respect, truth and \nfairness. Friends, families, and communities need to speak to each \nother in ways that help build people up, not tear them down. The Words \nCan Heal Campaign will draw attention to the language we use and \nprovide practical help to parents, school kids, supervisors, employees, \nteachers, government officials, entertainers, athletes--people from all \nwalks of life--to speak more kindly and less destructively with and \nabout each other. Through this campaign, the Jerusalem Fund will seek \nto make November 23, and every day thereafter, a day when unfair \ngossip, prejudicial comments, and verbal humiliation will be replaced \nby words that are encouraging, helpful, and healing.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, many Americans have felt \nthat what happens in their neighborhood is beyond their control. This \nresolution can offer a comprehensive plan to rebuild our communities \nand relationship through the words we speak and the way we communicate. \nThis holiday season, as we take an in-depth look at our lives and those \naround us, the Words Can Heal message resonates even more forcefully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
