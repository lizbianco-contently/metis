Mr. President, during the last few weeks, \nthere has been much discussion about whether or not we should expand \nour war against terrorism to a specific war in Iraq. A lot of us have \nbeen on the talk shows and on the news programs. This morning Senator \nBrownback of Kansas and I were on CNN talking about this very subject. \nIt is expected that we will take up a resolution with regard to a war \nwith Iraq probably later this week.\n  In the midst of this very public discussion, largely neglected have \nbeen conversations about a battle we are in the midst of fighting on \nour own soil--an economic battle against the long-term fiscal stability \nof our country, an economic battle involving the condition of our \nbudget and our national economy.\n  As we talk about protecting against terrorism and protecting against \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq, clearly, we have to talk about military \nstrength. But there is also a major component to being militarily \nstrong; that is, to be economically strong.\n  Let's look at our condition. Last year the administration told us we \ncould expect over $5 trillion of surpluses over the next decade. As a \nmember of the Budget Committee, having gone through a similar situation \nway back in the early 1980s, I warned that that was a risky gamble. I \ncited the experiences of 1981 when we voted for a huge tax cut. I \nrecalled, as we had this debate over a year ago about the projected \nsurpluses over time, that those surpluses may not materialize. If you \ngive a tax cut that is too large, it is going to throw you back into \ndeficit financing.\n  Indeed, that is what happened in 1981. We had a tax cut that was so \nhuge, we had to undo it--not once, not twice, but three times in the \ndecade of the 1980s.\n  Last year when we were having this debate, I suggested that you just \ncouldn't count on a 10-year forecast, that there was too much risk \nassociated with planning that far in advance. At the time I supported a \nhuge tax cut. I supported one version on an amendment that was up to \n$1.2 trillion over a decade and one that would give back to our \ncitizens and assist those who were struggling to make ends meet but one \nthat wouldn't break the back of the Federal Government should things \nnot appear quite as rosy as we thought they were going to be, which has \nbeen the case.\n  Things didn't turn out anywhere close to the rosy picture that was \npainted for us a year ago. After passing last year's tax cut, which \ngoes upwards of $2 trillion over a decade, we find that if we adopt \nover the next decade the administration's, the President's spending and \ntax policies, we will not see the $5.6 trillion of surpluses, but we \nwill see instead $400 billion of deficits.\n  Some point to congressional spending as the root of this problem. \nThat is simply not accurate. We will experience these deficits using \nthe administration's, the President's, the White House's own proposals \nfor spending and additional tax cuts. This doesn't even take into \naccount the trillions of dollars of Social Security funds that are also \ngoing to be spent.\n  The true deficit, not counting Social Security surpluses, is not $400 \nbillion. Over that decade, it is going to be $2.7 trillion. Remember, \nin the election of 2000 we all said we were not going to touch the \nsurpluses in Social Security; that we were going to leave those alone; \nthat there was going to be a fence off of Social Security surpluses. \nThen those surpluses would pay off the national debt over a 12-year \nperiod. That didn't happen.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us nearly $6 trillion of last \nyear's projected surplus is gone. There is nothing left.\n  Now, let's recap where it went. According to CBO, 34 percent of the \nlost surplus went to last year's tax cuts. Twenty-nine percent of it \nwas lost due to the overestimations of revenue by the administration; \nthat was the rosy picture of what the surpluses were going to be, \nprojecting over 10 years. In other words, lost revenue accounts for 63 \npercent of the disappearance of last year's surplus.\n  The remainder of the lost surplus went to the war on terrorism--\nsomething we obviously have to finance--or was directly related to the \nrecession. Twenty-two percent of that went to increased spending on \nnational defense, and only 15 percent of the disappearance of the \nsurplus is as a result of the economic downturn.\n  For all of those folks asserting the overspending has eaten through \nour surplus projects, that is simply not accurate. The two largest \nreasons for the disappearance of the surplus are tax cuts and the \nadministration's rosy estimates of the revenue.\n\n  The third biggest reason is what you would expect: Spending on \ndefense. The smallest cause of the disappearance is the economic \ndownturn.\n  The fact is, the surplus is gone. We are back up to our eyeballs in \nnational debt. Last year, the administration said the debt held by the \npublic would be virtually eliminated. Last year, the administration \nsaid the debt would be eliminated by 2008. It didn't happen that way.\n  Now we are in the middle of deficit financing. Instead of having no \ndebt, we are going to be stuck over that decade with $3.8 trillion of \ndebt, and the consequences of this enormously increased debt are that \nthe interest cost to the Federal Government will have tripled from $620 \nbillion over the decade to $1.9 trillion. That is going to have real \nconsequences in our national economy.\n  Why do you think the stock market is going in the tank, it is right \nnow? Every day it is losing. It is down in the 7,000 range on the Dow \nJones. It is not just because of the threatened war on Iraq. That is \none element of it. But it is a fact that the Federal Government has now \ngone back into its old ways of deficit financing; that is, borrowing \nmoney to pay present bills every year, projected over this decade to \nthe point that we said we were not going to do it. We must pay \nattention to our bottom line and to the economic security and the \nfundamental financial strength of America. That is what gives texture \nand vibrancy for us as a Nation that needs to be militarily strong, as \nwell as morally strong. We need that undergirding of economic strength.\n  With deficits projected the rest of the decade, we are going to be \ndigging a deeper national debt hole. And when is that going to occur? \nLo and behold, it is going to occur just at the time that all of the \nbaby boomers are going to retire and our cashflow situation is going to \nget worse.\n  We are living right now on the positive cashflow out of the Medicare \nand the Social Security trust funds. But by the year 2016, those trust \nfunds go from cash positive to cash negative, and they do it in a very \nbig way.\n  We cannot afford to continue to cut receipts in the hope that doing \nso will somehow miraculously turn into more revenues. We have to begin \nto think more realistically before our overly rosy optimism financially \nparalyzes our Federal Government. At the same time, our economy is \ncontinuing to be sluggish. Although most analysts remain optimistic \nthat we will pull out of this recession eventually, the path is not \nrising very fast, if it is rising at all.\n\n  The economic indicators are disturbing: Last week, leading economic \nindicators dropped for the third month\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\nin a row, and Nasdaq hit a 6-year low. The Dow Jones is down 1,200 \npoints since August 22. Oil prices just recently spiked to a 19-month \nhigh, and consumer confidence is at its lowest since November 2001.\n  Since the beginning of 2001, 2 million jobs have been lost, the first \ndecline in the number of private sector jobs in 50 years. The U.S. \npoverty rate rose last year for the first time in 8 years.\n  Last year's administration spending and tax cut plan has resulted in \ntoday's collision course of more deficits, more debt, more economic \ninsecurity, higher interest rates, lower economic growth and lower \nemployment.\n  All of this is occurring right under our noses. Yet I do not believe \nthat the administration is paying attention. I appreciate the ongoing \ndialog about a potentially impending war in the Middle East--but we \nalso need to pay attention to the battles that we are already waging. \nWe must do something to reinvigorate the economy. We must pay attention \nto our Government bottom line. We must not continue to raise the debt \nfor our grandchildren to later pay off.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to make a few short comments before \nI turn it over to my friend from Iowa. I have been listening to my \nfriend from Florida. He is blaming the administration for the deficit. \nI remind him who it is that spends the money. The administration cannot \nspend a dime unless it is authorized by the Congress.\n  We find ourselves in a Congress that doesn't even have a budget. When \nwe talk about spending and deficits, we should talk about ourselves and \nwonder why we haven't done one of the things we have done every year, \nand that is have a budget. We don't have a budget.\n  So I agree, as a matter of fact, with the spending, but we need to \ntake action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9655-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are a lot of rumors about where we \nare going in the next few days we have remaining, basically the rest of \nthis week and I presume next week, as to what is going to be done. \nThere is talk about pulling homeland defense. I hope that is not the \ncase. Of all the issues we have before us, certainly that has to be one \nof the most important.\n  There is talk of bringing all the kind of politically oriented issues \nto the floor, knowing they will not pass, but to be able to say we \ntried. I don't think that is the best way to govern. It seems to me we \nhave to make some priorities. We have a shortage of time. We have to \ndecide what are the most important things that need to be done during \nthat time. It seems to me they are fairly clear.\n  I hope we will address those things. Homeland defense has been on the \nfloor for 4 weeks now. It is one that, obviously, is necessary. I don't \nthink there is a soul here who believes we ought not to be doing that. \nWe have argued about governmental employee unions. Certainly, the \nhighest priority of this administration, and I think for the Congress, \nwould be to put into place a homeland defense program, which we have \nbefore us.\n  The Iraq resolution apparently is coming to the floor, hopefully \ntomorrow, to be discussed a rather short time. It is very obvious that \nneeds to be done.\n  We have passed no appropriations this year. We are supposed to have \nbeen finished with appropriations. Today, we start a new fiscal year--\nwithout the passage of any appropriations bills. Obviously, we plan to \ngo with a continuing resolution for most of them, but we cannot do that \nfor Defense or military construction. We have to decide those as \npriorities. Then we have to have a continuing resolution to carry on \nGovernment operations until sometime in the future--whether it is a \nNovember return, December, January or February, whatever. That has to \nbe done and, I hope, in a clean way that allows us to move forward with \nattaching a great many things to it.\n  So that is where we are. Certainly, we are all aware of the necessity \nof accomplishing those things in a reasonably short time we have in \nwhich to do that. So I urge the leadership and all of us to try to \ndecide how we handle those things and do them as quickly as we can, so \nwe will be able to leave here when the time comes. These things must be \ndone in the meantime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9655-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9655-S9657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP'S ATTACK ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S FISCAL POLICIES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to respond to what has been a \ncoordinated attack by the Democratic leadership on President Bush. This \ndrumbeat, as we all know, started a couple of weeks ago. Our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Daschle, took the lead on a \nSenate floor speech to question the leadership of President Bush. He \nwas joined by others in the Democratic leadership who pummeled the \nPresident and used many colorful charts and other props to make their \npoints. I was tempted to respond at that time, but, as you know, the \nSenate has been in debate on homeland security, so I didn't have an \nopportunity at that time.\n  It is probably good to reflect upon what was said 2 weeks ago and \nremind the public once again. The attack basically blamed the President \nfor all that ails our economy. There was an article in the Wall Street \nJournal, dated September 18 of this year, the day the attacks started, \nsummarizing the strategy of the other party and the substance of their \narguments. I will put that article in the Record. I will quote from it:\n\n       In a Senate floor speech he plans to make following the \n     breakfast meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Daschle . . . expected \n     to say the President's policies are responsible for U.S. job \n     losses, weak economy, declining business investment, \n     shrinking retirement accounts, an erosion of consumer \n     confidence, rising health care costs, vanishing budget \n     surpluses and record executive pay.\n\n  Indeed, we have seen our Democratic friends on several occasions use \ncharts with the listing referenced in the article. Let me be clear on \nthe attack because this kind of summarizes the various issues I am \ngoing to address. According to the Democratic leadership, the \nPresident's policies are the cause of job losses, weak economic growth, \ndeclining business investment, shrinking retirement accounts, an \nerosion in consumer confidence, rising health care costs, vanishing \nbudget surpluses, and record executive pay--meaning record executive \npay in the private sector.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, that is an awesome amount of power \nthat has been attributed to one individual--the President of the United \nStates. But there is a little bit of irony here. The distinguished \nmajority leader ascribes so much power to the President you could \nalmost make the public believe the President is a king. Maybe this much \npower makes the President an emperor. Now, how many times have we heard \nanother Democrat--the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd--pull his Constitution out of his pocket and \nsay the President is not a king. So who is right? Is it Senator \nDaschle, who has made the President such an imperial figure, or is it \nSenator Byrd, who says the President is not a king?\n  I think we need to work through this. My view is reality and history \nfavor Senator Byrd's point of view that the President is only the \nPresident of the United States and not an imperial power.\n  So I want to go through the Democratic leadership's attack point by \npoint. According to Senator Daschle, the President singlehandedly fired \nmillions of workers. Funny, Mr. President, I thought employers laid off \nworkers, not the President of the United States. It seems to me the \nPresident can fire political appointees, such as White House staff, but \nI don't think he can even fire Federal workers in America. Heck, right \nnow we are hung up on the homeland security debate. That is a fight \nover the extent of the President's powers with respect to Federal \nworkers in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The next charge, Mr. President. All by himself, the President has \nslowed economic growth. Funny, I thought we had a global economic \ndownturn, we had war on terrorism, we had overcapacity in telecom, and \nwe had a bubble in the stock market during the Clinton years. These \nthings might have had something to do with it--but not acccording to \nSenator Daschle. No.\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\nUnder the Democratic leadership's theory, all of these things are the \nfault of the President of the United States.\n  A third charge. Declining business investment is all George W. Bush's \nfault under the Daschle theory as well. Funny, I thought businesses \nmade investment decisions, not the President of the United States. \nActually, we had a stimulus package pushed by the President. Well, that \nhasn't had any effect, according to Democratic leadership. I guess the \nbusiness cycle doesn't exist under Daschle economics.\n  The fourth charge. Democratic leaders blame recent decline in 401(k) \naccounts all on President Bush. Senator Daschle seems fixated on recent \nstock market decline. I have a lot of concern myself.\n  The Democratic leadership, however, seems very obsessed with \nassigning blame. By contrast, folks in the heartland, such as my State \nof Iowa, tell me they want us to look forward and do something. They do \nnot want a bunch of political fingerpointing.\n  If we look forward, we see some very good issues in the area of \nretirement security. In fact, last year's bipartisan tax relief bill \ncontained the largest expansion of tax incentives for retirement \nsecurity in a whole generation. There is $50 billion in new incentives. \nI guess Senator Daschle's opposition to the largest increase in IRA and \n401(k) account contributions in last year's tax bill does not make a \nbit of difference; it just does not matter. While some may want to find \nfault, constructive legislators can point to bipartisan initiatives on \nretirement security that workers can look forward to in the future.\n  Why scare workers? Why whip up anger? Why not work together? Why not \nrecognize some good we do around here, such as the retirement security \npackage that phases in as part of the bipartisan tax relief \nlegislation?\n  Why not bring up the bipartisan Finance Committee pension bill which \nhas been on the calendar for the last 3 months? I introduced it only \nthis year as a consensus document, and the Finance Committee approved \nit. Let's get out of the partisan blame game and do some bipartisan \nwork for the benefit of our workers. Let's build on what we did last \nyear.\n  The fifth charge: Senator Daschle blames an erosion in consumer \nconfidence all on President Bush. Funny, it seems to me that the \nPresident, although being a very important leader, cannot stimulate \nconsumer confidence all by himself. What he can do is propose to return \nmore taxpayers' money to the taxpayers so they have a brighter future. \nAs policymakers in a time of slackening demand, we hope consumers will \nspend the extra tax dollars that were left in their pockets by this tax \nbill.\n  So the Bush tax cut, the largest tax cut in a whole generation, with \nchecks to every taxpayer, which the Democratic leadership opposed, had \na negative effect on consumer confidence? Give me a break. But that is \nthe charge Senator Daschle has made. More money to spend for every \nAmerican on their needs negatively affects their confidence? That is \nthe charge.\n  It goes to tell you, this makes no sense. In the parlance of a \nhunter, that dog does not hunt.\n  The sixth charge: The Democratic leadership says rising health care \ncosts are all the fault of the President. Funny, the last time I \nchecked, the President of the United States was not a physician. He is \nnot a nurse. He is not an insurance company executive. He is not a \npharmaceutical executive. He is not a trial lawyer who sues physicians, \nnurses, and hospitals. The President of the United States does not send \nyou a health care bill. But none of that matters. It just does not \nmatter. No, ignore market dynamics and other conditions. According to \nDaschle economics, the President all by himself is responsible for \nthese rising health care costs.\n  The seventh charge: Vanishing budget surpluses are all the \nPresident's fault, according to Senator Daschle. According to the \nDemocratic leadership, their spending demands have never fit into the \nledger. The recession does not matter. The money for rebuilding New \nYork after September 11 does not matter. Bailing out airlines has no \nconsequences on the budget, or fighting the war in Afghanistan and the \nwar on terrorism have no consequences. These are all unanticipated \nbipartisan responses to unexpected events, and all that does not \nmatter.\n\n  No, under Daschle economics, it is all the fault of President Bush. \nJust plain and simple, it is the President's fault.\n  Fairminded folks back home know it is not that plain. They know it is \nnot that simple. And the folks in the heartland of America are right. I \nwill get back to that in just a minute. I want to go to the eighth and \nfinal charge. And hold on to your hat. This one is pretty amazing.\n  According to the Democratic leadership, record executive pay is all \nthe President's fault. Apparently, Senator Daschle thinks the President \nvotes every share, controls every board of every corporation that has \nsuffered from excessive executive pay. So folks such as Terry \nMcAuliffe, the Democratic National Committee chairman who profited from \ninsider deals, are somehow not accountable for their own actions. The \nboards of directors do not matter, according to Daschle economics.\n  Oh, and there is another thing. Just ignore the fact that a lot of \nthese sweetheart insider deals occurred long before President Bush was \never sworn in on January 20, 2001. Do not let that little fact get in \nthe way of the debate.\n  How can anyone take that charge seriously, that the President of the \nUnited States is responsible for excessive executive pay of \ncorporations? The President no more sets executive pay than you or I \ndo, Mr. President. It is true that we can affect how executive pay is \ntaxed, or disclosure, but we do not decide the level of that pay.\n  Let's be clear: Either the President is an imperial figure or the \ncharges made by the Democratic leadership are without merit. Both \ncannot be true in a modern global economy.\n  I will take a few minutes to talk specifically about the bipartisan \ntax relief package enacted last year. Despite the-sky-is-falling \npartisan opposition during the tax debate last year, the passage of \ntime tells a very different story and it discounts the fictitious \npicture of doom and gloom portrayed last year by my big-spending \nfriends, most on the other side of the aisle.\n  According to revised economic data released by the Federal Government \nin August, the economy started to falter earlier than previously \nbelieved. The figures from economists show that the economy started \nnegative growth as early as January 2001, 20 days before President Bush \nwas sworn in. This proves the economy needed a shot in the arm sooner \nrather than later to get things rolling again; quite frankly, even more \nso than we thought at the time we passed the tax bill.\n  What is more, the primary weakness causing the economy to sputter was \nlackluster business investment, not a waning of personal consumption \nand the expenditure by our consumers.\n  Clearly, the job-creating machine in America needed a tuneup, and \nthat is just what the President set out to do when he took his oath of \noffice. As a cornerstone of his campaign for the White House, the \nPresident made good on his pledge to return more hard-earned money to \nthe working men and women of America.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee at that time, I had \nthe privilege of steering through Congress the largest Federal income \ntax cut in a generation.\n  The best way to grow the economy is not by growing Government, it is \nby allowing the industrious people of the United States to manage their \nown income.\n  Reducing marginal tax rates on income and investment was exactly the \nright policy prescription to cure sluggish business investments and \nprime the pumps that enable American entrepreneurs, small business \nowners, manufacturers, and corporate employers to grow the economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  It was the right policy. We thought so at the time. History now, \nlearning that the recession started on January 1, 2001, and not in the \nfall 2001, as we had anticipated, it was absolutely the right policy to \ndo. And we are fortunate it came along at the time it did, in the \nmiddle of that recession.\n  Letting workers, investors, entrepreneurs, employers, families, and \nretirees keep more of their money unleashes chain reaction because they \nspend two-thirds of the economy. They save it--not enough of our \neconomy. They invest it--probably not enough of\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\nour economy. But they open small businesses, creating jobs; they pay \nhigher wages, or they buy a house, upgrade manufacturing equipment, pay \nfor higher education. The list goes on.\n  It is a fundamental principle that policymakers need to remember. \nMoney recycled through Washington does not squeeze the most bang out of \nour almighty dollar, and yet plenty of critics continue to blame the \nRepublican tax cut rather than the bipartisan tax cut for the Federal \nbudget shortfall. This was a bipartisan tax bill because one-quarter of \nthe Democratic caucus in the Senate voted for the tax cuts. In an \nelection year, too many candidates still like to divide the American \nelectorate, and they do that in the demagogic way of pitting the rich \nagainst everyone else.\n  I am sure voters will get their fill of statistics claiming that the \nBush tax cut hands out 40 percent of the benefit to the top 1 percent \nof the taxpayers. This is not merely misleading, it is outright false. \nSome folks must be under the impression that as long as something is \nrepeated often enough, it will become true. That was how Adolf Hitler \ngot to the top.\n  The facts certainly are thorny little details for the critics of the \nbipartisan tax relief package. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, Congress's official nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Federal Tax \nCode became more progressive with the tax relief package passed in \nCongress last year, and taxpayers in the lower to middle income \nbrackets get the biggest break.\n  For example, taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 will \nsee their taxes reduced almost 14 percent when the tax cut takes full \neffect, whereas taxpayers with over $200,000 a year in income will see \ntheir taxes reduced by a mere 6 percent compared to that 14 percent.\n  As for the budget, the bipartisan tax cut was a minimal factor in the \nFederal Government's surplus to deficit situation. In its first year, \nthe tax cut accounted for just 8 percent of the shortfall. Indeed, \nincreased spending outpaced tax cuts by $6 billion. In other words, \nCongress spent $6 billion more than the taxpayers got back in their \npocket from the tax bill.\n  Over the long term, the 10-year surplus declines from $5.6 trillion \nto $300 billion. The tax cut represents 33 percent of the decline. \nThose who are looking to lay blame need to point their fingers then at \nCongress's appetite to spend. Folks who decry the tax cut should \ninstead weep for the hard-working taxpayer because of the bite that \nUncle Sam takes out of their paychecks.\n\n  The Bush tax cut saved Iowa households $752, on average, in its first \nyear. So I ask Iowans if they can't use that money and if that money \nprobably has not been put to good use, now that the economy has slowed, \nto keep the economy out of recession once again.\n  Even with that tax cut, the Federal Government takes 19 cents out of \nevery dollar earned. That is a record burden, higher than any decade \nsince World War II. So thanks in part to the bipartisan tax cut enacted \nin the summer of 2001, things are starting to turn around. Weaknesses \npersist in the manufacturing and employment sectors, but regardless, \nthe U.S. economy is as resilient as the spirit of the American people.\n  Lowering the tax burden in America triggers growth, creates jobs, \nspreads economic opportunity. Plus, tax cut opponents need to be \nreminded that a bigger economic pie will dish up a bigger slice of \nrevenue to fulfill the Government's needs and priorities, including \nwhat is a result of the war on terrorism and the need for homeland \nsecurity.\n  As the top Republican on the Senate tax-writing committee, I will \ncontinue to champion progrowth economic policies. That includes making \nlast year's tax cuts a permanent part of the Tax Code.\n  We have, as I am told, maybe just a handful of days between now and \nthe end of the session. There are a lot of bipartisan measures that are \non the agenda that are going to be left undone because we have wasted \nthe whole month of September not wanting to vote on a lot of critical \nissues.\n  We have the Enron-induced 401(k) refinements so that workers can \ncontrol their own 401(k). We have prescription drugs for senior \ncitizens on the agenda. We have the bipartisan approach to recapturing \nlost corporate tax revenue because corporations overseas set up shell \ncorporations to avoid tax policy. We have welfare reform that needs to \nbe reauthorized. We can go on and on.\n  Not just economic policy but the management of the Senate needs to be \nan issue in this election because with so much left undone on the \nSenate calendar that is bipartisan, there is no excuse for that not \nhaving been done because somebody does not want to take some hard \npolitical votes between now and the election that could have moved the \nInterior appropriations bill and homeland security along very quickly.\n  Management of the Senate is a very important issue in this upcoming \nelection based upon what is left on the calendar's unfinished business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9657-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9657-S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about hard-working \nAmericans, their needs in our current economy, and the kind of \nobligations we owe to one another.\n  I have the greatest respect for the ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee. Senator Grassley is an extraordinarily effective advocate \nand Senator on behalf not only of the people from Iowa he represents \nbut on behalf of Americans. Of course, we have a difference of opinion \nabout what is the best thing to do to get the economy going, to start \ncreating jobs, to put people back to work, and to make sure that the \neconomic prospects are bright for our young people. That is an honest \ndisagreement, but there could be no disagreement that we do, \nunfortunately, at this moment have what is called a jobless recovery.\n  That is half right. I think the jobless part is right. I think the \nrecovery part is a bit of a stretch. Unfortunately, many hard-working \nAmericans, from New York City to Des Moines to San Francisco, have been \nunemployed through no fault of their own but through the downturn in \nthe economy, through the economic impacts of the disastrous and \nhorrible terrorist attacks we suffered. I think we owe something to \nthese hard-working Americans. Every other Congress, every other \nadministration, has recognized that obligation.\n  When you do what you are supposed to, when you get up, you go to your \njob, and you do what you are asked to do to get the paycheck at the end \nof the week to support yourself and your family, that is what we want \nfor all Americans. The goal of our economic policy in this wonderful \nfree enterprise society that we cherish is to create enough jobs so \neveryone who is willing to work can work.\n  Unfortunately, we now have rising unemployment, and 1.2 million \nAmericans have exhausted the safety net that has always been there for \npeople who lose their jobs. That is called unemployment insurance. \nBelieve me, no one I know wants to be on unemployment insurance instead \nof having a job. It does not provide enough benefits. It does not take \nyou anywhere. It is the dead end of all dead ends, but it does provide \nsubsistence support for you and your family. I have been talking with \nso many of the Americans, especially New Yorkers, who are unemployed. \nThat is what they tell me. They have been looking for work.\n  The economy of the 1990s has receded. There are not enough jobs for \nthe people who are looking for work. Many have told me heartbreaking \nstories of going to job fairs, of walking the streets, of answering \nevery ad they can find, of absolutely making a nuisance of themselves \nto try to find some job opening to get working again. Unfortunately, \nthere are not enough jobs right now.\n  We have an honest disagreement in this Chamber about the best way to \nstart creating jobs again. It will not surprise my colleagues that I \ncome from the Clinton school of economics. We need a balanced approach. \nStimulate the economy, have targeted tax cuts, pay down the debt, and \nmake investments that will lead to our Nation being richer, safer, \nsmarter, and stronger.\n  The administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave a different theory. Evidence does count for something. The \nevidence is on our side, not their side. Eventually\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\nthey will get around to recognizing that and we will go back to a \nsensible economic policy. In the meantime, honest, hard-working \nAmericans should not bear the brunt for bad economic policies. They \nshould not bear the brunt because the administration does not have an \neconomic plan. We need to help them. We have the means to do so. We \nshould act immediately.\n  Around the country the headlines read: ``Prospects for Work Fade with \nEconomy,'' ``Jobless Recovery,'' ``Help is Needed on the Home Front,'' \n``The Jobless Need the Helping Hand of Congress and the President.''\n  In addition to no jobs for honest, hard-working people looking for \njobs, the poverty rate has gone back up. For the first time in 8 years, \nthe poverty rate increased by 1.3 million people. For families, that \nnumber increased by almost half a million. For the first time since \n1991 the median household income dropped by 2.2 percent. The DOW has \nhad its worst September since 1937. The number of Americans who no \nlonger have health insurance has increased by 1.4 million.\n  How much more of a wakeup call do we need to penetrate the fog of \nideology that sits over this Capitol? How much more information and \nevidence do we require to admit we have millions of Americans who are \nunemployed, on the brink of financial ruin because we are not giving \nthem a helping hand? We can take steps right now to extend unemployment \ninsurance. It may seem like a small step to some who are not \nunemployed. That is always the problem. We are sitting here with a \ncushy job, and we hear of people who do not have work, thinking good \nluck to them. That is inexcusable. Those fortunate enough to have a job \nto count on during a jobless recovery know there are a lot of people \n``there but for the grace of God go us.'' We should be there with a \nhelping hand. It is not right to ignore their plight any longer.\n\n  Many Americans are exhausting all of their unemployment benefits. \nThat is understandable; we only extended it for 13 weeks. I keep \nthinking of the contrast between the recession of the early 1990s and \nthis recession. In the early 1990s, former President Bush extended \nunemployment three times. And then President Clinton extended it twice \nuntil the economy began picking up and jobs began to be available \nagain. I don't think we need to look any further than our own history \nof the past 10 years.\n  When times get tough and people cannot find work because the economy \nis not creating jobs, that is what unemployment insurance is for. It is \nnot only the right thing to do, it is also smart. It provides a direct \nstimulus into our economy. Every dollar we spend on unemployment \ninsurance generates $2.15 in our gross domestic product. It puts into \nthe hands of people who will spend that money immediately the means to \npay their rent, to buy the food, to buy the school books, to pay the \nmortgage, to pay the car payment.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that Americans are the hardest \nworking people in the world. We do not take vacations like the rest of \nthe developed world. We work longer hours. Some of us take more than \none job in order to get ahead. It is the story of America. It is a \ngreat story. It is filled with optimism. It rests on the bedrock belief \nthat hard work will pay off.\n  Sometimes, through no fault of someone, something terrible happens, \nsomething unforeseen happens. A CEO of a major corporation starts \nlooting the corporation to have a $100 million house or a $30 million \nboat. All of a sudden people are down the drain: Their jobs, their \nincome, their pensions, their retirement security. They are unemployed. \nSometimes the worst happens and the waiters and waitresses and janitors \nand maintenance people who got up every day and for years went to work \nat the World Trade Center see not just their jobs but their friends' \nlives and literally the buildings in which they work collapse.\n  I am hoping we will extend benefits once again. We have only done it \nonce. We have the money in the fund to pay for the right thing and the \nsmart thing. We need to do it because so many of our unemployed will \nrun out of benefits completely by the end of December. I am hoping this \nCongress will act to extend unemployment insurance and disaster \nunemployment assistance for an additional 13 weeks for all States and \n20 weeks for States such as New York that are suffering from high \nunemployment, much of it directly related to the attacks we also \nsuffered. I don't think we should take another day. We should send a \nclear message that we care about the working men and women of this \ncountry. We care about their families. We are going to try to help them \nget back on their feet. We will give them the help they deserve because \nthey paid into this fund. We just have to pull the trigger so it goes \nout to them in their time of need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9658-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9658-S9659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with some interest to the \nSenator from New York and I have some comments to make which I hope \nwill clearly set the record in some areas.\n  She referred to the jobless recovery in which we find ourselves. This \nis exactly parallel to the jobless recovery that occurred in the early \n1990s as we came out of the recession that started in 1990, and the \nrecovery started in 1991. There was a period when the Congress was \nconcerned about the fact that we were recovering, but not enough jobs \nwere created. That is fairly typical of a recovery.\n  The present recovery is no different in that regard.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield for a comment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is correct, we had a jobless recovery in \nthe early 1990s, and a jobless recovery in the early part of this new \ncentury. In the early jobless recovery of the early 1990s, the first \nPresident Bush extended unemployment benefits three times. Is it the \nposition of the Senator that this job of recovery means it is so \ndifferent we shouldn't extend the same helping hand the President did \nin the early nineties to those who lost their jobs then?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have not gotten to the issue of extending \nunemployment. I have no particular objection to extending unemployment. \nI am trying to set the record straight about some of the statistics \nthat are being quoted.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for his lack of objection, and I \nhope it transforms into support for extending unemployment insurance.\n  Mr. BENNETT. When the bill comes to the floor of the Senate, I will \nbe happy to give it consideration, and I see no reason at the moment \nwhy I should oppose it.\n  The Senator commented on unemployment rising. The fact is the \nunemployment rate is falling. The unemployment rate hit its high in the \ncircumstance of 6 percent and starting to come down in August. It was \n5.7 percent. We do not have the September numbers yet.\n  I remember being taught in economics if we were at 6 percent \nunemployment, we were at full employment. The assumption was the \neconomy could not absorb more jobs than that without going into \ninflation. We have proven that is not the case.\n  But to panic because unemployment hits 6 percent and is now falling \nand to say we are not in recovery is, frankly, not accurate. We are in \na recovery. However slow it may be, however sluggish it may be, it is a \ngenuine recovery, and we should not panic everybody into believing we \nare on the verge of a double dip or a major recurrence of recession.\n  Personal income was unchanged in July and rose in August. The Senator \nsaid personal income was falling. Again, that is not sustained by the \nactual numbers. Personal income is rising, and the recovery is stronger \nthan the Senator from New York would have us believe.\n  I spoke on this issue yesterday, and pointed out we were in a \nrecovery which began in the fourth quarter of 2001 when the gross \ndomestic product rose at 2.7 percent. From the first quarter of this \nyear, gross domestic product rose at 5 percent. Previous figures for \nthe second quarter of this year indicate the gross domestic product was \nrising at 1.1 percent. Those figures have now been revised. They have \nbeen revised upward.\n\n[[Page S9659]]\n\n  Looking back over it, we are now told the recovery continued in the \nsecond quarter with gross domestic product rising at 1.3 instead of \n1.1, and the blue-chip forecast which said in the current quarter--the \nthird quarter--we would see gross domestic product rising at 2.7, the \nsame rate it did in the fourth quarter of last year, that those figures \nare low; that, in fact, the forecast now is the third quarter of this \nyear will see gross domestic product numbers closer to 3 percent \ninstead of 2.7 as previously forecast.\n  I don't expect anyone to remember all of these numbers I recite. I \nhope they will remember that the general trend is up and is more \nencouraging than the Senator from New York and others would lead us to \nbelieve.\n  We keep being told we are in a period of great distress and disaster, \nand we must do something and do something drastic about it. One of the \nthings that is proposed is we must postpone the effect of the tax cut \nthat was passed by wide margins--both in this body and the other body--\nat the beginning of the Bush Presidency.\n  I want to discuss that for just a moment. It has been framed with the \nsame kind of statistical maneuvering I have tried to address here. The \nquestion that makes for a good headline in a political stump speech is \nwho lost the surplus? They are talking about a $5.6 trillion surplus \nthat was projected at the time we had the tax cut debate. That surplus \nhas now disappeared in the projections that were being made, and we are \nbeing asked again and again, Who lost the surplus?\n  The first point I want to make on that score is the surplus never \nexisted. The surplus was a projection. I can take the Nation back \nthrough every projection made by the CBO; before that by the Office of \nManagement and Budget; before the Congressional Budget Office was \ncreated, by the old Bureau of Budget; and before the Office of \nManagement and Budget was created, and demonstrate virtually every \nprojection of surplus or deficit made by those entities has always been \nwrong. Sometimes it has been wrong on the high side. Sometimes it has \nbeen wrong on the low side. But the one consistency is every project, \nsurplus, or deficit in future years has always been wrong.\n  It comes as no surprise to discover the projection of the $5.6 \ntrillion surplus was wrong in this case as well.\n  I remember a discussion with Alan Greenspan when he was before the \nBanking Committee, or perhaps the Joint Economic Committee. I sit on \nboth, and he testifies before both. Someone asked him about the \nprojections that were being given to us at the time with great \nconfidence. They said, Mr. Chairman, how likely is it this projection \nwill be realized? He said it will not be realized. This projection will \nbe wrong. He said I cannot tell you whether it will be wrong on the \nhigh side or the low side. I cannot tell you and neither can any other \neconomist tell you whether we will reap the benefits of the new age \neconomy to a degree far greater than demonstrated by this projection or \nwhether we will fall on our face and come in flat.\n  The problem is--I am not now quoting Greenspan--with an economy doing \nsomething like $11 trillion a year and subject to the uncertainties of \nthe business cycle as well as the outside shocks that can occur in this \nworld, no one can look 10 years into a crystal ball and tell you with \nabsolute certainty what is going to happen.\n  I find it interesting that those who insist the loss of the $5.6 \ntrillion surplus is due to the Bush tax cut and solely to the Bush tax \ncut also say to us why don't we deal with our current economic problems \nby postponing the effective date of the Bush tax cut? And, after all, \nthat is going to take place in the outyears, anyway. So postponing the \neffective date will have no particular impact short term.\n  All right. Hold onto that argument for just a minute and listen to \nthe other argument that we are being told.\n  We are being told it was the Bush tax cut that blew the hole into the \nsurplus. Wait a minute. If the impact of the Bush tax cut is going to \ncome in later years so it can be postponed without making any \ndifference, how could it have been the primary mover in creating the \ndeficit right now? Well, I can tell you how. I was part of the \ndiscussions as we crafted the tax cut. Democrats said to us at the time \nthe tax cut was being considered it would have to have an immediate \nimpact. We have to put money in the hands of people right now. We can't \nwait for the tax cut impact in the outyears.\n  The proposal was made primarily from the Democratic side of the aisle \nthat in addition to cutting the marginal rates for taxes there be an \nimmediate rebate, $300 per taxpayer, right away. That was not part of \nthe original Bush proposal. That came out of Democratic proposals. And, \nfrankly, it seemed like a good idea. The Bush administration embraced \nit. We have a combination of cutting the marginal tax rates over a \nperiod of time into the future and a rebate to get money into the hands \nof the economy and into the hands of people right away.\n  If, indeed, it was the tax cut that destroyed the surplus right away, \nit was the rebate side of the tax cut that was proposed by Members of \nthe Democratic party and endorsed certainly by me and other Members of \nthe Republican party.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say postponing the effective \ndate of the tax cut won't affect the present situation. You cannot say \nthere was an immediate impact which was bad and then say our proposal \nwill have no immediate impact and that is good. This debate has gotten \nsomewhat into Alice in Wonderland. I hope we can stay with the facts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend from Utah--and he is my friend; I \nthink the world of him--has a unique argument: Who lost the surplus? I \nnever heard that until he talked about it. I think we all know who lost \nthe surplus. He never answered that question.\n  And then the unique observation is: It never existed. We never had a \nsurplus.\n  Talk about Alice in Wonderland. About a month ago--actually it was in \nAugust--I went on a family vacation. I had not read ``Alice in \nWonderland'' for a long time. I read ``Alice in Wonderland,'' and there \nare a lot of strange things that go on in that little girl's life when \nshe takes this strange odyssey.\n  But part of that is, as the Senator from Utah mentioned, Alice in \nWonderland, because the statements he has just made really are--I say \nthis respectfully--illogical and illusionary. They simply do not exist.\n  The fact is we have, in the Bush economic record, weak economic \ngrowth, record job loss, declining business investment, a falling stock \nmarket, shrinking retirement accounts, eroding consumer confidence, \nrising health care costs, escalating foreclosures, vanishing surpluses, \nhigher interest costs, raiding Social Security, record executive pay, \nand stagnating minimum wage.\n  In the Bush world, everything that should be up is down, and \neverything that should be down is up. Job losses should be down; they \nare up. Health care costs should be down; they are up. Foreclosures \nshould be down; they are up. The national debt should be down; it is \nup. Federal interest costs should be up; they are down. The Social \nSecurity trust, we should not be raiding it. In fact, we are doing just \nthe opposite of what we should be doing.\n  Those things that should be going up in the Bush economic plan are \ngoing down: economic growth, going down; business investment, going \ndown; the stock market, going down; retirement accounts, going down; \nconsumer confidence, going down; minimum wage, going down. Everything \nyou would think should be up economically is down.\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n  They have things reversed.\n  For someone to come on this floor and tell people we are in the midst \nof a recovery? Come on. We are in the midst of a recovery? I talked to \nSenator John Kerry today. He indicated that a company in Massachusetts \nis laying off, I think he said, 9,000 or 10,000 people today. That is \neconomic recovery? Last week we had all these layoffs taking place with \na phone company where they laid off 14,000 people.\n  More than 2 million jobs have been lost in 18 months. That is \neconomic recovery? We have the weakest economic growth in 50 years. \nThat is economic recovery? Business investment was down each of the \nlast six quarters; the weakest trend in 50 years. That is economic \nrecovery?\n\n  There has been $4.5 trillion of lost stock market wealth; the \nsharpest decline since President Hoover was President of the United \nStates in the early 1930s; $440 billion of lost 401(k) and IRA \nretirement savings in the last year. That is economic recovery?\n  The Nasdaq Stock Exchange is down to its lowest level in 6 or 7 \nyears; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down drastically and still \ngoing down; the poverty rate up for the first time since 1992.\n  Let's at least talk realism. We are not in an economic recovery. We \nhave to address the economy, as Congress should. We are not doing that. \nWe are focusing on only Iraq. I have no problem with focusing on Iraq, \nbut we can do more than one thing. This is the beginning of the fifth \nweek since we came back after the August recess, and we have not done a \nsingle thing to address the staggering, faltering, stumbling economy.\n  Mr. President, was my unanimous consent request granted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the state of our economy is causing \ngreat concern. The experts may tell us the recession is officially \nover, but that is cold comfort to many Americans.\n  Last week, we got some startling new numbers on the pain being felt \nby working families. The income of middle-class families fell for the \nfirst time since the last recession. And for the first time in 12 \nyears, our national poverty rate grew. Today, almost 33 million \nAmericans live below the poverty line.\n  The stock market is also reflecting the uncertainty Americans feel. \nYesterday, the market finished its worst quarter since 1987. The Dow \nJones lost nearly 1,200 points in the last month, and the Nasdaq just \nhit a 6-year low.\n  These losses are more than numbers. They are a crushing reality for \nfar too many Americans who are working hard to save for their \nretirement.\n  The recent declines are especially painful to our seniors who are \nliving off their savings or planned to in the next couple of years.\n  Congress has taken some important steps to address our economic woes. \nIn July, we worked together to pass accounting reform legislation to \nbegin restoring investor confidence. The American people are now \nreceiving accurate information about a company's financial condition.\n  Congress also worked across party lines last spring to enact a \nstimulus package. That legislation provides tax incentives for \nbusinesses to help them grow, invest, and avoid laying off employees.\n  That law also extended unemployment insurance for workers who were \nhit the hardest by the economic slowdown. At that time, we made sure \nworkers who had lost their jobs and exhausted their State employment \ncompensation received an additional 13 weeks of unemployment insurance \nwhile they were looking for jobs.\n\n  It is urgent that Congress act again. Our economic recovery is \ndisappointingly slow.\n  Last quarter, our economy grew at a meager 1.3 percent. Such an \nanemic growth rate means businesses are struggling to stay afloat and \nworkers are struggling to pay their bills.\n  Some have called this a jobless recovery. But there is no recovery \nfor the jobless. Over the last year, my home State of Missouri has lost \nmore than 55,000 jobs in manufacturing and farming.\n  More than 8 million Americans are unemployed today. An alarming \nnumber of unemployed workers have been looking for jobs for more than 6 \nmonths. By the end of the year, more than 2 million workers are \nexpected to exhaust their unemployment compensation.\n  Unemployment benefits are supposed to help tide workers over during \nhard times. It is intended to help them support their families, to help \nthem pay the rent, and put food on the table.\n  Right now our economy is not creating enough jobs for these people to \nget back to work. It will take more time for them to find a job.\n  It is appropriate that we respond to this emergency as we have done \nin the past. In the early 1990s, Congress provided 26 weeks of \nadditional unemployment insurance.\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced last \nweek that will provide the same temporary relief. Our bill will ensure \nthat if a worker cannot find a new job, and if that worker has \ncompletely exhausted the unemployment insurance currently available, \nthen that worker could receive another 13 weeks of assistance.\n  Workers and their families deserve this safety net. Congress cannot \nturn a blind eye to the hardships of jobless men and women, those who \nare hurting in this economy: the hurting, the helpless, and the \nhopeless.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly. The time is running out for too \nmany Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nconsider a bipartisan effort to pass legislation on which Senators \nKennedy, Clinton, and Wellstone have worked so hard. Their leadership \nhas shown it is critical that we pass this legislation now.\n  No other State, probably, needs this legislation more than \nWashington.\n  Washington State is in the middle of an economic crisis resulting \nfrom a downturn in both our aviation and high-tech sectors. With the \njobless rate at 7.2 percent, we are teetering among the highest, if not \nthe highest, unemployment rates in the country.\n  Mr. President, 202,000 Washingtonians are unable to find work. And \nover the last 12 months, our State has lost 50,000 jobs, and 60 percent \nof those are in the high-paying manufacturing sector.\n  Just in the last 2 weeks, Boeing announced it would exceed its \noriginal projections of 30,000 layoffs that it has already carried out.\n  Last month alone, 56,000 unemployed workers of Washington State \nreceived extended unemployment benefits. But all those benefits will \nexpire on December 31, 2002, unless we take the proposal before us \ntoday and pass it into legislation. That means if we don't pass this \nlegislation, those 56,000 workers will not be adding to our State's \ntroubled economy.\n  We can no longer wait because things are not getting better. Our \nState economist Chang Mook Sohn issued a report saying we are not going \nto see a recovery anytime soon and very little growth in the next 6 \nmonths.\n  We understand that unemployment checks are not long-term answers; \njobs are. But while people look for new work, extending unemployment \nbenefits will help unemployed workers make mortgage payments, put food \non the table, pay utility bills, health care bills, and, in my State, \nthe high cost of energy bills.\n  Extending unemployment benefits will give people a new opportunity to \nupgrade their skills. As has been pointed out, extending benefits will \nalso boost our economy, injecting into communities that have already \nbeen strapped with high unemployment rates a little bit of stimulus. A \n1999 Department of Labor study concluded that for every dollar spent on \nunemployment, it generates $2.15 of economic activity. This proposal \nfor Washington State over the next 6 months would mean over $1 billion \nin economic stimulus.\n  The cost of extending this program will be paid by the unemployment \ninsurance trust fund, which has nearly $30 billion in it and is a very \nhealthy account.\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\n  Congress created unemployment insurance in 1935 to help unemployed \nworkers get through the Great Depression. In the 1990s, we expanded \nthat five times and even higher for the States that had high \nunemployment. So far this year, Congress has only done this once.\n  We, in Washington State, need the support of our colleagues and of \nthe White House in dealing with this economic crisis. It is clearly \nimperative that we should pass the Kennedy-Clinton-Wellstone \nlegislation and do so immediately so that as our economy continues to \nstruggle, we bridge the gap with a stimulus and a helping hand to \nworking men and women in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate a \nmajor challenge facing many of the families in my State of \nMassachusetts, and that is the continued escalation of those on the \nunemployment list. We have seen that grow to a figure of 175,000.\n  In Massachusetts, we have the highest number of unemployed workers of \nany of the New England States. Two years ago we had the lowest \nunemployment of any of the States. Now we have the highest, with very \nlittle hope in the future for getting these workers back to work.\n  There has been a reduction in the total number of jobs. We have more \nworkers searching for fewer jobs than at any time in recent history. \nThese are not just figures developed by the Democratic Party. They are \nfigures developed by the Department of Labor: 8.1 million unemployed, \ntrying to fill 3.2 million positions. The disparity between the high \nnumber of unemployed and the available jobs is one of the highest \npercentages of any recent time, and that is true all over this country.\n  The people of my State are wondering how they are going to make ends \nmeet, whether they are going to see the expiration of their \nunemployment compensation.\n  I was here in the early 1990s, when on four to five different \noccasions we had bipartisan support for extension of unemployment \ncompensation.\n  The purpose of unemployment compensation is to reach out a helping \nhand to workers who work hard, play by the rules, are trying to pay a \nmortgage, trying to pay for children's school clothes, and to live a \nsomewhat normal life, but because of the economic exigencies they are \nout of a job.\n  The unemployment fund is now at a surplus of some $25 billion. It was \ndeveloped for just the kinds of reasons we are facing today. We, on \nthis side, believe we ought to have an opportunity to extend \nunemployment compensation to the families of this country thrown out of \nwork through no fault of their own. They ought to be able to at least \nhave this lifeline that will help support them during this difficult \ntime before they are able to get back on their feet.\n  That is the issue. It is one of decency, fairness, and humanity. At \nother times in our history, Republicans and Democrats in this body came \ntogether in order to provide that.\n  Now we are finding the Republican leadership opposing this proposal, \neffectively saying thumbs down to workers in my State, thumb downs to \nworkers all across New England and all across the country. It is the \nwrong policy at the wrong time.\n  I join with my colleagues, with Senator Wellstone, who has been the \nleader in this battle for extended unemployment compensation, and my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Clinton, Senator Carnahan, Senator \nCantwell and others, urging the Senate to take action. We can do it. It \nhas been done in a bipartisan way. It should not be partisan. This is \nabout hard-working Americans. Are we going to reach out with a helping \nhand to make sure their interests are going to be protected?\n  We ask the Senate for consent to provide additional unemployment \nbenefits for millions of out-of-work Americans. I urge my colleagues to \ngive that consent.\n  Over 2 million Americans who have lost their jobs are about to also \nlose their unemployment benefits. The Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation Act of 2002 will extend their benefits just as we have \nevery recession over the past three decades. Families are struggling, \nand we must act.\n  In fact, since President Bush assumed office in January 2001, the \neconomic well-being of America's families has dramatically \ndeteriorated. This is not just an economic coincidence, it is the \nresult of the economic policies of this administration--policies which \nneglect the basic needs of working men and women, lavish extravagant \ntax breaks on the wealthiest taxpayers, and allow corporate abuse and \nexcess to go unchecked.\n  President Bush says he has already taken care of the troubled economy \nby cutting taxes and, instead of supporting our bill, called on \nCongress to make the tax cuts permanent.\n  There are now 8.1 million unemployed Americans, 2.2 million more than \nwhen President Bush took office. And no amount of tax cuts for the \nwealthy can restore their jobs and pay their bills.\n  But this is deja vu all over again. The first President Bush twice \nblocked legislation to provide much-needed unemployment benefits before \nfinally signing into law three benefit extensions. In this recession, \n800,000 more workers are expected to run out of unemployment benefits \nthan in the last recession during the early 1990s. It will only get \nworse if we don't act.\n  Last March, Congress extended benefits for the first and only time \nduring this recession. That is not enough. Already, more than 1 million \nworkers have exhausted these benefits without finding a new job, and \nanother 2 million will join their ranks by the end of the year.\n  Most of them have families to support. They are scrimping on school \nsupplies; maxing out credit cards; and juggling electric bills with \nmortgage payments. These are our fellow citizens, and they need help \nnow.\n  We are supporting legislation that mirrors the benefits signed into \nlaw by the first President Bush in the early 1990s. The bill will \nextend benefits for workers in all States, and provide additional \nbenefits for those in high-unemployment States. This bill will ensure \nthat workers can keep a roof over their heads and food on their tables \nwhile they search for jobs in this tight economy.\n  This Bush administration has fought efforts to provide adequate \nunemployment assistance to workers. But the administration can no \nlonger afford to ignore the pain and the needs of struggling families. \nWe must act--and act now--to live up to our obligations to help our \nfellow citizens in their time of need.\n  Alan Gonsenhauser of Northborough, MA, is one of those workers who \nhas exhausted his benefits. Formerly the vice president of a consulting \nfirm whose largest client was Enron, he was laid off last December. \nNine months later, he is still looking for a job. He, his wife, and \ntheir two children have relied on unemployment benefits and personal \nsavings to cover family expenses, but his benefits expired last month.\n\n  Many hard-working Americans and their families have suffered as a \nresult of the recent spate of corporate scandals and the failure of the \nadministration to take decisive action. At WorldCom, more than 20,000 \nworkers were laid off. At Arthur Andersen, 7,000 workers were laid off. \nAt Global Crossing, over 9,000 workers were laid off. Enron laid off \nabout 4,000 workers.\n  Americans who are out of work are watching their savings shrink while \nthe cost of living just grows and grows. The cost of health insurance \nfor families has risen 16 percent in the last year and a half, and 27 \npercent for single individuals. Even more workers are being forced to \ngo without health insurance. The cost of prescription drugs is going up \nat three times the rate of inflation. Yet this administration \nrepeatedly sides with the health care industry and against working \nfamilies.\n  Families are struggling to pay for college for their children. \nTuition alone at a public 4-year college costs nearly 8 percent more \nthis year than last year--an increase of more than triple the rate of \ninflation. The importance of higher education is increasing but the \nability of middle-class families to pay for it is decreasing.\n  Out-of-work Americans are not only losing their health benefits, they \nare also losing their homes. According to new data from the Mortgage \nBankers Association of America, home foreclosures are at all-time \nhighs. Families who spent years saving to purchase their dream homes \nare now unable to afford to keep them.\n\n[[Page S9662]]\n\n  These are the economic fears which are keeping American workers up at \nnight--losing their job, losing their homes, losing their retirement \nsavings, losing their health care, and paying for college.\n  Millions more of them are kept awake by these fears today than were \n18 months ago. The Bush economy has turned the American dream into a \nnightmare for them.\n  It's time to restore economic security for workers and the Nation. \nDemocrats support extending unemployment benefits, guaranteeing \nretirement security through pension reform, raising the minimum wage, \ninsuring health care for the uninsured, and making prescription drugs \nand college more affordable for millions of Americans. America's \nworking families deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his powerful statement and my colleagues, the \nSenators from New York, Missouri, and Washington State, and others, in \nsupport of the Wellstone unanimous consent request. I know he will \npropound it momentarily. We are waiting for the assistant Republican \nleader to come to the Chamber.\n  In the meantime, I add my voice to those who have spoken this \nmorning. The economic conditions in this country continue to worsen. We \nnow have 2 million jobs that have been lost over the last 20 months. \nThe number of the private sector unemployed has gone up by over 2 \nmillion people. We have seen the number of long-term unemployed go from \nabout 650,000 now to 1.5 million people--those who are unemployed for \nmore than 6 months. We have seen a $4.5 trillion loss in market \ncapitalization. We have seen the number of foreclosures go up at a rate \nhigher than anything in recent years.\n  Over and over, every single indicator points to the fact that this \neconomy continues to worsen. Yet we have an administration that, for \nwhatever reason, chooses to ignore it entirely.\n  The point we make this morning and have made now for some time is \nthat at the very least we ought to be sensitive to those who are the \nvictims of this tragic set of economic circumstances.\n  Felix Batista is one of those people. I heard about Mr. Batista when \nI was in New York in the last couple of days. Felix Batista worked for \nthe World Trade Center for 23 years. After the tragedy of 9/11, Mr. \nBatista was left unemployed. He has yet to find a job more than a year \nlater, in spite of the fact that he was an outstanding employee, that \nhe has family, that he has run out of his unemployment benefits. He has \nno recourse but to continue to plead for help, ask for our \nunderstanding. I don't know whether Mr. Batista is watching this \nmorning, but I am sure if there are those who are unemployed with \naccess to C-SPAN, they have to be wondering, hoping, wishing the Senate \nwould act expeditiously.\n  They didn't have to hope or wait 10 years ago. We went through a \nrecession at that time and we extended unemployment benefits--not once, \nnot twice, but on three occasions. We provided the safety net to those \nwho were unemployed in the long term. We provided some hope, some \nopportunity to have a sense of worth. That is all we are asking, Mr. \nPresident. Give these people a chance. Give them the hope and the real \nopportunity they need to be able to pay their bills, buy groceries, to \nensure that their rent payments are made so they are not evicted in \naddition to being unemployed. So I hope that, at the very least, we can \nextend unemployment benefits again. We have done it before. The need \ncould not be more urgent.\n\n  While we can talk about all the other things we need to do about the \neconomy, there should not be any difference in opinion whatsoever, \nRepublican or Democrat, when it comes to economic security for these \nunemployed workers, these families left with nothing--the Felix \nBatistas of the world, who are good employees, who work hard, who \nexpect at least some understanding for their circumstances now.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota to make his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know the Senator wants to speak on \nthis matter as well. I can do this in a very brief timespan, though I \nthink this is a critically important issue. I thank, as always, my \ncolleague Senator Kennedy for his leadership, along with Senator \nClinton.\n  My State of Minnesota has lost 40,000 jobs in the last 18 months. I \nhave not seen anything like this for a long time. We have 123,000 \nMinnesotans who are officially unemployed, and that doesn't include \npeople who are self-employed, people who work part time, and those \npeople who have become discouraged workers. Right now, unemployed \nworkers in Minnesota are looking for jobs, and they outnumber unfilled \njobs by 2 to 1. This is a serious situation.\n  Look at the reports today about the stock market and the economy. The \ngood thing we did in the 1990s, in a bipartisan way, is that when we \nwere in the earlier years, before President Clinton, in recession, we \nextended the unemployment benefits another 13 weeks. That is exactly \nwhat we are talking about here--the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nAct. It is a bipartisan measure. It is critically important. Basically \nwhat we are saying is that we ought to at least, with this Economic \nSecurity Act, provide an additional 13 weeks of extended benefits for \nworkers who are either running out of benefits and won't even get the \n13 weeks they are due in December or those who have already run out of \nall of their benefits. For those States with high levels of \nunemployment, we are talking about another 20 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Colleagues, this is compassion. This is bipartisan. The economy is \nnot doing well, and the families we represent in our States are not \ndoing well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9662-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9662-S9663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3009\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I need to \nask my colleague a couple of questions.\n  I am sympathetic to granting an extension of unemployment \ncompensation. As the Senator mentioned, we have done it in the past. I \nam not familiar with the Senator's bill. Has the bill been printed yet? \nNot to get in too big a hurry, but is the bill available? My staff said \nmaybe we can find it on the Internet, but I don't believe it has been \nprinted yet.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a copy of the bill that I would be pleased to \ngive to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would appreciate a copy. I would like to look at it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is nothing really complicated about this. We \nhave a lot of people out of work. The economy is not doing well. They \nhave run out of benefits, and they need another 13 weeks.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't think asking a couple of questions is too much \nto ask. Is this a clean 13-week extension in unemployment compensation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is that all it is?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is correct. Although it is 13 weeks, it is \n20 weeks for States with higher levels of unemployment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Back to my question, it is not just a 13-week extension \nof unemployment compensation----\n\n[[Page S9663]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The same way, I say to my colleague, we did it in a \nbipartisan way in the early 1990s, where it was 13 weeks, and for \nStates with higher levels of unemployment, it went to 20 weeks. We have \ndone it before, and we can do it again right now.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will just inform my colleague that I just need to see \nhis bill.\n  One additional question: Has there been a cost estimate? I think I am \nfamiliar with old cost estimates on a clean 13-week extension, but I am \nnot familiar with how much additional the Senator is asking. Does he \nhave a cost estimate on his bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. CBO has not given us an estimate. I think it will be \n$10 billion to $13 billion. If I may say to my colleague for a moment, \nI appreciate his question and what he is talking about, and we will let \nyou read it. But people are flat on their backs. In the case of States \nwith high unemployment, it would be 20 weeks. We have done it before. \nThe CBO estimate--I have given you what I believe it is going to be. I \nam not neutral. We need to do this. We need to take this action.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for my colleagues' information, I have not seen his \nbill. I understand from staff it was introduced on Thursday, but it has \nnot been printed yet. I would appreciate a copy of the bill. We would \nlike to review it and see what it is. I will work with my colleague and \nmy friend from Oregon, who I know is interested in the bill as well. We \nhave other colleagues who are also interested in passing some extension \nof unemployment. Whether it goes beyond the 13 weeks or not needs to be \ndiscussed. There are Democrats and Republicans--other Senators--besides \njust a couple who want to address this issue.\n  At this point, I will object. But I will tell my colleague that I \nwill work with all interested Senators to see if we can pass some form \nof unemployment compensation extension before we adjourn in the next \nweek or so. We at least need to see the bill. This idea of having a \nbill introduced on Thursday and not printed in the Record yet, and then \nwanting to pass it on Tuesday, without other people looking at it, I \nthink is premature. So at this point I shall object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I may say to my colleague from \nOklahoma, I appreciate what I heard and his willingness to move \nforward. I can guarantee him that he will have the bill in a matter of \nseconds, lest we harp on the complexity of all of this to the point \nwhere it becomes a reason for not taking action; it is very simple and \nstraightforward, as I have defined. We have done this before in a \nbipartisan way. God knows, there is not one Senator in here who doesn't \nunderstand the economy in their State. We can take prompt action right \naway, and for people out of work in Minnesota and around the country, \nthey need this. We are pleased to do this. We will come back to the \nfloor ASAP and pass it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, all time remaining under morning \nbusiness belongs to the minority.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. The minority has how \nmuch time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of people who wish to \nspeak. We are told we are not going to be able, even though we are \ngoing forward for the fifth time, to invoke cloture. I do not think on \nour side we need all that time. Each side has a half hour. While my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, is in the Chamber, I \nam wondering if we can have 15 minutes on our side for Senator \nLieberman to talk about cloture, and the other 15 minutes would be for \nmorning business because Senator Kennedy has been here all morning \nwishing to speak, Senator Sarbanes is here, and Senator Durbin has \nshown up.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent we have the vote at 12:15 p.m. \nrather than 12 o'clock, and that the time be apportioned accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the vote was originally scheduled for 12 \no'clock, with 1 hour debate equally divided. I know my colleague from \nOregon wishes to speak on the unemployment compensation issue. I know \nhe has not had a chance. Does the Senator want to move the vote to \n12:15 p.m.?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we want to use 15 minutes of Senator Lieberman's time \nfor morning business. Senator Lieberman only needs 15 minutes. He is so \ngood he can handle it in 15 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is perfectly acceptable. The assistant majority \nleader is basically saying this side gets 30 minutes and his side gets \n30 minutes, and he is going to change the time allocation of the 30 \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection, except I would like the Senator \nfrom Oregon to be able to speak.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I wonder if I may take the remaining 2 minutes \non the minority side even though I am speaking for the majority \nposition.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is entitled to speak. They can get their \nvote at 12:15 p.m. Can the Senator from Oregon have 5 minutes to speak \non the unemployment compensation issue, and then we will divide the \nhour as described?\n  Mr. REID. The Republican side has 2 minutes left. He can take that 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We will give him 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. From where does his 5 minutes come? I do not care as long I \nknow.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oregon have 5 minutes and then the hour be apportioned as \ndescribed by the assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I dare the Presiding Officer to tell us what we have just \ndone.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from Oregon gets 5 minutes and then we have \n1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair, how much time do we have for the three \nspeakers on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes per speaker. Ten minutes to Senator Kennedy, 10 \nminutes to Senator Sarbanes----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Five minutes. We are saving 15 minutes for Senator \nLieberman. It will be 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Five minutes for Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes for Senator \nSarbanes, 5 minutes for Senator Durbin, and then the other 15 minutes \nfor Senator Lieberman. If he feels very generous, he can yield part of \nhis 15 minutes to these other Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9663-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9663-S9664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I probably will not use all the 5 \nminutes allocated. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy in granting \nme this time.\n  I have been on the floor this morning listening to charges and \ncountercharges between the parties as to who is to blame for the \ncurrent state of the economy. Frankly, I do not believe we planned this \neconomy. I think Congresses and Presidents are given too much credit \nand blame for the free-market system. I think the people at home could \ncare less about all the fingerpointing. In my view, now is the time to \ncome together, not as partisans but as Americans and as bipartisans, if \nyou will, to support legislation that is critical to those who are \nbearing the brunt of the economic downturn our country has been \nexperiencing.\n  I have joined Senator Kennedy as the lead cosponsor of this \nlegislation to extend emergency benefits for workers who have already \nexhausted their benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Program. I am \nhere again to offer my support for another attempt to extend the \nemergency benefits for unemployed workers.\n  Last week, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and I introduced the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. This is yet another \neffort to push the issue to provide benefits from this Congress before \nit adjourns.\n  I note for the record, I have been pushing emergency benefits for \nunemployed workers in Oregon for a year\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\nnow, since October of 2001. After months of work, last March Congress \nfinally extended emergency unemployment benefits to workers who have \nlost their jobs during the economic downturn, but this is no longer \nadequate.\n  Under the extension, unemployed workers in 48 States received 13 \nadditional weeks of benefits, and those in 2 States received 26 weeks. \nMy State, the State of Oregon, was one of those two States, as our \neconomy has been hurt, in a relative sense, worse than any other in the \nUnited States.\n  Now those benefits are ending for Oregonians. Starting this month \nabout 1,000 Oregonians a week will stop receiving badly needed \nemergency unemployment benefits. That is a lot of buying power that \nwill leave the economy of the State of Oregon if it happens but, more \nimportantly, there will be an awful lot of human hardship that will \nensue among these Oregonians if it happens.\n  These benefits are not gratuitous. They are not excessive. They are \nthe barest of safety nets required by these families. For many of these \nfamilies, as I have said, 1,000 a week, these benefits will cease if we \ndo not act before we go home. For that reason, we are, again, \nintroducing legislation, this time the Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation Act of 2002, in an effort to provide for these families.\n  Under this new legislation, those Oregonians will receive up to an \nadditional 20 weeks of emergency benefits. This is a temporary \nextension through July of 2003. Oregon's unemployment rate is simply \nthe highest in America, and this is the least we can do for those who \nare bearing most of the burden of this economic downturn.\n  I am going to join with Senator Kennedy and Senator Wellstone again \nto work in a bipartisan way to get this bill passed before we go home \nand influence our leadership to come to an agreement, as the assistant \nRepublican leader indicated his willingness to do. This is a must-do \nbefore we go home.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the increasingly \nserious problem of unemployment in the United States, in particular the \nnumber of workers who have exhausted their unemployment insurance \nbenefits and are still unable to find work.\n  According to the latest data from the Department of Labor, the \nadjusted unemployment rate in the United States is now 5.7 percent, \nwith over 8.1 million, 8.1 million, workers now unemployed. 1.4 million \nother workers who want work but cannot find it are not included in this \ntotal because they had not looked for work in the four weeks before the \nsurvey was completed.\n  In my State of New Mexico, we are doing much, much worse than this. \nOur adjusted unemployment rate is 6.3 percent, which puts us at number \nnine in the Nation in terms of the worst unemployment rate. Our \nunadjusted unemployment rate is 6.6 percent. We have had an increase of \n31.6 percent in initial unemployment insurance claims since July 2001, \nand an increase of 33.4 percent in continued unemployment insurance \nclaims in that same timeframe.\n  The bottom line in my State and across the Nation is that jobs are \nbeing lost, and there are no new jobs being created that workers can \napply for. Even worse, the workers that have not been able to find work \nnow face an additional crisis, that being that they have been on \nunemployment insurance for as long as allowed and will soon no longer \nbe eligible for new benefits.\n  According to the Department of Labor, by the end of August over 1.1 \nmillion workers have exhausted the extended unemployment insurance \nbenefits provided by the stimulus legislation and now have no funding \nat all available to them. According to the Center for Budget and Policy \nPriorities, this number will rise to over 2.2 million by the end of \n2002. The number of workers who exhausted their regular unemployment \ninsurance benefits in August 2002 was 46 percent higher than the number \nof who exhausted such benefits in August 2001. The number who exhausted \ntheir regular unemployment benefits in the first six months of 2002 is \n75 percent greater than the number who exhausted these benefits in the \nfirst eight months of 2001, and is more than double the number who \nexhausted these benefits during the same months of 2000.\n  For workers in New Mexico and across the Nation, these data are truly \nfrightening. And in spite of these data, the comments we keep hearing \nfrom the administration is that we are on the verge of a recovery, or \nwe have a strong foundation for a recovery, or the recovery is just \naround the corner. But I see no evidence of this. Investment in new \nresearch and development is falling. Investment in new equipment is \nflat. Production is falling. Lay-offs are rising. From what I can tell \nthe economy stalled, and I have seen no evidence at all that the \nadministration knows what to do. Even worse, from what I can tell there \nis a complete lack of concern in the administration about where the \neconomy is going right now. Nothing is being said about what should be \ndone or when it should be done.\n  Given this lack of response by the administration, I say it is time \nwe in Congress act. The Emergency Unemployment Insurance Act of 2002 is \na very positive step in this direction. Its purpose is very \nstraightforward: it will revise and extend the temporary unemployment \nprogram to provide an additional 20 weeks of temporary extended \nbenefits for ``high unemployment'' States, States like New Mexico, and \nan additional 13 weeks to all other states until June 2003.\n  As a practical matter, this means workers can continue to get \nunemployment insurance benefits while they continue to search for work. \nIn my view it is the least we can do for these folks. Unemployment \ninsurance offers at most a subsistence-level existence, and most \nworkers who receive benefits are forced to choose between paying for \neducation, health care, mortgages, and food. These are folks that have \nplayed by the rules over the years and now find themselves in hard \ntimes. Personally, I would prefer that we offer them more, but if we \ncannot, then it seems to me we should be able to offer them some \nminimal financial security when they need it the most.\n  So I want to add my voice to the others today and say that we must \npass this legislation before we go out on recess. American workers \ndeserve to be dealt with in a fair and equitable manner, especially in \nthis time of need. They need a lifeline, and its up to us to provide \nit. I recognize that there are a number of important issues that we \nhave to address in a very short timeframe. But from where I sit, this \nis a priority. The administration can talk all it wants about how the \neconomy is going to improve, but what matters to the folks in my home \nstate is whether they can find good jobs and keep them. Right now, they \ncan't do that. We need to give them some help until they can. This is \none step in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9664-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan.)

Madam President, I rise in very strong support of the \nlegislation to extend unemployment insurance benefits, the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Act, which Senator Wellstone and others have \nintroduced. I am very pleased to have joined in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  I have a few points to make in the limited amount of time that has \nbeen allotted to me this morning. First of all, we have extended \nunemployment benefits in every previous recession. The concept behind \nextending benefits is that when the economy goes soft and people lose \ntheir jobs, in order to help support them, we extend unemployment \nbenefits beyond the standard 26 weeks. Otherwise, benefits are limited \nto 26 weeks. Let me underscore we are talking about working people. One \ncannot draw unemployment insurance if one has not been working. So by \ndefinition, the people we are trying to help are people who were \nworking and producing and helping to move our economy forward and, \nbecause of conditions beyond their control, find themselves out of a \njob. Therefore, they are out of income that is needed in order to \nsupport themselves and often their families.\n\n  Traditionally, we give benefits for 26 weeks and then we figure that \npeople will find a job and go back to work. But when the economy goes \nsoft, then we have a very difficult problem on our hands, which is \nthere are not any jobs to go back to.\n  Most of the economic indicators now are trending downwards. We \ncontinue to face a serious economic problem, and the effort to extend \nthe unemployment insurance benefits is a response to this pressing \nneed. This need is felt by unemployed workers all across the country as \nthey confront the problem of how will they take care of their families, \nand where will they find the income with which to make it from day to \nday.\n  Unemployment insurance pays only a small percentage of what people \nwere previously earning. When a person is receiving unemployment \ninsurance benefits their income takes a real hit. In any event, these \nbenefits provide unemployed workers some support so that they are not \ncompletely cast out without any means of sustenance.\n  Unemployment insurance has been carefully devised to be a \ncountercyclical measure against recession because it provides extra \nincome at a time of economic downturn. Almost by definition this money \nwill be spent since the formerly employed workers are receiving \nbenefits that are far below what they were previously earning. Thus, \nthese benefits will all go into the income stream. They will help to \nprovide an impetus to the economy. Those who talk about how can we get \nthe economy moving again, this is one way to do it.\n  Furthermore, there is a trust fund that is designed to take care of \npaying these unemployment benefits. Payments have been made into the \ntrust fund in good times, such as when we experienced low unemployment \nrates over the last 7 or 8 years, and as a result of this we have well \nover $20 billion in that Federal trust fund. That money is in the trust \nfund because it was paid for the purpose of paying unemployment \nbenefits when we confronted an economic downturn.\n  People ask: Where is the money going to come from? It is going to \ncome from the trust fund. It ought to come from the trust fund. That is \nwhy the trust fund is there, and that is why the money has been paid \ninto the trust fund--for the purpose of providing a safety net at the \nvery time that we run up against the kind of economy we are witnessing \ntoday.\n  So the rationale for extending these unemployment benefits is \noverwhelming. It is consistent with past precedents. We have done it in \nevery previous recession. It conforms to the structure of the system in \nthe sense that we have paid into a trust fund to pay this money out. It \nwill meet the pressing needs of formerly employed workers now \nconfronting the very real problem of how they are going to support \ntheir family now that they have lost their income, and it will provide \na boost to the economy because this money will be paid to formerly \nemployed workers who will spend this money back into the economy, \nhelping to boost this economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that I was \nallotted 5 minutes under the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we are discussing unemployment \ninsurance. A few of these charts really tell the story. If we take a \nlook at the economic record over the last year and a half, we see some \nrather dramatic things have occurred. When President Bush took office \nin January 2001, 648,000 Americans were listed as ``long-term \nunemployed.'' That is more than just a temporary loss of a job. These \nare people who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks.\n  By August of this year, that number had more than doubled to 1.4 \nmillion Americans facing long-term unemployment. In fact, if we compare \nthe record of the Bush administration on private sector jobs, it is a \ndramatic indication of the failure of our economic policy.\n  This chart starts with President Eisenhower, goes through every \nsingle President, all the way to President George W. Bush. Without \nexception, every one of these Presidents saw an increase in private \nsector jobs during their administration. The largest increases came \nunder President Johnson, then President Carter and President Clinton. \nThere is only one President who has seen a decline in the number of \nprivate sector jobs in their administration, and that is the current \nPresident, George W. Bush.\n  So fewer jobs are being created, and there is higher unemployment. \nTraditionally, the Senate has not wasted any time in reacting. Take a \nlook at what happened in the second worst record of the last 50 years--\nunder President Bush's father--when they had a job increase of only \nfour-tenths of 1 percent. When they faced high unemployment under \nPresident Bush's father, the Senate went to great lengths to pass \nextensions of unemployment benefits, realizing there were hundreds of \nthousands, perhaps millions, of Americans out of work. Look at how \nquickly Congress responded, not only once but five times, to increase \nand extend unemployment benefits.\n  Then look at the votes in the Senate. There is not a single vote with \nfewer than 66 Senators supporting it. In some cases, as many as 94 \nSenators supported it. So there has been strong bipartisan support.\n  I cannot understand this, but why is this administration resisting \nthe effort of providing unemployment compensation to Americans who have \nlost their jobs? The President's economic policy has failed. It has \ncreated an economy which is sluggish. Take a look at the stock market \non a day-to-day basis and tell me there is any indication of hope on \nthe horizon.\n  This morning, I met with representatives of major businesses. I went \naround the table and asked: What do you think the future holds? And not \na single one of them is optimistic beyond the range of a year or two \nfrom now. So more and more people will face unemployment.\n  Why, then, should unemployment insurance become this political \nfootball? The Democratic side is insisting we extend unemployment \ninsurance, to make certain that people have some more money to live on \nin the hopes that they can find another job or at least keep their \nfamilies together during some of the most perilous times.\n  In the State of Illinois, we announced an unemployment rate in the \nmonth of August that put us fifth in the Nation for the highest \nunemployment rate. We frankly have a situation now where across this \ncountry many people are losing their jobs and, frankly, have nowhere to \nturn. The August 2002 unemployment rate of 5.7 percent nationwide is \nmore than 18 percent higher than it was the year before.\n\n  So under the Bush administration, the value of people's savings has \ndeclined because of the stock market crashing. We have seen people's \npension plans decimated and their plans for their actual activity \nchanged because they have had to decide to go back to work.\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\n  I heard a report recently where one investment counselor said: I \nnever dreamed there would come a day when I had to call a retired \nperson and say I am sorry, I have taken a look at your portfolio, and \nyou are not going to make it. You have to go back to work. But this \nperson said they had to do it. That is a reality. That is what is \nfacing people.\n  So there is a rush on for these jobs and for a lot of people who have \nlost their pension savings. Now, there is a situation where people who \nare unemployed have nowhere to turn. They have run out of unemployment \ninsurance benefits.\n  This morning, the minority whip, Senator Nickles from Oklahoma, said \nthe Senate Republicans would certainly consider unemployment insurance \nextensions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I believe Senator Kennedy was given 5 \nminutes, and I ask unanimous consent that I be given that time pending \nhis return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I am getting to is that this effort by Senator \nKennedy, Senator Clinton, Senator Wellstone, myself, and Senator Smith \nof Oregon is a really tradition that we have seen over and over again \nin the Senate and the Congress. When we are in a recession, the best \nthing that can be done to spark economic activity is to give some \nbuying power to people who are out of work. We have done that \nrepeatedly, no questions asked.\n  For some reason, the Bush administration, which has presided over \nthis recession getting deeper, darker, and gloomier, does not want to \ndo that. They do not want to provide the basic necessities of life for \nthese people. I do not understand that. One would think the President \nwould have stepped up as his father did three different times and say \nwe are going to provide the resources for these people who, through no \nfault of their own, are out of work. Yet the Bush administration has \nnot done it.\n\n  The situation gets worse. The Bush economic record shows in private \nsector jobs, we have lost more than 2 million jobs. We had 111.7 \nmillion private sector jobs when President George W. Bush took office. \nToday, we are down to 109.6 million. It is an indication of how serious \nit is. Unemployment has become a national phenomenon under this failed \nBush economic record.\n  I mentioned earlier the situation with people and their savings and \ninvestments. This chart is a graphic presentation of something we all \nknow. Look at the impact of President Bush's policies on worker \nretirement savings. Take an average person. Assume, for example, they \nhad $100,000 in their 401(k) retirement plan as of the date President \nGeorge W. Bush took office and they had it invested in the Standard & \nPoors 500--considered a pretty good barometer of business success in \nAmerica. They would have lost 30 percent of the value of their \nretirement. People who were tied into it have seen their retirement \nsavings go down. Many have been forced to go back to work. The stock \nmarket losses, $4.5 trillion, are an indication of lost stock market \nwealth since President Bush took office. I caution people who are \nfollowing this debate, this chart was prepared last week. The numbers \nare worse today. We know what is going on.\n  We need to do something in this country. We focus on national \nsecurity. We should. Shouldn't we spend time discussing economic \nsecurity? Or some time addressing this dramatic loss of wealth and \nsavings in America through no fault of the families who thought they \nwere well invested in a strong economy? This economy has hit the skids \nunder President Bush. His idea to hold a conference with close friends \nin Texas will not cut it. We need to do things to make a dramatic \ndifference.\n  Ask economists the thing to do to put life back in the economy, and \nthey say: Put buying power back in the hands of people who are \nunemployed. They will spend the money. They have to, for the \nnecessities of life. Spending it, with the multiplier in our economy, \ncreates jobs as a result.\n  This Senate, before it adjourns and goes home to campaign or relax or \nwhatever individual Senators care to do, should face its \nresponsibility. The responsibility faced earlier by President Bush's \nfather should be faced by this President Bush as well, to extend the \nunemployment benefits.\n  This bill we are supporting, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nAct of 2002, ensures that the millions of workers exhausting their \nregular unemployment benefits will have a safety net on which they can \nrely. It ensures that over 800,000 workers benefitting from temporary \nextended benefits at the end of the year will not be faced with the \nabrupt expiration of that benefit on December 28. It ensures that over \n863,000 workers who have already exhausted their temporary extended \nbenefits and remain unemployed for over 39 weeks have a place to which \nto turn. It is basic. It is essential.\n  For goodness' sake, don't we owe it to the people of America to talk \nabout the issues that hit them at home? Hit them in their pocketbooks? \nIt is enough to talk about the Middle East and Iraq 23 hours a day, but \ncan we spend an hour a day on the economy? I don't think it is \nunreasonable. If the President would suspend his conversations relative \nto campaigns for 1 hour a week to address the economy, it is something \nthe American people believe is long overdue.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we on the homeland security \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to urge my \ncolleagues to work to resolve the outstanding differences on the labor-\nmanagement issues because I believe the two sides are very close. I \nsubmit further that it is of vital importance that the Congress proceed \nto enact legislation on homeland security and the Senate move ahead to \niron out the remaining differences, go to conference with the House, \nand then present a bill to the President for signature. It is \nimperative that all of the intelligence agencies be brought under one \numbrella in an effort to avoid a repetition of 9/11.\n  My analysis shows me that had all of the dots been put together prior \nto 9/11, 9/11 might well have been avoided. I am not prepared to accept \nthe Intelligence Committee's analysis that another terrorist attack \nwill occur. I believe if we put all the dots together, we can prevent \nit.\n  Had we had the Phoenix FBI report, together with the information from \nKuala Lumpur about two of the hijackers known to the CIA, not told to \nthe FBI or INS, had we had the National Security Agency warning on \nSeptember 10 that something was going to happen the next day, had the \nwarrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act been pursued as \nto Mr. Zacarias Moussaoui, there would have been a blueprint. But the \nsystem broke down because there was not one overall umbrella.\n  What we are faced with now, the differences in the two positions, \ninvolves the labor-management issues. Last Thursday, we had a \ndiscussion in the Senate where it was agreed that the provisions of the \nNelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment did not supplant the provisions of title \nV which have a national security exemption but were in addition to the \nexisting provisions of title V on collective bargaining. When you take \na look at the language in the Nelson amendment, it is very close to the \nlanguage of the existing law. The existing law refers to \ncounterintelligence, investigative, or national security, and the \nNelson amendment refers to counterintelligence or investigative work \ndirectly related to terrorism investigation.\n  It may be that the language of Nelson would have to be modified \nslightly so that instead of providing for a ``majority'' of such \nemployees, it would be a ``significant number'' of such employees.\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\n  Then with respect to the issue of negotiability, the Gramm-Miller \nbill has six categories: Performance appraisal under chapter 43, \nclassification under chapter 51, pay rates and systems under chapter \n53, labor-management relations under chapter 71, adverse actions under \nchapter 75, and appeals under chapter 77.\n  The Nelson amendment would leave in four of those categories--\nperformance appraisal, classification, pay rates and systems, and \nadverse actions--and would subject their implementation to review by \nthe Federal Services Impasses Panel, seven appointees, all appointed by \nthe President.\n  It seems to me we could borrow the language from chapter 71 under \nlabor-management relations, under a national security waiver, and \nprovide flexibility which the President is seeking in the event that \nthere is a national security issue.\n  I believe it is very important we resolve this matter so we can move \nahead with enactment of a homeland security bill. As I said last \nThursday and repeated yesterday, I have not taken a position in favor \neither of the provisions of the Nelson amendment or of the provisions \nwhich are in the Gramm amendment.\n  But I believe we are so close together these differences can be \nreconciled.\n  I wonder if I might have the attention of the manager of the bill, \nthe Senator from Connecticut. Will the Senator from Connecticut respond \nto a question?\n  I ask unanimous consent I may ask a question of the Senator from \nConnecticut without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My question to the Senator from Connecticut is:\n  When you take the language of title V, chapter 71, which specifies \nthe President may issue an order excluding any agency or subdivision \nthereof from coverage under this chapter if the President determines \n(a) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, investigative or national security work; and, (b) \nthe provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that agency or \nsubdivision in a manner consistent with national security requirements \nor considerations;\n  And, add to that the language from the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment \nwhich specifies that the President could not use his authority without \nshowing that, (1) the mission and responsibilities of the agency or \nsubdivision materially change; and, (2) a majority of such employees \nwithin such agency or subdivision have as their primary duty \nintelligence, counterintelligence or investigative work directly \nrelated to terrorism investigation.0\n  My question is, isn't it true the provisions of existing law and the \nadditions made by the Nelson amendment are very close?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding, Madam President, to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, that is my understanding as well. The language with \nregard to the particular section cited by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nin the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux language is supplementary to what is in the \nstatute, and essentially adds those two extra determinations the \nPresident makes to waive collective bargaining rights of Federal \nemployees because of national security reasons, and the determination \nis totally that of the President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I direct another question to the \nSenator from Connecticut; that is, it has been reported to me the White \nHouse may be willing to accept the language of Nelson on the clause if \na ``majority'' of such employees was modified to ``significant number'' \nof such employees. I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he thinks we \nmight be able to make that minor modification if that would in fact \nclose the area of disagreement on this issue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, responding to my friend from \nPennsylvania, I think the question in the report of what the White \nHouse has really demonstrates how close we are to an agreement. I \nprefer the word ``majority;'' that is, to set some standard. Basically, \nthis provision of Nelson-Chafee-Breaux gives some minimal due process \nprotection for Federal workers in the future from a President who would \narbitrarily apply this national security waiver to remove collective \nbargaining rights of Federal employees.\n  One of the elements of due process is to say for the determination to \nbe made, a ``majority'' of the employees of the agency or office \ndepartment would have to be involved and, speaking generally, national \nsecurity. A ``significant'' number seems a little lower. I think we can \nprobably find a word. It is a little too low, it seems to me, between \nthose two words to grant both some comfort level for Federal employees \nwithout diminishing the authority of the President.\n\n  I say again these statements are some of the reasons the President \nwill have to make his determination. But the President's determination, \nfor all intents and purposes, is final. As we discussed last week, \nthere is one reported case where an appeal was made of a determination \nby President Reagan. He just gave an order. He didn't make a \ndetermination. The circuit court even upheld that because the \npresumption in favor of the President when he invokes national security \nis so high.\n  But I welcome this colloquy with the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nthink somewhere, if the concern of the White House on this particular \nsection is about the word ``majority,'' we can find another word which \nI hope can satisfy all concerned and still provide that minimal due \nprocess for Federal employees.\n  After this vote that is coming up, I hope we will continue to work. I \nfear cloture will not be invoked. I think the Senator from \nPennsylvania, along with my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, can \nplay a critical role in getting us over this last obstacle which stands \nbetween us and adopting a bill we all say we agree on 95 percent of, \nexcept this major disagreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor that answer. The purpose of the question and the colloquy is to \ndemonstrate how close we are; that when the Senator from Connecticut \nsays he prefers language of a ``majority'' of such employees to a \n``significant number'' of such employees, I can understand his \npreference. But what I especially liked about his answer was his \ndetermination which matches mine to find language which will find \nanother word which will bridge the gap. When we talk about a 95 percent \nagreement, I think we are really much closer than that when you really \nstrip down all the language.\n  If I might have the attention of the Senator from Connecticut again \nfor another question, moving now to the issue of so-called flexibility \nwhere the Nelson amendment is willing to give the flexibility which the \nPresident sought under four of the six chapters, subject only to \nreference to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in the event of \ndisagreement over implementation--again, noting that all seven of those \nappointees are designated by the President--the thought I believe might \nbridge the gap would be if as to five of these areas--performance \nappraisal, chapter 43; classification, chapter 51; pay raise systems, \nchapter 53; adverse actions, chapter 75; and appeals, chapter 77, \nexcluding only labor-management relations under chapter 71, for which \nthere already is a national security waiver--my question to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut is whether we might be able to bridge the gap by \ngiving the President national security authority for waiver to devise \nthe human resource management system in the event the President makes a \ndetermination national security requires it, borrowing the language \nfrom chapter 71 where the agency or subdivision has a primary function \nof intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national \nsecurity work, and the human resources arrangements cannot be applied \nin a manner consistent with national security requirements and \nconsiderations so in effect we are borrowing the national security \nwaiver provisions which apply as to collective bargaining for the other \nfive categories where the President is seeking some flexibility.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, responding through you to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, I genuinely appreciate the thought and effort he is \ngiving to this to try to find a way out of an impasse that is stopping \nus from\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\ndoing what we really have a responsibility to do, which is to create \nthe Department of Homeland Security as soon as possible. And he has \njust offered, on the floor of the Senate, a new idea, at least one I \nhad not heard before and I do not believe has been part of the \nnegotiations.\n\n  I think we ought to try to sit down--involving, obviously, some of \nthose who have been working on this compromise; Senators Nelson, \nChafee, Breaux, folks from the White House, Senator Thompson and I and \nyourself, I say to you, Senator Specter--as soon as we can to see \nwhether this idea you have offered can be a breakthrough.\n  The fact is, on collective bargaining rules, as I have been saying \nthroughout this debate, not on a national security premise for \neliminating the right to be a member of a union, but throughout the \nstatute there is a system that says that a President, a Secretary, an \nagency head, in time of national emergency, can do almost anything to \noverride collective bargaining provisions because the national \nemergency, national security comes first.\n  In a way, you are suggesting a similar priority, hierarchy, for the \ncivil service rules. It is an idea very much worth considering. I fear \nwe are kind of on automatic pilot, with a cloture vote--the fifth one, \nif I count correctly--on which we are not going to invoke cloture. And \nthe clock is running because we are heading, soon, towards a debate on \nan Iraq resolution, which would take the homeland security measure back \nto the calendar.\n  So I welcome your thoughtful initiative. I, for one, will be glad to \nspend any amount of time with you and the others I mentioned, and \nanyone else, to see if we can break this logjam, present some due \nprocess for Federal workers--which I know is your desire as well, I say \nto Senator Specter--but also preserve the executive authority, not just \nof this President but of the Presidency on into the future, \nparticularly when national security is involved.\n  So I thank my colleague, and I hope we can go to work on this idea.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor that answer. When he focuses in on the national security \nrequirements, I think he puts his finger on the nub of the issue: That \nif there is a national security interest here that would warrant the \nwaiver on the collective bargaining matters, which are already set \nforth in existing law, the same rationale ought to apply to give the \nPresident greater authority under the other chapters where there really \nis a national security issue at stake.\n  I quite agree with the statement by the Senator from Connecticut that \nwe have to move with speed because if we do not come to terms, this \nmatter will be removed from the calendar in deference to the \nconsideration of a resolution authorizing the use of force as to Iraq.\n  We all know there is a target date of this Friday, October 4, which \nhas been delayed until next Friday, October 11; and that is the date by \nwhich we are likely to be out of session. So if we do not bridge this \nnarrow gap now, and if we then go on to the resolution for the use of \nforce, it is highly likely we will not conclude the legislation on \nhomeland security before we recess. I think that would be a grave \nmistake.\n  The proponents of the Gramm-Miller amendment have asked for a vote on \ntheir amendment without any intervening second-degree amendments. And \nwhile I would be prepared to give the proponents of Gramm-Miller such a \nvote, the proponents of the Nelson amendment have a right, as a second-\ndegree amendment, to proceed to have a vote on their second-degree \namendment.\n  So while I supported the position and voted against cloture when the \ncloture motion was made on Gramm-Miller last week--and I did so in part \nto give an opportunity for compromise on this matter, but also in part \nto leave an opportunity for an amendment which this Senator intends to \noffer, which would bring all of the intelligence agencies under one \numbrella--but it seems to me at this point that we ought to move ahead \nand invoke cloture on Gramm-Miller. That will then bring to a head the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by Senator Nelson. And then we would \nfinally get down to some of the really tough negotiations to try to \nbridge the gap. There is nothing that promotes the negotiations like \nthe imminence of a vote on a specific subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I inquire as to how much time we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, without losing my right to the floor, for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, let me withdraw that inquiry for the \nmoment and say that it appears we are about out of time with regard to \nthose who oppose cloture. The time has been running against us. And now \nit appears that the Senator from Pennsylvania supports cloture. I would \nsuggest that the time should not run against those of us who oppose \ncloture. Should that time not be allocated differently?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think the Senator from Tennessee \nraises a very good point. I will yield the floor momentarily. But \nbefore doing so, if I might have the attention of the Senator from \nTennessee. I will yield the floor after a question to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Tennessee and I had \nbeen in the cloakroom discussing these matters, and we had discussed \nhow close we are. As the Senator from Tennessee has noted, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut ventured the view that we were very close on the two \nlabor-management issues, as to adding the language of Nelson to the \nexisting law which retains the national security waiver, and then the \nsuggestion of giving the President flexibility where the President \nmakes a determination of national security.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Tennessee what his view is as to how \nclose we are to resolving these two outstanding issues.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, if I may respond.\n  Unfortunately, not as close as I think the Senator apparently thinks. \nWith regard to the labor-management relations issue that was referred \nto initially by the Senator from Pennsylvania, and was the subject of \nthe conversation, the dialog, a moment ago with the Senator from \nConnecticut with regard to the Presidential authority, the point was \nmade that there is a disagreement with the wording of the portion of \nthe amendment that refers to the ``majority of the employees.'' The \nsuggestion was made it should be ``substantial number of employees.'' \nThe Senator is correct that is a point, but it is only one point.\n  My understanding is we have submitted language to those on the other \nside of this issue that addresses, in addition to that, the concern \nthat the President is limited to acting with regard to matters of \nterrorism only.\n  It is the last couple of lines of page 12, of the draft that I have \nanyway, where the current language says ``or investigative work \ndirectly related to terrorism investigation.''\n  The language that has been submitted by us is ``or preventing \ninvestigation or responding to terrorists or other serious threats to \nhomeland security.'' In other words, why should this President be \nlimited to exercising his authority to a more narrow range of \nactivity--that would be terrorism--when there could be some other \nnational security issues that prior Presidents have had the opportunity \nto deal with that this President would not? So the compromise was \nsuggested to keep the focus on terrorism but also add other serious \nthreats to homeland security.\n  As I understand it, that suggestion lies at this moment with the \nother side. We have not had a response to that. I wouldn't want those \nlistening to think there is only a one-word difference between us with \nregard to that issue, as unfortunate as that may be.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nthat response. He raises a good issue. I agree with him the earlier \nlanguage which exists presently, categorizing national security \ngenerally and consistent with national security requirements and \nconsiderations, is the broader language. I do not think the additional \nlanguage of terrorism seeks to limit that, but I think the Senator from \nTennessee raises a good point that it ought to be clarified so the \nnational security considerations are broader than just terrorism.\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\n  I direct the attention of the Senator from Tennessee to the second \nconsideration; that is, whether a national security waiver or \ndetermination by the President of national security considerations \nwould be sufficient on the issues of the flexibility on the other five \nchapters.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, that is certainly worth considering, \nas Senator Lieberman reflected a moment ago. Once you get down to it, \nthe issue has to do with two situations, as I see it. One has to do \nwith disputes involving collective bargaining agreements and what you \ndo about that. There are issues as to matters somewhat minor, if not \nfrivolous. Some matters have taken years to resolve--whether or not the \nannual company picnic was called off and things of that nature.\n  On the other hand, there are other issues that may be part of a \ncollective bargaining agreement that might limit, for example, the \nauthority to transfer someone to a border where that was needed.\n  Unless there is a national emergency situation, the President or the \nSecretary should not be limited to situations that have already become \nemergencies. They should be proactive and preventive. That is one \ncategory of issues.\n  I could see why we might have the status quo with regard to the run-\nof-the-mill kind of collective bargaining issues we have, limit the \nSecretary's flexibility even with regard to those matters, as long as \nwith regard to the matters that really mattered, the President had such \na waiver or a certain amount of discretion in that area.\n  The same thing could be said with regard to the second category of \nmatters at issue; that is, matters concerning individual employees in \nterms of dismissal, discipline, things of that nature. It often takes \nup to 18 months to process--multilevel, multiappeal, multiavenue, \nmultimonths, into years. The status quo with the national security \nwaiver would be less likely to work in such a situation because I can't \nimagine a situation where the President would want to step in and \nintervene with regard to the disciplining of one particular employee.\n  There is a category, that first category I mentioned, of things where \nwhat the Senator suggests should be seriously considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Time allotted to the minority \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, had my friend from Tennessee used his \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In a manner of speaking, I have now discovered that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is on the other side of this issue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. May I say to my friend from Tennessee, that was a \nsurprise to me as well, a pleasant surprise in my case, one I \nappreciate.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask whether or not the Senator would \nentertain a unanimous consent request perhaps for however much time the \nSenator needs, 15 minutes, and perhaps 10 minutes additional time for \nme.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have our party \nconferences starting at 12:30. We really have a lot to do today. If we \ndo that, this vote will not be completed until nearly 1 o'clock. I \nwould have to respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 12 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Would the Senator from Connecticut give me a couple of \nminutes of his time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee have 3 minutes on his own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep \ndisappointment in the language in the Gramm substitute related to \nunaccompanied alien children. As a result, I stand in support of Title \nXII of the Lieberman substitute, which contains provisions based on S. \n121, bipartisan legislation I introduced in Jan. 2001.\n  My disappointment is best understood with the following example. Not \nlong ago, the Nation's attention was focused on the plight of Elian \nGonzalez and whether he should be allowed to stay in the U.S. or return \nto Cuba.\n  At the same time, a young 15-year old Chinese girl stood before a \nU.S. immigration court facing deportation proceedings.\n  She had found her way to the United States as a stowaway in a \ncontainer ship captured off Guam, hoping to escape the repression she \nhad experienced in her home country.\n  And although she had committed no crime, the INS sent her to a \nPortland jail, where she languished for seven months. When the INS \nbrought her before an immigration judge, she stood before him confused, \nnot understanding the proceedings against her.\n  Tears streamed down her face, yet she could not wipe them away \nbecause her hands were handcuffed and chained to her waist.\n  While the young girl eventually received asylum in our country, she \nunnecessarily faced an ordeal no child should bear under our \nimmigration system.\n  This young Chinese girl represents only one of 5,000 foreign-born \nchildren who, without parents or legal guardians to protect them, are \ndiscovered in the United States each year in need of protection.\n  When discovered by Federal authorities, these children are not always \ngreeted with the special care and attention they deserve. Nearly 2,000 \nof them served time in juvenile jails, even though most had committed \nno crime. One child was even detained for 5 years. Many are handcuffed \nand placed in cells with other juveniles who have committed serious \nviolent crimes.\n  Because of their age and inexperience, children may not be able to \narticulate their fears or testify to their needs with the same degree \nof accuracy as adults. Yet despite these facts, no Federal laws and \npolicies have been developed and implemented, thus far, to protect \nthem.\n  While not all children will merit asylum, providing them appointed \ncounsel would help the INS and the courts understand the special \ncircumstances of the child's arrival in the United States, while at the \nsame time help the child to understand the process he or she is \nundergoing.\n  In my mind this goes a long way in explaining my opposition to the \nGramm substitute as it relates to unaccompanied alien children and why \nthe Lieberman substitute is much stronger in this regard.\n  Both pieces of legislation sought comprehensive reform in the way in \nwhich these vulnerable children are treated while under the watch of \nimmigration authorities.\n  The Gramm substitute, however, would strip many of the important \nreforms relating to unaccompanied alien children from the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  Moreover, the provisions with respect to these children included in \nthe Gramm substitute are nothing more than a legislative sleight of \nhand that appears to make reforms, but in reality would render those \nprovisions meaningless.\n  Clearly, most unaccompanied alien children do not pose a threat to \nour national security, and must be treated with all the care and \ndecency they deserve outside the reach of this new Department.\n  More specifically, the unaccompanied child protection provisions now \ncontained in Title XII of the Lieberman substitute would make critical \nreforms to the manner in which unaccompanied alien children are treated \nunder our immigration system.\n  These provisions would also: preserve the functions of apprehending \nand adjudicating immigration claims of such children, and, when the \nsituation warrants, of repatriating a child to his home country, within \nthe Immigration Affairs Agency, and under the larger umbrella of \nhomeland security.\n  The unaccompanied alien child protection provisions would transfer \nthe care and custody of these children to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Its Office of Refugee Resettlement has real expertise \nin dealing with both child welfare and immigration issues.\n  At the same time, these provisions would establish minimum standards \nfor the care of unaccompanied alien children; provide mechanisms to \nensure that unaccompanied alien children have access to counsel; permit \nthe Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to appoint guardian \nad litem,\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nif necessary, to look after the children's interests; and provide \nsafeguards to ensure that children engaged in criminal behavior remain \nunder the control of immigration enforcement authorities at all times.\n  Roughly 5,000 foreign-born children under the age of 18 enter the \nUnited States each year unaccompanied by parents or other legal \nguardians. Some have fled political persecution, war, famine, abusive \nfamilies, or other life-threatening conditions in their home countries.\n  They often have a harder time than adults in expressing their fears \nor testifying in court, especially if they lack English language \nproficiency.\n  Unbelievably, some of these children are subjected to such punitive \nactions as shackling, the use of leg manacles, and strip searches while \nin INS custody. Others are housed with violent juvenile offenders, or \nsubjected to solitary confinement.\n  Despite these horrific circumstances, the Federal response has fallen \nshort in providing for their protection.\n  Unaccompanied minors are among the most vulnerable of the world's \nasylum seekers, and they deserve our support and protection.\n  And yet, no immigration laws or policies currently exist that \neffectively meet the needs of these children. Instead, children are \nbeing forced to struggle through a complex system that was designed for \nadults.\n  It is important that we address this issue in this present \nlegislation for a number of reasons.\n  First of all, as we contemplate transferring the functions of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) into the proposed new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we must ensure that the new Department \nis not burdened with functions that do not relate to its core mission.\n  For decades now, the INS has failed in its responsibility to care for \nthese vulnerable children. As we transfer and reshape the INS in this \nlegislation, it is imperative to relieve the agency of its \nresponsibility of the care and custody of unaccompanied children.\n  Doing so would accomplish two ends: one, it would permit the INS to \nfocus its energies, efforts, and attention on its core missions; and \ntwo, it would transfer the care and custody of the these children to \nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, an office that is better \nsuited and much more experienced in handling the complexities of the \nchildren's situations.\n  As we turn over these responsibilities to a different agency, \nCongress must clearly define its expectations of the agency regarding \nthe standards of care for these children.\n  It would be irresponsible for us to do anything less.\n  Quite frankly, it confounds me that, after more than a century since \nthe first federal immigration law was enacted, our immigration system \nis still incapable of meeting the special needs of these children, \nwhether those needs are medical, psychological, or legal.\n  This is why, in an effort to change current U.S. policy toward the \ntreatment of unaccompanied foreign-born children, I introduced the \n``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'', S. 121.\n  The overall purpose of this legislation is to refocus our policy away \nfrom treating these children like criminals, and to move toward a \nsystem that protects and serves their best interests.\n  Sometimes, this means safely returning them to a parent or guardian \nin their home country.\n  In other, more extraordinary cases, a child's best interest may \ninvolve a grant of asylum.\n  As introduced, S. 121 was a reasonable, moderate, bipartisan bill \nwith the main purpose of reforming the care of unaccompanied alien \nchildren who come to the attention of Federal authorities.\n  As reasonable as it was, my staff and I conducted numerous meetings \nand phone calls with the Department of Justice and the INS, to further \nrefine the bill's provisions.\n  Last February, the Judiciary Subcommittee in Immigration held a \nhearing on the legislation.\n  I listened to all of the ideas that they expressed, and I addressed \nalmost all of them in the modifications that were made in the version \nof the legislation now included in Title XII of the Lieberman \nsubstitute.\n  Still, after all this compromise, the administration did not bother \nto even mention Title XII in its statement of administration policy of \nthis legislation.\n  Given the moderate nature of Title XII, and given the fact that so \nmany Republicans are cosponsors of it, I urge the Senate to maintain \nthe provisions I have outlined today, rather than accept the \nevisceration of the bill's core protections that would result under the \nGramm substitute.\n  If it becomes necessary, in the coming days I intend to offer an \namendment to restore these important provisions to the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  And I will call on my colleagues to support that amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise once again to point out \nproblems with the amendment offered by Senators Gramm and Miller which \nwould take away the rights of Federal workers. Last week I spoke of the \nneed to provide full whistleblower protection to employees in the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and how the Gramm-Miller amendment \nfails to provide such protection despite claims to the contrary. While \nthe substantive rights are maintained for whistleblowers, the methods \nto enforce such rights are not part of the amendment.\n  And despite claims made by the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, yesterday that veterans' preference would be protected, the \nGramm-Miller amendment fails to fully protect veterans in the new \nDepartment.\n  It appears that my colleagues believe that by maintaining the merit \nsystem principles, the new Department will protect our Federal \nemployees from retaliation for blowing the whistle and from violations \nof veterans' preference requirements. However, simply following the \nmerit principles will not fully protect the Federal workers who protect \nour Nation from terrorist attacks. We must provide a neutral third-\nparty method to enforce such rights.\n  The Gramm-Miller amendment fails to do this.\n  Currently, Federal employees, who believe that they have been denied \na position or have been subject to a designer Reduction-In-Force, RIF, \naction in violation of veterans' preference requirements, can challenge \nsuch wrongful actions through the Merit Systems Protection Board or \nthrough a union grievance procedure. Whistleblowers who allege that \nthey have been subject to a prohibited personnel practice may go \nthrough the Office of Special Counsel and to the MSPB for corrective \naction. In addition, whistleblowers can bring allegations of \nretaliation through the union grievance procedure. The Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute amendment would block both routes for redress.\n  Under Gramm-Miller, the Department of Homeland Security could waive \nany and all due process appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board. \nInstead, the due process procedures in current law would be replaced \nwith an internal department appeals process. By allowing the agency, \nrather than an independent third party, to determine whether the agency \nviolated veterans' preference or other employee protection laws, we \nwill have removed the impartiality of the process.\n  However, under the Lieberman substitute, as well as the Nelson-\nChafee-Breaux amendment, veterans' rights are not compromised. The \nappeals to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 77 may not be waived.\n  In addition, Chapter 71 of Title 5 which relates to Labor-Management \nRelations, may not be waived. This allows veterans and whistleblowers \nwho are in collective bargaining units to exercise their right to use a \nnegotiated grievance process to challenge violations of veterans' \npreference requirements or the Whistleblower Protection Act. Under the \nGramm-Miller substitute, the new Department could waive the labor-\nmanagement statutory requirements in Title 5. As such, grievance rights \nand union representation could quickly disappear.\n  Quite simply, under the Gramm-Miller substitute, veterans may still \nhave veterans' preference rights, but they will have no way to seek \nredress for any violation of those rights. We have a proud history of \nprotecting the rights of veterans and federal workers who protect this \ncountry. Whether they are whistleblowers or veterans, these Federal \nemployees serve their Nation well. We need to support those who are \nwilling to serve their Government.\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reaffirm my overall support \nfor a Department of Homeland Security. And I remain convinced that it \nis still possible to reach a consensus on this critical issue, and that \nwe must strive to do so before the end of this session.\n  However, after giving this matter a great deal of thought, I must \nstand in opposition to the provisions in the Gramm-Miller bill that \nwould strip many of the protections afforded to employees of the new \nDepartment.\n  As it stands, the bill's language would take away rights from some \n200,000 Federal employees, rights that have been available for decades \nto most of the Federal workforce.\n  None of us dispute that any organization, particularly one entrusted \nwith such a vital mission as homeland security, can function properly \nonly if its managers have the authority both to offer incentives to \ntalented employees and to fire negligent or ineffective employees.\n  And despite a great deal of rhetoric to the contrary, such \nflexibility already exists under the current labor provisions that \ngovern the Federal workforce.\n  This flexibility was granted under the terms of the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978, allowing managers to: performance standards, and \nhave the power to fire employees for performance failures as long as \nthere is at least some plausible evidence.\n  In light of these facts, it is downright wrong to suggest that the \nGovernment cannot fire employees who, say, are drunk on the job or who \ncommit crimes.\n  In fact, under current law, managers can remove such employees from \ntheir jobs immediately, while the employees' appeal can be settled \ndefinitively within 30 days.\n  Under current law, managers also have wide latitude in transferring, \nsuspending, and reassigning employees, as well as in appointing \ncandidates from outside the federal government to fill open positions.\n  On both sides of the aisle, there is virtual unanimity that any \nhomeland security legislation must include a package of additional \nflexibilities regarding hiring, training, separation, and retirement. \nThese additional flexibilities are in the Lieberman substitute.\n  And yet, the President has threatened to veto the Lieberman \nsubstitute, unless the Senate agrees to the labor provisions of the \nGramm-Miller substitute.\n  Apparently, the President is willing to scrap crucial legislation to \nprotect our country from terrorism if he is not given open-ended \nauthority to abolish or limit federal employee rights and protections.\n  In my view, this threat is unnecessary, unwarranted, and highly \nunproductive.\n  And now the President has rejected a perfectly sound bipartisan \ncompromise proposed by Senators Nelson, Breaux, and Chafee. This \ncompromise, which I support, provides what he wants, management \nflexibility authority, and what the Federal Government requires, \nsafeguards to ensure that he cannot abuse that power.\n  This amendment provides the President broad leeway to change the \ncivil service rules governing hiring, promotions, dismissals, \nperformance appraisals, classifications, and pay rates for Homeland \nSecurity Department employees.\n  At the same time, Federal employee unions could object. If the two \nsides could not agree on the changes, then the Federal Services \nImpasses Panel, a board of seven presidential appointees, would \narbitrate.\n  This amendment allows the President to revoke an employee's rights to \ncollectively bargain and to form unions, if that employee's duties \nmaterially change and these duties directly relate to intelligence, \ncounter-intelligence, or investigations relating to terrorism.\n  In threatening to veto this compromise, the administration has tried \nto frame the debate in terms of national security.\n  For instance, the President's spokesman recently said that the \ncompromise bill would prevent the president ``from making decisions \nbased on national security, no matter how urgent a crisis we find \nourselves in.''\n  I find it disturbing that the administration has suggested that \nputting any restriction on the President's authority to limit or \nabolish federal employee rights and protections somehow jeopardizes our \nnational security.\n  The way I see it, the administration is getting it exactly backwards.\n  The administration's attempt to give the executive branch total \nauthority to rewrite the civil service system without consulting anyone \nwould not help protect our country. Indeed, it would leave it more \nvulnerable.\n  At a time of such massive restructuring of the federal government, it \nis absolutely critical that we maintain as much continuity as possible.\n  Yet the Gramm-Miller substitute's open-ended language would allow the \nPresident to eliminate, by fiat, many important workers' rights.\n  This would be a huge blow to the morale and productivity of many \nthousands of Federal employees, and would risk the loss of many highly \nqualified individuals to the private sector.\n  There is also a large percentage of workers who, if push comes to \nshove, can option for early retirement. This is no time for the federal \ngovernment to suffer a so-called ``brain drain,'' and be forced to \ntrain novices from scratch.\n  In the middle of our war on terrorism, the last thing we want to do \nis lose experienced employees on the front lines of this war.\n  We are talking about employees at the Coast Guard, the Department of \nDefense, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Border \nPatrol, the Federal Aviation Authority, and other agencies.\n  We are talking about men and women who are working around the clock \nto prevent another terrorist attack and to protect our citizens.\n  I for one do not see any inherent clash between collective bargaining \nrights and homeland security.\n  For example, Department of Defense civilians with top secret \nclearances are long-standing union members whose membership has not \ncompromised our national security.\n  And many of the heroes of September 11 were unionized. The New York \nCity firefighters who ran up the Twin Towers did not see any conflict \nbetween worker rights and emergency response.\n  And let's not forget that Federal employees do not have the right to \nstrike.\n  Why haven't supporters of the President's proposal not been able to \nidentify one instance of a labor dispute which contributed to a \nbreakdown in our national security?\n  I have heard from many Federal employees in California who would be \naffected by this legislation. I would like to share with you the words \nof just one.\n  Joseph Dassaro is a Senior Border Patrol Agent assigned to the San \nDiego Sector of our southern border. He has been an agent for ten \nyears, and is President of the San Diego Chapter of the National Border \nPatrol Council. In his words: ``The loss of collective bargaining \nrights and civil service protections would force me to leave the Border \nPatrol. Simply put, without the union and the Civil Service Reform Act \n. . .''\n  ``I have no faith in the ability of the agency, or any subsequently \ncreated agency, to provide working conditions in which I can operate in \nthe best interests of this nation. Additionally, based on the vast \ninput I have received from the many agents I represent, I can assure \nyou that [if the President's proposal is enacted], Border Patrol \nattrition rates would more than double . . .\n  ``At record levels, agents are applying for local police positions in \nSouthern California. Recently, the San Diego County Sheriffs \n[Department] interviewed over twelve agents from one Border Patrol \nstation. Not only do these agencies offer better pay, incentives, and \nworking conditions, they also offer an environment which rewards merit \nand seniority.''\n  Mr. Dassaro, along with the hundreds of thousands of other Federal \nemployees, has been working day in and day out to keep our country \nsecure.\n  I do not know why the administration wants to take fundamental rights \nand protections away from these patriotic Americans. We should not be \nattacking job security under the guise of national security.\n  This debate on homeland security should not be an exercise in scoring \npolitical points at the expense of labor protections for Federal \nemployees, protections that are already in place at\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\nvirtually every other Federal agency and which have functioned smoothly \nfor many years.\n  Which is why I ask my colleagues to vote against the anti-union \nprovisions in Gramm-Miller, while urging the Bush Administration to \nreconsider the compromise offered by Senators Nelson, Breaux and \nChafee. \n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we know that our Nation faces a very \nserious threat of terrorism. To protect our national security in \ntoday's world, we need an immigration system that can carefully screen \nforeign nationals seeking to enter the United States and that can \nprotect our Nation's borders. We need a system that can make effective \nuse of intelligence information and identify those who seek to harm us.\n  Unfortunately, our current Immigration and Naturalization Service is \nnot up to these challenges. For years, INS has been plagued with \nproblems, from mission, overload to mismanagement to inadequate \nresources. As a result, INS has been unable to meet its dual \nresponsibility to enforce our immigration laws and to provide services \nto immigrants, refugees, and aspiring citizens.\n  The immigration reforms in the Lieberman substitute amendment are \ncarefully designed to correct these problems and bring our immigration \nsystem into the 21st century. The amendment untangles the overlapping \nand often confusing structure of the INS and replaces it with two clear \nlines of command, one for enforcement and the other for services. It \nalso includes a strong chief executive officer, the Under Secretary for \nImmigration Affairs, who, under the direction of the Secretary of \nHomeland Defense, will act as a central authority to ensure a uniform \nimmigration policy and provide effective coordination between the \nservice and the enforcement functions. Developed on a bipartisan basis, \nin consultation with respected experts, the immigration reforms in the \nLieberman substitute emphasize clear direction, close coordination, and \ngenuine accountability to the American people.\n  On these key issues, the Gramm-Miller substitute moves in exactly the \nwrong direction. Rather than establishing a single, accountable \ndirector for immigration policy, Gramm-Miller establishes three: the \nUnder Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, the Under \nSecretary for Immigration Affairs, and the Chief of Immigration Policy \nwithin the Deputy Secretary's office. Little coordination is provided \namong these three positions. These officials will have authority to \nissue conflicting policies and conflicting interpretations of law. The \nresult for the Nation's immigration system is likely to be a new period \nof disarray, not real reform.\n  Given the vast responsibilities of our immigration agency, the large \nnumber of people who cross our borders, and the major national-security \nconcerns that have arisen since September 11, we will do the country a \ngreat disservice if we enact a so-called ``reform'' that makes the \nchronic problems of the INS even worse. We deserve a well-thought-out, \neffective reform, like that included in the Lieberman substitute, not \nthe proposal offered by Gramm-Miller.\n  We need a separate and comprehensive directorate within which we can \nbalance border security, provision of services, and efficient and fair \nenforcement of the immigration laws. Within this separate directorate, \nit is essential to include both the service and the enforcement \ncomponents of immigration policy. Nearly every immigration-related \naction involves both enforcement and service components. Coordination \nbetween the two is critical to ensure that the laws are interpreted and \nimplemented consistently. Coordination cannot be achieved merely by \nsharing a database or having a common management structure far up the \nladder. Coordination will not be achieved if enforcement and services \nare housed in different departments.\n  That, however, is exactly what the Gramm-Miller proposal does. The \ntwo most critical enforcement functions, border patrol and inspections, \nwill be taken from other immigration functions and placed in the Border \nand Transportation Protection Directorate. The formulation of \nimmigration policy, our only chance to achieve coordination between \nthese dispersed functions, will be subject to the conflicting views of \nvarious officials spread out in the new Department. With its dispersed \nimmigration functions and failure to provide centralized coordination, \nGramm-Miller is a recipe for failure.\n  Consider this example. An executive for a large international \ncorporation arrives in the United States with a business visa that \nexpires in 30 days. The inspector is reluctant to admit the executive, \nsince his visa will soon expire. The executive states that his attorney \nhas filed for a renewal of the visa. Under Gramm-Miller, with its \nfailure to provide coordination between the service and enforcement \nfunctions, the inspector will not be able to verify that a renewal \napplication has been filed, and the executive will be denied admission. \nSuch a mistake, repeated many times each year, will be disruptive to \nour economy.\n  Or consider an asylum seeker picked up by a border patrol agent. He \nclaims that he will face persecution if returned to his home country. \nHis brother enters the U.S. with a visa and is granted asylum, a \nservice bureau function. Without effective coordination between \nservices and enforcement, the brother processed by the service bureau \nwill be allowed to stay and become a permanent resident, while the \nbrother picked up by the border patrol may be returned to face \npersecution or even death. These are mistakes that we cannot tolerate.\n  We need a reform that ensures uniform policies and consistent \ninterpretations of the law. We know from painful experience that \ninconsistencies in interpretation and enforcement, with no one in \ncharge to resolve differences, can lead to unacceptable results. We \nneed an immigration system that works. The Lieberman substitute will \ngive us that system. The Gramm-Miller substitute will repeat--and \nincrease--the mistakes of our past.\n  The Lieberman substitute also deals with another serious flaw in our \ncurrent immigration system--the care and custody of unaccompanied alien \nchildren. Senator Feinstein has been working on this issue for many \nyears, and her bipartisan legislation is included in our reforms. It \naddresses the needs of children arriving alone in the United States. \nOften, these children have fled from armed conflict and abuses of human \nrights. They are traumatized and desperately need protection. As \nchildren, they deserve special care and protection.\n  Jurisdiction over their care and custody does not belong in a \ndepartment dedicated to preventing security threats. Our plan transfers \nresponsibility for these children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement \nin the Department of Health and Human Services, an office that has \ndecades of experience working with foreign-born children and is well-\nequipped to place these children in appropriate facilities where they \nwill receive the care and attention they deserve.\n  We also provide safeguards to ensure that children have the \nassistance of counsel and guardians in the course of their proceedings. \nCurrently, over half of the children in immigration proceedings are \nunrepresented by counsel. Children as young as 18-months-old have \nappeared in immigration court without a lawyer. These children simply \ncannot be expected to effectively represent themselves when faced with \nthe complexities of U.S. immigration law.\n  The Gramm-Miller substitute provides plainly inadequate protections \nfor these vulnerable children. Although care and custody is transferred \nto the Office of Refugee Resettlement, this substitute leaves out the \ncounsel and guardian provisions.\n  The fear that providing government-funded counsel for children will \nset a precedent for the provision of counsel for other populations in \nimmigration proceedings is unfounded. Our plan contains a very narrow \nexception for vulnerable children, and only Congress can extend that \nexception to other groups.\n  Guardians are crucial in order to ensure that the best interests of \nchildren are addressed throughout their immigration proceedings. \nGuardians would ensure that the child understands the nature of the \nproceedings. Immigration proceedings are the only legal proceedings in \nthe United States in which children are not provided the assistance of \na guardian or court-appointed special advocate.\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\n  Finally, the Lieberman substitute remedies decades-old problems with \nour immigration court system. That system--called the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review--is part of the Department of Justice. Every \nday, immigration courts make life-altering decisions. The interests at \nstake are significant, especially for persons facing persecution and \nfor long-time permanent residents, who face permanent separation from \nfamily members.\n  Despite these major responsibilities, the immigration court system \nexists by regulation only. As such, it can be moved, dissolved, or \nreconfigured at any time, without Congressional involvement. For years, \nimmigration judges have been criticized because they are too closely \naligned with immigration enforcers. Their impartiality is jeopardized \nwhen both judge and prosecutor are too closely linked. These criticisms \nwill only intensify if the immigration courts are relocated to the new \nsecurity agency.\n  We need an immigration court system that provides individuals with a \nfair hearing before an impartial and independent tribunal, and \nmeaningful appellate review. The Lieberman substitute maintains the \nimmigration court system at the Justice Department, so that immigration \njudges and immigration enforcers are effectively separated. It also \ncodifies the existing court structure and its components, making it a \npermanent part of our immigration system.\n  The Gramm-Miller substitute would seriously undermine the role of \nimmigration judges. It vests the Attorney General with all-encompassing \nauthority, depriving immigration judges of their ability to exercise \nindependent judgement. Even more disturbing, the Gramm-Miller proposal \ncould curtail the right to appeal adverse decisions, since the Attorney \nGeneral will have the authority to change or even eliminate appellate \nreview. This result is a recipe for mistakes and abuse. An independent \njudicial system is essential to our system of checks and balances. \nImmigrants who face the severest of consequences deserve their day in \ncourt.\n  In reforming our immigration system, we must isolate terrorists \nwithout isolating America. We must protect our Nation, and we must also \nprotect immigrants. In strengthening our defenses against terrorism, we \nmust settle for nothing less. Americans are united in our commitment to \nwin the war on terrorism and protect the country from future attack. An \nessential part of meeting this challenge is protecting the ideals that \nAmerica stands for here at home and around the world.\n  The Lieberman substitute acts on this principle by providing basic \ncivil rights and privacy safeguards in the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. A civil rights officer will oversee civil rights issues and \nadvise the Secretary on policy matters. A privacy officer will perform \nsimilar functions on privacy issues. An official in the Inspector \nGeneral's office will investigate civil rights abuses.\n  We have heard no complaint from either the administration or our \nRepublican colleagues about these civil rights provisions. The \nadministration's detailed Statement of Policy on September 3rd did not \ncontain a single objection to them. Nevertheless, all of these \nprovisions have been removed from the Gramm-Miller substitute.\n  Today, many Americans are concerned about the preservation of basic \nliberties protected by the Constitution. There continues to be a debate \nover the constitutionality and wisdom of some of the administration's \npolices and actions since September 11. Clearly, as we work together to \nbring terrorists to justice and enhance our security, we must also act \nto preserve and protect our Constitution.\n  The civil rights provisions in the Lieberman substitute are limited \nin scope, but will be essential to the proper role of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They should be included in whatever \nbill the Senate ultimately passes, and I urge the Senate to accept \nthem.\n  Earlier this week, our committee held a hearing on the grave public \nhealth challenge of West Nile fever. We heard how vital it is for CDC, \nNIH and FDA to work together closely to respond to this deadly \nepidemic. The same health agencies that are responding to West Nile \ntoday may need to respond to a biological attack tomorrow. The last \nthing we should do is disrupt the close coordination among our health \nagencies that will be needed for an effective response to such an \nattack. Yet this is exactly what the Gramm-Miller amendment would do by \ntransferring responsibilities for bioterrorism research and response to \nthe new Department of Homeland Security. While claiming to enhance our \npreparedness for bioterrorism, the amendment would actually diminish it \nby needlessly splitting responsibilities for bioterrorism between HHS \nand the new Department.\n  We heard from Dr. Tony Fauci, the Nation's leading expert on \ninfectious disease, that NIH is working swiftly to develop a new \nvaccine against the West Nile virus. Dr. Fauci and the other medical \nleaders at NIH should retain the responsibility for developing new \nvaccines for anthrax, Ebola and other biological weapons. These \nresponsibilities should not be transferred to a new department with \nunproven scientific expertise. Certainly, the new Department should set \nbroad priorities for our homeland security research program, but the \nfunding and the scientific responsibility for carrying out that \nresearch should remain with NIH.\n  Sadly, the Gramm-Miller amendment also includes fails to include \nprotections for the ethical treatment of human subjects in research. \nAmerica has a tragic history of ethical abuses in national security \nresearch. In our Senate inquiries during the 1970s, we learned how the \nCIA had given LSD and other dangerous drugs to experimental subjects \nwithout their knowledge or their consent. These shameful experiments \nled to the death by suicide of an agent in New York.\n  We must not let history repeat itself in the research carried out by \nthis new Department. Basic protections for human subjects cover \nresearch conducted by all other Federal agencies. They should also \napply to the new Department. These protections should not be \ndiscretionary. They should be a required element of every research \nproject that the new Department conducts.\n  I also want to speak today about America's workers. We live in a \nnation forever changed by the tragic events of September 11. The \ndreadful images seared into our memories on that fateful day were grim \nproof to every American that we are vulnerable to grave new threats. We \nmust take the necessary steps to protect America from these new \ndangers. We must act wisely as we create a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We must ensure that our actions truly enhance, rather than \ndiminish, our Nation's security. And we must meet our security needs in \nways that reflect the values that make America the envy of the world.\n  As we debate the formation of this new agency, we should remember the \nevents of September 11 and the heroism of our Nation's union workers in \nthe cause of homeland security. Union members risked and lost their \nlives and saved countless others through their actions on September 11. \nWe will never forget the example that firefighters, construction \nworkers and many government workers set that day.\n  Union workers have also shown great bravery and extraordinary \nsacrifice in the service of homeland security since September 11. The \npostal workers and the hospital worker killed as a result of \nbioterrorism were all union members. The brave flight attendant, whom \nthe President recognized in the State of the Union Address for \npreventing terrorism, is a member of a union.\n  The dedication and resolve of these union members truly represents \nthe best of America. Over 43,000 of the Federal workers affected by the \nproposed Government reorganization are currently union members. These \nare the workers who risk their lives each day to protect our Nation's \nborders. They are the workers from the Federal Emergency Management \nAuthority who coordinated the Federal emergency response on September \n11. These workers are out every day on the high seas to rescue those in \nneed and to prevent dangerous cargo from reaching our shores. They are \nalso the workers dedicated to making our Nation safer from the threat \nof bioterrorism.\n\n  Among the ranks of unionized Federal workers are true heroes who have \nserved their Nation with distinction in battle and are now contributing \nto our Nation as civilian employees and as active members of their \ncommunity. I am\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n\ntalking about Federal workers like Robert J. Patterson, who was awarded \nthe Purple Heart medal and the Bronze Star and many other honors for \nhis service in Vietnam. He was ambushed and shot in the legs, the \nstomach and the shoulder while on patrol in Vietnam, but he still \nmanaged to call for backup and save the lives of many other members of \nhis squad. For nearly 20 years now, Mr. Patterson has worked as a \ncivilian employee for the Federal Government, and he now serves as Vice \nCommander of his local VFW post and is active with the Boy Scouts and \nas a mentor for troubled youth.\n  Dedicated Federal workers like Mr. Patterson take pride in their \nwork, love their country, and have served it with distinction for \ndecades. Nearly half a million Federal workers are veterans of our \nNation's armed services. Veterans are represented at twice the rate in \nthe Federal workforce as in the private sector. Disabled veterans, \nthose who have paid a great price for serving this Nation, are five \ntimes more likely to work in the Federal Government as the private \nsector.\n  On September 11, unionized Federal workers were on the scene and \nplayed critical roles at both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon \nas they worked round-the-clock to make our homeland secure. Denise \nDukes, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, worked a 24-hour \nshift in Washington on September 11 to ensure that food and water was \nreaching the rescue personnel at Ground Zero. Afterwards, she left her \ntwo children to go to New York and coordinate the response and recovery \neffort on the ground. As Ms. Dukes explains of her fellow Federal \nworkers: ``We were proud and eager to serve our fellow Americans, and \nwe would never allow anything to stand in the way of that mission.''\n  Michael Brescio, who works for the Environmental Protection Agency's \nResponse Team, got tens of thousands of urgently needed respirators to \nthe rescue workers at Ground Zero immediately after the attack. Far \naway in Kodiak, AK, Mark Andrew Jamison went on high security alert in \norder to protect our Nation's coastline. Mr. Jamison, a veteran of our \nNation's armed services who was entrusted with a top secret security \nclearance, loves his job because, as he put it: ``Above all . . . I'm a \npatriot like the hundreds of thousands of other Federal employees who \nkeep our country secure and safe day-in and day-out.''\n  We must protect the rights of these dedicated Federal workers to \nremain union members and we must allow other workers in the new \ndepartment to exercise their fundamental right to form a union.\n  Unions are critical to protecting our Nation's homeland security. \nMany Federal workers would not speak out about security lapses without \nthe protection of a union because of the legitimate fear of retaliation \nby their supervisors. After September 11, an 18-year veteran of the \nU.S. Border Patrol named Mark Hall bravely spoke out about the \nvulnerability of our Northern border after INS management ignored this \nconcern. Mr. Hall was threatened with being fired by the INS and faced \na 90-day suspension without pay for speaking out to protect the \nAmerican public.\n  The actions of Mr. Hall helped to make our borders safer. Congress \nsubsequently acted to triple the border patrol personnel on the \nNorthern border. Union membership was critical to Mr. Hall's ability to \nspeak out in the first place. As he explains, he ``would never have \nspoken out if I hadn't had my union behind me because whistleblower \nprotections alone would not have been enough.'' Federal workers who are \ndenied union rights will be far less likely to speak out and protect \nthe public in the future for fear of unjust retaliation. Denying \nFederal workers fundamental rights will undermine our Nation's homeland \nsecurity at a time when we can ill afford it.\n  The President now has the executive authority to exclude workers \nengaged in intelligence work or particularly sensitive investigative \nwork from basic collective bargaining. Past presidents have used this \nauthority sparingly, out of respect for government workers--even in \ntimes of war. They have barred collective bargaining only in highly \nspecialized and sensitive positions, such as U.S. Army Intelligence, \nNaval Intelligence, Naval Special Warfare Development Group and the Air \nForce Office of Special Investigations.\n  This administration has already demonstrated its intention to go far \nbeyond every past administration in its use of this authority. Earlier \nthis year, this Administration stripped clerical and other workers in \nthe Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's office of their long-\nheld union membership. After decades of dedicated service to this \nNation as union members, secretaries in the civil division of the U.S. \nAttorney's office were excluded from collective bargaining. These \nsecretaries were not involved in national security; they were \nprocessing claims by people injured on government property and others \nsuing over their denial of benefits. Nonetheless, this administration \nchose to deny these dedicated workers their fundamental rights.\n\n  We all know that this administration is not a champion of worker \nrights. They do not support a much-needed extension of unemployment \ninsurance benefits. They oppose an increase in the minimum wage for the \nmillions of Americans who work hard but still don't make enough to stay \nabove the poverty line. This administration opposes ergonomic \nprotections that would keep millions of workers from suffering \ndebilitating injuries while at work. Immediately after taking office, \nthis administration overturned rules requiring Federal contractors to \nobey our Nation's labor laws and undermined protections for Federal \nworkers. But how far is this anti-worker agenda going to go?\n  We have witnessed the bravery of these workers, their dedication to \ntheir country, their military service, their contributions to their \ncommunities. Yet, this administration displays a contempt for workers \nand particularly for the Federal workers who serve with dedication \nevery day to keep our Nation safe.\n  These unionized contract workers maintain the highest security \nclearances and do extensive work for the Department of Defense. Under \nthe administration's proposal, we could well see Federal workers \nworking alongside contractors with the federal workers being denied the \nsame fundamental rights and protections that the contractors continue \nto hold.\n  These are the very rights held by the brave firefighters and police \nin New York City who paid the ultimate price to protect others. They \nare the rights that allowed those courageous border patrol officers to \nspeak out and improve homeland security. It is essential that any \nreorganization respect and protect the rights of these, and thousands \nof other hardworking Federal employees, whose work is so vital to the \nnew Department's success and the Nation's security. Denying basic \nrights to those who strive and sacrifice to make us safer will not \nprotect homeland security.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle claim that union membership is \ninconsistent with service to our country. For example, Senator Gramm \nclaims that union workers kept Logan Airport's luggage inspection area \nfrom being renovated by the Customs Service. He claims that the \nrenovation had to be negotiated with the union as part of a collective \nbargaining agreement.\n  This is just one example of the many distortions being offered on the \nother side by those who want to deny dedicated Federal workers their \nfundamental rights. In fact, the collective bargaining agreement of \nthose dedicated Customs workers did not prevent the Customs Service \nfrom renovating the terminal. The union did not have the right to \nbargain over whether any renovation could take place. The agreement \nbetween these workers and the Customs service simply provided that the \nworkers should be notified of the change and be able to discuss the \nimpact of the particular implementation of the change. Since the \nworkers were not notified, the new construction was poorly done. It \nleft the Customs inspectors with an obstructed view, making it much \nharder for them to do their job well. The result was that the rate of \nCustoms seizures subsequently went down at the airport.\n  This case is a perfect example of how ignoring the front-line workers \nwho protect America day in and day out will not make us safer. These \nworkers want to do the best job possible each and every day. For that \nreason, they challenged the Customs service for failing to properly \nnotify and consult the\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\nworkers and won the case before the Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n  The real test of our core values come not during easy times but \nduring times of crisis. We must stand up for the right of free \nassociation and the basic protections for these dedicated Federal \nworkers. This is the real test of who we are as a nation. By being true \nto the values that make America great, we honor the sacrifices of \nAmerica's veterans even as we protect the security of our homeland.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, we have now entered the sixth week in \nwhich the Senate has been considering legislation to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security which all of us, most all of us, agree \nis urgently necessary because the current disorganization in the \nFederal homeland security apparatus is dangerous. This is the sixth \nweek, not all day every day, but parts of 6 weeks, beginning today.\n  Second, we are about to have the fifth opportunity to invoke cloture \non this bill, to stop the debate in deference to the urgent national \nsecurity interests in adopting this legislation.\n  I fear the majority of my colleagues are on automatic pilot in which \nthey are, once again, for reasons I consider to be peripheral, \nmarginal, and unknowing, insensitive to the fact that the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, and I and everybody else have acknowledged that on \nmore than 90 percent of this bill, we all agree. So we are prohibiting \naction on a matter of urgent national security importance because of a \nsmall disagreement.\n  There is a lot of interest in it. It means a lot to Members on both \nsides. Why not follow the leadership and independence of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania who has just said: My Republican colleague, this is \ntoo urgent a matter to delay any longer. I will vote for cloture.\n  There is nothing like cloture and the imminence of a vote on the \nunderlying bill to force the kind of compromise that we need to have in \nthe interest of national security and that we are so close to having.\n  Up until this time, largely through the good work of Senators Ben \nNelson, John Breaux, Lincoln Chafee, encouraged by a lot of us, there \nhas been a show of flexibility with regard to the protections for \nhomeland security workers and the President's desire for executive \nauthority, particularly in cases of national emergency, that Federal \nemployees and those who are concerned about their rights in the Chamber \nhave moved.\n  In fact, the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise moves back from the \nprotections for homeland security workers our bipartisan committee bill \nprovided.\n  I supported those compromises, and the Federal employee associations, \nworkers groups, unions also supported them because they know how urgent \nit is to adopt a homeland security bill.\n  The White House regrettably has moved hardly at all. The Senator from \nTexas who led the debate on the other side has moved hardly at all. \nThat is why we are at this impasse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I want to point out how hard \nthe Senator has worked on this, even before the President announced his \ncommitment to a Department of Homeland Security. The Senator worked \nthrough the Governmental Affairs Committee on a bill. There were long \nhearings and markups, and they brought it to the floor, and now for 6 \nweeks we have been on it. This is the fifth time we are going to try to \nbring debate to a close and a final vote.\n  I say to my colleague from Connecticut, if the Senate Republicans \nreject this effort to end the debate, I frankly think we ought to \nharken back to the Cub fans back in Chicago, who said: It is time to \nwait until next year.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Illinois for his kind comments. \nI hate to say it because, by nature, I am an optimistic and trusting \nperson. As we all know, the clock is ticking and the Senate is going to \nmove to debate on a resolution concerning possible military action in \nIraq. That means this will go back to the calendar. Will it ever \nemerge? I don't know. I would hate to think that will happen on a \nmatter of such critical national security interest. This is the \nprotection of the lives and safety of the American people we are \ndiscussing.\n  The evidence grows that the disorganization of the Federal \nbureaucracy contributed to the vulnerability that the terrorists took \nadvantage of on September 11. As I say, I am a trusting person. So I \nkeep asking myself, why won't the White House negotiate on these \nmatters? I have been reading and listening with alarm to some of the \nthings being said, and they trouble me because I worry now that we are \nbeing stopped from achieving an agreement on a matter that we agree 95 \npercent on, for reasons that have something to do with the election.\n  Last week on this floor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada introduced into \nthe Record an e-mail sent apparently to almost 2 million people on the \nRepublican National Committee mailing list that said the Senate is more \ninterested in special interests in Washington and not in the security \nof the American people, and we will not accept a Homeland Security \nDepartment that doesn't allow this President and--et cetera, et cetera, \nand then quoting President Bush. It also says the bipartisan approach \nis stalled in the Senate because some Democrats chose to put special \ninterests and Federal Government employees ahead of the American \npeople. That is untrue.\n  President Bush altered his rhetoric at the end of last week after the \neruption over that language and toned it down a bit--but still kept it \nin a political context. In Flagstaff, AZ, last week, reading from the \nWashington Post of September 28, the day before, the reporter Edward \nWalsh says:\n\n       The President today portrayed his differences with the \n     Senate over the creation of a Department of Homeland Security \n     as a struggle between common sense and business as usual, and \n     he urged the election of Republicans to help him implement \n     his idea.\n\n  Mort Kondracke reports yesterday Roll Call a conversation with our \ncolleague, the other Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, chair of the \nNational Republican Senate Committee:\n\n       In an interview, Bill Frist, chairman of the NRSC told me \n     he has no intention of turning Iraq into a campaign issue, \n     but every intention of doing so with homeland security.\n\n  Of course, it is the right of the Republican Party and the President \nto make an election issue out of anything they want to make an election \nissue out of, but this is a matter on which we should not be engaged in \npolitics. This is a matter on which we should be reasoning together to \nget over the small differences that remain on this question, to reach \ncommon ground and get this done. The Gramm-Miller substitute leaves out \nsome very critical parts that our committee put in. Senator Durbin has \na part on information technology. Of course we should support it. \nSenators Carnahan and Collins put in an amendment to create a COPS-like \nprogram for firefighters. There should be broad, bipartisan agreement \non that. I could go on. Senator Carper has a provision relating to the \nsafety and security of Amtrak facilities. None of those are in Gramm-\nMiller. If we can reach agreement on this question of protection for \nFederal Homeland Security workers and protecting also the President's \nprerogatives regarding national security, I would guess that the Gramm-\nMiller substitute, as amended by Nelson-Chafee-Breaux, would have a \nreal head of steam behind it and would probably find its way rapidly to \nthe conference committee.\n\n  Let me make this appeal to my colleagues on the other side. We are \nnot a unicameral legislature. The White House seems to be insisting \nthat we negotiate to the final point here in the Senate bill, and with \nthat stubborn intransigence they are blocking us from achieving all the \nrest that we want to achieve in terms of homeland security. We can pass \nthe bill here. It then goes to conference. The process continues.\n  So let's not have it reach a dead end here, which it is rapidly \napproaching, as we move on to the Iraq resolution and the probability \nof adjourning--or at least recessing--quite soon thereafter. I appeal \nto my colleagues--mostly Republicans, but some of those Democrats who \nvoted against cloture the first time on Gramm-Miller--to listen to the \nwords of the Senator from Pennsylvania. The best way to get this moving \nis to invoke cloture, force the compromises we need. Let's have the \nmeetings that Senator Thompson, Senator Specter and I have talked about \nwith Senators Nelson, Breaux, Chafee, and anybody else who wants to \ncome. This is an eminently solvable\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\ndispute, if we have the will to do it. Then we can go on to protect the \nsecurity of our people and dispatch our responsibility under the \nConstitution.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield that time to the Senator from Louisiana, \nunless the Senator from Tennessee wishes to go forward.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I think the Senator is right on target. We \nhave two differences of opinion about how to approach this matter, and \nthere is not a dime's worth of difference between the two. The easiest \nway to figure out how to reach a legitimate compromise is to vote \ncloture, and then we can negotiate what is the proper approach to this \nlegislation. If you read both offerings in this particular area, we \nwill give the President essentially the authority to take away \ncollective bargaining rights of American workers if they are related to \nnational security or threats of national security. We also basically \ngive him the authority to make management changes. I will address this \nquickly.\n  If you are going to make management changes, do you want the people \nwhose jobs are being changed to be involved in that decision or do you \nwant to take away their collective bargaining rights, one, and tell \nthem arbitrarily what they are going to have to do? What type of a \nworker are you going to have if you take that away and then not even \nlet them talk about what their duties are going to be. You are going to \nhave a very reluctant workforce, which is not in the interest of this \ncountry from a homeland security standpoint. We have suggested models \nafter the IRS, which say let them come in and negotiate, talk, and find \nout what their duties are going to be. If you cannot agree, we \nsuggested turning it over to a Federal board that the President \nappoints to resolve the conflict and let them make the decision. At \nleast the workers will have an opportunity to be heard. I don't think \nthat is asking too much when you have taken away all of their \ncollective bargaining rights.\n  This thing can be resolved. We are going to continue our meetings \nthis afternoon. We have taken 3, 4 weeks already and have not made a \nlot of headway. Perhaps we ought to appoint a Federal negotiating board \nto handle the Senate, and maybe we can resolve it that way because, \nobviously, right now we are not making progress. But we are going to \ncontinue our efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the issue here with regard to this \ncloture motion is whether or not the President of the United States is \nentitled to an up-or-down vote on his proposal to make this country \nmore safe. I repeat. The issue--and the only issue--on this cloture \nvote is whether or not the President of the United States, at this time \nin our history, is entitled to an up-or-down vote on his proposal to \nmake this country safer. I think the answer to that is yes and the \nanswer to cloture should therefore be no.\n  If there is not a dime's worth of difference between these proposals, \nI would like to think the President in this time in our history would \nbe given the benefit of the doubt on these issues, which our friends on \nthe other side say are really insignificant.\n  The Senator from Connecticut says the evidence mounts as to \nshortcomings of the Federal bureaucracy and that it contributed to the \nproblem we had on September 11. I could not agree more. My only \nquestion is: Then why are we not allowed to make some changes that \nmight improve the situation?\n  Gramm-Miller does provide for consultation. The implication has just \nbeen made that Gramm-Miller does not provide for consultation. Why \nshouldn't employees be brought in and enter into a dialog? It provides \nfor that.\n  However, the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux so-called compromise still puts \nadditional hurdles in the path of this President that other Presidents \nhave not had. For some reason, at this time, with regard to this \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we are putting forward additional \nhurdles and additional determinations this President must make that \nother Presidents have not had to make.\n  The Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise takes the issue of labor-\nmanagement and the issue of appeals off the table altogether and says: \nYou shall make no changes, regardless of the myriad indications we have \nhad where we have deficiencies in our system with regard to these \nissues.\n  There is no reason why these issues should take years and years to \nresolve. There is no reason why we should fiddle while Rome is burning. \nSurely we can do better, but this so-called compromise takes those \nissues off the table and out of the power to make any kind of \nadjustments. I suggest that is not a reasonable compromise. I suggest \nthe President is entitled to an up-or-down vote.\n  I agree with my good friend from Connecticut; we are in the last \nstages of this discussion. If we do not resolve this matter within the \nnext day or so, there will be no homeland security bill this year. That \nis a tragedy for this country. We apparently divided sides and decided \nwho benefits. That is the fact, and, therefore, I urge no on the \ncloture vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Gramm-\n     Miller amendment No. 4738:\n         Joseph Lieberman, Max Baucus, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, \n           Dianne Feinstein, Tim Johnson, Patrick Leahy, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Jack Reed, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jim \n           Jeffords, Debbie Stabenow, Daniel K.

I see my friend from Missouri is in the Chamber, and a \nnumber of other Senators.\n  Do any of the Senators wish to speak now?\n  I yield to my friend from Missouri for purposes of a question. Does \nthe Senator wish to speak now?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have a number of issues to speak about. I \nwish to speak in relation to a welcoming resolution, and then I have \nfurther remarks upon which I wish to expound.\n  I am happy to accommodate the floor leader's desire. I ask what his \nintentions are.\n  Mr. REID. My intention was that we go into a quorum call until the \nmajority leader appears on the floor. But maybe--and does the Senator \nfrom Louisiana wish to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. Thank you, I say to the assistant majority leader. \nI wish to talk about the West Nile virus for a few moments because it \nis an issue that is so important to Louisiana and many States.\n  Mr. REID. How long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Maybe 10 minutes. But we may not be ready. The House is \npassing their bill. I am kind of open to the time.\n  Mr. REID. How long does the Senator from Missouri wish to speak, \napproximately?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have one matter that will take 2 minutes \nand another matter that will take 10 to 15 minutes. And if nothing else \nis happening, I could go for another 20.\n  Mr. REID.

Her \nMajesty Queen Sirikit arrives here in Washington on Friday of this \nweek.\n  We know that Thailand and the United States have a shared commitment \nto peace, liberty, democracy, and free enterprise.

However, in such times of anxiety, it is \nimportant that we recall that the globe is populated much more heavily \nwith our friends than with our enemies and that, while we must face \nthose enemies, we should also pause to honor our faithful allies.\n  With this thought in mind, I take a moment to draw the attention of \nthe Senate to the Government and people of Thailand whose Queen, Her \nMajesty Queen Sirikit, arrives here in Washington, D.C. on Friday, \nOctober 4, 2002.\n  The United States enjoys a long and constructive relationship with \nthe people of Thailand, dating back to 1833 when the administration of \nPresident Andrew Jackson negotiated and signed the Treaty of Amity and \nCommerce in which the two signatories pledged to establish ``a \nperpetual peace'' between them. That treaty, the first such that the \nUnited States signed with any Asian nation, commenced a 169-year period \nof amicable, mutually beneficial relations.\n  Thailand and the United States enjoyed a shared commitment to peace, \nliberty, democracy and free enterprise, enabling us to cooperate both \nin the broadening and the protection of those values. Thailand is one \nof the only five countries in Asia with whom the United States has a \nbilateral security agreement. Furthermore, this country has a military \nassistance agreement with Thailand that was negotiated and signed \nfollowing the end of the conflict in the Korean peninsula. Each year, \nour armed forces join with the Thai defense establishment in military \nmaneuvers dubbed ``Cobra Gold''. These are the largest military \nexercises involving U.S. forces in the whole of the Asian continent.\n  We are all aware of, and deeply regret, the pain that many of the \nThai people have had to absorb following the recent retreat of many \nAsian economies. However, after implementing painful but necessary \nreforms, the Thai economy is clearly bouncing back, with a recovered \ncurrency and annual economic growth that could prove to be as high as 5 \npercent his year. The U.S. remains Thailand's largest export market \nwhile Thailand ranks 22nd as a destiny of U.S. exports. This nation has \nan aggregate investment of almost $20 billion, while 600 U.S. \ncompanies, large and small, are currently doing business there.\n  But I do not wish to talk solely of general U.S.-Thai relations. I \nalso wish to acquaint the Senate with the splendid humanitarian work of \nQueen Sirikit, who has worked tirelessly to promote the well being of \nboth Thais and non Thais alike. For the past 46 years she has served as \nPresident of the Thai Red Cross Society. In this capacity, she had to \naddress the massive humanitarian problems posed by the influx of 40,000 \nCambodian refugees as they flooded across the Thai border to flee the \nturmoil in their country. Many of those people lived for years in the \nKhao Larn Center that she set up to shelter, feed and care for families \nwith small children and unaccompanied orphans.\n  Her own people have similarly benefited from Her Majesty's close \nattention. To increase the income of the country's rural families, Her \nMajesty has initiated many projects, such as the Foundation for the \nPromotion of Supplementary Occupations and Techniques, better known as \nthe SUPPORT Foundation. This is certainly a model for other developing \ncountries as many are discovering to their cost that the early stages \nof economic development can often prompt a rush from the land to the \ncity that the nascent urban economy is often unable to bear. If \ndeveloping nations are to achieve sustainable growth, they will have to \nemulate Queen Sirikit's attention to the needs of the rural population.\n  I am by no means the first person to recognize Her Majesty's \naccomplishments. She has been awarded the prestigious CERES medal by \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Tufts \nUniversity has honored her with an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters \nin recognition of her work for the rural poor of Thailand. Her care for \nthe health of those same people has won her an Honorary Fellowship from \nGreat Britain's Royal College of Physicians.\n  I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in \nwelcoming Queen Sirikit to the United States. I understand that Her \nMajesty will preside over an event at the Library of\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\nCongress next Wednesday, October 9 during which the work and activities \nof the SUPPORT Foundation will also be exhibited and I look forward to \nseeing many of you there.\n  I have a resolution that I hope to be able to bring up which will \njoin with the House in extending the welcome of Congress to Her \nMajesty, the Queen. We look forward to discussing that with the leaders \non both sides. And I hope to be able to address that later on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9678-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9678-S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE INACTION\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think it is time that we take a look at \nwhere we are and determine what is happening in this body. We have not \ncompleted an energy bill, a Defense authorization bill, a terrorism \nreinsurance bill, a homeland security bill, or a bill to provide a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Even though we are beginning the new fiscal year today, this is not a \nhappy occasion. We have not considered a budget on this floor. We have \nnot completed and sent to the President a single 1 of the 13 \nappropriations bills. I fear that the President's pen may dry up before \nwe send him a bill to sign or veto.\n  Our distinguished former colleague and leader, Senator Bob Dole, once \nsaid:\n\n       I do believe we spend a lot of time doing very little, and \n     that may be an understatement.\n\n  Meanwhile, there are great needs. Our economy struggles. We have not \npassed a terrorism risk reinsurance bill that would put our \nconstruction industry back to work. We haven't passed an energy bill \nthat could put literally three-quarters of a million people to work in \nthe construction area, in the development of the goods and the \nproducts, the pipelines we need to secure our energy future.\n  The economy is a problem. This summer, the Governor of the State of \nMissouri announced that Missouri's relative job loss was the highest in \nthe Nation over the past year. There are measures pending before us \nthat have been recommended that we have not passed. Here we are, the \nfirst day of the new fiscal year, and we have not yet begun to debate a \nbudget that would be the framework for our appropriations bills. It was \nto be completed on April 15. We worked on it in the Budget Committee. \nIt was a contentious debate. But we said at the time that the bill that \nwas reported out of the Budget Committee was not one that could pass. \nUnfortunately, we were correct. It has not even been brought up.\n  The majority has not even brought up their own budget bill to be \namended or to be debated on the floor. Even if the bill is not perfect, \nwe should at least bring it up for debate so we can proceed to get a \nbudget. Since 1976, when the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 first \nwent into effect, this has never happened. This is the first time the \nSenate has not seen fit to consider a budget since the Ford \nadministration.\n  Historically, the budget resolution has been a difficult matter to \nresolve. On average, it has been adopted late some 40 days. It is never \npleasant. I see the distinguished former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee on the floor. He has fought many difficult battles, but he \nhas accomplished the purpose. And we passed a budget so we could pass \nappropriations bills; so we have some discipline. This one is over 5 \nmonths late and counting.\n  One of the key congressional responsibilities provided for in the \nConstitution remains unscheduled. Furthermore, as of midnight last \nnight, there are no budget enforcement provisions, no pay-as-you-go \nrequirements, no points of order against overspending. They are all \nrelaxed. As of today, all budget enforcement provisions have expired. I \nhope nobody will take this as an invitation to break the budget with \nmore directed spending.\n  On top of this, we have not completed a single appropriations bill, \nwhich was supposed to have been completed by midnight last night. We \nhave begun the fiscal year of 2003 with a record of zero for 13--not a \nvery good average. Only three bills have completed Senate consideration \nin appropriations.\n  We all know resolving spending matters is always difficult. There is \nalways someone else to blame. But clearly the Senate has not completed \nits most primary responsibility, which is expressing the will of the \npublic in the form of a budget. I understand in the last 8 weeks we \nhave not completed action and had a rollcall vote to pass a major piece \nof legislation. We have been on the Interior appropriations bill for 4 \nweeks. This is week 5.\n  In this case, we are making no progress because the majority will not \npermit the Senate to cast a vote on an amendment designed to prevent \nforest fires from destroying forests and homes and taking human life.\n\n  I know members of the Appropriations Committee are ready to bring \ntheir bills before the Senate for consideration. The chairman, Senator \nByrd, and ranking member, Senator Stevens, reported all 13 bills out of \nthe Appropriations Committee by the end of July.\n  The Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and I are ready to bring our \nbill to the floor to fund veterans and housing and the environment and \nspace and science and emergency management. Well, it is not there. We \ngo into the new year without any of these bills being passed.\n  I don't want to be confrontational with those managing the Senate, \nbut this is week 5 on a bill that should have taken 2 days. As someone \nwho has spent a lot of time in my few years working with the majority \nand minority and with the House and the administration resolving \ndifficult matters of disagreement, I know how difficult it is to \ncomplete spending bills. However, I fear this process is bogged down by \ndesign.\n  Last week, we were told we may have to vote on Saturday. But instead \nof voting on Saturday, we canceled votes on Friday and Monday. On the \nInterior bill, western Senators have an amendment to protect their \nforests and their citizens from fire. But the majority, apparently on \nbehalf of certain interest groups, will not permit the Senate to vote. \nWe should vote. That is our job. We vote up or down. We should vote, \nwin or lose. The whole purpose of this delay, regrettably, is to avoid \nvoting.\n  What is reprehensible is that the authors of the amendment to prevent \ndevastating, deadly fires--deadly to humans, to forests, property, and \nwildlife--are not even given an opportunity to get a vote. If we would \nvote, we could get to the remaining amendment, pass this bill, and move \non in the next day or two.\n  Some are suggesting--this I believe is outrageous--that the sponsors \nof the amendment should have to pull their amendment so we would not \nhave to vote. We have only cast 227 votes this year. I can't remember \nany year in my history where we passed so few. But this would be a good \ntime to pass another one. We could cast another vote and pass this \nbill.\n  The sponsors of this amendment have had people in their States die. \nThey have had millions of acres of trees, including old-growth trees, \nhabitat, and wildlife ruined, killed by fire, and houses burned. They \nhave a solution on which the Senate should have the courtesy, if not \nthe common sense, to vote. How poorly is the majority leadership \nwilling to treat Senators from these States?\n  The Senators and their constituents deserve a vote, period. If \nSenators want to vote against it, then do so. Senator Craig has not had \nthe opportunity to slip this provision into a conference report, so he \nis doing what the Senator is paid to do, which is to offer an amendment \nup or down and have a vote. Why can't we? Should the sponsors be asked \nto ignore their burning States and set their amendments aside or should \nthe people preventing a vote decide that the Senate should do what we \nare paid to do? To me, the answer is obvious.\n  We have been in session for over 4 weeks. The last 4 weeks, we have \ncast a whopping 19 votes, many of them on noncontroversial judges. I \ncompliment our colleagues from South Dakota for figuring out a way to \nprotect their State from fire. But I want others to have the same \nopportunity. I have farmers who want farm aid. The Senator from South \nDakota got his vote on farm aid. I voted for it. It was not germane to \nthe bill, it was not relevant to the bill, but I voted for it because \nit is important to farmers all across the heartland of America.\n\n  Why can't the Senators whose States are on fire or threatened to be \non fire have a vote? I haven't heard one good\n\n[[Page S9679]]\n\nexplanation as to why Members whose States are on fire should not be \nentitled to a vote. I would urge the leadership to explain to the \npeople of the western States that are on fire why they are not \ndeserving of a vote.\n  The amendment is pending. Let us vote. South Dakota got the \nprotection. Are California or New Mexico less important?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you think through the Craig-Domenici amendment, \nwhich was going to permit us to have a vote in reference to the \nthinning of forest accumulations in certain parts of the West to avoid \nfire, here is the logic: We won't let you vote. But do you know why \nthey won't let us vote?\n  Mr. BOND. I am puzzled why we can't get a vote on this commonsense, \nsound forest management plan. I defer to my colleague and ask for his \nguidance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two reasons: One, some of their Senators would have to \nvote for it because it is such a good amendment; they know some of them \nare yearning to vote for it so they get to vote. Secondly, if it got \nenough votes, they would have to filibuster it--``they'' being the \nother side of the aisle--because it would then be an amendment that the \nenvironmentalists who don't support it would insist that their Members \non that side vote against.\n  It is the strangest kind of filibuster you ever saw. It is a \nfilibuster so as to never let an amendment pass so that the majority \nwon't have to vote on it. And if it were to pass, they would have to \nfilibuster it. So they are clean and blaming us for the filibuster.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for the \ninformative discussion. Maybe they have the votes to defeat it. If they \ndefeat it, then there is no problem. But I have to say, having studied \nthis issue and having been added as a cosponsor of this amendment, as \none whose hobby and avocation is forestry and having talked to Forest \nService personnel in my State, to leading academic foresters from \ninstitutions in my State and across the West, this is just common \nsense. The foresters, the academic foresters, the professional Forest \nService people, know you cannot leave the fuel that sets off \ncatastrophic fires in the forests or you will have catastrophic fires.\n\n  In my State, we have not only oak decline and beetle infestation; we \nhave had tornadoes. They have knocked over trees. Guess what. It was a \nvery dry summer. These trees have dried out. A spark from lightning or \nany kind of manmade spark could set these off. Ours is not the biggest \nproblem. The biggest problems are faced by our colleagues in the West. \nI simply want to get an up-or-down vote. I know somebody might be put \nin a difficult spot. They have to either vote for their constituents \nand the safety of forests or for the environmental groups who don't \nseem to understand the problems that arise in the forests of the West. \nI daresay none of those groups live next to the forests, which could \nbecome a raging inferno if those fuels are not removed from the \nforests.\n  I think we are going to have to make a choice. Do we want to serve \nour citizens and protect the environment, prevent catastrophic forest \nfires or do we want to take care of politically active and well-\nfinanced interest groups? I can certainly understand the free speech \nand the desire for people in the environmental groups to have their \nviews and express them, but I don't believe we are obliged to skip a \nvote on the amendment because they oppose it. They have a right to jump \nup and explain their arguments and try to urge people not to vote for \nit. Senator Craig, Senator Kyl, Senator Domenici, and I would be happy \nto try to discuss that with anybody. But we have discussed it. It is \nabout time we vote. I think it should be resolved with a vote. They can \nmove to table and vote up or down. The effort of Senator Craig to \nprevent forest fires is worth the Senate's time and I would like to \nhear from somebody why it should not be voted on. We have lost forests \nthe size of New Jersey. Firefighters have died. South Dakota is \nprotected, but Idaho, New Mexico, Montana, Missouri, and other Western \nStates deserve to be protected as well.\n  I think we at least have a right to have a vote on it. I plead with \nthose objecting to permit us to do what the people sent us to do--cast \na vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield whatever time he has remaining?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to merely comment on the issue \nraised by my good friend from Missouri. I think the people in the West \nunderstand we are not being dealt with fairly. The Western States have \nthis large accumulation of debris and forests are burning down. Our \namendment would permit some help to those States where we see these \nenormous accumulations going up in flames. We could take that out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9679-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9679-S9680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEW FISCAL YEAR--2003\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Happy New Fiscal Year.\n  Mr. President, the new fiscal year began at midnight last night and \nnone of the 13 regular appropriation bills has been enacted. Over the \nlast decade, this has happened only two other times--in 1996 and last \nyear.\n  Now, one could make a good argument that the failure to complete any \nof the regular appropriations bills last year was completely \nunderstandable given the events of last September.\n  But I think the failure this year to complete any appropriations \nbills before the beginning of this fiscal year today lies squarely at \nthe foot of the Congress for not adopting a congressional budget \nresolution last spring.\n  There is a reason why we have a congressional budget process! And I \nthink if ever we needed an example of why we must not let this process \natrophy and die on the vine, this year is a good example of why we need \nthis process.\n  For the first time in the 27-year history of the Congressional Budget \nand Impoundment Control Act, the U.S. Senate did not consider and did \nnot adopt its own budget plan for this year.\n  To be completely accurate, we do have in place a congressional budget \nresolution but it is the one that I helped to have enacted in the \nspring of 2001. And that Fiscal Year 2002 budget resolution remains in \neffect until replaced with a new one, but I think we all know that the \neconomic downturn that became clear after that resolution was adopted \nand the attacks of last September have made many of the numbers in that \nresolution outdated for guiding fiscal policy here in the Congress.\n  Further, let us remember that many of the Budget Enforcement Act \nprovisions that were enacted in 1990 and extended in the negotiated \n1997 Balanced Budget agreement, expired at midnight last night.\n  I am talking about no appropriation spending caps for this year or \nbeyond. This will be the first time since 1987 that we have not had \nthese spending caps to help guide our budgeting and appropriation \nprocess.\n  I am talking bout no 60-vote points of order for violation of some of \nthe major points of order in the Budget Act. As I said, until replaced \nthe FY 2002 Budget Resolution with its 10 year numbers is still the \nenforceable resolution in the Senate even if the numbers in it are \noutdated. But as of today we can not even enforce that resolution with \nour normal 60-vote points of order.\n  We do not have our normal 60-vote point of order for pay-as-you-go \nviolations.\n  My colleagues will remember that the Senate has operated since the \n1990's with this deficit-neutral requirement and they will also know \nthat it was one of our most effective tools in our quest for balanced \nbudgets. In the absence of this pay-as-you-go enforcement provision \ntoday, any major tax or entitlement spending program could be \nconsidered without addressing the fiscal impact that legislation will \nhave on surpluses or deficits in the future.\n  Just for the record, in this 107th Congress alone, budgetary points \nof order have been raised in the Senate over 65 times. And on only 8 \noccasions did the matter receive sufficient votes--that is 60 or more--\nto waive the point of order.\n  I have helped draft with the Chairman of the Budget Committee, \nLeaders Daschle and Lott, and with the support of President Bush, a \nsimple Senate\n\n[[Page S9680]]\n\nresolution to extend these pay-go and other enforcement provisions that \nexpired at midnight last night.\n  We should adopt this resolution without delay; it is the least we can \ndo to keep some hope alive that the budget process will survive the set \nbacks this last year.\n  I think, as Chairman Greenspan--maybe I should say Sir Chairman \nGreenspan in recognition of his knighting last week--that we need to do \nat least this small resolution to send a signal to the markets and the \npublic that fiscal discipline has not been totally abandoned.\n  Again, today is the first day of a new year. October 1 is the first \nday of the new year under our budgets and it has been so for quite some \ntime. It used to be July 1. Everybody thought it was too soon, so they \nmoved it to October so there would be plenty of time. So it is the \nfirst day, but we don't have a budget resolution.\n  Today, we start a budget and start spending money--if we ever get \naround to it--under a budget that doesn't exist. I think it is time we \ndo that. Seeing the majority leader on the floor, I want to ask in a \nforthright way--because I know he is aware of this--when does he think \nwe might be able to take up the resolution I am going to introduce with \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee, the so-called pay-go \nresolution? I ask the leader, is that on his agenda somewhere? I would \nbe here to help him if there is anything I could do to move the time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As he knows, we have attempted to bring debate on \nhomeland security to a close now on 5 separate occasions. We failed to \ndo that again this morning. It was my expectation we were going to take \nup the budget enforcement mechanism prior to the time we moved to the \nIraqi resolution. That may be complicated now, in part, because I think \nwe need to get started on the resolution on Iraq prior to the end of \nthis week. But without any doubt, we will address the budget \nenforcement resolution the Senator has addressed prior to the time we \ndepart, prior to adjournment.\n  I have made that commitment to the budget chair and I have said it on \nthe floor on several occasions. I think it is essential. I have not \nheard all of his remarks, but I assume the Senator from New Mexico made \na similar statement. So we will make that effort. I am quite confident \nwhen we do, it will be successful.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That means before we recess, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It only has to be passed by the Senate, and we will \nhave extended the pay-go provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9680-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MOTION TO PROCEED--H.R. 2215\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

This does not displace homeland security on the \ncalendar. The regular order would be we would revert right back to \nhomeland security once the conference report has been disposed of, with \nno additional action required on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's explanation. I \nknow there have been some negotiations, though not as fruitful as we \nwould like, on homeland security, but I trust the negotiations will be \nongoing, and maybe we will have some success upon the conclusion of the \nDOJ authorization bill. I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

We have voted \nnow on cloture five times: Three times on the pending bill, the \noriginal bill, and twice on the Republican amendment--twice on the \nRepublican amendment.\n\n  I have offered the Republican leadership the opportunity for an up-\nor-down vote on the Republican amendment, and I am still told that is \nnot good enough. For the life of me, I do not know what else to do. But \nwe will continue to have cloture votes. We will continue to stay here. \nTo the extent we can, we will interrupt--and I use that word \n``interrupt'' as opposed to ``displace''--homeland security with other \npieces of business so we do not keep spinning our wheels.\n  If it is November 4, we will be here. If it is November 7, we will be \nhere. I have heard there are those on the other side who believe \nsomehow they can make this a political issue if we just drag it out and \nblame the Democrats. We are not going to do that. I think the record is \nabundantly clear who is holding this up. We will vote on it. We will \nvote on final passage at some point this fall. I just want to make sure \nmy colleagues all understand that.\n  This is the sixth week--the sixth week--we have debated this bill, \nand there are probably 70 or 80 amendments pending.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nSeptember 25, 2002.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor moving to the Department of Justice Authorization Act. This is the \nfirst one in 21 years. I note for my friend from South Dakota and my \nfriend from Nevada, this passed the House of Representatives 400 to 4. \nThe conferees, Republicans and Democrats, endorsed it unanimously. It \nshould be able to pass, I hope, easily here.\n  I spoke at some length yesterday about all the items that law \nenforcement has asked for in this bill.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is waiting to speak. \nI will take only a few seconds. I wish to emphasize again, this is \nlegislation that passed 400 to 4 in the other body. It has been \nendorsed across the political spectrum--law enforcement, antiterrorist \ngroups, schools, those small towns in rural America facing drug \nproblems. They are all looking for the adoption of this conference \nreport.\n  The high-tech industry is looking for the passage of the Madrid \nProtocol which is in the bill.\n  There are 20 new judge positions. Actually, we were trying to get \nthese authorized during the last 6 years of\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\nPresident Clinton's term, and they were blocked. Now with President \nBush in office, I put the same 20 in to show bipartisanship. They are \nback in there and should be passed. President Bush can nominate the \npeople for these positions. I cannot believe either side would hold us \nup.\n  I hope we will have a consent agreement for a limited amount of \ndebate at some point and then go to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Under the previous unanimous consent agreement that has \nbeen granted, the Senator from Louisiana has 10 minutes before we get \nto debate on this bill. It has been 21 years since this bill has been \nreauthorized, so I do not think anyone can criticize the Senator from \nVermont and/or Senator Hatch for taking a little time talking about \nthis bill. But it appears this is such important legislation that we \nwill probably have a rollcall vote on it, I would think.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope so.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from Vermont, does he have an idea how long \nhe and/or Senator Hatch will take debating this conference report?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I cannot speak for Senator Hatch, Mr. President, but I \nwill be happy to vote later this afternoon at 4:30 or so.\n  Mr. REID. It is quarter to 3 now. So within the next couple hours, it \nis likely we could have a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator asked for the yeas and nays on this yet?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, but I will. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my good friend \nfrom Louisiana for her usual courtesy and cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Utah for their very hard work over a \nlong period of time on this major piece of legislation. The vote was \noverwhelming in the House, and it is due to the bipartisan work that \nhas gone into crafting the reauthorization of the Justice Department. I \nlook forward to voting for that legislation later today.\n  I have been contacted by many of my sheriffs and law enforcement \nofficials and, of course, I have been particularly interested in some \nspecific aspects of the bill particularly dealing with violence against \nwomen and violence against children and child abuse and the good work \nthat the Department of Justice is doing to help our local counties and \ncommunities fight these terrible incidents that occur in our country.\n  My heart is heavy and very sad to say that just this last weekend we \nlost another child to child abuse in a horrific way. A little 7-year-\nold was stabbed to death in front of about 10 people by a deranged and \nvery sick individual who had threatened the life of this child's \nmother. The 7-year-old was trying to protect his mother and was killed \non the streets of New Orleans.\n  The Senator from Vermont knows well the great needs of the country \nregarding these issues. I thank him for working so hard on them.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, due to her good \nwork on the bill, of which she is a prime sponsor, reauthorization of \nthe Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is in this bill. It \ntracks the Leahy-Hatch-Kennedy-Landrieu bill.\n  We also have authorized funding for the Centers for Domestic \nPreparedness. I note that because it has been the persuasive \npersistence of my friend from Louisiana that has improved this bill so \nmuch, and I commend her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9681-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WEST NILE VIRUS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. While this \nunderlying bill is important, I wish to take a moment this afternoon to \nurge my colleagues to take up another bill that does not have the same \nbreadth and depth as the one that was just described. The people of \nLouisiana, and I might add, the people of Illinois--Senator Durbin has \nbeen working hard on this particular issue--and many other States have \nbeen severely affected by the West Nile virus. In fact, over 17 people \nhave died in Louisiana and over 2,400 people have been affected and \ninfected by this very frightening disease.\n  If we can manage today--and I have had discussions with the \nleadership--we are going to hopefully pass this bill by unanimous \nconsent, which will give grants to our counties and parishes in \nLouisiana to help their local officials do more effective pest \neradication, whether that is through traditional spraying or larvacide \ntechniques that are used to kill mosquitos at their various stages \nbefore they can attack human beings and carry this deadly disease.\n  The effects are quite frightening. People in my State are having a \nvery tough week. We had a terrible storm that was not a hurricane but \nnonetheless it was a very large and intense tropical storm. So the \nheadlines at home have been filled with storm warnings, storm \npreparations, and consequences of the storm management.\n  Now, in the gulf, we find ourselves facing yet another potential \nhurricane that is moving toward the shores of Louisiana. So this summer \nhas been a very anxious time between the storms and the West Nile virus \nat home where a lot of the parishes in Louisiana were affected. \nSeventeen deaths are quite extraordinary. I think it is the largest \noutbreak in many years. We are really struggling with providing some \nhelp to the local communities and parishes that, in fact, do have \nmosquito abatement control districts and, under normal circumstances, \ncan take care of those needs on a local level. But when something such \nas this breaks out, it is important for us to step up to the plate and \nhelp.\n  This bill will give local governments an opportunity to submit for \ngrants to take care of their businesses and to upgrade their \neradication programs. There are other parts of the Federal Government \nthat can be helpful in educating people about how to stay safe from \nthis virus, such as what to do, what symptoms it shows.\n  This bill that I hope we can take up today will provide hard dollars, \nnot for bureaucracies, not for a new Federal agency but to get grants \nto Georgia, the State of the Presiding Officer, and my State, for those \nlocal jurisdictions to get their spraying up to par and to do it in an \nenvironmentally safe way.\n  Hopefully, the worst is behind us, but we do need to prepare in the \nevent we have another outbreak. Getting this grant program established \nwill help us next year if this happens again.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider H.R. 4793--I am not asking that it \nbe called up at this time--which I hope we can pass by unanimous \nconsent later on today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9681-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9681-S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is important for us to understand where \nwe are on the homeland security bill. This is, obviously, a very \nimportant bill for the President. The President has outlined \nextensively his plan of organizing this agency.\n  The one thing he has asked is that he be given an agency that is \nworkable. The distinguished majority leader has pointed out there have \nbeen a number of cloture votes and we have not gotten cloture, so by \nthat he suggests that somehow this side of the aisle is the problem.\n  I believe it was June of this year that the majority leader promised \nhe would not fill up the tree. For those who may be listening at home, \nthat is a means of adding a number of amendments so that the other side \ncannot offer any amendments for a vote. Well, they filled up the tree \nto keep the President from getting an up-or-down vote on his proposal. \nAs a result, we have opposed cloture because it would have prevented us \nfrom getting to the President's proposal.\n  If we get to the President's proposal--and I hope we will--the \nmajority leader may have the votes to defeat it. But I think, since we \nare dealing with this subject in wartime, where we need to reorganize \nGovernment to make it flexible, to make it responsive, to make it \neffective in defending the homeland, we ought to give the Commander in \nChief at least a vote on his proposal.\n\n[[Page S9682]]\n\n  I believe my colleagues who have been working on the bipartisan bill \nthat reflects the President's proposals have taken some 25 different \namendments to accommodate the interests of Congress and various bodies. \nThe distinguished junior Senator from Georgia and the senior Senator \nfrom Texas have worked with the Senator from Tennessee on this measure. \nThey have gotten to the point where they have made compromises. It \ncomes down to the point where the President believes, and most of us on \nthis side agree, that he could not manage the Department effectively if \nhis hands were tied. Whether my colleagues want to vote on it or not, I \nthink it makes sense, out of common courtesy, if nothing else, to give \nthe Commander in Chief an up-or-down vote on his proposal.\n  As has been pointed out, the Senate bill does not include the \nmanagerial flexibilities the President needs to run the Department. His \nrepresentative, Dr. Falkenrath, stated we think the bill, as reported \nby the Governmental Affairs Committee, would create an extremely rigid \nbureaucracy. There would be a huge gap between the responsibilities of \nthe Secretary to integrate the units as to what it says in article 102 \nand actually do that in practice.\n  What it means is we set up a new Homeland Security Department that is \nsupposed to be fast and responsive, assimilate the information that \ncomes in from all the varying intelligence sources, and then develop an \nappropriate response. Unfortunately, too many elements of the \nGovernmental Affairs bill tie the President's hands and keep him or his \nSecretary of the Department from taking a responsive action to make \nsure the Department is responsive and effective in searching out and \ntrying to stop direct threats to the health, safety, and, frankly, the \nlives of people in America.\n  It was surprising to me that the bill even moved backward from where \nthis President, the previous President, the previous President, the \nprevious President, and so forth down the line, had the ability, in \nnational security interests, to make some of the changes in terms of \npromoting and rewarding exceptional employees, assigning them to the \nright duties and getting rid of employees who do not want to or are not \nable to do the service expected of them.\n\n  When we are talking about national security, it has been the long \naccepted practice that commanders have to be able to command their \ntroops. They are still protected by some 65 to 68 different provisions \nassuring there is no discrimination and a whole other range of \nprotections, but to give the managers the flexibility to manage the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is simply consistent with what previous \nPresidents have exercised for decades. The Presidents can use the power \nof Commander in Chief to make sure the military works. If somebody \nslacks off in the Army, does not show up for a job as a sentry, they do \nnot get 30 days of pay and a year and a half of appeals. They have real \nproblems right now, and that is because they are dealing with national \nsecurity.\n  I believe it is time we move on with homeland security. I was \ndelighted to know that the majority leader is committed to moving this \nbill prior to our adjournment. I want to go home as much as anybody \nelse, but the very simple way to do that would be to give us an up-or-\ndown vote on the Gramm-Miller, or Miller-Gramm, substitute, as amended, \nwhich reflects the President's views to accommodate the interests of \nthe reasonable requests made by Members of Congress and others who \nwanted to see changes in it.\n  We can pass this bill. All we ask for is an up-or-down vote. If we \nhave an up-or-down vote, those who favor the system that has been \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee may win or we may \nwin, but we certainly ought not hold up the bill simply to prevent a \nvote on what the President said is a critically important issue for \nnational security.\n  I believe the time has come to stop filling up the trees, trying to \ninvoke cloture to prevent a vote, trying to lock in an amendment that \nwould undercut the President's power before he has an opportunity to \nhave a vote on his proposal. That does not make any sense.\n  This body ought to show not only concern for the Commander in Chief's \nrequest but ought to respect the needs of the American people who must \nbe assured we are doing everything in our power to move forward on \nhomeland security with the Department that is effectively constituted \nand set up to carry out the responsibilities.\n\n\n                       Use of Force Against Iraq\n\n  We also have another important issue before the Senate. Before we get \nout of here, I hope very shortly, we will be moving toward a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force against the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein. Let's be clear about the intent. The resolution, that I trust \nthe House will adopt and we will adopt, should send a clear message to \nthe world community and the Iraqi regime that the demands of the United \nNations Security Council must be followed. Saddam Hussein must be \ndisarmed.\n  Previous administrations, both President Clinton and Vice President \nGore, have outlined the dangers that Saddam Hussein has posed. \nPresident Clinton made a very forceful statement in 1998 and then on \nMay 23 of 2000. The Vice President, Al Gore, said we must get rid of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Regrettably, the situation has gotten worse. Without inspectors, \nthere has been no check on the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We know from defectors and other intelligence sources he \nis moving forward on these issues. We know the Iraqi regime possesses \nbiological and chemical weapons. It is rebuilding the facilities to \nmake more. According to the report we received from British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair, he could launch a chemical or biological attack in \nas little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has \nlongstanding and continuous ties to terrorist groups. We know there are \nterrorists operating inside of Iraq. Members of al-Qaida and the Iraq \nGovernment have been in contact for many years. This regime is seeking \na nuclear weapon and the delivery capability to go with it.\n  Unfortunately, he has readily available other weapons of mass \ndestruction such as biological and chemical weapons. The Iraqi dictator \nhas answered a decade of resolutions from the United Nations with a \ndecade of defiance. In the southern and northern fly zones over Iraq, \ncoalition aircraft continue to be fired upon and coalition pilots \ncontinue to put their lives on the line just to enforce these \nresolutions.\n  Unfortunately, some elected officials went to Iraq this past weekend \nand said: We trust Saddam Hussein; we do not trust our President. They \nshould have watched what we have seen on television, the firing on the \ncoalition aircraft by Iraqi forces. In the last 2 weeks alone, \ncoalition aircraft have been fired on 67 times. Saddam Hussein claims \nto be willing to accept inspections. He wants to work with us. However, \n67 times he has tried to kill our pilots who are flying to enforce the \nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council.\n  As President Bush stated this past weekend, the Iraqi regime is led \nby a dangerous and brutal man. We know he is actively seeking the \ndestructive technologies to match his hatred. We know he must be \nstopped. The dangers we face will only worsen from month to month and \nyear to year. To ignore these threats is to encourage them. When they \nfully materialize, it may be too late to protect ourselves and our \nallies. By then, the Iraqi dictator will have had the means to \nmaterialize and dominate the region and each passing day could be the \none in which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX nerve gas or a \nnuclear weapon to a terrorist group.\n  The mantle of leadership requires this body to act. We have seen the \nUnited Nations speak loudly and carry a soft stick too long. I am \npleased to be able to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I believe we made reasonable accommodations in the resolution \nthe President has recommended. I hope we can have hearings on that \nresolution. We see the final words, get it passed by the House, and \npass it out of this body by a very significant majority vote of both \nparties. That is the clearest message we can send to the United \nNations, to our allies, to those on the fence, and to the malefactors \nof great evil who lurk in our world today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9681-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9681-S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, I rise today to address two timely \nissues.\n  It is with a heavy heart over the loss of two passengers on a \nGreyhound bus last night in California and the injury of several others \nthat I turn the attention of the Senate to bus security. This tragedy \noccurred when a passenger attacked the driver of the bus. After a \nheroic struggle upon being stabbed in the neck, the driver lost control \nof the bus. That is when the bus careened off Interstate 5. The alleged \nattacker was subsequently arrested by the police.\n  While terrorism is not suspected as the cause of the attack, no one \nknows what would have happened had the attacker gained control of the \nbus. Also, this attack occurs almost exactly 1 year after the October \n3, 2001, Greyhound attack in Tennessee that left 7 dead.\n  However, we have seen the all-too-often result of buses used to \ncommit terror attacks in the Middle East where suicide bombers have \nused buses to carry out their deadly work. Historically, between 1920 \nand 2000, about half of the terrorist acts in the world occurred \nagainst buses or bus companies. With intercity buses serving almost 800 \nmillion passengers annually in over 4,000 communities, I believe \nCongress must act to protect our travelers from being subject to the \nsame terror and safety concerns.\n  Last November, I introduced S. 1739 to authorize a 2-year grant \nprogram to improve the safety and security of buses. Funding could be \nused for safety improvements inside the terminals and on buses--for \nequipment such as metal detectors, database programs for sharing \npassenger lists, communication technology, cameras, and more. My \nlegislation passed the Commerce Committee earlier this year without \nopposition, but unfortunately, it has been stalled waiting for floor \naction. I urge my colleagues to clear this bill for passage by the full \nSenate today. We owe it to the families of those who have been touched \nby this tragedy, and we owe it to the millions of passengers embarking \non a trip or tour via bus service.\n  Also, the House companion legislation, H.R. 3429, has passed the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and is pending on the \nHouse floor. It has strong bipartisan support, including its sponsor \nCommittee Chairmen Don Young.\n  Congress has already expressed its approval for funding of such \nsecurity measures in the 2002 supplemental appropriations bill by \nproviding $15 million for bus security. My legislation authorizes the \nprogram at more adequate levels and provides much-needed congressional \ncommitment for implementation of the program. Intercity bus \npassengers--our fellow citizens--should feel secure and safe, and \nCongress should not stand in the way.\n\n  Additionally, I would like to ask my colleagues to examine the issue \nof access to technology, which is also important to protecting the \nsecurity of our people. Over 7 months ago the Commerce committee held a \nhearing on the so-called digital divide at our colleges and \nuniversities that serve the largest concentrations of the Nation's \nminority students. We heard compelling testimony that a significant \ntechnology gap exists for a majority of these students at a time when \nthe world economy is becoming increasingly technology driven. Only one \ntribal college has funding for a broadband connection, and it is not \nyet in place. At private historically black colleges and universities, \n75 percent of their servers and printers are obsolete or nearly \nobsolete and in need of replacement. Half of the HBCUs surveyed in a \nlandmark study 2 years ago by the Department of Commerce did not have \ncomputers available in the location most accessible to students--their \ndormitories. Hispanic students are almost 20 percent less likely than \nnon-Hispanic whites to have a home computer and almost 25 percent less \nlikely to use the Internet at home.\n  Curerntly there is no Federal program that provides funds to \nminority-serving colleges and universities for computer hardware and \nsoftware acquisition. S. 414, the NTIA Digital Technology Program Act, \nwould provide this critically needed resource for America's under-\nrepresented and educationally disadvantaged minorities in higher \neducation. It has been lauded as the most significant tool for \naddressing the infrastructure and instrumentation needs of the Nation's \nminority-serving institutions since the reauthorization of title III of \nthe Higher Education Act. It is a bipartisan bill sponsored by 18 \nSenators from both sides of the aisle. The bill was reported \nunanimously by the Senate Commerce Committee in May and also enjoys \nbipartisan cosponsorship and support in the House of Representatives.\n  In the ever-expanding world of the information highway, it should be \nour mandate to work to ensure that no one in this country is left \nbehind-least of all our leaders of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9683-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 414\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

Madam President, there is another matter that is extremely \nimportant for small businesses in this country; that is, the high cost \nof health insurance.\n  I have, along with my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, \nintroduced a measure to authorize association of health plans so small \nbusinesses can come together in trade associations or other multistate \nbodies with similar interests to purchase their health insurance with a \nlarge pool.\n  If you purchase as an individual or as a very small business, it is \nlike going into the store and buying soda one can at a time. You can't \nget a very good price. It also costs you a lot more in administrative \ncosts to administer that plan if you are the sole administrator. From \nthe health insurance standpoint, you don't share the risks over a broad \ngroup of people so that you can make an actuarially sound determination \nof how much health insurance costs.\n  We have seen health insurance costs rising all across the Nation.\n  Early last month, I hosted my second National Conference for Women \nand Small Business Owners in St. Louis. And not surprisingly, some 72 \npercent of them said providing health insurance, which is extremely \ncostly, was one of the most important challenges they face.\n\n  We also found another statistic that I found very amazing. We have 39 \nor 40 million people without health insurance in the country today. \nThat is far too many. But did you know that 60 percent--roughly 24 \nmillion of those\n\n[[Page S9684]]\n\npeople--are either employees, employers, or members of the families of \npeople employed in small business? Some 24 million people are without \nhealth insurance today because their chief breadwinner belongs to a \nsmall business that cannot afford health insurance.\n  I think that is just too many. The high costs of health insurance \nhave made it difficult for small businesses to get the health insurance \ncoverage they need. They do not have the bargaining power. They cannot \nspread the administrative cost. They cannot spread the risk. Basically, \nthey cannot get as good a deal as a large corporation or a union or the \nGovernment can get.\n  We are very fortunate, as Federal employees, to have access to the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program. That is because we have a \ngreat big pool and we can bargain to get the best rates and we have \nchoices from health insurance providers. Those choices are not \navailable to small business. So we have developed a plan, with the full \nsupport and leadership of the President, to authorize establishing \nassociation health plans. The time has come for those health plans to \nbe set up by legislation.\n  On Monday of this week, we found that there has been a jump in the \nnumber of those Americans without health insurance. It is extremely \ntimely.\n  Yesterday, I understand, the Secretary of Labor wrote to the majority \nleader and asked that we bring up and try to pass association health \nplans. It has already been passed by the House. It is just sitting \nhere.\n  We need to pass it. I hope before we get out of here--I hope that is \nOctober 11; I am not sure from what the majority leader said whether we \nwill make it by October 11--but before we go, I hope we have a vote on \nassociation health plans.\n  The Secretary of Labor has said this is the highest priority. And the \nSecretary of Labor would be the one who would regulate these plans to \nmake sure they do not cherry-pick, that they are financially sound, and \nthat they meet the requirements of the law.\n  The law is carefully structured to prevent picking out only healthy \ninsured groups. You could not set up a group of fitness instructors, \nfor example, in a health plan because that would take the lowest risk \npeople and give them an unfair advantage over others, when health \ninsurance is supposed to spread the risk over a broad population.\n  Association health plans are just one, but a very important, step we \nneed to take in assuring that a significant number of those 24 or more \nmillion Americans who do not have health insurance get it.\n  This is something I have heard from small business groups, as I have \nlistened to them in my State and across the country, in forums of all \nsizes. We get e-mails. We do not get letters very often; they still get \nheld up in the radiation process, but when we do get letters, they are \nstill talking about the high cost of health care.\n  Association health plans are one way we could give small business the \npower to deal with the high cost of health insurance. I have spoken to \nmy colleagues about this before. This has been an item of great \ninterest in our Small Business Committee. I hope more colleagues will \nlook into this question of getting adequate and affordable health \ninsurance coverage through association health plans.\n  The President has made a very strong and clear statement in favor of \nassociation health plans. I would hope this body could follow the \nleadership of the House of Representatives, which has already passed \nthe association health plan legislation. This would be something very \nimportant we could do for small businesses and their employees and \ntheir employees' families.\n  Madam President, I am happy to respond to questions from my \ncolleagues to provide them further information. I invite their \nattention and I hope we can get action on that measure.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. Seeing no one seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, I was interested to read in today's \nWashington Post an editorial urging us to move forward on the election \nreform bill. This bill has been championed by Senator Dodd, the \nchairman of the committee, and Senator McConnell, the ranking member. I \nhave had a role in some antifraud provisions.\n  The Florida elections of this year seem to have brought more \nattention to the need for election law reform. The conclusion of the \nWashington Post is that:\n\n       At a time when voter turnout is at an all-time low, \n     bolstering public confidence in the machinery of democracy is \n     especially urgent.\n\n  I agree with that. That is why I worked so hard to see if we could \nget a bill passed that would do that. We need to make it easier to vote \nand tougher to cheat. Unfortunately, what we saw in Florida this year \nwas the old truth: No matter how much appropriations in or what kind of \nlegislation you have, if you have incompetence in local election \nofficials, incompetence trumps everything. We know there were \ntremendous problems this year in an area where there were problems in \n2000, even though they had new machines.\n  Nevertheless, we have worked on a bill that has many compromises and \nhas a good structure for getting the kind of equipment we need to \nimprove elections, providing additional safeguards, voting machines for \nthose with disabilities and, in my view, the very important role of \npreventing dead people, nonexistent people, and dogs from voting.\n  Many of my colleagues don't want to hear me talk anymore about Ritzy \nMekler, the dog that was registered in Missouri. Unfortunately, Ritzy \njoins a very distinguished group of dogs registered to vote around the \ncountry because motor voter does not have protection against phony \nregistration.\n  We spent more than 7 months last year negotiating a bill. We brought \nit to the floor. There was some backsliding. We got it passed late this \nwinter. It has been stalled in trying to work out the final details.\n  I have been discouraged because I have worked with the leaders from \nthe other side on the bill to offer some compromises. We want to get \nthe bill passed. I believe, along with Senator McConnell, that we have \nproposed reasonable means of dealing with the problems they have. \nUnfortunately, the negotiations at the staff level have been stymied. \nEvery time we get the wheelbarrow full of frogs, we find, as we try to \nwrap up the final details and get the final frogs in, some of the frogs \nhave jumped out of the wheelbarrow.\n  Election reform is another bill that is long overdue for passage. I \nsee my colleague from Kentucky in the Chamber who has been a champion \nin this area. I appreciate working with him and Senator Dodd. I hope we \ncan work with our colleagues on the House side, if we will just move \nforward and deal with some very important protections against more \nfraud in voting.\n  Since I see the manager of the bill is ready to go, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9684-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9684-S9685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the homeland security bill is being \nheld up because some labor unions want to put their special interests \nahead of the collective interests of the Nation's security. Remember, \nthese unions are not fighting against any increase in the President's \nauthority to override collective bargaining agreements in the interest \nof national security. No, they actually want to roll back this \nauthority that every President has had and has used since President \nJimmy Carter.\n  How do union special interests affect national security? Here are \njust a few examples:\n  In 1987, a union objected to renovating border protection areas at \nLogan Airport--the same airport used by the 9-11 hijackers.\n  In 1990, a union prevented the INS from adding extra immigration \ninspectors in the Hawaii airport because it might affect the overtime \npay of existing workers.\n  In 2000, a union objected to a Customs Service drug interdiction \nalong the Florida coast because it would interfere with vacation days.\n  Let me say that again. In 2000, a union objected to a Customs Service \ndrug interdiction along the Florida coast simply because it would \ninterfere with vacation days.\n  So why are our colleagues on the other side advancing the labor \nunion's agenda? Well, let's take a look at this chart. Four of the five \nmajor public sector unions who are publicly pushing for the Lieberman \nbill have showered over 93 percent of their campaign contributions to \nDemocrats. The fifth contributed 87 percent.\n  Here are the top contributors supporting the Lieberman bill: American \nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees contributed 99 \npercent of their funds to Democrats; American Federation of Teachers, \n99 percent; International Association of Fire Fighters, 87 percent; \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, 93 percent; and National \nTreasury Employees Union, 94 percent.\n  When it comes to the accusations of linking campaign contributions to \npolitical payoffs, my Democratic colleagues and their friends in the \nmedia continue to believe influence pedals down a one-way street. \nRemember the energy bill? You could hardly sit down to breakfast in the \nmorning without reading about how Republicans were shamelessly catering \nto big oil and big energy interests at the expense of the environment. \nThese accusations have blared forth from every corner of the media \nestablishment. The New York Times--surprise, surprise--on several \noccasions editorialized about big money driving the energy bill, \nessentially viewing it as a payoff to oil companies and their friends \nin the administration, which include ``the biggest and dirtiest \nutilities.''\n  The Boston Globe judged a House-passed energy bill as ``little better \nthan the one cobbled together by Enron, other utilities, and big oil \nfor the Bush administration.''\n  The Fort Worth Star ominously warned of the ``propriety of allowing \nbig contributors to shape public policy to their personal benefit.''\n  The Greensboro, North Carolina News and Register declared ``clearly \nsomething is wrong when big business shapes the nation's energy \npolicy.''\n  This rhetoric also blared forth from my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who charged this bill was ``crafted behind closed doors,'' \nand that it ``looked like the Exxon-Mobil report,'' and that Exxon-\nMobil, Enron, and Chevron enjoyed an excess bonanza at the expense of \nconsumers.\n  Finally, the rhetoric blares out of our television sets every \nWednesday night at 9 o'clock on the ``West Wing,'' a 60-minute \npolitical commercial masquerading as a television drama. On the \npremiere last week, the pretend president proclaimed, ``The Republicans \nare busy. They are trying to convince us that they care about new \nenergy and that they are not in the vest pockets of big oil, and that \nis a tough sell.''\n  He then charged, ``This isn't the time for people whose doomsday \nscenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco and Shell. This isn't \na time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives just \nbecause they can't think of any. This is the time for American heroes, \nand we reach for the stars.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is a gift from NBC and GE to the Democratic \nParty, financed by millions of--you guessed it--corporate dollars. That \nis what the ``West Wing'' has been. I hope Senators don't dispute these \ncorporations have a right to express political opinions. I do not \nbelieve political donations dictate public policy. In fact, I have been \nvigorously involved throughout my career defending the right of all \nthese entities to contribute to the candidates of their choice and say, \nthrough issue advocacy, whatever they choose to say during the course \nof a year.\n  But as long as people are going to make that charge, they ought to do \nit evenly. For those who do believe contributions impact policy, then \nlet's, in the name of basic fairness, apply the same scrutiny to unions \non the homeland security bill that the New York Times, NBC, and my \nDemocratic colleagues applied to energy companies on the energy bill. \nIf they did, here is what they would find. The biggest public sector \nunions--American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; \nthe American Federation of Teachers; International Association of Fire \nFighters; the American Federation of Government Employees; and the \nNational Treasury Employees Union--give almost 9 out of every 10 cents \nto Democratic candidates. Their agenda to weaken the President's \nnational security powers is being advanced by the beneficiaries of \nthose contributions. But we are hard-pressed to find anybody or any \nhotly accusatory stories in the New York Times or on CNN.\n  Remember, Madam President, when corporate corruption called for a \ncorporate accountability bill, unions--many of which were knee-deep in \nfinancial corruption themselves--rallied to block a very modest \namendment to require better disclosure, simple disclosure on union \nfinancial reports.\n  So where are the editorials in the New York Times? Where are they \nconnecting the dots and condemning the specter of influence peddling? \nWhere are the rants from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nagainst the influence-peddling of big union bosses? Where is that \nepisode of the ``West Wing''--you know, the one where the pretend \npresident tells Josh and Sam, above the obligatory orchestral \ncrescendo, how much he yearns for ``American heroes'' to sever the \nmenacing hold unions have on the homeland security bill?\n  I could settle down in my favorite chair every Wednesday night at 9 \np.m. waiting for that episode, but I am not a fool. My mother didn't \nraise any children as fools. I know that would be a wait in vain, for \nthere are too many other Republican bogeymen to expose, too many \nconservative policies to mock with the elitist derision only Hollywood \ncan muster, too many ways to stage easy political victories that real-\nlife Democrats are simply unable to win in Congress because too many \nhard-working Americans do not believe in them.\n  I call on my colleagues to put aside the pet grievances of the labor \nunions and return to the task at hand because I just don't see how any \nof us can go home and explain to the families in our States we may be \ngiving the President less power to protect them than he had before \nSeptember 11.\n  So it continues to be my hope we will be able to get an up-or-down \nvote on the President's homeland security bill. It seems to me that is \nnot asking too much. I know the Senator from Texas, and others, have \nspent an enormous amount of time to see to it the President's proposal \nat least gets an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in opposition to \nthe Lieberman Homeland Department proposal and in support of the Gramm/\nMiller, administration-supported, bipartisan substitute. As Senator \nGramm and others have so ably demonstrated, the Lieberman proposal \ntakes away the President's existing authority to exempt personnel in \nthe new department from collective bargaining requirements when \nnational security requires it. The substitute reinstates the \nPresident's authority in this area.\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\n  While I understand that those on the other side might have a \ndifferent political agenda than the President of the United States on \nthis, time has almost run out. If we don't soon get together and \nacknowledge the importance of passing a bill to allow Government to \nbetter deal with the threat of terrorism, Congress might adjourn \nwithout passing anything. After 6 weeks of Senate floor consideration, \nthat would be a shame.\n  Under the Lieberman approach to providing labor flexibility to the \nPresident when it comes to issues of national security, the President \nwould be better off with the agencies as they exist, coupled with his \nauthority, from an administrative or executive point of view, to move \npeople around within those agencies; he would be better able to achieve \nhis goals without any legislation than by adopting the legislation that \nis before us or under the amendment being proposed by the Senators from \nNebraska, Rhode Island, and Louisiana.\n  The labor issues that we must settle in this bill are extremely \nimportant, but I believe they are moving the debate far from some of \nthe other important differences between the Lieberman homeland bill and \nthe Republican homeland, Gramm-Miller, substitute. As the Senate \ncontinues to consider the homeland security proposal pending in \nCongress, I want to reemphasize the relatively few, but very important \nchanges, that the Republican substitute makes to address border and \nimmigration security concerns raised by the Lieberman substitute.\n  ``Division B'' of the Lieberman bill creates the ``Immigration \nAffairs Directorate,'' with an undersecretary to oversee all \nimmigration functions of the U.S. government. ``Division A'' of the \nLieberman bill, among other things, creates the ``Border and \nTransportation Protection Directorate,'' with an undersecretary to \nmanage all activities and policies related to border and transportation \nsecurity.\n  Under Division B, all immigration functions, including all \nimmigration enforcement functions--intelligence, investigations, \ndetention, border patrol, and border inspections--are under the \n``Immigration Affairs Directorate,'' informally referred to as the \n``Immigration Affairs box.'' The problem with this approach is that it \nleaves a gaping hole in the ``Border and Transportation box.'' One of \nthe biggest priorities of the Bush administration, and of the Congress, \nhas been to create a more streamlined border, both along the U.S.-\nMexico and U.S.-Canada border. The Lieberman bill, by refusing to move \nthe Border Patrol and border inspections functions out of the \nImmigration Affairs box and into the Border and Transportation box, \nwill only exacerbate the coordination problems that currently exist at \nour nation's southern and northern border. Most importantly, \ncoordination of personnel and the sharing of security information will \nbe compromised.\n  Mr. President, all of our Nation's immigration enforcement functions, \nincluding intelligence, detention, and investigations, have border \ncomponents and could arguably be better placed with the undersecretary \nfor Border Protection. At the very least, I repeat, the Border Patrol \nand Border Inspections functions should be included in the Border and \nTransportation box.\n  Instead, in the Lieberman proposal, a bare-bones, almost meaningless \n``Border and Transportation'' box is created. It includes Customs, but \nmaintains that Customs is its ``own distinct entity'' so that Customs \ncan continue to operate almost independently of the Under Secretary of \nthe Border and Transportation Directorate, Coast Guard--again as a \ndistinct entity, divisions of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC. \nWithout including Border Patrol and border inspections as a function of \nthe Border Protection Directorate, this ``box'' will not effectively \nstreamline much border activity at all. Another ironic point is that \nFLETC is included in the Border Protection box. FLETC trains Border \nPatrol agents and yet the Border Patrol is not included in the Border \nProtection box.\n  Mr. President, the Republican substitute, or Gramm-Miller substitute \nas it is known, in this area is a much wiser approach--it includes the \nBorder Patrol and Border Inspections functions in the Border and \nTransportation Directorate. This will allow for better coordination of \nresources and elimination of duplicative functions at the border. \nProtecting our borders is one of our first lines of defense against \nterrorism, and we must get it right.\n  Another major problem with Division B, ``Immigration Affairs,'' of \nthe Lieberman bill is its inclusion of language that would abolish the \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review and create within the \nDepartment of Justice what amounts to an independent agency for \nimmigration judges.\n  Immigration law is complicated. There is a process by which you have \na decision made, a review of that decision, and eventually the final \nreview all the way up the chain into the Department of Justice by the \nAttorney General of the United States. There is a body of case law \nbuilt around this. There are procedures that are built around it. As \nfar as I know, those procedures are working. I do not know of any \nreason, for homeland security, why we would want to change that.\n  It seems at the very least that the Lieberman language, which \ndesignates when and how this new Executive Office for Immigration \nReview operates, needs to be changed so that the checks and balances \nthat exist today with respect to EOIR will continue to exist--the \nGramm-Miller substitute maintains this check by keeping the currently-\nexisting authority for review of EOIR decisions with the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Mr. President, one of the most critical functions of the \nreorganization of agencies that deal with our homeland security is the \nborder function, and we must get it right. Let's work to pass the \nGramm/Miller substitute, which, among the numerous other important \nimprovements, incorporates two important border/immigration changes to \nthe pending Lieberman homeland bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nspeak in support of an amendment that Senator Baucus and I introduced \nwhich modifies the Customs provisions of the homeland security bill.\n  The creation of a Department to oversee homeland security is a \ntremendous undertaking for Congress and the White House which will face \nmultiple challenges. This is certainly true in the context of \nincorporating the U.S. Customs Service into the new Department.\n  The U.S. Customs Service is one of the oldest agencies in the U.S. \nGovernment. Created in 1789 to enforce U.S. tariff policy, the agency's \nmission has continually adapted to meet the changing needs of our \nNation.\n  Today, it is one of the most modernized agencies in the U.S. \nGovernment, responsible for managing over 23 million entries and 472 \nmillion passengers a year. It collects over $23 billion dollars in \nduties and fees and is responsible for seizing millions of pounds of \ncontraband narcotics every year. The Customs Service is a vital \ncomponent of our Government.\n  Given the importance of the agency in facilitating international \ntrade and law enforcement, I think we have an obligation to do \neverything we can to enhance the effectiveness of the new Department as \nit moves from Treasury too Homeland Security.\n  That is why I, working closely with Senator Baucus, developed a \nseries of recommendations regarding the Customs Service which we \npresented to the Committee on Governmental Affairs early in the process \nof developing this bill.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senators Lieberman and \nThompson for incorporating the vast majority of our recommendations \ninto the homeland security bill. I especially appreciate the collegial \nand bipartisan spirit in which the recommendations were developed and \nadopted by the committee. I think we will have a much better product \nbecause of our joint efforts.\n  The additional changes we are offering to the bill will further \nenhance the effectiveness of the Customs Service as it moves into the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The ability of the Customs Service to effectively facilitate \ninternational trade while at the same time perform its law enforcement \nfunctions is in large part due to the cooperative relationship which \nthe Customs Service has with much of the international trade community. \nThis cooperative relationship benefits both parties and has\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\nbeen developed over a long period of time. By understanding the \nbusiness community and how international trade actually works, the \nCustoms Service is much more adept at identifying anomalies in trade \npatterns that often point to illicit activity. I want to make sure \nthese relationships are not lost with the transfer of the Customs \nService to Homeland Security.\n  Part of the key in maintaining this traditional cooperative \nrelationship is to maintain the advisory elements on which they are \nbuilt. This means carrying forth such committees as the Treasury \nAdvisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the Customs Service, \nor COAC, to the new Department of Homeland Security. This is precisely \nwhat our amendment does.\n  I also want to make sure the international trade functions of the \nCustoms Service continue to receive adequate resources to continue \ntheir work. A good example of this is the continued construction of the \nautomated commercial environment, or ACE. Currently, the automated \ncommercial system is the only comprehensive mechanism to monitor trade \nflows. Yet it is antiquated and subject to periodic slowdowns. We must \ndo better.\n  That is why I strongly support rapid and efficient deployment of ACE, \nthe automated commercial environment. The ACE system will be key to \nfacilitating economic trade in the future. We must make sure than, even \nin these times of tight budget constraints and intense focus on \nhomeland security, we continue to provide Customs with the funds needed \nto get the ACE system up and running. A well-functioning automated \nmechanism for monitoring trade flows will help facilitate international \ntrade and help Customs more effectively perform its law enforcement \nfunctions.\n  Our amendment establishes a new account within the Customs Service \ncalled the Customs Commercial and Homeland Security Automation Account. \nFor fiscal years 2003 through 2005, $350 million in Customs user fees \nwould be allocated specifically to this account. Creation of this \naccount will ensure that sufficient funding is available to complete \nconstruction of the automated commercial environment ACE after Customs \nmoves from the Department of the Treasury to Homeland Security.\n  As we move forward in enhancing our border security efforts, it is \nimportant to keep in mind that a large part of homeland security is \neconomic security. And, international trade is a critical component of \nour economic security. Exports alone accounted for 25 percent of U.S. \neconomic growth from 1990-2000. Exports alone support an estimated 12 \nmillion jobs. Trade also promotes more competitive businesses--as well \nas more choices of goods and inputs, with lower prices. If we impede \ntrade, we impede our own economic growth and our own well-being.\n  The tragedy of September 11 make it clear that the United States must \nbe at the forefront in developing the border technologies and \nenforcement methodologies which will enable our economy to prosper and \ngrow in the new global environment. We cannot afford to do any less. A \nnation which master the competing goals of international trade \nfacilitation and border security will be a nation which can confidently \nembrace new world trading system. It will be a nation which prospers \nwell into this new millennium. I stand ready to work with my colleagues \nand President Bush to make sure our Nation rises to meet this \nchallenge.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson, and \nothers to protect the rights of the thousands of Federal employees who \nwill be transferred to the proposed Department of Homeland Security, \nand to express my opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Gramm and the Administration's efforts to lessen those \nrights.\n  The employees of the 22 agencies that are slated to be reorganized \ninto the Department of Homeland Security are on the front lines of the \neffort to respond to and investigate the September 11 attacks and to \nprevent further acts of terrorism. These dedicated men and women, who \nhave served the American people during this uncertain time, are about \nto undergo a professional upheaval while at the same time being \nexpected to maintain their high level of performance. This massive \nreorganization should not be used as an excuse to take from these \nemployees the one constant that they expect would follow them to their \nnew department: the Federal civil service protections which they all \nhave in common, regardless of their current home agency.\n  The civil service system was put into place in order to end the \ncorrupt patronage system that had permeated government hiring and \nadvancement. The creation of a new department should not be used as an \nexcuse to roll back these protections and plunge these workers into \nuncertainty regarding their professional futures.\n  I am concerned that the administration appears ready to use the \ncreation of this new cabinet-level department as an opportunity to \neliminate or weaken the civil service protections currently in place \nfor the Federal employees who would be transferred to the that \ndepartment. Unless it is amended by the Nelson amendment, the pending \nGramm amendment would have this effect of weakening these civil service \nprotections.\n  Some in the administration and some on this Senate floor have argued \nthat the civil service system is rigid and could prevent the new \nSecretary from acting quickly in the face of an imminent threat. This \nis not the case. The existing civil service system already provides the \nadministration with broad flexibility, while at the same time ensuring \nthat Federal workers have a consistent framework of basic protections, \nincluding appeal rights. This flexibility is important in an issue as \ncritical as our Nation's security, but the underlying Lieberman \nsubstitute and the Nelson amendment would provide the flexibility \nneeded.\n  Supporters of stripping these protections also have argued that the \nnew Department should be allowed to scrap the existing system because \nthat system has some problems. The ongoing debate over civil service \nreforms should not be used as an excuse to allow the Department of \nHomeland Security to be the only Federal department with employees who \nare not covered by this system.\n  I regret that the administration has issued a veto threat against the \nSenate Homeland Security bill as reported by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee because it ensures that the approximately 170,000 federal \nworkers slated to be transferred to the new department would retain \nbasic civil service protections. Civil service protections level the \nplaying field for Federal workers, ensuring that they are treated \nequitably. To propose to treat workers in one department, many of whom \nhave had these protections for years, differently from their \ncounterparts in other departments would undermine seriously the entire \ncivil service system.\n  No one, including the President, has demonstrated how maintaining \nthese basic protections could jeopardize our national security. We can \nprotect both our country and the rights of our workers. In fact, we can \nbetter protect our country if our workers' rights are well-protected, \ntoo. The United States affords its workers some of the best labor and \nemployment protections in the world. But a wholesale elimination of \nthose rights under the guise of homeland security would send exactly \nthe wrong message.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska would grant the \nnew Secretary of Homeland Security expanded authority to create a new \npersonnel system while still ensuring that the rights of workers are \nprotected. This compromise will help to ensure that workers have input \ninto the structure of any new system that is created. As a number of \nour colleagues have said, it would be harmful to worker morale and to \nworker-management relations to simply foist a new system upon these \nworkers without their input and then expect them to accept it.\n  In addition to basic civil service protections, the Nelson amendment \naddresses the issue of collective bargaining. I support the right of \nworkers to join a union and I am troubled that the administration \nappears poised to strip existing union representation and collective \nbargaining rights from many of these workers. I also am troubled by the \nimplication that union membership is somehow a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  The Nelson amendment would allow workers who are covered by existing\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\ncollective bargaining agreements to keep those rights. It does not \nhamper the ability of the new Secretary or the President to remove \ncollective bargaining rights from individual workers or newly-created \nagencies within the department if there is a valid national security \nconcern. Simply being an employee of a department with the word \n``security'' in its name is not sufficient cause to be stripped of \ncollective bargaining rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nelson amendment and to oppose \nthe Gramm amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9688-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9688-S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT--\n                      CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad we are on the Department of \nJustice authorization. As I said earlier, I appreciate the fact the \ndistinguished majority leader moved to it. This is actually a very \nimportant bill. At a time when it seems so much good legislation is \nbeing stalled, it would be a shame if this was, too.\n  I know since January of last year Senate Democrats have tried to \nbridge the gap and make bipartisan progress on campaign finance reform, \ncorporate accountability, and a real Patients' Bill of Rights, and a \nnumber of bipartisan anticrime, antidrug, antiterrorism bills. We \nworked with the administration after September 11 on the USA Patriot \nAct; we passed that in record time. We created the September 11 \nvictims' trust fund and we enhanced border security.\n  We tried to work as supportive partners in the effort against \nterrorism. Throughout that effort in the Judiciary Committee, we rose \nabove the bitterness and partisanship that had been exhibited by my \npredecessors during the last 6 years of the previous administration. We \nhave held more hearings on more judicial nominees and held more \ncommittee votes on them and confirmed more judges in 15 months than the \nRepublicans were willing to confirm in the last 30 months when they \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  I emphasize that for the 30 months prior to the change in the control \nof the Senate, the Republicans controlled the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee during both the time of President Clinton and President Bush. \nIn the 15 months we have been in control--it has been only with \nPresident Bush--we have put through twice as many judges in 15 months. \nWe put through more judges in 15 months than they did in 30 months.\n  I mention this because some at the White House, who should know \nbetter, talk about the holdup on judges but do not like it when they \nare reminded that we have done more under President Bush than they did \nfor both President Bush and President Clinton during a period twice as \nlong. It is an interesting point.\n  I remember Adlai Stevenson once said to some of his Republican \nfriends: If you promise to stop talking lies about us, I will stop \ntalking the truth about you. But I find the statements and statistics \ncontinue, so I thought I would throw a little truth on the matter.\n  I mention this because we have tried to go more than halfway. As I \nsaid, during 15 months, we moved more judges than the Republicans did \nduring 30 months. We have reached out in order to pass legislation from \nour committee--and the distinguished Presiding Officer is a valued \nmember of that committee--and passed out piece after piece either \nunanimously or by a strong bipartisan majority. We passed intellectual \nproperty legislation, consumer legislation, anticrime legislation, \nantidrug legislation, but then mysterious Republican holds came up and \nstopped them.\n  Here are some of the bills we passed out of the committee that have \nbeen held up on the Republican side: the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act; \nthe Hatch-Leahy Drug Abuse Education Prevention and Treatment Act; the \nDREAM Act, championed by Senators Durbin and Hatch; a charter amendment \nto the Veterans of Foreign Wars, something totally without \npartisanship. We passed it unanimously, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington State knows. We passed out a charter amendment to the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, a nonpartisan request. We cannot get it \nthrough the Senate because it is being held up on the Republican side \nof the aisle.\n  We passed out a charter amendment for AMVETS, a wonderful veterans \norganization. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I voted for it \nand it was voted unanimously out of our committee. It is being held up \non the Republican side of the aisle.\n  We passed out a charter amendment for the American Legion. Every \nDemocrat voted for that. Every Democrat has agreed: Move that through \nthe Senate. It is being held up on the Republican side.\n  Now we find there is a Republican hold on the Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act. This is the first one in 21 years. It \npassed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 400 to 4. The chief \nsponsor is a leading Republican Member of the House.\n\n  We strengthen our Justice Department, increase our preparedness \nagainst terrorist attacks, prevent crime and drug abuse, improve our \nintellectual property and antitrust laws, strengthen our judiciary, and \noffer our children a safe place to go after school. It is a product of \nyears of work.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for bringing this up for a vote. Let me \nshow my colleagues some charts. This is not a hodgepodge where one \nmight go in and look as to whether you wear a green tie or paisley tie \nor drive a blue car or a black car; this is something that really \naffects Americans.\n  It was passed by the House of Representatives. If it is allowed to \ncome to a vote, it could pass easily in this body: border security, \ndomestic preparedness, suppression of financing terrorism treaty.\n  Let me mention the last part. We worked this out with the Bush \nadministration. They said there is a difficulty in following the money \nused by terrorists around the world. We know how quickly President Bush \nand Secretary O'Neill moved after September 11 last year to freeze the \nassets of some of these terrorist groups, and I commend the President \nfor that action; I praise the President for doing that. But I wish the \nPresident now would tell his own party that we have the legislative \ntools that President Bush has asked for to go after the money of \nterrorists, and it is being blocked on the Senate floor by a Republican \nhold.\n  Let's pass this. Let's do what we all know has to be done. This is \nnot partisan--grabbing the money of terrorist organizations that are \nafter the United States. That is not a Democratic or Republican issue. \nBut when every single Democrat said they will vote to go after that \nmoney, it is time for the anonymous Republican who has a hold to let us \ngo forward.\n  Let me show a few other items that are in the bill. We improve law \nenforcement. We have FBI reform and FBI agent danger pay. Some of these \nFBI agents are working in some of the most dangerous places, especially \noverseas. Sometimes their mere presence targets them for assassination. \nThis is agent danger pay. We ought to be doing that.\n  The Body Armor Act is something every law enforcement agency from \nwhich I have heard wants to protect police officers from those who \nwould attack them. I cannot understand why this is being held up on the \nother side. We ought to go forward with this bill. We ought to pass it. \nWe ought to tell our law enforcement officers that we will help them.\n  Senator Carnahan's Law Enforcement Tribute Act is in this \nlegislation. It authorizes grants to States, local governments, and \nIndian tribes for memorials to honor killed or disabled officers while \nserving as law enforcement safety officers. How can anybody oppose that \nwithout looking terribly political? Senator Carnahan deserves credit \nfor this bill.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Sessions joined in a bipartisan effort \non the Body Armor Act. That should be allowed to go through.\n\n  Then we have some ways to stop crime from happening in the first \nplace. We reached a bipartisan agreement to give the Boys and Girls \nClubs the funds they need for 1,200 additional clubs across the Nation. \nNext to motherhood and apple pie, I cannot imagine anything that should \nhave more support than helping the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. We \nhave an excellent one in Burlington, VT. I know it very well. It just \ncelebrated its 40th birthday.\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\n  I remember that Boys and Girls Club back in the days when I was \nState's attorney. I know those kids who went there had a place to go, \nhad a place to learn, had a place to gather, had a place to \nconstructively work, and were not the kids who got in trouble. They \nwere not the ones I saw in juvenile court. They were not the ones who \nmade our crime list. They were the ones who made the star list in our \ncommunity.\n  I mention this because Senator Hatch and I went to the Boys and Girls \nClub congressional breakfast honoring the regional youth of the year. \nWe also honored Senator Thurmond. I heard, and I know they were \nsincere, Republican Senator after Republican Senator come forward and \nsay we have to authorize and expand the Boys and Girls Clubs. All \nright. Let's do it.\n  Last week, we offered to pass this bill on a voice vote to zip it \nthrough. We polled every single member of this side of the aisle. They \nwere all in support of that Boys and Girls Club authorization, as they \nwere the Body Armor Act and the help for law enforcement. Every single \nDemocrat was ready to vote for it. We were willing to have it go by on \na voice vote. An anonymous objection came from the Republican side.\n  I know in an election year some politics gets played, but not with \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs and not with the Violence Against Women \nOffice. We want to increase Federal focus on this tragic and recurring \nproblem. Preventing domestic violence is not a partisan issue.\n  I remember going into the emergency rooms of our hospitals at 3:00 in \nthe morning when I was in law enforcement. I saw the results of \ndomestic violence. I saw women beaten so badly that even though we had \nan idea who may have beaten them, they could not even tell us through a \nbroken jaw, swollen lips, and bloody faces. I saw that. I saw domestic \nviolence even in a bucolic State like mine, but the amount of domestic \nviolence is the same in every State.\n  It was not just those battered individuals I saw in the emergency \nroom--at least we had hopes they would be brought back to health. We at \nleast had hopes that medical care would return them to their ability to \nfunction--I still have nightmares sometimes of some of the others I \nsaw, but I didn't see them in the emergency room. I saw them one floor \nup in the morgue.\n  This happens in every single State, and I never heard a police \nofficer say: I wonder if this victim is Republican or Democrat. The \npolice officer said: Why don't we do something to stop it?\n  Here is a chance to do something. Let's vote for it.\n  The Crime Free Rural States Grants, we have crime in our cities, but \nwe also have crimes in our rural areas. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer was Governor in one of our finest States, a State that is a \npart of the American heartland, a State I have had the pleasure of \nvisiting.\n  In fact, there were Leahys who moved out to Nebraska in the 1850s \nwhen my great-grandfather and his brothers came over from Ireland, some \nstaying in Vermont, some staying in New York and others going to \nNebraska. I know how beautiful a State it is, and I know there are both \ncities and rural areas. I know how hard the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer as Governor fought against crime in both areas. He knows, as I \ndo, that crime is a fact of life in rural areas. It is sometimes more \ndifficult to fight because there are not all the needed resources \navailable. It might be a small sheriff's department. The chief of \npolice may be the whole police force.\n\n  We can help. This legislation authorizes programs that will reduce \ndrug abuse and recidivism, mandatory, to increased funding for drug \ntreatment in prisons, to funding for police training in South and \nCentral Asia. These proposals are not Republican or Democrat; these are \nbipartisan. Most of them were in the Hatch-Leahy Drug Abuse Education, \nPrevention and Treatment Act.\n  Drug courts, drug-free prisons, reauthorizing the Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention Act--one of the saddest things is going to \njuvenile court and seeing 12- or 13-year-old boys and girls who are \nalready recidivists, people who have committed crimes that one would \nthink a child that age would not even know about.\n  In going back through the reports, there are steps that could have \nbeen taken 2, 3, or 4 years before that might have prevented that. Now \nthese boys and girls are people who are probably going to end up in an \nadult jail somewhere, lost to society and lost to themselves. We should \nhave stopped it. That help is in here.\n  That is one of the reasons the House of Representatives, facing some \nof the same kind of partisan divisions that we face in this great body, \npassed it 400 to 4. I do not need to tell the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer the need for these kinds of investments. He has had the \nexperience both as a Governor, a Senator, and a parent. He knows what \nwe have to do, just as I do. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's set aside \nthe partisanship for a while and let's do something.\n  There are intellectual property provisions in this bill. We are in \nthe United States seeing an enormous loss of jobs. In the last 2 years, \nwe have had the biggest drop in jobs that I can remember, the largest \nnumber of layoffs we have seen in years. The economy is in a tailspin. \nThe stock market has had a greater drop than at any time since the \nPresidency of Herbert Hoover. If anything, we should be helping \nAmerican innovators and businesses, both big and small. We want these \nbusinesses to prosper. We want these businesses to be able to compete \non a worldwide scale. We want these businesses to hire the people of \nNebraska, Vermont, South Dakota, New York, California, Florida, \nArizona, Alabama, and all our other States. So we put in the Leahy-\nHatch Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.\n  What this does is the sort of thing that the President and all the \npeople around him say we need, something to simplify life for \nbusinesses. We would implement a treaty to allow American businesses to \nhave one stop for international trademark registration which they can \ndo only to countries that sign on to the protocol.\n\n  American businesses and companies that need to protect their \ntrademarks if they sell their goods and services in international \nmarkets, especially over the Internet, would be helped by this \nlegislation. Every single business leader I have heard of, regardless \nof their political background--from chambers of commerce, to business \nleaders, Republicans and Democrats alike--say pass this bill.\n  I checked on this side of the aisle. Every single Democrat is ready \nto vote for it right now. It has been held up for over a year by a \nRepublican hold. I say to some of the businesses, talk to the Members \nof the Republican Party. The Democrats are ready to pass it.\n  We have another provision in the TEACH Act, an exemption that allows \neducators to use the same rich material of distance learning over the \nInternet as in face-to-face classrooms. Let me state why that is \nimportant. In rural areas--such as Nebraska or Vermont--there may be a \nnumber of small schools that cannot each support a library and \nsometimes cannot afford a teacher in a specialized area such as \nscience, history, or math. Together they can, but you have to link \nthem. So copyright laws apply. We worked that out. This is a no-\nbrainer. It will help the kids. It should be a no-brainer for the \nSenate to pass.\n  We reauthorize and modernize the Patent and Trademark Office and give \nthem funds they need. When I hear the baloney that comes out of the \npolitical people in the Attorney General's office and the White House \nabout judges, this would be the one they should want. There are 20 new \njudges included to be appointed by President Bush. For a little bit of \nhistory, this is more than were created during the 6-plus years that \nthe Republican Party controlled the Senate. The Clinton administration \nwanted to create these judgeships. They wanted to create new Federal \njudicial positions, and they were blocked by the Republicans. I \nbelieved the judicial positions were needed when President Clinton was \nPresident. I thought it was wrong that the Republicans stopped us from \ndoing that. I did not want to do the same thing to President Bush that \nthey did to President Clinton. Two wrongs do not make a right. So it \nwas included. These are Federal judges in States we know are Republican \nand will be chosen by Republican Senators--in Arizona, Alabama, Texas. \nWe include them just the same.\n  Why did that not pass last week? One may wonder, finally, having \nblocked it\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nfor 6 years during the Clinton administration, now they have 20 judges \nPresident Bush may appoint--one may wonder why it has not been passed \nby a Democratic-controlled Senate. The Democratic-controlled Senate \nwanted to. But I will tell you the secret: A Republican Senator held it \nup. That is what happened. I hope no one comes down and says, We need \nmore judges. We have 20 judgeships included, mostly in Republican \nStates.\n  There are a lot of other provisions, including the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act. A lot of western Senators want that. We get into \nimmigration matters. I talked a lot about rural areas.\n  Let me talk about the rural underserved medical areas. Every Senator \nhas rural areas in their State. My State happens to be predominantly \nrural. But even the States of New York, California, Texas, and Illinois \nhave large rural areas. It is very hard sometimes to get doctors into \nthose areas. If you have someone injured in a farming accident, there \nmay not be a doctor. That injured person may die for want of needed \nmedical treatment. You may have a woman in a difficult childbirth. She \nmay die or her baby may die for want of medical care. There may be an \nelderly person who just needs a certain amount of preventive care to \nlead a happy, productive life. We have worked on the visa provisions of \nINS to allow doctors from outside this country to serve in rural areas: \nExtend their visa providing they will stay in rural areas and help \nwhere there is a need. It allows grandparents to apply for citizenship \non behalf of orphaned children, grandparents who saw their \ngrandchildren orphaned in the tragedy of last September 11. These are \nsome items included.\n\n  This is as much a bipartisan piece of legislation as I have seen in \n28 years. The people supporting this legislation are wide ranging. By \ngolly, I just happen to have a chart. Let's see who is in favor of \nthis: Boys and Girls Clubs of America; the Coalition for Juvenile \nJustice; the Fraternal Order of Police; Family Violence Prevention \nFund; National Automobile Dealers Association; National Association of \nCounties; National Association of Police Organizations; National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence; National Mental Health \nAssociation; National Network to End Domestic Violence; Presbyterian \nChurch, Washington office; Volunteers of America; U.S. Council for \nInternational Business; National Association of Manufacturers; the \nInternational Trademark Association; American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation; U.S. Copyright Office; the American Library Association; \nAssociation of American Universities; American Research Libraries; \nIntellectual Property Owners Association; American Intellectual \nProperty Law Association; Avon Products; Nintendo; Warner Brothers; \nIBM--I could go on. That is about as broad a cross section supporting \nthis as we will see in the Senate.\n  I am not sure what game is being played. I urge my good friends on \nthe other side of the aisle to come forward, belly up to the bar, pay \nthe price, pass the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \nletters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n         Boys and Girls Clubs of America,\n                                Rockville, MD, September 27, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to you today in regard to \n     H.R. 2215, the 21st Century Department of Justice \n     Appropriations Authorization Act. As you know, in addition to \n     the many other critical components of the bill, H.R. 2215 \n     authorizes continued funding to Boys & Girls Clubs of \n     America, so that we may continue our aggressive growth \n     efforts in disadvantaged communities throughout the country.\n       Today, thanks in large part to Congress, Boys & Girls Clubs \n     of America is serving more than 3,300,000 youth in more than \n     3,200 Clubs. We are located in all 50 states, and now have \n     more than 420 Clubs in public housing and 120 Clubs on Native \n     American lands. We are located in inner-city, and rural \n     communities throughout America playing a vital role in the \n     development of our children.\n       During the past 5 years, we have grown by more than 1,000 \n     Clubs and 1,000,000 new youth served. The Congressional \n     funding that we have received is matched at least dollar for \n     dollar nationally, brining true public-private partnerships \n     to communities all over America.\n       Senator, we thank you for your strong support of Boys & \n     Girls Clubs of America, and ask that you move quickly and \n     decisively in passing the 21st Century Department of Justice \n     Appropriations Authorization Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Mr. Robbie Callaway,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National \n           Network to End Domestic Violence; Family Violence \n           Prevention Fund; Now Legal Defense and Education Fund,\n                                               September 26, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: As national organizations working to address \n     the varied needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence \n     and the service providers in the field, we urge you to \n     support the Violence Against Women Office in the Department \n     of Justice by voting in favor of the Conference Report of \n     H.R. 2215, the 21st Century Department of Justice (DOJ) \n     Appropriations Authorization Act.\n       As you know, the Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) was \n     created in 1995 to implement the Violence Against Women Act \n     of 1994 and to lead the national effort to stop domestic \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Because ending \n     violence against women is an on-going struggle, it is \n     imperative to statutorily authorize the Violence Against \n     Women Office in order to institutionalize policy development, \n     observe trends, raise awareness, serve as a crucial resource \n     for the Attorney General, prosecutors, police and other \n     community agencies, and provide technical assistance. In \n     addition, the Office ensures federal dollars under the \n     Violence Against Women Act of 2000, passed by Congress with \n     overwhelming bi-partisan support, are administered in the \n     most effective manner possible to best serve victims and end \n     violence.\n       With strong bi-partisan support, both the House and the \n     Senate have passed H.R. 2215, which would statutorily \n     establish a strong VAWO. On behalf of all victims of domestic \n     and sexual violence and the service providers who help them, \n     we thank Congress for this strong statement from our federal \n     government that violence against women will not to tolerated. \n     As you know, it is critical that the statutory creation of \n     the Violence Against Women Office reflect the essential \n     components of the office. Currently, VAWO is part of the \n     Office of Justice Programs--the grant-making body of the \n     Department of Justice. However, VAWO cannot serve as the \n     leader in promoting the changes needed to effectively serve \n     victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and \n     trafficking if it is merely a grant-making office. VAWO needs \n     the authority to create policy regarding violence against \n     women and needs to have a Presidentially-appointed, Senate-\n     confirmed Director, in order to ensure that these issues \n     continue to have a high profile on local, state, federal and \n     international levels.\n       The Conference Report of H.R. 2215 accomplishes this and \n     creates a separate and independent Violence Against Women \n     Office in the Department of Justice, under the general \n     authority of the Attorney General. We urge you to lead the \n     way for a safer nation for women and children by voting in \n     favor of the Conference Report of H.R. 2215, the 21st Century \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) Appropriations Authorization Act.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact us at the numbers listed below.\n           Sincerely,\n     Juley Fulcher,\n       Public Policy Director, National Coalition Against Domestic \n     Violence;\n     Lisa Maatz,\n       Vice President of Government Relations NOW Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund;\n     Lynn Rosenthal,\n       Executive Director, National Network to End Domestic \n     Violence;\n     Kiersten Stewart,\n       Director of Public Policy, Family Violence Prevention Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                               September 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I am writing to support Senate passage \n     of H.R. 2215, the Department of Justice Reauthorization Act. \n     The members of the Business Software Alliance work with a \n     variety of Justice departments to reduce software piracy and \n     to ensure a safe and legal online world in this heightened \n     cybersecurity environment.\n       The legislation strengthens our nation's criminal justice \n     system and increases the frequency and quality of reports to \n     Congress. Effective criminal enforcement requires both \n     initiatives by prosecutors and timely action by the courts. \n     BSA is particularly supportive of funding for the enforcement \n     of our nation's intellectual property laws in Section 101 and \n     the related reporting requirement contained in Section 206. \n     The robustness of our nation's tech sector depends in part \n     upon\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\n     the strength of the laws that govern intellectual property as \n     well as the enforcement of such laws. Until recently, there \n     have been few criminal copyright cases brought by the \n     Department. Simply put, there is nowhere else to turn if the \n     federal government does not enforce our nation's intellectual \n     property laws.\n       We appreciate the longstanding efforts of Congress to \n     strengthen our nation's criminal laws and make our nation's \n     intellectual property laws a catalyst for growth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Robert W. Holleyman, II,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 27, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our support of \n     the inclusion of the modified versions of H.R. 1900 and H.R. \n     863 in the conference report on H.R. 2215, legislation to \n     reauthorize the Department of Justice. The undersigned \n     members of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n     Coalition appreciate your efforts to approve a \n     reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 that retains the \n     rehabilitative principles of our juvenile justice system.\n       In particular, we appreciate your efforts to preserve \n     current law in several key areas that has been working well \n     for more than 25 years to ensure that youth in the juvenile \n     justice system are protected from abuse and assault by adults \n     in adult jails. The modified version of H.R. 1900 codifies \n     the separation protection for youth, which requires that \n     states prevent all contact between juvenile and adult \n     inmates, including any `sight or sound' contact. The proposal \n     also drops a harmful provision that would have permitted \n     children to be placed in adult facilities with parental \n     consent. This provision represented a radical change from \n     current law and would have resulted in children being \n     unnecessarily placed in adult jails.\n       The revised version of H.R. 1900 also includes an \n     appropriate concentration on prevention through the \n     restoration of the Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Grant \n     program. In order to ensure that children stay out of trouble \n     and on the right track, a significant investment in and \n     emphasis on prevention, particularly primary prevention, is \n     crucial. The Title V program is an effective model of \n     community collaboration in which community stakeholders--\n     including locally elected officials, law enforcement, school \n     officials, public recreation, private nonprofit \n     organizations, and youth workers--come together to develop a \n     plan for juvenile delinquency prevention. Working in more \n     than 1,000 communities nationwide, Title V is currently the \n     only federal program providing delinquency prevention funding \n     to communities through a flexible, local prevention block \n     grant approach to help communities reduce juvenile \n     delinquency and related problems and enable young people to \n     transition successfully into adulthood.\n       Finally, we are pleased that H.R. 863, legislation to \n     authorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JAIBG), \n     has also been included in the conference report. Never \n     authorized, the JAIBG was created in the FY98 Commerce \n     Justice State Appropriations bill to provide states and units \n     of local government with funds to develop programs to promote \n     greater accountability in the juvenile justice system. Under \n     H.R. 863, the program purpose areas are expanded \n     significantly to provide additional services and treatment \n     for troubled youth. By supporting these additional purposes, \n     JAIBG will provide needed resources to proven strategies for \n     rehabilitating adjudicated youth and families as well as \n     reducing juvenile re-offense rates.\n       We appreciate your continued efforts on behalf of children \n     and youth and look forward to final approval of H.R. 2215.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; \n           American Civil Liberties Union, Washington National \n           Office; American Probation and Parole Association; \n           American Psychological Association; Bazelon Center for \n           Mental Health Law; Child Welfare League of America; \n           Children & Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity \n           Disorder (CHADD); Children's Defense Fund; Coalition \n           for Juvenile Justice; Education Fund to Stop Gun \n           Violence; Justice Policy Institute; National \n           Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n           (NAACP); National Association of Counties; National \n           Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; National \n           Education Association; National Mental Health \n           Association; National Network for Youth; National \n           Recreation and Park Association; Presbyterian Church \n           (USA), Washington Office; Volunteers of America; Women \n           of Reform Judaism; Youth Law Center.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we don't have one of the leaders on the \nfloor at the present time. I was going to ask that we proceed to a \nvote. But I am not going to do that until the other side is represented \nhere. But I know everyone on this side is ready to vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the distinguished committee chairman \nis on the floor, Senator Leahy, I would like to ask him a couple of \nquestions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. We are now on this conference report. It is my \nunderstanding that it passed the House 400 to 4. We moved to this a \ncouple of hours ago. Does the Senator know of any opposition to this \nmatter on either side of the aisle?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell my distinguished friend, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, that I checked. I know his office also checked on \nour side of the aisle. Everybody is in favor. We were told that the \nDemocratic side of the aisle wanted to let it go through in wrap-up \nlast week. I am told there is a lot of legislation in here sponsored by \ndistinguished members of the Republican Party who support it. But the \nhold has been a continuing hold on the Republican side. I can't \nunderstand why. This is as close to a motherhood bill as I have seen \nhere in years.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the chairman of the committee, that it \nwould seem to me that at an appropriate time we should move for a vote. \nWe want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to speak. There is \ncertainly ample opportunity to do that. But I hope before the day ends \nwe can pass this very important piece of legislation. I know there are \nthings in here which are important to the people of Nevada and to the \nrest of the country. I think the committee should be commended for \npassing this, moving it to the floor, and getting to conference.\n  Getting anything out of conference under the present atmosphere is a \nremarkable feat. Senator Leahy is to be admired and commended for doing \nthis. I hope that before the day is out we can pass this important \npiece of legislation.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. The \ncommittee of conference went across the political spectrum. Every \nconferee--Republican and Democrat--signed that conference report. They \npassed it 400 to 4 in the House. I am amazed that we are still even on \nthe floor. I have been advised by the Republican side that a Republican \nSenator wants to come over and speak. Otherwise, I would have said let \nus go to a vote now. Obviously, I don't want to cut off any Senator who \nwishes to speak. But I tell my friend from Nevada that, as far as this \nSenator is concerned, I am perfectly willing to go to a vote anytime we \nwant. It is now 4:30. I can't imagine why we need to wait beyond 5 \no'clock.\n  Again, just before the Senator from Nevada came to the floor I read a \nlist.\n  Mr. REID. I was listening.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sure he was. I read a list of all those who support \nit. This is probably as broad a spectrum--National Association of \nManufacturers to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. It sure \nencompasses a lot.\n  We have a charter change for the Veterans of Foreign Wars in here; a \ncharter change for AMVETS; a charter change for the American Legion. \nAll of those organizations support it.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I pushed that through.\n  This is something that the AMVETS and Veterans of Foreign Wars \ndiscussed and asked for, this charter change. They all support it. All \nthe Republicans and Democrats on the committee support it. We ought to \npass it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to make sure that it is clearly \nstated and make sure it is clear in the Record. The charter changes for \nthe American Legion, the charter changes for AMVETS, the charter \nchanges for Veterans of Foreign Wars are in a separate bill that has \nthe Republican hold on it. However, there is no opposition from members \nof the Judiciary Committee. I\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\nam told there is no Democrat who opposes those charter changes. I am \ntold that every Democrat in the Senate is perfectly willing to pass the \ncharter changes for the American Legion, for the AMVETS, and for the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, and as soon as the Republican hold is lifted \non the charter changes for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American \nLegion, and AMVETS, we can pass it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak to the legislation that has been \nplaced before us this afternoon, the Department of Justice \nreauthorization bill or, as it is officially titled, the 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act.\n  I begin by putting this in the context of what I would call \npriorities. We are now less than 2 weeks, probably, from closing the \nsession of this Congress, and there is a great deal of unfinished \nbusiness to which we need to attend.\n  As a matter of fact, we are bringing this legislation up--I should \nsay the majority leader has brought this legislation up--deferring, for \nour consideration, the bill that is currently on the floor, the \nhomeland defense reorganization bill that the President asked us to \ndeal with about 3 months ago. That bill has now been on the floor of \nthe Senate for at least a month, and we still have not even voted on \nthe President's proposal.\n  This DOJ, or Department of Justice, reauthorization bill has a lot of \nimportant provisions in it. I am going to get to those in a moment. But \nin terms of priorities, it seems to me the reauthorization of a \nDepartment which has not been reauthorized for more than two decades, \nand clearly is going to continue to operate--that is, the Department of \nJustice--is a little bit lower priority, at this point in this \nlegislative session, than voting on the President's homeland \nreorganization legislation. It is a lower priority than adopting a \nresolution dealing with the Senate's position with respect to the \nauthorization of the President to utilize force in any action he may \ndecide to take against Iraq. And it is less of a priority than having \nthe Senate act upon the Defense appropriations and authorization bill.\n  It is clear, because the majority was not able to pass out a budget \nthis year--the first time since the creation of the Budget Act, which I \nthink was in 1974--that we do not have a budget. That has been one of \nthe reasons we do not have any appropriations bills done. I am not \naware of any bill that has come from the House to the Senate and been \nvoted on by both bodies and sent to the President. I might be wrong, \nbut I do not recall any. I think we have only acted on three or four.\n  It is common knowledge that in order to fund the Government beyond \nOctober 1, it is going to require the adoption of what we call \ncontinuing resolutions or CRs. We have already adopted one, and we are \ngoing to have to adopt another and then another one after that. These \ncontinuing resolutions will authorize Government to continue to be \nfunded at some level; last year's level plus some increment of \ninflation, I suppose.\n  Because we didn't pass a budget and because we haven't passed the \nappropriations bills, we don't have all of the other specific \nprogrammatic funding that would ordinarily be included in these \nappropriations bills, including new programs. That is not good.\n  We can get by with these continuing resolutions for a matter of weeks \nand perhaps a few months if we have to. Where we can't get along \nwithout an appropriations bill is for the Department of Defense and the \nconduct of the war. Things have changed so dramatically since last year \nwhen an appropriations bill was passed for the Department of Defense \nthat all recognize--this is not a partisan issue; I think everybody \nrecognizes--we are going to have to pass a Defense authorization bill \nand a Defense appropriations bill for the next fiscal year. We are \ngoing to have to do that as a matter separate and apart from the \ncontinuing resolutions we will adopt.\n  Those are the first three things we have to do before we complete our \nwork. In one way or another they all deal with national security, \nwhich, obviously, is the first thing about which we have to be \nconcerned. And in a time of war, I know it is very much on the minds of \nall Members.\n  Again, a Defense authorization and appropriations bill to actually \nprovide the programs and the funding for our military forces for this \nnext year; an authorization that this body would approve the use of \nsome kind of force for the President, should he deem it necessary in \ntaking action against Iraq; and completion of our work on development \nof the Department of Homeland Security so that the President would know \nhow he can organize the Government to best deal with the threat to the \nhomeland--those should be our top three priorities.\n  We don't yet have the Defense bill. It is ready but it hasn't been \nbrought to the floor. The homeland security bill has been pending for 4 \nweeks perhaps. We still didn't even have a vote on the President's \nproposal for a Department of Homeland Security. The majority leader \nkeeps filing cloture which is defeated because people are not ready to \nfinish that bill until we have a chance to vote on the President's \nproposal. That is only fair. He ought to have some say in how his \nDepartment is going to be reorganized. Perhaps his idea won't prevail, \nbut it will, if we can ever get it to a vote. He is at least entitled \nto a vote.\n  Instead of granting that, we have left that national security debate, \nand we are now on the question of whether we should reauthorize the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  What is an authorization? Ordinarily an authorization for a program \ntells you what you can do from year to year in this Department of \nGovernment. It is important in an organization such as the Department \nof Defense, where we have had such a dramatic change in requirements \nsince last year with the war on terror.\n  As I said, it has been now more than two decades since the Department \nof Justice has had a reauthorization. All we have done in those two \ndecades is each year appropriate money for the various programs we have \npassed for funding of the Department. That has worked fine. It could \nwork, obviously, again.\n\n  One could argue that because of the war on terror, there are a lot of \nnew things that need to be done in the Department of Justice--new \nauthorities granted, new capabilities, new funding, and that it might \njustify a new authorization act. I could abide by that rationale, if we \nhad before us a reauthorization that embodied those kinds of new \nprograms. But that is not what we have. This is the same old, warmed \nover stuff that we have had for the last couple of decades.\n  If we want to fight the war on terror and we want to take our \nprecious time to reauthorize the Department of Justice with that in \nmind, we would write an entirely different bill than this.\n  One example, just off the top of my head: We had testimony in the \nIntelligence Committee last week that there is a great deal of \nconfusion about the FISA Act, the forward intelligence surveillance law \nunder which our law enforcement officials have the ability to collect \nintelligence on people who are thought to be foreign agents or working \non behalf of foreign governments or engaged in terrorist activities \ninternationally. It is a little bit easier to collect intelligence on \npeople like that than it is under our normal criminal justice system \nwhere a crime has been committed or is being committed and the FBI is \ninvestigating that crime.\n  As part of the USA Patriot Act last year, we made changes to the FISA \nlaw to make it more effective in the new era of the war on terror. We \nfound out something. This came about in a variety of different ways, \nbut it has all come together here. This FISA law has one aspect that \nneeds to be fixed. Senator Schumer and I have a proposal to fix it, but \nwe haven't been able to get it on to the floor. As a matter of fact, I \nhad anticipated including it in the intelligence reauthorization. We \nwill have the conference on that tomorrow evening. It is almost to the \nfloor.\n  But I was told by Chairman Graham that a member on the majority side\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\nwas going to object to the inclusion of the Schumer-Kyl provision and, \ntherefore, would I please not include it in that bill. I said, of \ncourse, I would be happy to because we want to get the intelligence \nauthorization passed. But at some point we have to make this change in \nFISA. I will describe what the change is.\n  It should have been in here but it is not. If we are talking about \npriorities, I would much rather get that done than have to wade through \nall of this. We have gone two decades without this. But we need to make \nsome of these changes for law enforcement.\n  The evidence before the Intelligence Committee was that the FBI \nthought, with respect to Zacarias Moussaoui, thought to be the 20th \nhijacker, that he had some connection to international terrorism. He \nwas a foreign person, not a U.S. citizen, and had engaged in flight \ntraining up in Minneapolis under conditions deemed to be suspicious by \nthe FBI there. We all heard about the memorandum or letter from agent \nRowley from the Minneapolis office complaining about the fact that the \nFBI had not seen fit to apply for a FISA warrant to look into Zacarias \nMoussaoui's computer to see what was there.\n  We all know that after the fact, after September 11, this was done, \nand certain things were found, and so on, which we don't discuss here.\n  The fact is, a lot of people criticized the FBI for misunderstanding \nor misapplying the law and not seeking a FISA warrant on Moussaoui. The \ntestimony we had before the committee was that there was a dispute \nwithin the FBI about what they had to prove, and there was some \nsuggestion that maybe he might have been connected in some way with a \ngroup of Chechens, but nobody could connect him to a foreign power or \nan international terrorist organization. Those are the two requirements \nfor FISA to apply.\n  Had the change that Senator Schumer and I advocate been in effect, it \nis clear that we could have gotten a warrant against Moussaoui because \nit would simply add the phrase ``or foreign person,'' which would mean \nthat if you had probable cause to believe that someone is involved in a \nterrorist kind of enterprise, but you don't necessarily know what \ncountry he is working for and you can't necessarily connect him to a \nparticular terrorist organization, you think maybe he is just a \nterrorist, and with this warrant you might find out exactly who it is \nhe is connected to, but you don't really have that information at this \npoint, you could go ahead and seek the warrant to tap his telephone or \nlook in his computer, search his house, whatever the case may be.\n  It is a very straightforward approach. Agent Rowley, who testified \nbefore the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee--we had a \ncombined hearing--said she thought that would have been a very good \nthing and strongly supported it.\n  It has the support of the Department of Justice and the FBI. We have \nhad several different witnesses from those organizations testify both \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee, both of \nwhich I sit on. They have all indicated this would be a very helpful \nchange in the law, so that with respect to a guy like Moussaoui, if you \ndidn't have the evidence that he was connected to a particular \nterrorist organization, or that he was working for a particular foreign \npower, you could still get a warrant to investigate exactly what he was \nup to if you could demonstrate to the judge you thought he was up to \nsomething, that he was a foreign person, and that the kind of activity \nthat he appeared to be looking at was a terrorist kind of activity.\n  I cannot imagine anybody who would oppose that, but I understand \nmaybe there is somebody who would. We need to vote on that before we \nleave here in a way that the House can also approve it, so that we can \nactually improve our ability to fight international terrorism.\n  You would think those kinds of changes would be in this \nreauthorization act. It is not in here. Not only that, but one of the \nauthors is alleged to be one of the people who would object to what \nSenator Schumer and I are trying to do. We need to get to the bottom of \nthese things. I want to find out. If anybody objects to the Schumer-Kyl \namendment, come to the Senate floor and tell us so we can find out who \nis behind the objection, get it on the floor, get it approved and \nenacted into law and signed by the President. Our law enforcement \nofficials want it. It is important to fight the war on terror, to get \nafter the terrorists so we can investigate them before rather than \nafter they commit crimes against us. That is the kind of priority we \nought to be engaged in here.\n  Instead, what does this bill have in it? Well, it is about 240 pages \nlong. It has a lot of provisions. For example, it authorizes $75,000 \nfor an exchange program with Thailand for prosecutors. That is probably \na nice thing. I don't know of any reason why that isn't a good thing to \ndo. But $75,000, as you know, is kind of decimal dust around here. We \nwould ordinarily be focused on somewhat larger issues. Here is a bigger \none: $5 million for a DEA training site in south and central Asia. \nProbably a good idea, although I don't know.\n  One thing that we have been asked by the administration--especially \nat this time of war--not to do is to impose any more reporting \nrequirements on our agencies that are involved in the war on terror. I \nam trying to count the number of reports and commissions contained in \nthe bill. There are too many to count so far. I am trying to get an \naccurate count. Suffice it to say there are numerous reports--report \nafter report--that we are asking the Justice Department to prepare and \nsend up to us on a whole variety of issues.\n  Oversight is very important, and we need to engage in oversight of \nthe Department of Justice. But there is a balance between causing them \nto have to spend so much time preparing reports that they literally \ncannot do the job we ask them to do. I am not sure how some of these \nreports, anyway, will advance the ball with respect to justice.\n  The bill speaks of the 21st Century Department of Justice \nAppropriations Act, but it contains a lot more than just \nappropriations. It seems to me that we ought to be pretty well focused \non the mission. If the FBI, for example, is going to literally change \nits focus from, first and foremost, being an investigator of crimes \nthat have been committed so they can be prosecuted in court, to an \nagency--and remember it is part of the Department of Justice--which has \nnow its first and foremost focus of preventing terrorism by conducting \ninvestigations that will potentially lead to uncovering the possibility \nof terrorists in the United States who would perform these horrible \nacts against us, if that is the new mandate--and certainly Robert \nMueller, Director of the FBI, has been very forthright about the need \nfor change in the FBI and the need to create this new priority in the \nFBI, and I commend him, and Attorney General John Ashcroft has \nsupported the same kind of reformation of the Department of Justice and \nthe FBI--then why is that kind of priority not reflected in this \ndocument? It is kind of the same old thing, rather than a new 21st \ncentury mission with terrorism at the core.\n\n  We need to find resources to fight terrorism. A lot in this bill has \nnothing to do with terror. That is not to say there is not a great deal \nthe Department needs to do that doesn't relate to terrorism, and we all \nunderstand and appreciate that. One would think there would at least be \nsomething here that represents the case for looking forward into the \n21st century, rather than just looking back for the last couple of \ndecades and trying to pull together different things that we would like \nfor the Department of Justice to do for us.\n  Let me get back to the issue of reports. Do we need to require the \nAttorney General to submit to the Committees on the Judiciary and \nAppropriations of both the House and the Senate a report identifying \nand describing every grant and cooperative agreement that was made for \nwhich additional or supplemental funds were provided in the immediately \npreceding year? I suppose somebody should put that information \ntogether. I wonder whether we need to mandate it in this authorization \nbill. Here is another report identifying and reviewing every office of \njustice program grant, cooperative agreement, or programmatic contract. \nI suppose some auditor needs to have that on the books, but is it \nnecessary to send a report to the committees of the House and the \nSenate? Do we need to\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nrequire that the Attorney General submit, within 6 months of enactment, \na report to the chairman and ranking member of the House and Senate \nCommittees on the Judiciary, detailing the distribution and allocation \nof appropriated funds, attorneys, and pre-attorney workloads for each \noffice of the U.S. attorney, except those at the justice management \ndivision? That is an internal matter that is important to the proper \nfunctioning and operation of the Department of Justice offices of U.S. \nattorney, but there is an office of U.S. attorney that is supposed to \nkeep track of those things.\n  It doesn't seem to me that this rises to the level of what we are \nincluding within the reauthorization. Do we need to require the \nAttorney General to conduct a study of offenders with mental illness \nwho are released from prison or jail to determine how many such \noffenders qualify for Medicaid, SSI, or SSDI, and other Government aid? \nDo we need that? Should that be included in this 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act? At least, if it \nis, does it rise to the level of priority greater than giving the \nPresident the authority to take action to deal with Iraq, giving the \nPresident a vote on his idea for reorganizing a Department of Homeland \nSecurity and providing the Senate's approval of funding so our military \ncan do what we ask it to do? Which of those ought to come first?\n  We have now taken these other items and put them over here so we can \ndeal with this Department of Justice reauthorization--an action that \ndoesn't need to be done at all. We haven't had a reauthorization of the \nDepartment of Justice for over 20 years and yet it has functioned very \nwell.\n\n  There is more. I will cite one more. The bill provides the inspector \ngeneral discretion to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing or \nadministrative misconduct by an employee of the Department of Justice--\nauthority which already exists--and allows the inspector general to \nrefer such allegations to the office of professional responsibility or \nthe internal affairs office of the appropriate component of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  It seems to me that a lot of what is in the legislation is \nquestioning the Department of Justice rather than supporting it. It is \nasking it to do a lot of things that will take time and money and \ndivert resources from the job that is first and foremost on the minds \nof Americans. I will let that point go for the moment.\n  It is not that this is a bad bill. That is not my point. My point is \nthat this is an old bill that was written for another time and which \nisn't really necessary today--certainly not to take the time of the \nSenate away from those other items that I mentioned. We should not be \ntaking the time to debate this.\n  Now, I was just notified a couple hours ago that this bill was going \nto be brought to the floor. The problem with dealing with a bill such \nas this in this context is that there is naturally a tendency to hurry \nup and rush to get it over with because we have more important things \nto do. I suspect that is what you are going to hear from perhaps the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee or others--``If \nthese other things are so important, then hurry up and pass this \nbill.''\n  That is a nice technique: find a time when we really ought to be \ndoing something else, insert this into the agenda and argue that we \nbetter hurry and get it over with so we can get back to these more \nimportant items. If it is so all-fired important to do, then it is \nimportant enough to be done right. I will give you one example of a \npart of it that wasn't done right.\n  (Mr. KOHL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we have a strict rule around here that a \nconference report, which is what this is--and for those who are not \naware, that means the Senate has passed a bill, the House has passed a \nbill, representatives of the two bodies have gotten together and agreed \non a compromise, a conference report. They held a conference and they \nagreed. The bill goes to the House and the Senate, and we are supposed \nto act on the conference report. That is our process.\n  The idea is that the conference committee is supposed to iron out \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. That is what happens in a \nconference committee. What you do not do is bring up new issues in a \nconference committee. That is verboten. That is not right. If it was \nnot in the House or the Senate bill, then it is not germane to the \nconference. Every now and then, people look the other way and forget \nabout the rules and say: There is a group who wants another provision; \ngranted it was not in the Senate bill and it was not in the House bill, \nbut we are getting a lot of pressure to get it done, so we are going to \nstick it in the conference report. There is such a provision in this \nconference report.\n  I do not know if it is a good or bad provision. I have heard \narguments both ways. I have gotten a lot of pressure from the group who \nwants it. They are good people. They are friends of mine. I would like \nto support them. I do not know whether they are right or wrong on the \nprovision, and I will describe it in a moment.\n  The fact is, when it whizzed through the Judiciary Committee, I \nthought I would have an opportunity to come to the floor and hear a \ndebate about it and perhaps be involved in that debate and ask \nquestions, understand it, and maybe even offer an amendment or two, and \nthen either pass it or not pass it or vote for it or vote against it.\n  I am not sure what I would do, but when it comes in the form of a \nconference report, as you know, it is unamendable. Whatever is in here, \nyou take it or you leave it. You either take everything or the whole \nbill goes down. This bill may not have a whole lot that is important or \ngood in it, but I do not know that it has a whole lot of bad provisions \nin it. There are at least some good provisions in the conference \nreport. I want to make that point, and I will speak to them. There are \na couple items I like in this bill.\n  I am not arguing this bill should not be adopted. The problem is, \nwhen the House and Senate conferees take something out of left field \nand stick it in the bill when it was neither in the Senate bill nor in \nthe House bill, it comes back in a form we cannot even amend.\n  That is what happened with this arbitration issue. I am not sure \nexactly what it is called--the motor vehicle franchise dispute \nresolution process bill. This is a bill that is supported by a lot of \nlocal auto dealers. As I said, at least the auto dealers in Arizona \nare, for the most part, good folks, as far as I am concerned. They have \na complaint against the motor companies whose cars they sell having to \ndo with the contracts, the franchise agreements they sign when they \nbecome a dealer for these cars.\n  What they complain about is the fact that when they sign the \ncontract, it pretty well binds them to a process of arbitrating \ndisputes in a certain way so that if they and their parent company have \na dispute, the contract says, you resolve that dispute by arbitration. \nIn that way, the parties do not have to go to court.\n  Arbitration is actually a good thing, not a bad thing. I would think \nyou would want to keep the parties from having to go to court. And if \nboth parties, the franchisee and the franchiser, agree they will \nresolve their disputes through arbitration, through the American \nArbitration Association, rather than going to court, one would think \nthat is a good thing. These dealers believe it is a bad thing. They \nsaid they signed bad contracts and were under pressure by the \nfranchisers, the big auto companies, that had bargaining power leverage \nover them, basically, to say: You either sign the contract the way we \nhave presented it to you or you cannot be our franchisee. I do not know \nwhether that is right or not, but that is their argument.\n  They say the Federal Government has to intervene and, in effect, \ncreate an opportunity for the voiding of those provisions of those \ncontracts so they can literally take these disputes into court and \nfight it out with their lawyers in court.\n  They were in my office a week or so ago wanting to talk to me about \nthis. I will honestly tell you, I had no idea this provision was coming \nup then. I thought: Why are you guys coming in here? It turned out \nthere was a mixup and I could not meet with them.\n  I spoke with one of their representatives last Friday. I said: I am \nsorry you all were in and you thought we had a meeting, but I really \ndid not think this issue was coming up. Little did I know.\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nThey probably knew something I did not know. I guess they might have \nknown this was coming to the floor and I did not realize that was the \nsituation. I perhaps should have.\n  The problem now is that we debate this in a scenario in which there \ncan be no amendments. The conference report, under our rules, cannot be \namended. The only way to amend it is to send it back and have the \nconference committee revisit it, and that is a motion that very rarely \nis accepted. I am not even sure I would be for doing that.\n  This is the kind of thing that should not be done in this type of \nbill. It was done by a very few people. I am on the Judiciary \nCommittee, as is the Presiding Officer. I did not know it was put in \nthere. I did not have anything to do with it. I was not asked, and yet \nwe are members of the Judiciary Committee and this is supposed to be \nour product.\n  Again, I do not know whether this is a good idea or a bad idea. I \nwould have liked to have heard debate on it, perhaps an opportunity for \nit to be amended, but that will not be possible. That is another \nproblem with the conference report as it has come to us.\n  What I am talking about is the motor vehicle franchise dispute \nresolution process bill. That is not the only example of items that \nwere added to the conference report and which had never been passed by \nthe House of Representatives or by the Senate. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  In title I, subtitle A, there is something called the Law Enforcement \nTribute Act. This section authorizes grants for the construction of \nmemorials to honor the men and women in the United States who were \nkilled or disabled while serving as law enforcement or public safety \nofficers. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. I presume \nthere is nothing wrong with it. I suppose if the grants for \nconstruction got out of hand from a monetary standpoint we might have \nsome objection. We obviously want to use some prudence in what kind of \nmoney is appropriated for that purpose.\n  I do not know anything about that issue. I am on the Judiciary \nCommittee and that was never considered. It did not come through the \nSenate. It did not come through the House. But it is in the conference \nreport. It was put in in the conference.\n  There is a section 11002, disclosure of grand jury matters relating \nto money laundering offenses. This would add two sections relating to \nmoney laundering to the list of banking law violations where a \nprosecutor can disclose grand jury information to a State financial or \na Federal financial institution or regulatory agency.\n  We have had a lot of complaints in the war on terror about the \ndisclosure of grand jury testimony. Here national security is involved. \nThere are some who still say that we should not release grand jury \ntestimony on a very classified basis to other law enforcement or \nintelligence agencies, such as the CIA, so that it can do its work \nbetter to protect us from terrorists; that when information is \npresented to a grand jury, it is as if it is sacred and nobody else can \nknow about it. We cannot even use it for protection against terrorism. \nBut this bill, without having passed through the House or Senate, \nincludes a section that would let grand jury information be disclosed \nto either a State financial or a Federal financial institution or \nregulatory agency.\n  That may well be a good thing if you are trying to go after people \nwho launder money. That may well be a good section. I just do not know. \nAgain, being a member of the Judiciary Committee and a Member of the \nSenate does not provide enough protection for us really to have had the \nopportunity to debate or amend this provision.\n  There is a section called grant program for State and local domestic \npreparedness support. This would seem to be a good purpose, expanding \nthe uses of grant funds and changes the name from the Office of State \nand Local Domestic Preparedness Support to the Office of Domestic \nPreparedness. It does not seem to me there would be anything wrong with \nthat. It did not pass the Senate. It did not pass the House.\n  There is a provision, section 11004, U.S. Sentencing Commission Act \naccess to NCIC terminal. This is a big deal. It would allow the \nAttorney General to exchange NCIC information with the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission. The reason, I guess, is the Sentencing Commission has \nstated it is necessary for it to help complete a study that it wants to \ndo on recidivism rates that they have been charged--by who else?--by \nCongress to complete. They are currently working with the FBI, and they \nsupport this.\n  There is another section dealing with danger pay for FBI agents, and \nthis could conceivably fall into the category of a response to the war \non terror, although I do not know.\n  It is the kind of thing one might expect to see in the bill even \nthough it was not in the Senate-passed or House-passed bill. It would \nbe interesting to find out whether or not the granting of the danger \npay allowance is a response to the war on terror. That might well be an \nappropriate one of those rare exceptions where even though the House \nand Senate bills did not have this in it, it might be a good thing to \ninclude in the conference report, but one would hope there would be \nsome description and discussion of that so we would all appreciate the \nreason for doing it.\n  There is a section on Police Corps. It provides for increases in the \ntuition allotments for Police Corps officers; scholarship reimbursement \nfrom $10,000 to $13,333 a year; reauthorizes the program for 4 more \nyears. It increases the stipend for training from $250 to $400 a week \nand eliminates the $10,000 direct payment to participating police \nagencies requirement--or opportunity, I should say.\n  Again, that is what one ordinarily would have seen come before the \ncommittee and the Senate, but it did not pass this body. Section 11007, \nradiation exposure compensation technical amendments; section 11008, \nFederal Judiciary Protection Act of 2002--I have pages of these--\npersons authorized to serve search warrants; a study on reentry, mental \nillness and public safety; technical amendments to the Omnibus Crime \nControl Act; debt collection improvement; use of annuity brokerage \ninstruction settlements.\n  There is a provision which I would certainly support, section 11014, \nreauthorization of a State criminal alien assistance program. There are \nthose who oppose this. I favor it. For those who oppose it, maybe they \nwould want to offer an amendment reducing the amount of it.\n  Frankly, I would love to offer an amendment increasing the amount \nbecause the amount that is authorized is about one-third what is \nnecessary to reimburse the States for the housing of criminal illegal \naliens who are the responsibility of the Federal Government but whom \nthe States undertake to house in their prisons.\n  I am denied the opportunity to offer an amendment to increase the \nfunding under this very good program because it comes to us in the \nconference report upon which we did not act.\n  I will not go through all of these, but there are INS processing \nfees; U.S. Parole Commission extension; the waiver of foreign country \nresidence requirement with respect to international medical graduates; \npretrial disclosure of expert testimony relating to a defendant's \nmental condition; Multiparty/Multiform Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002; \ndirect shipment of wine, there is a provision on that; Webster \nCommission Implementation Report. There is a very large provision in \neffect authorizing the establishment of a police force within the FBI \nto provide protection for FBI buildings and personnel in various areas. \nThere is a report on information management technology; a GAO report on \ncrime statistics. There is a big grant program--well, not big. It \nauthorizes $30 million for the Attorney General to make grants to \nStates for various reasons. There is a new motor vehicle franchise--\nexcuse me, that is the one I mentioned before. There is a new holding \ncourt in a certain State. I will not mention the State, but just one \nState though.\n  The point is that this bill includes numerous provisions which did \nnot pass the House, did not pass the Senate, which we have no \nopportunity therefore to seek to amend, and which are presented to us \nin a take-it-or-leave-it form in the conference report. It is not the \nright way for us to do business, again, in the last 10 days or so of \nour session.\n\n  I will not say anything more about the bill itself because I do not \nwant one to get the impression that reauthorizing the Department of \nJustice is not\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\na good thing; it is--that many of the provisions I read to you are not \ngood provisions. Some of them I know are good provisions because I know \nwhat they are. Others I presume are good, though I do not necessarily \nknow that. But I would like to at least offer one amendment to one of \nthem, and I know I will not be given that opportunity.\n  It is not what we should be doing in the context of the debate we are \nhaving in these last 10 days, which is, How do we enhance the national \nsecurity of the United States of America?\n  I go back to the three things we should be doing right now. We should \nbe completing our work on the Homeland Security Department. At a \nminimum, the President should be granted an opportunity for Senators to \nvote on his proposal. Why have we not been allowed to do that? Why, \nright after the debate on that very issue, right after another cloture \nmotion on that failed, do we in effect call a timeout on the Homeland \nSecurity Department legislation and go to this bill instead? That is \nmore important, and that should take precedence. So should the Defense \nauthorization and appropriations bills.\n  Presumably, we are going to leave time to debate a resolution with \nrespect to granting the President the authority he needs to take action \nin Iraq.\n  I see my good friend and colleague on both the Judiciary and \nIntelligence Committees, the Senator from California, is in the Chamber \nand appears ready to speak. I will yield the floor to her in about 1 \nminute.\n  It has always been my great pleasure first to chair and now to be the \nranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nTerrorism and Technology, a committee that has worked over the years, \nwhether under my chairmanship or Senator Feinstein's chairmanship, on \nthe kinds of legislation I was speaking of earlier, the very things we \nneed to do to help our law enforcement agencies have the power to do \nthe job we want them to do.\n  I am very proud to say that legislation we worked on together as a \nresult of hearings we held together was finally passed as part of the \nUSA Patriot Act, and the work that that subcommittee has done over the \nyears has really paved the way for a lot of what we now know was \nimportant to do but until, unfortunately, after September 11 people \nwere not willing to focus on in order to get done.\n  I conclude by saying it is a matter of priorities. We ought to be \nfocused right now on first things first, and that is our national \nsecurity, and that means first and foremost passing legislation such as \nthe Schumer-Kyl amendment to FISA, getting our Homeland Security \nDepartment legislation concluded, getting our Defense authorization and \nappropriations bills concluded, and paving the way for action on a \nresolution of force with respect to Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my \ndistinguished colleague and friend from Arizona. I must say I differ \nwith him on this bill because I am very much in support of this bill. \nIn particular, I commend both Senators Leahy and Hatch for bringing \nthis first Department of Justice authorization report to the Senate \nfloor in 20 years. I very much hope the Senate is going to adopt the \nreport.\n  Before I go into saying what this bill does with respect to Federal \njudgeships, I want to comment that this bill does deal with homeland \nsecurity, particularly border security. This bill specifically \nauthorizes more than $4 billion for the administration and enforcement \nof laws relating to immigration, naturalization, and alien \nregistration. More than $3.2 billion of this amount will be allotted to \nthe National Border Patrol. That is something for which both Senator \nKyl and I have worked on our subcommittee for a substantial period of \ntime, and I am very pleased to see this authorization. It deals with \ndomestic preparedness.\n  For example, the Conference Report authorizes funding for the Centers \nfor Domestic Preparedness in Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, \nNevada, Vermont, and Pennsylvania. It adds additional uses for grants \nfor the Office of Domestic Preparedness to support State and local law \nenforcement agencies. This bill also has FBI reform. It includes \nprovisions from the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act to codify the \nauthority of the Department of Justice inspector general to investigate \nallegations of misconduct by FBI employees.\n  The conference report provides special danger pay allowances to FBI \nagents in hazardous duty locations outside of the United States, \nsomething we should very much want to speed through at this time.\n  It has the Law Enforcement Tribute Act. It has the Feinstein-\nSessions-Carnahan-Durbin, James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor \nAct, which imposes criminal penalties on individuals who use body armor \nin the commission of crimes of violence or drug trafficking crimes. \nThis bill specifically originated as a product of the work of Lee \nGuelff, whose brother, James Guelff, was a police officer at San \nFrancisco's northern station. Officer Guelff responded to a sniper \nincident at the corner of Franklin and Pine Streets and encountered an \nindividual completely clad in Kevlar--Kevlar helmet, Kevlar vest, \nKevlar pants, the whole thing--with about 1,100 rounds of ammunition. \nOfficer Guelff only had his police revolver, which he emptied to no \neffect against his Kevlar protected assailant, who shot the officer in \nthe head and killed him. It took 150 police officers to equal the \nfirepower of this one man with semiautomatic weapons clad in Kevlar \nstanding in the intersection.\n  This is a very important bill. We have worked for 6 years. To Lee \nGuelff, congratulations.\n  This bill authorizes a separate and independent Violence Against \nWomen Office within the Department of Justice similar to S. 570 \nintroduced by Senator Biden with 22 cosponsors. It is a very important \nstep for those who would like to see this separate office set up.\n  The bill has crime-free rural States grants. It creates and \nauthorizes $30 million for the crime-free rural States program to make \ngrants to rural States to help local communities prevent and reduce \ncrime, violence, and substance abuse.\n  For many of us, this bill is important because it restores a vital \nprogram, the SCAAP program, that the President cut out. SCAAP is an \nacronym for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Under law, the \nFederal Government is responsible for the borders. If we do not protect \nthe borders, people come to our country illegally. Some commit crimes, \nthey are convicted, they do time in jails, but the local jurisdictions \npay for that time in jail in State prison and in jails. SCAAP is the \nonly program that reimburses the States for their cost of incarcerating \nillegal aliens. It is a very important program. Senator Kyl and the \npeople of Arizona support it. I support it. I believe every member of \nthe Judiciary Committee supports it. I believe the Presiding Officer \nsupports it. That authorization is in this bill.\n  Regarding drug abuse, this bill includes several provisions from the \nHatch-Leahy-Biden-Feinstein Drug Abuse Education Prevention and \nTreatment Act that will move Federal antidrug policy toward a more \nbalanced approach that includes added attention to prevention and \ntreatment. The provisions in this bill, for example, authorize funding \nfor drug courts. We know drug courts work in prevention of narcotic \nuse. The bill authorizes $172 million over the next 3 fiscal years to \nsupport State and local adult and juvenile drug courts. These courts \nprovide treatment as an alternative to jail for nonviolent offenders \nwho stay off drugs. The statistics of recidivism show this approach \nworks.\n  There are provisions with respect to drug-free prisons. The bill \nauthorizes the use of Federal funds for jail-based substance abuse \nprograms, for reentry programs, for DEA, and police training. It \nauthorizes funding for the drug enforcement agency police training in \nSouth and Central Asia to reduce the supply of drugs entering the \nUnited States.\n\n  The bill has a myriad of proposals with respect to protecting \nintellectual property: The Madrid Protocol, distance learning, Patent \nand Trademark Office authorization and modernization, and enhanced \nenforcement of intellectual property laws.\n  Most importantly, this bill authorizes a number of new judgeships. It \nauthorizes five new permanent judgeships in the southern district of \nCalifornia at\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nSan Diego, as well as two in the western district of Texas. The western \ndistrict of North Carolina receives one. It converts four temporary \njudgeships to permanent judgeships: One in the central district of \nIllinois, the northern district of New York, the eastern district of \nVirginia. And it creates seven new temporary judgeships, one in each of \nthe northern districts of Alabama, Arizona, central district of \nCalifornia, southern district of Florida, district of New Mexico, \nwestern district of North Carolina, eastern district of Texas. It \nextends the temporary judgeship in the northern district of Ohio for 5 \nyears.\n  I have heard Members of this body implore the Judiciary Committee \nabout the need for additional judgeships. The Southern District court \nin San Diego, for example, has the heaviest caseload in the nation. \nThis court has operated in a state of emergency since September, 2000. \nThe Southern District handles complex litigation as well as major drug \ncases that emanate from the closeness of San Diego to the Mexican \nborder. The district is relying on temporary and senior judges. The \nbench has been close to real catastrophe. This bill finally brings \nrelief.\n  This bill improves civil justice; has motor vehicle franchise \nfairness; the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act; and the Antitrust \nTechnical Corrections Act. There are a number of things in this bill to \nimprove immigration procedures: The J-1 visa program, the H-1B visas, \nhelp to children, and more.\n  I conclude by noting that this bill is not unrelated to our present \nplace in time. It is not unrelated to the need to protect our borders, \nto seeing that our nation has adequate border security, to seeing that \nFBI agents have hazardous duty pay, and to seeing that our visa program \nis improved. The bill provides authorization for the payment to State \nand local jurisdictions for the incarceration of illegal immigrants and \nfor the addition of additional judgeships. It is a very important bill.\n  Again, I particularly thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member. \nWithout them, this bill would not be on the floor today. It is a very \nimportant bill. I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9697-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JO-ANNE COE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the \nreauthorization conference report that is before the Senate today. \nThere are many parts of this legislation I want to talk about. One part \nthat is very important to me is the new judgeships that would be \ncreated in the border areas of our country, including two new district \njudgeships in the western district of Texas, and one temporary \njudgeship in the eastern district of Texas.\n  The conference report contains language that Senator Feinstein and I \nput forward because of the judicial emergencies that we find in our \nStates. Largely in the border regions, we have had an onslaught of \ncaseload that has made it very difficult for our judges to not even \nstay even but just to try to handle the most important cases. So we \nhave been trying to add some judgeships, both in California and in \nTexas, to relieve some of this emergency.\n  The judgeships in the western and eastern districts of Texas have \nbeen declared ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan Judicial \nConference of the United States. The creation of new judgeships will \ncertainly bring much needed relief.\n  Of all the courts in the country that are desperate for judges, the \nUnited States-Mexico border courts have the most critical need. \nAccording to the statistics from last year, the western district of \nTexas handles the most criminal cases in the country; last year, 4,434.\n  Currently, the western district of Texas is facing a criminal \ncaseload of 1,987 pending cases; that is 2,758 defendants. In El Paso, \n884 cases are pending overall--more than any other region in the \ndistrict. Each day, more cases are added, overwhelming an already \noverburdened western district.\n  As our war against terrorism is advancing, as well as our war against \ndrugs, it is even more crucial we have highly qualified judges and law \nenforcement officials in charge of our justice system.\n  Mr. President, I really appreciate the fact that we do have a cloture \nmotion on this conference report. I hope very much we will be able to \npass this legislation and create these courts. Hopefully, they will be \nable to be up and running sometime next year and try to bring justice. \nJustice delayed is justice denied in many instances. We would like to \nclear out the backlog and let people face trials and either serve their \nsentences or, if they are acquitted, of course, allow them to go free. \nRight now, they are incarcerated, and it is creating not only a burden \non the court system but on the prison system. Many of our county \nprisons and State prisons are overloaded and trying to help with the \nbacklog, but it is very hard for these counties to justify the costs \nwhen they do not get full reimbursement.\n  So we would appreciate passing this bill so we could get these \ncourts. I hope the Senate will act expeditiously on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak a few minutes on the \nDepartment of Justice conference report that is before the Senate.\n  The Department of Justice is one of the great Departments of our \nGovernment. It is one of the oldest, one of the\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\noriginal Departments. I served in that Department for 15 years. It was \nthe greatest honor for me. I believe it has worked, and I believe, all \nin all, this bill is a healthy bill. I am pleased to support it.\n  It came out of the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, and we \ntalked about many of the issues. Hopefully, when the dust settles, the \nbill we pass will strengthen justice in America. I am pleased with \nthat.\n  There is one provision that came out of this conference committee, \nhowever, with which I am not pleased. It was not in the Senate bill; it \nwas not in the House bill. It was placed in the conference report \nwithout having been passed by either body, which is against the \ntradition of the Senate and the House. This should not be done. It is \nnormally not done.\n  That provision deals with automobile dealers and arbitration clauses \nthey have with automobile manufacturers. The truth is, most automobile \ndealers today are pretty sizable entities. They have lawyers. They \nnegotiate these contracts when they have an agreement with a big \ncompany. It requires arbitration apparently in most of these contracts. \nThey reject it. They want to alter this right of contract and eliminate \nit. I objected to it in committee.\n  I believe the question of binding arbitration is one that requires a \ngood deal of thought. I believe pretty strongly that if we are going to \nchange arbitration law in America to exempt people from binding \narbitration, I am not sure the first place we should start is between \nautomobile dealers and automobile manufacturers. That seems to me to be \nan odd place to start. There was not a lot of thought put into it. \nThere are disputes and arguments between the dealers and the \nmanufacturers, and the dealers believe they will have a better chance \nin court, if they can try the case at home, in a lawsuit, probably \nthrowing some claims in that lawsuit. They want to do it that way.\n  Apparently, most of our colleagues agreed; an overwhelming number of \npeople supported the amendment. It is now included in the bill.\n  I say that because I earlier introduced an arbitration bill that \nfocuses on improving arbitration across the board. It was a broad bill \nand had a lot of positive changes in it. I will be introducing today \nanother, even more comprehensive, bill to deal with arbitration. I will \nnot go into all the details of it, but I call this bill the Arbitration \nFairness Act of 2002, and it will continue the changes we offered in \nthe 106th Congress when I introduced the consumer and employee \narbitration bill of rights.\n  This will be a broader procedure. It will deal with the question of \nFederal arbitration. Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act in \n1925. It has served us well for three-quarters of a century.\n  Under the act, if parties agree to a contract affecting interstate \ncommerce that contains a clause requiring arbitration, the clause will \nbe enforceable in court. That is the fundamental issue with which we \nhave been dealing.\n\n  My State has had a lot of debate about arbitration. It is healthy to \nlook at what we did 75 years ago. We found there are legitimate \ncomplaints about arbitration. Our act, a bill of rights of protections \nfor people who are involved in arbitration, I think will take us a step \nin the right direction.\n  It will maintain cost-benefits of arbitration. Many times it is quite \ncost-effective to arbitrate, but there are instances in which \narbitration costs more and is more of a headache than perhaps going to \nsmall claims court or other courts.\n  There have been some concerns that the arbitrators under these \nagreements are not independent and the corporation or the larger entity \nhas too much power in selecting who might arbitrate.\n  The bill provides the following rights:\n  No. 1: Notice. Under the bill, an arbitration clause, if it is to be \nenforceable, would have to have a heading in large, bold print that \nstates whether arbitration is binding or optional and identify a source \nthat the parties may contact for more information and state that a \nconsumer could opt out and go to small claims court.\n  In other words, when you have an arbitration, you have to pay the \narbitrators. Both parties have to go. Many States have effective small \nclaims courts where you file a $25 fee and an independent judge will \nhear the case. Sometimes that is better. This would allow an opt-out \nfor a person who is involved in an arbitration matter if they choose \nand if they qualify for the small claims court. That probably is \nhealthy.\n  It would eliminate a lot of the complaints we have heard about over a \nsmall item, say a television or sofa or refrigerator, that could cost \nmore to arbitrate than the merchandise is worth. This would at least \ngive that option, so a party could opt out if it chose.\n  No. 2: The independent selection of arbitrators. The bill would grant \nall parties the right to have potential arbitrators disclose relevant \ninformation concerning their business ties and employment. All parties \nto the arbitration would have an equal voice in selecting a neutral \narbitrator.\n  This ensures that the large company that sold a consumer product will \nnot select the arbitrator itself because the consumer with a grievance \nwill have the right to nominate potential arbitrators, too. As a \nresult, the final arbitrator selected will have to have the explicit \napproval of both parties to the dispute. This means the arbitrator will \nbe a neutral party with no allegiance to either party. There are some \ninstances when that has not been the case.\n  We deal with choice of law. We make clear that parties can be \nrepresented by counsel at their own expense. It guarantees that all \nparties will have a fair hearing in a forum that is reasonably \nconvenient to the consumer or employee to prevent a large company, for \nexample, from requiring a consumer or an employee or small business \nowner to travel across the country to arbitrate a claim.\n\n  The bill grants to all parties the right to conduct discovery and \npresent evidence; to have cross-examination; that there should be a \ntape recording or a stenographer to make a record of the hearing, and \nthat there would be a timely resolution. That is important.\n  One of the reasons we choose arbitration is for timely resolution. \nThere have been complaints that these have not been timely and in fact \nhave been just as long, in some instances longer, as going to court.\n  Under the bill, the defendant must file an answer within 30 days of \nthe filing of a complaint. The arbitrator has 90 days to hold a hearing \nand must render a decision within 30 days after the hearing. That would \nbe the maximum time that would be allowed. It would require a written \ndecision. As to expenses, it grants all parties the right to have an \narbitrator provide for reimbursement of arbitration fees in the \ninterest of justice; the reduction, deferral, or waiver of arbitration \nfees in cases of extreme hardship; and also the small claims opt-out.\n  This is a Department of Justice bill that I believe has some good \nthings in it. It has 20 new Federal judges, pretty much selected on a \nneed all across America. Some States are really in crisis, such as \nCalifornia and they need some additional district judges. We need \nseveral in Alabama. It has that in there.\n  It has a body armor bill that Senator Feinstein and I worked on that \nsays if you deal with such a violent criminal who is involved in a \nserious crime, who wears body armor while they are committing that \ncrime, then the judge is authorized to give a more substantial penalty \nwhere that occurs and make it a separate offense for wearing body armor \nduring the commission of a felony.\n  We had an instance in my State, and Senator Feinstein in California, \nin which a criminal actually wore body armor and killed a law \nenforcement officer, thereby gaining an advantage in weaponry by being \nso protected.\n  There are some other provisions in the bill that are good. We \nstrengthen the Coverdell Act that deals with forensic laboratories. In \nmy view, as a prosecutor for many years, perhaps the greatest single \nbottleneck in justice today is a delay that so often occurs in \nobtaining scientific analysis of evidence. A prosecutor cannot go \nforward with a case involving cocaine, white powder, until some chemist \nreports that it is actually cocaine. Most prosecutors probably will not \ntake it to a grand jury until they have that chemical report.\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\n  If there are fingerprints, an analysis is needed. If there is a \nweapon involved, the ballistics need to be examined. If there are DNA \nissues, DNA is needed. If there has been a rape, the DNA analysis and \nblood samples are needed. Those are procedures that are being delayed.\n  In my State, we saw delays of as much as a year or more in actually \nreceiving the scientific analysis. On a routine basis, that is \nhappening around America. It is important we assist in that. The bill \nwe named after former Senator Paul Coverdell--who was such a wonderful \nMember of this body, a bill he worked on before his death--would help \nstrengthen that.\n  I believe we are moving in the right direction, and I would like to \nsee the Federal Government take a stronger lead in encouraging the \nStates to move forward on forensic capabilities.\n  We spend huge amounts of money on prisons. We spend huge amounts of \nmoney on probation officers. We spend huge amounts of money on \nsheriffs' deputies, police officers, prosecutors, judges, and juries, \nbut we are spending only a pittance on getting our scientific evidence \nproduced in an honest and effective way. As a result, justice is being \ndelayed. And justice delayed is justice denied.\n  Recently, in Alabama, we had probably the most horrendous crime ever. \nA man killed six members of one family. The newspaper reported he was \nout on bail pending trial. The prosecutor said they were waiting on the \nchemical analysis of the drugs he had been arrested with. Had that come \nin promptly, had he been indicted, gone to trial, and been in jail, six \npeople would probably be alive today.\n  That is occurring around America today. Make no mistake about it, it \nis something we need to do to improve. It is primarily a State \nfunction, but this Government does a lot to encourage and help States \ndo better, and we really ought to step it up in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch \nfor their hard work on the Department of Justice authorization bill. \nThis bill will strengthen our Department of Justice and increase our \npreparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime, and improve our \nintellectual property and antitrust laws.\n  However, I am disappointed that the ecstasy provisions I sponsored in \nthe Senate version were removed in the conference committee. These \nprovisions would have directed the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \nNIDA, to continue researching and evaluating the effects of ecstasy on \nan individual's health and authorized money to the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas, HIDTA, program for combating ecstasy use.\n  I am concerned that ecstasy has become the ``feel good'' drug of \nchoice among many of our young people and drug pushers are marketing it \nas a ``friendly'' and ``safe'' drug to mostly teenagers and young \nadults. But we know this is not true.\n  Just last week a new study conducted by researchers at John Hopkins \nUniversity found that a single use of ecstasy could seriously harm the \nbrain and put users at risk of damage that mimics Parkinson's disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following article from Reuters \ntitled, ``Ecstasy's Brain Drain Possibly Wider Than Thought,'' be \nprinted in the Congressional Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, several recent studies have also revealed \nan alarming increase in the availability and abuse of ecstasy across \nthe United States.\n  According to the Partnership for Drug Free America's 2001 National \nSurvey, more teens in America have now experimented with Ecstasy than \ncocaine, crack or heroin. Approximately 2.8 million teenagers in \nAmerica, roughly one of every 11 teens in the Nation, have now tried \necstasy.\n  Even the Armed Services have been impacted by this dangerous drug. In \nJuly 2002, 82 marines and soldiers at Camp Lejeune, NC, were convicted \nin a military court for either using or distributing ecstasy.\n  Despite the abundant evidence to the contrary, young people have been \nlulled into believing that ecstasy and other designer drugs are safe \nways to get high without risking addiction or physical harm.\n  As legislators, we have a responsibility to stop the proliferation of \nthis potentially life threatening drug. I remain firmly committed to \nworking on legislation to combat this dangerous drug and I appreciate \nmy colleagues' willingness to work with me to pass this legislation \nnext year.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Ecstasy's Brain Drain Possibly Wider Than Thought\n\n                            (By Amy Norton)\n\n       New York (Reuters Health).--The club drug Ecstasy may \n     damage a broader range of brain cells than most research has \n     suggested, according to a new study in monkeys.\n       Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that one \n     round of the drug, designed to simulate what many Ecstasy \n     users take in a night, was toxic to dopamine-producing cells \n     in the brain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that helps \n     regulate mental and emotional functions, as well as movement. \n     This is the first time Ecstasy has been shown to have such \n     dopamine effects in primates.\n       Previous studies in animals and humans had shown the drug \n     to selectively affect brain cells that carry out the work of \n     serotonin, a chemical involved in mood, memory and other \n     vital functions. Both serotonin-cell loss and memory problems \n     have been found in regular users of Ecstasy, also known as \n     MDMA.\n       Similarly, monkeys and baboons in the new study showed \n     damage to the serotonin system. But the dopamine effects, \n     which were even more substantial, were ``totally \n     unexpected,'' lead author Dr. George A. Ricaurte told Reuters \n     Health.\n       He and his colleagues at the Baltimore, Maryland university \n     report the findings in the September 27th issue of Science.\n       According to the researchers, these findings are \n     particularly concerning because dopamine is vital to \n     movement, and a loss of dopamine brain cells is known to be \n     involved in Parkinson's disease (news-web sites) and the \n     related movement disorder parkinsonism.\n       Of course, whether the primate findings extend to humans at \n     all is unknown, Ricaurte pointed out.\n       ``Clearly,'' he said, ``most MDMA users have not developed \n     parkinsonism.''\n       Still, the researcher added, if the drug does have dopamine \n     effects in humans, this raises the possibility that with age \n     and its accompanying, natural dopamine decline, Ecstasy users \n     could face a heightened risk of parkinsonism.\n       Before this study, only mice had been shown to have \n     dopamine effects after Ecstasy exposure, making mice ``an \n     enigma'' in the field, Ricaurte said. His team's working \n     hypothesis, he explained, is that the pattern of MDMA \n     exposure in this primate study is behind the dopamine damage.\n       The animals were given three does of the drug at 3-hour \n     intervals, in an amount and time frame designed to simulate \n     what often goes on at ``raves''--all-night dance parties \n     where Ecstasy use is pervasive.\n       It may be that taking multiple does in a night, known as \n     ``stacking,'' is required for dopamine damage to occur, \n     according to Ricaurte, but there's no evidence of that yet.\n       And whether any dopamine-cell loss would be lasting in \n     humans is also unknown. In this study, primates showed \n     ``profound'' dopamine-cell loss 2 to 8 weeks after Ecstasy \n     exposure, according to the researchers.\n       ``We were struck by the severity of the dopaminergic \n     injury, ``Ricaurte said.\n       To begin to see whether such injury occurs in humans, his \n     team plans to take brain scans of former Ecstasy users to \n     look for signs of dopamine depletion.\n       In a statement released in response to the study, Dr. Glen \n     R. Hanson, acting director of the US National Institute on \n     Drug Abuse, said the findings ``are cause for concern and \n     should serve as warning to those thinking about using \n     Ecstasy.''\n       Earlier this month, US health officials reported that the \n     number of Americans using Ecstasy went up 25% between 2000 \n     and 2001.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDepartment of Justice reauthorization bill. The reauthorization of the \nDepartment of Justice and all of its component parts is long overdue. \nIn particular, this bill is important because it reauthorizes the \nIncentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Program, Title V, \nwhich is the cornerstone of our national juvenile crime prevention \nstrategy. Senator Leahy deserves special mention for recognizing the \nimportance of juvenile justice policy and waging a successful fight to \nreauthorize many important programs.\n  Effective prevention programs are critical to any juvenile crime \nstrategy, and title V is one of the programs that deserve our support. \nLet me tell you why. It relies on local communities, who know their \nneeds better than the Federal Government, to identify solutions \ntailored to local problems. Communities qualify for funds only if they\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nestablish local boards to design long-term strategies for combating \njuvenile crime, and if they match Federal funds with a 50-percent local \ncontribution.\n  And, title V works. Participating communities, from 49 States, \nbelieve in this program so much that, according to the GAO, they've \nmatched Federal money almost dollar-for-dollar, far more than the 50-\npercent match this program requires. In addition, studies confirm that \nmany of these programs have reduced crime in cities across the Nation. \nA program that can motivate communities both to cooperate in improving \nsafety and to collect the resources to do so is one that really works.\n  I would also like to commend the conferees for including in the final \nbill important provisions from S. 1165, the Biden-Kohl-Reed-Landrieu-\nDaschle Juvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act. Senator Biden has \nalways been a leader on juvenile crime control issues and it has been a \npleasure to work with him. This bill understands the importance of \nfederal assistance to our communities in the area of juvenile crime \ncontrol and delinquency prevention programs.\n  Finally, on a different issues, I am pleased that the bill makes \nseveral needed technical corrections to the Nation's antitrust laws. It \nwill also eliminate unnecessary and unused antitrust review authority \nplaced in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and will therefore further \nour goal to consolidate antitrust oversight.\n  Again, I applaud the Senate's consideration and passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \npassage of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, H.R. 2215. I applaud Chairman Leahy, who along with \nhis staff, has put in long hours to complete this bill. It is my hope \nthat the conference report, which has passed the House by a vote of \n400-4, will pass the Senate today.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 2215 includes the Law Enforcement Tribute Act, \na bill I introduced. The Law Enforcement Tribute Act authorizes $3 \nmillion in grant funding to States, localities, and Indian tribes to \nprovide for permanent tributes to the police officers and firefighters \nwho have been injured or killed in the line of duty. I have been \ncontacted by numerous law enforcement and public safety organizations \nthat have voiced their support for the bill, including the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the International Association of \nFire Fighters, the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, and the Missouri \nPolice Chiefs Association. These organizations believe, as I do, that \nit is appropriate for our national Government to help local communities \npay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  H.R. 2215 also authorizes language for many programs of critical \nimportance to our nation's security. It authorizes funds to enhance \nborder security and increase domestic preparedness. The bill includes \nimportant provisions to strengthen law enforcement, such as FBI reform, \nand better witness protection. H.R. 2215 improves state and local \nforensic science capabilities, and implements appropriate sentencing \nenhancements when defendants use body armor in crimes of violence or \ndrug trafficking crimes.\n  H.R. 2215 establishes a permanent, separate, and independent Violence \nAgainst Women Office within the Justice Department, similar to S. 570, \nwhich I cosponsored. It also authorizes $30 million for the Crime-Free \nRural States program to make grants to rural States to help local \ncommunities prevent and reduce crime, violence, and substance abuse. \nH.R. 2215 reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct, and preserves the core protections that ensure juvenile \ndelinquents are dealt with firmly but fairly.\n  Support for these law enforcement programs comes at an important \ntime. Crime rates, which had fallen to record lows during the 1990's, \nhave begun to creep up, and our Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies have had new and important responsibilities placed \non them following the September 11 attacks. So, I am extremely pleased \nthat we are expressing our support and providing resources that will \nmake a real difference in increasing the personal security of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan \nlegislation. The fact that it is now before the Senate for a final vote \nis primarily due to the skill, patience, and determination of our \ncolleagues on the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, especially \nChairman Leahy, Senator Hatch, Chairman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman \nConyers, and I commend them for their leadership. They have guided our \nSenate-House conference with a steady hand and have kept the process \nmoving, even when the prospect of the bill's passage appeared in doubt. \nAs a result, we are about to complete action on a genuinely \ncomprehensive authorization bill for the Department of Justice--\nsomething Congress has not managed to enact since 1979.\n  The need for this legislation is urgent. The terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 made clear that we must strengthen the ability of our \njustice system to deal with the threat of terrorism. Since September \n11, Congress has enacted laws giving law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials enhanced powers to investigate and prosecute terrorism, \nimproving the security of our borders, and strengthening our defenses \nagainst bioterrorism.\n  On May 14, President Bush signed the Enhanced Border Security and \nVisa Entry Reform Act. The Department of Justice Authorization Act \nbuilds on that bipartisan legislation by authorizing over $4 billion \nfor the administration and enforcement of our immigration laws--$3.2 \nbillion of which will be allotted to the Border Patrol. The act \nauthorizes funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration to conduct \npolice training in South and Central Asia, and improves our \nimplementation of the International Convention for the Suppression of \nFinancing Terrorism. These will be important tools in our effort to win \nthe war on terrorism and protect the country for the future.\n  Here at home, the Department of Justice Authorization Act achieves \nmany important goals: It implements needed reforms of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, including a long-overdue plan to improve the \nBureau's outdated computer system. It also provides special danger pay \nto F.B.I. agents who perform hazardous duties outside the United \nStates.\n  The bill closes a number of loopholes in our criminal code, and \nincreases the protection of witnesses who report criminal activity. It \nincreases sentences for defendants who use body armor during the \ncommission of violent crimes. It reauthorizes the State assistance \nprogram to help States deal more effectively with the problem of \ncriminal aliens. It authorizes funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica, including the creation of 1,200 new clubs across the Nation to \nimprove the lives of at-risk youth. It reauthorizes the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act, while preserving the core \nprotections to see that juvenile delinquents are treated fairly and \nhumanely.\n  It authorizes a number of important drug treatment and prevention \nprograms, including programs to reduce drug dependency among prisoners \nand to support State and local drug courts. These cost-effective \nprograms will reduce the demand for drugs in America, which President \nBush has called ``the most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs \nin America.''\n  I am also pleased that this legislation contains a provision to \nextend H-1B visa status for persons with pending labor certification \napplications. Unfortunately, this application process now takes years \nto complete, and is undermining the ability of American companies to \nkeep qualified workers.\n  The Department of Justice Authorization Act also reauthorizes the \nPolice Corps, a program that I have strongly supported since its \ncreation in 1994, to improve the quality of police training, develop \nstrong community-police partnerships, and produce officers who will \ntake future positions of leadership and responsibility in law \nenforcement.\n  The Department of Justice Authorization Act is an impressive \nbipartisan achievement that will strengthen our justice system and our \ndefenses against terrorism. I commend all the conferees for their \neffective work.\n  The House of Representatives overwhelmingly adopted this legislation \nlast week by a vote of 400 to 4, and I urge the Senate to support it \nnow.\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non H.R. 2215.\n  With approval of this conference report, we are one step closer to \nauthorizing the operations of the Justice Department for the first time \nsince 1979. I commend the conferees, and particularly the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee Senator Leahy, for the work they have done on \nthis measure. It will improve the operations of the Department, and in \nso doing it will strengthen our efforts against terrorism, help protect \nour borders, and prevent crime and drug abuse.\n  I would like to highlight a few of the provisions of the conference \nreport that I think are particularly important, beginning with the \nestablishment of the Violence Against Women Office. Today is the first \nday of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and it is a fitting tribute \nto this special month that H.R. 2215 provides this Senate with an \nopportunity to make our voices heard loud and clear on the importance \nof continuing the fight against domestic violence, sexual assault and \nstalking.\n  A key tool in that fight is the permanent and independent Violence \nAgainst Women Office, a proposal I first introduced in the Senate in \nMarch, 2001, and now established in the Conference Report. This \nprovision means that the Office will be removed from its current \nlocation inside the Office of Justice Programs, and become its own \nfree-standing entity. The bill also sets out the jurisdiction of the \nOffice and the extensive duties and functions of the Director. It also \nrequires that the Director be nominated by the President, confirmed by \nthe Senate and report directly to the Attorney General.\n  With this bill, the Violence Against Women Office is set out in black \nand white. Its leadership and agenda cannot be pushed to the sidelines \nnor marginalized as one of many offices in a large bureau. Instead, \nthis law gives the Violence Against Women Office the foundation and \nroots it deserves. It will be its own, separate and distinct office \nwithin the Department of Justice with a Director who answers only to \nthe Attorney General. This statutory authority is long overdue.\n  Since we passed my Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the Office has \nbeen charged with disbursing billions of dollars to states, localities, \ntribal governments and private organizations to improve the \ninvestigation and prosecution of crimes of domestic violence, sexual \nassault and stalking; to train prosecutors, law enforcement and judges \non the unique aspects of cases involving violence against women; and to \noffer needed services to victims and their families.\n  The Violence Against Women Office also handles and coordinates the \nDepartment of Justice's legal and policy issues regarding violence \nagainst women, everything from enforcing protection orders across State \nlines to issuing annual reports on stalking. The Office also works with \nother Federal agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service about \nFederal policies, programs, statutes, and regulations that impact \nviolence against women.\n  It is a tall order for the Violence Against Women Office, and to \ncarry out these critical mandates, we must ensure that the Office has \nthe sufficient visibility, prestige and authority. An independent \noffice will provide just that platform. An independent office will be \ninsulated from any attempts to undo the great work it has historically \naccomplished. A director nominated by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate will have the credibility and the bully pulpit to travel \nthis country and get local people to the table. Let me be clear, to \nmeet its mandate, the Violence Against Women Office should not, must \nnot, and cannot be buried within a grant-making bureaucracy.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act passed in 1994, we have changed \nthe way folks think about domestic violence and sexual assault. We have \nhauled these matters out from the closet, and called them their proper \nnames, ``crimes'', crimes that warrant investigation and prosecution \nwith crime victims who desperately need our help. Across the country \nthere are signs that the law is working. Statistics released by the \nJustice Department last month indicate that rape and sexual assault \ncrimes dropped 8 percent from 2000 to 2001. The New York City Police \nDepartment is beginning to use digital cameras to capture the injuries \nof domestic violence which has drastically improved the way these cases \nare prosecuted. One of the first trials for cyberstalking is underway \nin Chicago.\n  In my home State of Delaware, the Violence Against Women Act and the \nleadership of the Office have made an enormous impact. Just last week, \nthe STOP grant program, one of several grant programs in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, awarded $85,000 to the Sexual Assault Network of \nDelaware so that it can formalize community responses to sexual assault \ncrimes and victims. Since 1995, Delaware has received more than 30 \ngrants totaling almost $8.5 million dollars, all of it designated to \ncombat violence against women.\n  But sadly, we are not done.\n  The National Violence Against Women Survey reports that nearly 25 \npercent of women sometime in their lives has been raped or physically \nassaulted by an intimate partner.\n  One out of 5 adolescent girls in America becomes victims of physical \nor sexual abuse in a dating relationship according to a report issued \nby the Journal of American Medicine.\n  We still need Domestic Violence Awareness Month this October. And we \nneed the leadership of an independent and separate Violence Against \nWomen Office. I want to thank the Senate conferees, Senators Leahy, \nHatch and Kennedy, who worked long and hard to get an ensure that the \nViolence Against Women Office Act was included in the compromise \nConference Report, and I thank Senators DeWine, Levin, Specter, \nCarnahan, Hutchison, Miller, Collins and Carper who originally joined \nme when I first introduced a bill for an independent office in March, \n2001. And finally, in this first week of Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, it is right to give thanks for the tireless efforts of advocates \nand service providers who support the women and children victimized by \ndomestic violence and sexual assault.\n  The next point I would like to highlight is that the Conference \nReport reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act \nof 1974. Congress has tried for over six years to get this job done and \nas the former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the current \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs I am extremely \ngratified we were able to renew the juvenile justice law here.\n  Last year, Senators Kohl and Reed and I introduced S. 1165, the \nJuvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act. That bill reauthorized the \n1974 Act, authorized the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant \nfor the first time, and proposed to close the gun show loophole. S. \n1165 contained provisions similar to H.R. 1900 and H.R. 863, and \nprovisions complimentary to Senator Leahy's S. 1174. Major provisions \nof H.R. 1900, H.R. 863, S. 1165 and S. 1174 are included in this \nConference Report today. Provisions from S. 1165 included in the \nConference Report will ensure that youth in the juvenile justice system \nare protected from abuse and assault by adults in adult jails. The \nConference Report ensures we will remain focused on preventing juvenile \ncrime before it occurs: it reauthorizes Title V, the Justice \nDepartment's juvenile crime prevention grant program. Title V resources \nhave been critical in Delaware to sponsor programs to reduce school \nviolence, provide transition counseling to students returning to their \nlocal school from alternative school placement, reduce suspensions, \nexpulsions, truancy, and teen pregnancy, and provide services to the \nchildren of incarcerated adult offenders. I compliment Senator Kohl for \nhis steadfast devotion to Title V and for ensuring it is continued \nthrough this Conference Report.\n  The Conference Report adopts provisions of S. 1165 that authorize the \nJuvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant. This program was created \nin the 1998 Commerce Justice State appropriations bill but has never \nbeen authorized. It provides resources to States and units of local \ngovernment so programs can be developed to promote greater \naccountability in the juvenile justice system. The Conference Report \nalso expands the purposes to which JAIBG funds can be put, for the \nfirst time, resources are provided to support proven strategies for \nrehabilitating adjudicated youth and families\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\nas well as for reducing juvenile re-offense rates. In years past, my \nstate has used JAIBG funds to establish a Serious Juvenile Offender \nprogram through the Delaware Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services, \nwhich provides an immediate secure placement of violent youth offenders \nwho have violated the terms of their probation. Delaware has also used \nthese funds to expand diversionary programs such as Teen Court and Drug \nCourt, thus reducing the time between arrest and disposition of \njuvenile offenders, and to add psycho-forensic evaluators in the \nDelaware Office of the Public Defender to identify and address mental \nillness as a cause for delinquent conduct. I compliment the conferees \nfor including provisions drawn from S. 1165 and H.R. 863 in this \nReport.\n  I would also like to highlight the provisions in the Conference \nReport that are designed to strengthen Boys and Girls Clubs of America. \nProvisions here will allow for the establishment of 1,200 additional \nClubs across the Nation. This will bring the number of Clubs to nearly \n4,000, serving nearly 6 million young people across America.\n  Finally, this Conference Report also incorporates much of S. 304, the \nDrug Abuse Education Prevention and Treatment Act, a bill which \nSenators Hatch, Leahy and I introduced together. While I am \ndisappointed that many of the bill's drug treatment provisions were \ndropped in conference, I promise to fight for those provisions again in \nthe next Congress.\n  I want to draw attention to three of the important provisions from S. \n304 that were included in the conference report to address addiction \namong those in the criminal justice system and make sure that we are \ndoing all we can to keep them from reoffending. Specifically, the \nconference report reauthorizes two key programs created in the 1994 \nBiden Crime Law to deal with drug addicts in the criminal justice \nsystem, prison-based drug treatment and the drug court program, and \nincludes my ``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,'' \nwhich creates demonstration programs to oversee the reintegration of \nhigh-risk, high-need offenders into society upon release.\n  Let me address prison-based drug treatment first. Providing prison-\nbased treatment is not ``soft''; it is smart crime prevention policy as \nthe Key and Crest programs in my home state of Delaware have shown. If \nwe do not treat addicted offenders before they are released, they will \nreturn to our streets with the same addiction problem that got them in \ntrouble in the first place, and they are likely to re-offend. This is \nnot my opinion; it is fact. More than 80 percent of inmates with five \nor more prior convictions have been habitual drug users, compared to \napproximately 40 percent of first-time offenders. Prison-based \ntreatment programs are a good investment and an important crime \nprevention initiative.\n  And so are drug courts. The Federal Government has funded drug courts \nsince 1994 as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with non-violent \noffenders who need drug treatment. Rather than just churning people \nthrough the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts \nhelp these folks get their acts together so they won't be back. When \nthey graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and \nmore prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are \nrequired to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and \nkeep up with financial obligations, including drug-court fees and \nchild-support payments.\n  Drug courts have been proven effective at keeping offenders with \nlittle previous treatment history in treatment, providing closer \nsupervision than other community programs to which the offenders could \nbe assigned, reducing crime and being cost-effective.\n  Just as treating addicted offenders when they are in the criminal \njustice system is smart crime policy, so is making sure that high-risk, \nhigh-need offenders get reintegrated into society upon release. These \nindividuals have served their prison sentences, but they pose the \ngreatest risk of re-offending because they lack the education, job \nskills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse \ntreatment and other mental and medical health services they need to \nsuccessfully re-integrate into society. The demonstration reentry \nprograms created in this conference report will help supervise high-\nrisk people when they are released from jail and make sure they get the \nservices and other support that they need so they won't go back to a \nlife of crime and can be productive members of our society.\n  Once again, I thank the conferees, Senators Leahy, Hatch and Kennedy \nand their staff, including Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Ed Pagano, Tim \nLynch, Steve Dettelbach, Makan Delrahim, Leah Belaire, Wan Kim, Melody \nBarnes and Robin Toone, for their unfailing support for these \nprovisions, and for their hard work in bringing the Conference Report \nto the floor.\n\n\n                     Violence Against Women Office\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As you stated earlier, the pending Justice reauthorization \nconference report establishes an independent Violence Against Women \nOffice, and isn't it true that this Office will be an autonomous and \nseparate office within the Department of Justice and no longer \nunderneath the jurisdiction of the Office of Justice Programs?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is absolutely correct. Rather than be one of many \noffices subsumed in a larger bureau or office, the Violence Against \nWomen Officer will now be its own, separate and distinct entity within \nthe Department of Justice. This provision means that the Office will be \nremoved from its current location in the Office of Justice Programs, \nand become its own free-standing entity. This is a non-negotiable and \nunambiguous provision of the act. What this means is that the \nleadership and the agenda of the Office cannot be pushed to the \nsidelines or marginalized. You and I both know that ending violence \nagainst women is too important of an issue to be relegated to a back \noffice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I couldn't agree with you more, Senator. I am particularly \npleased that the Violence Against Women Office will now be led by a \nDirector nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. How \nwill this provision affect our nation's fight to end domestic violence \nand sexual assault?\n  Mr. BIDEN. A director who is nominated by the President and confirmed \nby the Senate will have the stature, credibility and authority \nnecessary to spearhead the efforts to end violence against women. In \npractical terms, a director within this sort of clout will attract the \nattention of key Congressional leaders, will be able to travel the \ncountry and bring state leaders to the table for local initiatives, and \nwill be able to command the nation's bully pulpit on these issues. \nAnother key provision in the statute creating the Violence Against \nWomen Office is the explicit instruction that the Director report \ndirectly to the Attorney General. Would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, the statute is unequivocal. The director shall report \ndirectly to the Attorney General--do not pass go, do not get out of \njail free. The law is clear that the director is not to report to \nvarious deputies or assistants, but rather straight to the Attorney \nGeneral. That kind of unfettered access to the Attorney General will \nensure that issues of violence against women remain in the forefront, \nand part of the decision-making and policy-development done by those at \nthe highest levels of government, isn't that so?\n  Mr. BIDEN: That is right. As the former Director of the Violence \nAgainst Women Office said: ``There is a world of difference between \nfull participation in the highest levels of decision-making and being \nburied in a satellite grant office in the Department.'' When the \ndirector is out of the leadership circle and placed in a satellite \noffice, the Violence Against Women Office's involvement in activities \ndecrease; for example, it is no longer involved in educating U.S. \nAttorneys about their role in local communities' efforts to stop \nviolence or it is no longer involved in deciding whether to bring or \nappeal specific cases. The new Violence Against Women Office Act will \nbe ensure that the Director has the access he or she needs to fully \nparticipate--the fight to end violence against women deserves no less.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts as our Judiciary Committee \nChairman and as a conferee to the Justice Reauthorization Act in moving \nthis important act forward.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report \nfor\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\nthe U.S. Department of Justice Reauthorization. We are debating \nlegislation that overwhelmingly passed the House last Thursday on a \nvote of 400-4. It is my hope that it will pass the Senate with an \nequally strong majority.\n  I am speaking in support of legislation included in the conference \nreport that protects the rights of motor vehicle dealers, many of which \nare small businesses, under State law. The provision is identical in \nsubstance to Senators Hatch and Feingold's bill, S. 1140, which has \nbipartisan support of 64 cosponsors. I ask my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation and restore desperately needed rights to small businesses \nthroughout the nation.\n  S. 1140 is necessary to restore fairness for automobile dealers by \npreserving their state rights in dispute resolution with manufacturers \nunder motor vehicle dealer contracts. All 50 States, including Wyoming, \nhave enacted laws to regulate the relationship between motor vehicle \ndealers and manufacturers and curb unfair manufacturer practices. These \nlaws are necessary to protect auto dealers since they must sign \ncontracts with the much larger manufacturers to sell the product. A \nSupreme Court decision, however, allows manufacturers to skirt these \nState laws by including mandatory binding arbitration in their dealer \ncontracts.\n  Congress never intended to strip the State's role in regulating the \nmotor vehicle dealer franchise relationship, but because of the Supreme \nCourt interpretation, states cannot prohibit manufacturers from forcing \ndealers to waive their state rights and forums. Dealers must sign \n``take-it-or-leave it contracts'' drafted by the manufacturer to stay \nin business, and are vulnerable to manufacturer abuses of power. Since \nStates cannot remedy this problem, Federal legislation is necessary to \nrestore dealers' rights.\n  Specifically, the legislation included in the conference report \nStates that whenever a motor vehicle franchise contract provides for \nthe use of arbitration to resolve a contractual controversy, \narbitration may be used to settle the controversy only if both parties \nconsent in writing after the controversy arises. It also requires the \narbitrator to provide the parties with a written explanation of the \nfactual and legal basis for the award.\n  The arbitration language in the conference report before us is \nsupported by Wyoming automobile and truck dealers and dealers \nthroughout the country because it would merely restore State law. It is \nconsistent with Wyoming law, which does not allow a manufacturer to \nforce a dealer to prospectively waive rights and remedies under State \nlaw. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and protect our \nStates' interest in regulating the auto dealer/manufacturer \nrelationship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the end of the fiscal \nyear, and, absent action by the Senate, it will also mark the end of a \nfiscal discipline system that has served this country very well for \nmore than a decade.\n  Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass a budget blueprint for \n2003. It was jointly co-sponsored by Senators Conrad and Domenici, the \nchair and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. It received 59 \nvotes. one vote short of passage. It would have done exactly what \neveryone in this chamber knows we should do. It would have extended the \npay-as-you-go rules and the other points of order that have helped \nenforce at least some measure of fiscal discipline around here since \n1990.\n  When we voted in the spring, many Republicans voted ``no,'' citing \nthe total amount for 2003 discretionary spending. That issue has been \nremoved from the current effort to extend the budget enforcement rules, \nand there is no longer any plausible reason to oppose a simple \nextension of the points of order.\n  Prior to the time President George H.W. Bush signed the budget act \ninto law in 1990, there were no procedural barriers to the most \nirresponsible fiscal propositions. Spending proposals could be offered \nwithout any consideration for offsetting their budgetary affects. Tax \ncuts could be implemented without the slightest thought for their long-\nterm consequences. Enormous fiscal damage could be inflicted with a \nsimple majority vote.\n  The 1990 Budget Act ended the bad old days, and it did so with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. It has subsequently been extended each \ntime it expired whether the Senate was in Democratic or Republican \nhands.\n  It should be extended here today.\n  I think we all know that the budgetary trend of the last year has \nbeen profoundly negative. For many years, the two parties have \ndisagreed vehemently about the most fundamental aspects of our \ncountry's spending and tax policies--and we will continue to disagree. \nBut the times when we were able to restore fiscal balance, like we did \nin the 1990s, were the times when both parties agreed to retain basic \ndiscipline at the procedural level. We very much need to agree to that \nright now.\n  Democrats will continue to press for adoption of the Conrad-Domenici \nbudget enforcement resolution as soon as possible, and we urge all \nSenators to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9703-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9703-S9704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHALLENGES TO CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF BENEFITS FOR DISABLED VETERANS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have worked hard to make sure all the \nbrave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces are treated \nfairly.\n  Many military retirees, like so many other Americans, have relocated \nto fast-growing Nevada because of its high quality of life. And Nevada \nis also home to some of the country's finest military installations.\n  Regardless of where our loyal veterans and service members live, they \nall deserve our gratitude, respect, and fair treatment.\n  For several years I have introduced and championed legislation that \nwould end the unfair policy of denying America's disabled veterans \nretirement benefits they have earned through years of service and \nsacrifice.\n  Changing the current law that requires disabled retirees to forfeit a \ndollar of their earned retired pay for each dollar they receive in \nveterans' disability compensation is simply the right thing to do.\n  I am therefore extremely troubled that the Bush administration \nopposes a\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nprovision in the Senate Defense authorization bill allowing so-called \nconcurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability pay by disabled \nmilitary retirees.\n  Some officials have been quoted in recent newspaper articles as \nstating that retired pay and disability pay are ``two pays for the same \nevent'' and that receiving both would be ``double-dipping'' not \npermitted other retirees. These statements are simply not true.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of Federal \nretirees required to waive their retirement pay in order to receive VA \ndisability. Other Federal retirees get both disability and retirement \npay.\n  This antiquated law that denies our veterans concurrent receipt in \neffect implies wrongly and unfairly that disabled military retirees \nneither need nor deserve the full compensation they earned for their 20 \nor more years served in uniform.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation are earned for \nentirely different purposes and therefore a disabled veteran should be \nallowed to receive both. Current law ignores the distinction between \nthese two benefits.\n  Military retired pay is earned compensation for the extraordinary \ndemands and sacrifices inherent in a military career. It is a reward \npromised for serving two decades or more under conditions that most \nAmericans find intolerable.\n  Veterans' disability compensation, on the other hand, is recompense \nfor pain, suffering, and lost future earning power caused by a service-\nconnected illness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on their \nretired pay alone, and a severe disability only makes the problem worse \nby limiting or denying any postservice working life. A retiree \nshouldn't have to forfeit part or all of his or her earned retired pay \nas a result of having suffered a service-connected disability.\n  Likewise, the administration's assertion that if concurrent receipt \npasses ``1.2 million veterans could qualify'' for extra payments is \nsimply not credible. The Department of Defense and Department of \nVeterans Affairs previously informed Congress that about 550,000 \ndisabled retirees would qualify if the Senate concurrent receipt plan \nwere approved. But the new administration speculation that an \nadditional 700,000 might apply for and be granted disability ratings is \nan unfounded exaggeration.\n  The administration's argument that funding benefits for America's \ndisabled veterans would hurt current military personnel is also \nmisleading. Congress is not cutting funding for those who are now \nserving our country in order to provide benefits for those from \nprevious generations who served loyally and made tremendous sacrifices. \nCongress will appropriate the money to pay for it.\n  Enacting my concurrent receipt legislation will not cause service \nmembers to live in substandard quarters, as some Defense leaders try to \nclaim in a misguided attempt to turn one generation of patriots against \nothers.\n  Moreover, at a time when our Nation is calling upon our Armed Forces \nto defend democracy and freedom, we must be careful not to send the \nwrong signal to those now in uniform. All who have selected to make \ntheir career in the U.S. military now face an additional unknown risk \nin our fight against terrorism. If they are injured, they would be \nforced to forego their earned retired pay in order to receive their VA \ndisability compensation. In effect, they would be paying for their own \ndisability benefits from their retirement checks unless my legislation \nis enacted.\n  We must send a signal to these brave men and women that the American \npeople and Government take care of those who make sacrifices for our \nNation. We have a unique opportunity this year to redress the unfair \npractice of requiring disabled military retirees to fund their own \ndisability compensation. It is time for us to show our appreciation to \nthese men and women.\n  Finally the assertion that the veterans who would benefit from \nconcurrent receipt are already doing well financially is ridiculous. \nNBC News recently aired three news stories documenting the dire \nsituation that veterans are facing today. The Pentagon has acknowledged \nthat its studies of retiree income included very few seriously disabled \nretirees.\n  On July 8, 2002, I sent a letter to the President urging him to \nsupport the inclusion of a concurrent receipt provision in the final \nDefense Authorization Act. Our veterans have heard enough excuses. Now \nit is time for them to receive the benefits they earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9704-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9704-S9705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER DAVID G.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nan outstanding Naval Officer, Commander Dave Manero, for the tremendous \nwork he has done as a member of my staff during the second session of \nthe 107th Congress. It is my privilege to recognize his many career \naccomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided the Navy, the great State of Mississippi, and our Nation.\n  Commander Manero is the son of Carmen and Rosemary Manero of Highland \nPark, NJ. He earned his commission through NROTC at the University of \nPennsylvania where he graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science in \nElectrical Engineering. He received his Wings of Gold from Helicopter \nTraining Squadron Eight at NAS Whiting Field, FL. on July 7, 1989.\n  Following flight school, Commander Manero reported to Helicopter \nAnti-Submarine Squadron Light, HSL, 41 where he received training in \nthe SH-60B Seahawk with a follow-on tour at the HSL-45 `Wolfpack.' \nWhile assigned to the Wolfpack, he deployed in USS Paul F. Foster, DD-\n964, as Detachment One Operations Officer in support of Operation \nDesert Storm. During the Gulf War, he worked in close coordination with \nBritish Lynx helicopters in the destruction of six hostile surface \ncombatants. He subsequently cruised as Detachment Three Maintenance \nOfficer embarked in USS Jarrett, FFG-33, in support of Operation \nSouthern Watch. He was presented with the 1991 Naval Helicopter \nAssociation national ``Aircrew of the Year'' and the 1993 Wolfpack \n``Officer of the Year'' awards.\n  Commander Manero's next assignment included selection for the Navy's \nAdvanced Education Program where he attended a two-year Masters Program \nat Harvard University. He graduated in 1995 with a Master of Public \nPolicy specializing in International Affairs and Security. After \ngraduate school, Commander Manero was assigned as Flag Lieutenant, \nCommander Carrier Group ONE located in San Diego, CA. He deployed to \nthe South Pacific embarked in USS Blue Ridge, LCC-19, and Arabian Gulf \nin USS Carl Vinson, CVN-70, as a member of the fly-away Joint Forces \nAir Component Commander's staff.\n  Commander Manero returned again to the East Coast where he attended \nthe U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and graduated in December 1997 with \nClass 112. In January 1998, he reported in to the Naval Rotary Wing \nAircraft Test Squadron in Patuxent River, MD where he served as a Test \nPilot and as the Sea-Control Department Head. A Member of the Society \nof Experimental Test Pilots, he has accumulated over 2800 flight hours \nin over 30 different aircraft types.\n  In May 1999, Commander Manero reported to the HSL-43 `BattleCats' \nwhere he served as Training Officer, Detachment Officer-in-Charge and \nSquadron Maintenance Officer. Prior to his detachment from his \ndepartment head tour, he was selected for Commander and was nominated \nfor the prestigious `John Paul Jones Inspirational Leadership' award. \nDave is currently assigned as a Legislative Fellow on my staff and has \nmade tremendous contributions towards shaping our Navy's future through \nthe DD(X), Littoral Combat Ship, LHD, and LHR programs. He also was \ninstrumental in securing over $108 million in Military Construction \nfunding for Mississippi. I offer my sincere congratulations for Dave's \nrecent selection to command. He will depart my staff in December to \ntake command of a squadron in mid-2004.\n  Throughout his most distinguished career, Dave has served the United \nStates Navy and our Nation with pride and excellence. His awards \ninclude the Air Medal, two Strike Flight, the Navy Commendation Medal, \nfive, two with Combat Valor distinction, the Navy Achievement Medal, \nthe Combat Action Ribbon, and numerous other campaign and unit \ndistinctions.\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\n  Commander Dave Manero has been an integral member of my staff and has \ncontributed greatly to the best-trained, best-equipped, and best-\nprepared naval force in the history of the world. Dave's superb \nleadership, integrity, and limitless energy have had a profound impact \non my entire staff and will continue to positively impact the United \nStates Navy and our Nation. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, I wish Dave, his wife Justina, and their children Michael \nand Elizabeth ``Fair Winds and Following Seas'' and the best of luck in \ntheir bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9705-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JAMES B. HECKER, U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize and say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer, \nLieutenant Colonel Jim ``Scorch'' Hecker, upon his departure from my \nstaff. Lieutenant Colonel Hecker was selected as an Air Force Fellow to \nwork in my office during the Second Session of the 107th Congress due \nto his professional reputation and superior knowledge of Defense \nissues, the United States Air Force requirements process, and the \nmilitary presence in my home State. He has been a valued team member \nand it is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding \nachievements and the superior service he has provided the United States \nSenate, the Air Force, and our Nation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hecker, the son of Rick Hecker and Cindy Walker, \nwas a graduate of the Air Force Academy where he was commissioned as a \nSecond Lieutenant. Since then, Lieutenant Colonel Hecker has spent the \nmajority of his career patrolling the world's skies as an Air Force \nfighter pilot. Following flight training, he began his service flying \nthe F-15C ``Eagle'' in the 8th Fighter Squadron, 49th Tactical Fighter \nWing at Holloman AFB, NM. When the F-15C's left Holloman AFB, so did \nLieutenant Colonel Hecker. He was reassigned to the 390th Fighter \nSquadron, 366th Wing, Mountain Home AFB, ID. During this tour, \nLieutenant Colonel Hecker was instrumental in bedding down the F-15C \naircraft in the first Composite Wing in the Air Force. After this tour, \nLieutenant Colonel Hecker attended the Air Force Weapons School at \nNellis AFB, NV with a follow-on tour at the 44th Fighter Squadron, 18th \nAir Base, Okinawa, Japan. As the squadron Weapons Officer, Lieutenant \nColonel Hecker was the lead pilot responsible for preparing the \nsquadron to go to war. During this tour, Lieutenant Colonel Hecker \ndeployed in support of Operations SOUTHERN WATCH where he led combat \nmissions patrolling the skies over Iraq enforcing the no-fly zone. In \nJuly 1998, Lieutenant Colonel Hecker was handpicked to return as an \ninstructor at the Air Force Weapons School where he deployed in support \nof Operation ALLIED FORCE. Lieutenant Colonel Hecker led 10 combat \nmissions and was the focal point in the Combined Air Operations Center \nC5 Strategy Cell for resolving air-to-air issues. In 2000, Lieutenant \nColonel Hecker left the cockpit to serve on the staff of the Secretary \nof the Air Force in Washington, DC as an Air Force Senate Liaison \nOfficer and then was selected to serve as a Military Legislative Fellow \nduring the 2nd session of the 107th Congress.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hecker quickly became a valued member of my staff \nsharing his proven operational experience and insightful knowledge on a \nnumber of Department of Defense issues, including defense health care, \noperational beddown of C-17 and C-130J aircraft, various weapons \nsystems, military construction, university research programs, and \neconomic development projects. Specifically, Jim was instrumental in \nhelping the Air Force gain Congressional support for the F/A-22 \naircraft and solve the weather radar problem with the WC-130J aircraft \nat Keesler AFB. He helped me articulate a successful case for adding \nfunding for additional maintenance training simulators and military \nconstruction projects that will help ensure the successful beddown in \nJackson, MS of the first ever C-17 aircraft assigned to the National \nGuard. He successfully negotiated with Northrop Grumman Corporation to \nmove the production of the Global Hawk's wing as well as full assembly \nof the Fire Scout to Mississippi. Lieutenant Colonel Hecker's \ncoordination with the staffs of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee led to over $108 million \nin military construction funding for Mississippi's military bases.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hecker is married to the former Terrie Lee Draney \nof Colorado Springs, CO. They have two children, 7 year-old son Jaden \nand 5 year-old son Colton. The Congress and the country applaud the \nselfless commitment his entire family has made to the Nation in \nsupporting his military career. Among Lieutenant Colonel Hecker's many \nawards and decorations are the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak \nleaf clusters, Air Medal with oak leaf cluster, and Air Force \nAchievement Medal along with numerous other campaign and unit \ndistinctions.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hecker will return to the Air Force at Langley \nAFB, VA where he will once again control the skies in the F-15C. I have \nappreciated greatly Lieutenant Colonel Hecker's contributions to my \nteam and I will miss him. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, I wish Lieutenant Colonel Hecker and his family ``Good \nHunting and Godspeed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9705-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9705-S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLLADAY JOHNSTON RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, our friend and distinguished colleague, \nStrom Thurmond, has a lost a dear member of his Senate Family. Holly \nRichardson's courageous battle with breast cancer ended early Monday \nmorning. I do not use the word courageous lightly; if there ever was a \ncourageous cancer patient, it was Holly Richardson. She fought until \nthe end and never gave up.\n  Holly was one of the most delightful people I have ever met. She was \nStrom Thurmond's right, hand lady for almost 25 years and she meant so \nmuch to the entire Thurmond family. Holly's strong faith helped her \nimmeasurably and while we all mourn her passing, we know where she is.\n  Her obituary in this morning's Columbia, SC, newspaper, The State, \npoignantly describes this remarkable lady, as does the article about \nher in today's Charlotte Observer. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the State, Columbia, SC, Oct. 1, 2002]\n\n        Holly Johnston Richardson--Longtime Thurmond Confidante\n\n                           (By Lauren Markoe)\n\n       Washington.--Holly Johnston Richardson--confidante, \n     gatekeeper and personal adviser to U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond \n     since 1978--died Monday of breast cancer.\n       ``Early this morning, I lost one of my closest friends and \n     staff members,'' Thurmond said in a statement issued by his \n     office. ``She was a member of my extended family in every \n     sense of the word.''\n       The Summerville native was 48. Since 1979, Richardson \n     functioned as Thurmond's master scheduler, making sure he was \n     in the right place at the appointed time. Her supersized \n     Rolodex included the numbers for scores of average South \n     Carolinians and several heads of state, and she could get \n     most of them on the phone in seconds.\n       But generations of staffers say it was her Southern charm, \n     impeccable manners and love for Thurmond that made her one of \n     the most important people in his life.\n       ``I've seen the senator cry twice. When his daughter died \n     and today, when Holly died,'' said Mark Goodin, a former \n     press secretary and adviser to Thurmond. ``She was always \n     there for him. I don't think anybody ever thought she would \n     go before he did.''\n       Thurmond's daughter Nancy Moore Thurmond died in a car \n     crash in 1993. The oldest living and longest-serving senator, \n     he will turn 100 on Dec. 5.\n       Chris Kelley Cimko, Thurmond's press secretary from 1993 to \n     1997, said Richardson went well beyond her office duties in \n     her service to Thurmond, particularly before he began living \n     at Walter Reed Army Medical Center last year.\n       ``When she was cooking Sunday night, she would make a \n     double batch of whatever it was and make sure it was in his \n     refrigerator,'' said Cimko.\n       ``Like all trusted staff members, Holly Richardson had my \n     ear,'' Thurmond's statement continued. ``What she probably \n     never knew fully is that she had my heart.''\n       Richardson met the Thurmond family after joining his 1978 \n     re-election campaign, just\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\n     after her graduation from Converse College in Spartanburg. \n     She drove a camper, nicknamed ``Strom Trek,'' over 10,000 \n     miles in 10 weeks, recalled Nancy Thurmond, the senator's \n     now-estranged wife.\n       Her first job in Thurmond's office was to answer phones, \n     greet visitors and help out with constituents' problems. She \n     also oversaw the office's intern and page programs, which \n     gave high school and college students opportunities to learn \n     the workings of a congressional office.\n       Generations of interns, staffers and members of Congress \n     recall her courtesy and work ethic.\n       ``Holly Richardson was one of the most personable and \n     efficient people I've ever known,'' said N.C. Sen. Jesse \n     Helms. ``She was unfailingly pleasant and devoted to Strom \n     Thurmond--a feeling that was mutual.''\n       ``She treated everyone the same way, with dignity and \n     respect,'' said Cimko.\n       She is survived by her husband, Phil, and two children, \n     Emmett, 12, and Anne 9, and her parents, Joanne and Coy \n     Johnston of Summerville.\n       Richardson, an active member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church \n     in Alexandria, Va., her adopted hometown, had a strong faith \n     that supported here and others. She was also an active member \n     of the Junior League.\n       ``When we lost our daughter, Holly's vigilant faith helped \n     to sustain all of us,'' Nancy Thurmond said.\n       But as devoted as she was to the Thurmond's her own family \n     still came first, said Nancy Thurmond. She and staffers said \n     they marveled at Richardson's ability to balance her family \n     life and her work on Capitol Hill.\n       She was diagnosed with breast cancer less than a year ago, \n     and rebounded after rounds of chemotherapy. But the disease \n     spread, and she had to stop working several months ago.\n       A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at \n     Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Columbia.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Oct. 1, 2002]\n\n                 Thurmond Staffer Dies of Cancer at 47\n\n                           (By Charles Hurt)\n\n       Washington.--Holladay Richardson, one of Sen. Strom \n     Thurmond's top aides for nearly a quarter century, died \n     Monday morning after a year-long, fight against breast \n     cancer. She was 47 and the mother of two children.\n       ``Words cannot begin to express my deepest sadness and pain \n     with the loss of Holly,'' Thurmond wrote in a statement.\n       In a statement made part of the Senate's public record, \n     South Carolina's senior senator said many aides over the \n     years had his ear, but that only Richardson ``had my heart.'' \n     He called her his ``unofficial third daughter.''\n       Richardson's most recent post was scheduler, the person who \n     sets up Thurmond's calendar.\n       She first worked for him in South Carolina on his 1978 \n     Senate campaign. Since 1979, she has shared Thurmond's \n     Washington office, where she has seen eight chiefs of staff \n     come and go.\n       Nationally syndicated political columnist Armstrong \n     Williams recalled Richardson's importance from his days on \n     Thurmond's staff more than 20 years ago.\n       ``I can't remember the senator without Holly,'' he said. \n     ``I knew she had cancer, but this is terrible. She was always \n     there.''\n       As Thurmond's health faded in recent years, Richardson and \n     other top staffers assumed greater roles in the office of \n     American history's oldest and longest-serving senator.\n       ``Holly protected him, would finish sentences for him and \n     knew what he was thinking,'' Williams said. ``She was \n     everything that anybody would ever want in a daughter. She \n     was like a child protecting her parent.''\n       In May, Richardson and her family walked in the National \n     Race for the Cure in Washington.\n       She described to a reporter for Roll Call at the time how \n     she and her family had coped with her diseases by helping \n     people less fortunate, such as a bed-ridden neighbor for whom \n     they cooked.\n       ``You go through a few minutes of self pity before you \n     realize that you can either sit here and feel sorry for \n     yourself or you can put it aside and move on,'' she was \n     quoted as saying. ``That's how my family has gotten through \n     this, by focusing on others who are in bad situations. \n     Extending a hand to others, that's what life is all about.''\n       Richardson is survived by her husband, Phil, their children \n     Anne, 9, and Emmett, 12, and her parents, Joanne and Coy \n     Johnston of Summerville, S.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9706-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSWOMAN PATSY T. MINK\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on Saturday, September 28, 2002, Hawaii \nlost a beloved and extraordinary daughter, Patsy Takemoto Mink, who \nrepresented Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 years. I \nextend to her husband, John, and daughter, Wendy, my sincerest \ncondolences.\n  The passing of Congresswoman Mink is a great loss for our Nation and \nour State, and it is a personal loss for me. She was an honorable \ncolleague and a dear friend throughout our political careers.\n  I was privileged to work with Patsy in 1956, when we were both \nmembers of the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives. She was the \nfirst Asian-American woman elected to the Hawaii Legislature. In the \n1960s, we both gave speeches at Democratic National Conventions. She \nwas Chairwoman of the Honolulu City Council. In 1964, she joined me as \na member of Hawaii's Congressional Delegation when she became the first \nAsian-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. For \n24 years, she was an integral part of the Hawaii Delegation. I \nappreciated her honesty, I respected her thoughts, and I admired her \nresolve.\n  Throughout her public service, Patsy concerned herself with making \nour country a better place for all people. She will be remembered for \nher powerful and passionate voice as she championed causes for women, \nchildren, the elderly, and the needy. For those who were vulnerable or \nmistreated, she was their able and loyal defender.\n  Born Patsy Takemoto in a plantation community in Paia, Maui, on \nDecember 6, 1927, Patsy had the intelligence and work ethic to succeed \nin any profession. However, medical school eluded her and the legal \ncommunity did not embrace her after she received her law degree from \nthe University of Chicago in 1951. The reason she was rejected by \nmedical schools and legal circles? Her race and her gender.\n  Rather than accept defeat, the strong-willed Patsy set out to \neliminate the societal barriers of the day, and ran for office in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, which at that time was comprised of \nmostly white and mostly males members. She won the election and went on \nto pave the way for new generations of women to more fully enjoy their \nrights as citizens of a great nation.\n  Patsy co-authored and spearheaded the difficult passage of Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination in \neducational opportunities based on gender at institutions receiving \nfederal funds. It opened academic opportunities for women, and \nrevolutionized the world of sports. Since the passage of this landmark \nlegislation, participation by girls in high school athletics nationwide \nhas increased nearly tenfold, and college participation has grown \nalmost five times. College scholarships awarded to women in 2002 were \nworth $180 million. Title IX serves as the foundation of the careers of \ntoday's top professional U.S. female athletes. The U.S. women soccer \nteam's 1999 World Cup triumph, U.S. women's domination of Olympic \nsports, and the birth of the women's professional National Basketball \nAssociation are rooted in Title IX.\n  To fully appreciate the significance of Title IX, compare women's \nsports in 1972 to today as reported by the Honolulu Advertiser. In \n1972, the only woman with an athletic scholarship at the University of \nHawaii was a drum majorette. Of UH's $1 million athletic budget, $5,000 \nwas given to women's club sports. Today, UH spends $4 million annually \non 11 women's teams.\n  Patsy's reputation as a relentless and formidable lawmaker extends \nbeyond the passage of Title IX. She advocated for civil rights, peace, \neducation, health care, and the environment with equal eloquence and \neffectiveness.\n  I last spoke with my friend, Patsy, in August at a fund-raising event \nin Hawaii. She mingled and talked with constituents with her trademark \nvim and vigor. Her deep love for her constituents and her nation was \nevident. She was focused on the future and continuing her service to \nthe people of Hawaii.\n  Patsy answered the call to public service to the end, and her work \nimmeasurably improved America's landscape for the under-represented and \ndown-trodden for whom she had so much compassion. As my colleagues and \nI continue our work, we will long be able to look to Mrs. Patsy Mink's \nlife of service for inspiration and hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9706-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9706-S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REFLECTING ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, one year ago, this Nation stood united. \nTogether we mourned, prayed, and hoped. We hugged our loved ones a \nlittle bit longer and a little bit tighter. Our hearts wept for the \nthousands of families who unexpectedly and unbelievingly lost a husband \nor wife, a\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nmother or father, a son or daughter at the hands of evil.\n  It's hard to believe that an entire year has passed since that \nsurreal day. While we have observed holidays, celebrated milestones, \nand continued with life, there are still daily reminders of the \nhorrific events of one year ago. Flags still fly more frequently than \nbefore, security precautions still cause delay, and our hearts still \nweigh heavy when we think about the dreams that were cut short that \ntragic day.\n  As we remember September 11, I encourage you to make today a day of \nintrospection and compassion.\n  Remember where you were last year when you heard the news.

Make it a \npoint to leave work on time, have dinner with your family, talk to each \nother about what today means, and hug your loved ones a little bit \nlonger and a little bit tighter.\n  On your own or as a family, consider doing something for your \ncommunity in honor of the victims of 9/11. It can be donating blood, \nmaking a financial contribution to a needy cause, or giving your time \nand energy to a worthwhile organization.\n  I hope that we can all make today a positive and meaningful \nopportunity to unite our communities in helping others and honoring the \nvictims of 9/11. Together we will send a strong message to the world \nthat Americans remain united.

Mr. President, as I have on many occasions, I want to \nspeak to the very important issue of broadband deployment, especially \nin rural States like my home State of South Dakota. I want to ensure \nnew technology is utilized in ways that will help link rural \ncommunities to new and exciting opportunities available via the \nInternet. New technology will be critical to bringing new jobs, \neducational opportunities, and health care to South Dakota communities.\n  As the Senate considers the various proposals on how best to \nencourage the deployment of broadband, I want to make absolutely \ncertain that any legislation we pass takes into account the \nextraordinary challenges we face in rural America to deploy advanced \ntelecommunications services at an affordable cost to consumers. On this \npoint, I must acknowledge and comment on the terrific effort put forth \nby so many of our rural independent and cooperative telecommunications \nproviders in South Dakota. These companies have taken very seriously \ntheir commitment to serving rural communities, and now it's our turn in \nCongress to do our part towards this effort.\n  Not only will broadband deployment assist rural communities in \ndeveloping new opportunities, I believe increased broadband deployment \nwill help jumpstart our lagging economy. A recent study by an economist \nwith the Brookings Institution concluded that adding more broadband \nconnections could boost the economy by $500 billion per year. To \nsupport this finding, computer and technology companies like\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\nMicrosoft, Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Intel, Corning, Motorola, and \nNCR have weighed in, saying it is critically important for the United \nStates to adopt a national broadband policy that encourages investment \nin new broadband infrastructure, applications, and services.\n  Broadband deployment should be a national priority in the 21st \ncentury. In order to be competitive, educate our workforce, and \nincrease productivity, the United States must have universal broadband. \nMillions of Americans in rural areas and inner cities are impeded in \naccessing the full range of services available from the Internet \nbecause they do not have access to broadband service. We should strive \nto connect all Americans to the Internet through broadband technology. \nI will work with my colleagues to find a way to accomplish this goal in \na fair manner that supports broadband deployment throughout all of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9708-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, every year the Congress \ndesignates the September 15--October 15 period as Hispanic Heritage \nMonth, but even as we do so we know that the contributions Hispanic \nAmericans make to our national life are much greater than the modest \ntribute we pay them. Of all the varied cultures and traditions that are \nwoven together into the distinctive fabric of American life, Hispanic \nAmericans have some of the most distinctive, vigorous, and sustained \nculture and traditions.\n  In recent years the Hispanic American population in the United States \nhas grown very rapidly. According to the 2000 census it stands at 35 \nmillion, which represents an increase of 58 percent in the previous \ndecade alone. Projections show that by mid-century Hispanic Americans \nwill make up 24 percent of the population; put another way, just about \none in every four Americans will be of Hispanic-American origin. We \nhave see this trend very clearly in my own State of Maryland, where the \nHispanic American population has grown more than 82 percent since 1990, \nand now makes up more than 4 percent of the population statewide. But \nnumbers and percentages, while impressive, only hint at the vigor and \nthe variety of the Hispanic contribution to Maryland's culture and \neconomy.\n  Just as the U.S. population is diverse, so is the Hispanic American \ncommunity itself. There have long been established Puerto Rican and \nDominican communities in New York City, Central American communities in \nthe Washington metropolitan area, Cuban Americans in Florida, Mexican \nAmericans in California and the Southwest; but Hispanics from many \ndifferent countries now live in cities and towns and villages in every \ncorner of the Nation, and they bring to the communities in which they \nsettle the rich cultures of the nations from which they have come. They \nare moving forward to take their place in community and political \ninstitutions at every level. They are changing the face of America, and \nchanging the way we see America. As Hispanic Americans participate \nincreasingly in every aspect of our national life grows, they bring a \nnew dimension to ethnic diversity; with their presence they challenge \nthe old, corrosive assumptions that divided the world into black and \nwhite.\n  We must see to it that Hispanic Americans, like all others Americans, \nhave access to all the opportunities that make our society stronger, \nopportunities for education, employment, health care and housing. We \nmust also see that language barriers do not create unnecessary and \nunproductive impediments to participation. Sensitivity to cultural \ndifferences is important in our schools and clinics, our financial \ninstitutions, government offices and courts; appropriate bilingual \nmaterials can often solve problems of communication. Hispanic Americans \nhave given much to our national life, and with adequate opportunities \nthey will give much more.\n  Succeeding generations of immigrants have come to this country in \nsearch of a better life. They have worked hard, often against the most \ndifficult odds, to make a place for themselves and their families, and \nto realize fully the promise this Nation offers. Diversity has always \nbeen the hallmark of the Republic; the attacks of September 11 a year \nago have brought home to us, perhaps more so than ever in the past, \nthat in the diversity of our people lies one of our greatest strengths. \nHispanic Americans are now helping to write an important new chapter in \nour history, and I am pleased and proud to offer this tribute to \nHispanic Heritage Month, which recognized and celebrates their \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9708-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9708-S9709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING FRED ABRAHAM\n\n Mr. DeWINE.

While there, he helped resolve many of the \nchallenging habitat and conservation issues facing Ohio in the 1970s \nand 1980s, and solidified his status as a leader on wetland and \nwildlife issues.\n  Fred then went on to work for one of the most influential \nconservation organizations in the country, Ducks Unlimited. At DU, he \nbuilt strong coalitions and made countless friends, advocating on \nbehalf of sportsmen at the national level. After 16 years at DU, where \nhe engaged in fundraising and grassroots advocacy, Fred came to \nWashington as DU's Director of Conservation Policy.\n  Fred was the force behind some of the most important conservation \nlegislation that has been signed into law.

I immediately \ncould sense his passion for wetlands and his motivation to preserve \nthese areas for us now and for generations in the future. There is no \nquestion that Fred Abraham is ``the Man'' when it comes to wetlands. \nBoth in Washington and around the country, he is widely recognized as \nthe foremost advocate on wetland restoration.\n  Everyone who has had the opportunity to work with Fred is proud to \ncall him a friend.

RALPH PAIGE\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize Ralph Paige, executive director of the Southern Federation of \nCooperatives/Land Assistance Fund, or LAF, as the recipient for the \nNational Cooperative Month Economic Freedom Award.\n  For the past 14 years, under Mr. Paige's direction, the Federation/\nLAF has aided the underserved communities in the great State of \nGeorgia, and the rural South, by creating credit unions, farmer-owned \ncooperatives, and new sources of affordable housing for low-income \npeople. He has also been a leading advocate for fair treatment and land \nretention for African-Americans and other minority farmers. The \nFederation/LAF has created more than 70 cooperative member groups with \na membership of more than 20,000 families across 10 Southern States, \n200 units of affordable housing, and 19 credit unions with more than \n10,000 members.\n  Under Mr. Paige's leadership, the Federation/LAF has been a \nfrontrunner in not just developing new rural businesses and \ncooperatives but also provides the training and resources necessary so \nthat they may continue to thrive. The Federation/LAF continues to also \nadvance forestry cooperatives, providing special landowner training \nprograms to advance their development.\n  Mr. Paige has given selflessly of his time to promote and enhance \ncooperative business. He serves on the boards of the National \nCooperative Business Association, Nationwide Insurance, and the \nCooperative Development Foundation. He has served as an appointee to \nseveral USDA advisory committees, including the 21st Century Production \nAgriculture Commission, the Agriculture Policy Advisory Committee for \nTrade, and the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education and \nEconomics Advisory Board.\n  Mr. Paige is a past member of the boards for the Georgia Advisory \nBoard on Small and Minority Business, Cooperative Business \nInternational, and Cooperative Works, which is a national network of \ncooperative development centers.\n  His achievements have been noted by national and international \norganizations. The Congressional Black Caucus recognized Mr. Paige's \ncontributions to rural communities with the 2001 George Collins Rural \nAgriculture Advocacy Award. He is also an entrant into the George \nWashington Carver Public Service Hall of Fame, and has received the \nGeorgia Distinguished Cooperator Award from the Georgia Cooperative \nCouncil. Under Mr. Paige's direction, the Federation/LAF received the \nHumanitarian Award from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Non-\nviolent Social Change and an award from the United Nations for \n``significant contributions of adequate shelter to the poorer segments \nof the community.''\n  Ralph Paige epitomizes cooperation. Since 1967, the Federation/LAF \nhas worked on behalf of some of the most disadvantaged citizens of our \nNation to enable them to do two of the things most basic to economic \nfreedom: own land and operate businesses. For these reasons, it is my \nhonor to recognize Ralph for his work to advance cooperatives and serve \ndisadvantaged communities. I congratulate you on receiving the 2002 \nCooperative Month Economic Freedom Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9709-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF HOLLY J.

As a young \nwoman in Lincolnton, North Carolina, in the 1920's, she pursued a \nteaching certificate from the Livingstone Normal Teachers School and \ntaught under the supervision of her father, for a year. She then \nmarried Emory Loritts and went on to become very active in her \ncommunity. Mrs. Loritts was involved with the Arts Council of Lincoln \nCounty, the Lincoln County Library, and the Seniors Center. However, \nMrs. Loritts still had a desire to work with the young people of \nLincoln County and returned to college to earn her Bachelor of Science \nand Masters of Science. She went on to teach in Lincoln County Schools \nfor the next fifty years and was instrumental in shaping the minds and \nlives of thousands of American citizens.\n  Mrs. Loritts, who now resides in Huntsville, AL, is an example of the \ndedicated professionals that teach our young people every day. Her \ncommitment to improving the lives of children and producing solid \ncitizens should serve as an example to each of us. I applaud her \ntireless efforts on the behalf of others and would like to take this \nopportunity to thank her for all that she has contributed to her \ncommunity and the impact she has made on the lives of others.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mrs. Annie \nLoritts for her outstanding achievements and in wishing her a happy \nupcoming birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9709-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9709-S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO TECHNICAL SERGEANT CAESAR KELLUM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

For \nexample, he maintained a 100 percent academic average on all written \nevaluations; unprecedented in his unit's history. Out of 36 weapons \ndirectors, he is the only one to earn an ``exceptionally qualified'' \nrating on back-to-back evaluations. Additionally, he is a key member of \nan evaluation team to assess operations control center's readiness to \nhelp detect and identify 800,000 aircraft annually.\n  In addition to his excellent work with the U.S. Air Force, TSgt \nKellum has exhibited a great deal of involvement within the local \ncommunity. He orchestrated the sector's participation in the American \nCancer Society's Annual Relay for Life event and served as team captain \nfor the Millennium Cure Walkers. He raised $5,061,56 for the American \nCancer Society, exceeding the goal by 237 percent. As a result of his \nperformance, he was awarded the highly coveted ``Team Spirit'' award, \nwhich is extended to the team with the best overall effort and \nattitude.\n  Caesar Kellum was raised in Athens, AL and, after graduating from \nWest Limestone High School in Salem, AL, enlisted in the United States \nAir Force in August of 1990. Since arriving at Tyndall AFB, FL, \nTechnical Sergeant Kellum has completed all the requirements and \nreceived his associate of science degree in Instructor of Technology \nfrom the Community College of the Air Force. Currently, he is in his \njunior year at the American Military University working on a bachelor \nof science degree in Management.\n  SGT Kellum's military decorations include the Air Force Commendation \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Achievement Medal, Combat \nReadiness Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Organizational \nExcellence Award, Humanitarian Service Medal, National Defense Ribbon, \nGood Conduct Medal, and the Air Force Professional Military Education \nGraduate Ribbon.\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\n  TSgt Caesar Kellum deserves the thanks and praise of the nation that \nhe continues to faithfully serve. I know the Members of the Senate will \njoin me in wishing him and his wife Tiffiney Ann, also in the USAF, all \nthe best in the years ahead. Well done, TSgt Kellum. You have made \nAlabama and America Proud.\n  I had the pleasure recently to visit with Caesar and Tiffney. They \nare the very model of a couple that have given their lives to \nexcellence in public service. I was inspired just talking to \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9710-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DANIEL J.

Edelman, Inc., as it commemorates its 50th anniversary. \nPublic relations firms look to Edelman as a company to follow, and I \ncommend their work.\n  Since its founding in Chicago in 1952 by Daniel J. Edelman, the \nagency that bears his name has consistently been identified for its \nleadership in public relations. Edelman has received several awards, \nincluding the Golden World Award from the International Public \nRelations Association and the Sword of Excellence Award from the \nInstitute of Public Relations in London.\n  Mr. Edelman is widely regarded in public relations circles as a \nleader and innovator in the development of public relations practices, \nstandards and ethics in the United States and internationally. He has \ngenerously given his time to the Public Relations Society of America \nand to students seeking public relations careers. Mr. Edelman believes \nthat public relations should be practiced in a professional manner with \ncommitment to the highest standards. Edelman Public Relations has \ncontributed significant time to local, national and international \nphilanthropic causes and organizations.\n  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating Edelman on \nits 50th Anniversary.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nhonor the men and women at WKDZ FM radio in Cadiz, KY on winning the \nmost prestigious nationwide award broadcasting has to offer. WKDZ was \nrecently awarded a Marconi Radio Award by the National Association of \nBroadcasters, recognizing it as the ``Small Market Station of the \nYear.'' WKDZ is the only Kentucky station to ever receive a Marconi \nAward as Small Market Station of the Year.\n  WKDZ did not win this award based solely on their ability to play \ngood music or put interesting personalities on the air. Criteria used \nby the Marconi judges included ratings, community awards and \nrecognition, events sponsored by the station, continuing community \nservice broadcasts, and staff involvement in the community.\n  Over the years, WKDZ has raised thousands upon thousands of dollars \nfor the community. The station raised more than $150,000 during the \nRelay for Life, $82,000 on the Rotary Radio Auction, surpassing their \ngoal of $75,000 and helped gather 4,000 cans for the community \nThanksgiving Food Bank. WKDZ has furthermore sponsored such local \nevents as the Community Easter Egg Hunt, Halloween Safety Night and the \nTrigg County Country Ham Festival.\n  WKDZ is a shining example of how a private-owned business can on one \nhand be a profitable contributor to the local economy and on the other \nbe an active and influential participant in the community. I applaud \nWKDZ's efforts and congratulate them on this noteworthy honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9710-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF MARYGROVE COLLEGE'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my \ncongratulations to Marygrove College in Detroit on the celebration of \nits 75th anniversary.\n  For the last three-quarters of a century, Marygrove College has \noffered a strong liberal arts education to students from a wide-variety \nof backgrounds. Marygrove was originally founded in 1846 as St. Mary \nAcademy in Monroe, MI, by the Sister, Servants of the Immaculate Heart \nof Mary. The school was originally designed to teach young women and \ngirls. The gates of Marygrove College opened in September 1927 to \nwelcome 287 students through its doors. Today, 6,000 students \ncrisscross its metropolitan Detroit campus to take advantage of a \nquality and diverse education.\n  The college offers associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees in \n54 areas of study. The courses range from arts, music, and social work \nto radiology and science. Taking into account the fact that the average \nundergraduate student is 33 years old and the average graduate student \nis 36, Marygrove offers a special opportunity for students to advance \ntheir education within a schedule built around their established lives. \nWithout an educational opportunity like Marygrove's, many people might \nchoose not to pursue their education because they believe they are too \nbusy or too entrenched in their ``normal'' lives.\n  Marygrove's importance to Detroit is enhanced by its contributions to \nthe arts community. The school enriches Detroit's cultural scene \nthrough its extensive art, dance, and music programs. The school \nregularly sponsors exhibits in its beautiful art gallery as well as \nfrequent recitals and concerts for the public. Two years ago, Marygrove \nbecame the home of Detroit's 80-year-old Institute of Music and Dance.\n  Along with the celebrations for its 75-year anniversary, Marygrove \nwill open its newly-renovated 400-seat theater in November. In addition \nto a more dancer-friendly surface, the theater will contain a new \nmultipurpose room for rehearsals and dance classes. The facility will \nhave new acoustical systems, new house and theatrical lighting, better \ndressing room facilities, and better lines of sight from the balcony \nseats. The reopening of this theater, once used by the native \nMichigander, Madonna, will provide a new chance for developing and \npursuing performing arts opportunities in Detroit.\n  I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the \nstaff, teachers, and students of Marygrove College on its 75 years of \neducational accomplishments. Best of luck to Marygrove on the next \n75.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9710-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9710-5", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9710-6", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 3018.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenhance beneficiary access to quality health care services under the \nmedicare program, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Grassley, \nto introduce the ``Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity \nAct.'' This legislation is critical to ensuring access to quality, \naffordable health care for the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries \nnationwide.\n  Medicare is one of America's great success stories. Since its \ninception 36 years ago, Medicare has provided millions of elderly and \ndisabled Americans with insurance coverage they would not have \notherwise had. When Medicare was enacted, about half of America's \nelderly lacked health insurance. Now nearly all are covered by \nMedicare.\n  Over the past three decades, Medicare has undergone significant \nchanges, including changes in the way that health care providers are \nreimbursed. In response to rising Medicare expenditures, Congress has \nresponded with complex cost-containment mechanisms: diagnosis related \ngroups, or DRGs, for hospital inpatient services in the early 1980s, a \nfee schedule for physicians' services in 1989. And in 1997, Congress \npassed the Balanced Budget Act, which mandated prospective payment \nsystems for hospital outpatient departments, home health agencies, and \nskilled nursing facilities. Gradually, Medicare has changed from a \ncost-based system to one of prospective, flat-rate payment.\n  The significant changes in payment policy have resulted in a few \nbumps along the way, particularly those enacted as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. The BBA was a well-intended attempt to get our \nNation's fiscal house in order and extend the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund. And in that regard, the goal of the legislation was \nachieved. Solvency of the Part A Trust Fund was extended by almost 30 \nyears. But in some instances, the BBA cuts went too far.\n  In such cases, these cuts threatened to reduce Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries' access to quality medical care and services. Congress \nresponded by passing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, BBRA, of 1999 \nand the Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act, BIPA, of 2000. I \nwas proud to play a role in both of these bills, including help for \nrural areas, which were disproportionately affected by the BBA.\n  Despite the policies and payment changes enacted as part of BBRA and \nBIPA, we still find that in some cases more improvements and \nadjustments are needed. And that is why Senator Grassley and I are \nintroducing this bill today.\n  So what does this bill do? Most importantly, this bill would restore \npayments to physicians, which were cut in 2002 by about five percent. \nUnder the Medicare fee schedule, payment for physician services depends \non several factors, including the growth in medical inflation, \nperformance of the American economy, and changes in law and regulation.\n  Also central to the calculation of payments are estimates by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which was formerly \nknown as the Health Care Financing Administration, of the numbers of \nMedicare beneficiaries in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Largely \nbecause of significant estimation errors and a weakened economy, \nphysicians under Medicare experienced an average payment reduction of \nfive percent in 2002. If Congress does not act to fix the system, \nfurther large cuts are forecast for the coming years. And the potential \nconsequences of inaction are serious.\n  According to a 30-State survey by the Medicare Rights Center, \nMedicare beneficiaries in 15 states and the District of Columbia are \nalready having trouble finding a physician who accepts new Medicare \npatients. And researchers from the Center for Studying Health System \nChange have found that the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries who \nreported delaying or not getting necessary physician care rose from 9.1 \npercent in 1997 to 11 percent in 2001. The study also showed that of \nthe near-elderly, patients between 50 and 64, 18.4 percent experienced \ndifficulty in seeing a physician in 2001, up from 15.2 percent in 1997.\n  This bill would provide positive payment updates to the physician fee \nschedule over the next three years, representing a dramatic turnaround \nin Medicare physician payments. It would also modify the formula that \nis used to increase payments each year, the so-called SGR, which most \nphysicians have learned to view with uncertainty and distrust.\n  While this proposal on physician updates represents progress, I \nacknowledge that it is imperfect, producing large reductions in \nMedicare physician payments in 2006 and beyond. I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues in the Congress and the Administration to \nfind a more reasonable solution.\n  Aside from physician payments, this legislation addresses a number of \nother important Medicare reimbursement issues, many of which are set to \ntake effect today, October 1. The bill will\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\ncompletely eliminate the 15 percent cut in home health payments. It \nwill forestall large cuts to indirect medical education, so critical to \nthe well-being of our nation's teaching hospitals. And the bill will \ncontinue additional payments to nursing homes to help them hire more \nstaff to care for patients.\n\n  It should come as no surprise that another priority of mine, and \nSenator Grassley's, is ensuring that rural areas are treated on par \nwith their urban counterparts. I represent a state with a population \ndensity of about six people per square mile where patients and \nproviders are often separated by vast distances. The current Medicare \npayment structure does not adequately account for the unique \ncircumstances and challenges of providing medical care in such areas, \nwhere economies of scale often make systems like prospective payment \nunworkable.\n  That's why I was proud to help write the Sole Community Hospital law \nin the early 1980s and the Critical Access Hospital, CAH, program in \n1997. Based on the Montana Medical Assistance Facility program, or MAF, \nthe CAH concept has been a lifeline for over 600 rural communities \nnationwide, allowing hospitals that might have otherwise closed to stay \nopen. This bill makes a number of important changes to the CAH program, \nincluding a provision allowing greater flexibility in the use of acute \ncare and swing beds, as well as reauthorization of the Rural Hospital \nFlexibility Grant Program, which assists facilities in making the \nswitch to CAH status.\n  Aside from Critical Access Hospitals, this legislation makes a number \nof other important changes to bring Medicare equity to rural America. \nBy making the Medicare Incentive Payment Program, MIPP, automatic, \nphysicians can more easily receive their 10 percent bonus for \npracticing in health professional shortage areas. And by setting a \nfloor for the physician work component of Medicare's geographic cost \nindex, payments to rural physicians will be raised.\n  This bill also puts rural and urban areas on a more level playing \nfield with respect to non-CAH hospital payments. It equalizes the base \npayment rate for all PPS hospitals, eliminating the differential in the \nso-called ``standardized amount,'' which systematically pays rural \nareas less than large urban ones. And it makes Disproportionate Share \nHospital, DSH, payments more equitable by allowing rural facilities to \nreceive increased payments for treating indigent patients.\n  Many of these provisions are based on the work and recommendations of \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, in their report on \nrural Medicare policy. That report included telling statistics, and \nreinforced what I hear from my constituents on a regular basis: \nMedicare payment policy disadvantages rural areas and changes are \nneeded. For example, in 1999, overall Medicare margins for rural \nhospitals with 50 beds or less were negative 5.4 percent, worse than \nany other category of hospital. And total margins for these hospitals \nare also the lowest, at 1.7 percent in 1999, compared to 3.6 percent \nfor all hospitals. Clearly Congress has work to do to ensure greater \ngeographic equity in Medicare payment, and this bill makes great \nstrides to that end.\n  In addition to many reimbursement changes, this legislation contains \nimportant relief for providers struggling with Medicare's regulatory \nframework. Many of these regulatory relief provisions were contained in \nlegislation I wrote with Senators Kerry, Murkowski and Grassley last \nyear. Among other things, these provisions will: ensure that CMS \nanswers questions posed by health care providers in a timely manner; \ngive additional appeals rights to providers, so that they receive fair \ntreatment for honest billing mistakes; and ensure that CMS demands on \nproviders to return overpayments are reasonable and do not force small \nproviders to declare bankruptcy.\n  In addition to Medicare provisions, this legislation addresses many \ncritical issues related to Medicaid and the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. The bill provides $5 billion in fiscal relief to \nstates struggling with tight Medicaid budgets and nearly $3 billion to \nhelp safety net hospitals continue to provide critical health care \nservices to low-income Americans. The bill also ensures the continued \nsuccess of the S-CHIP program by giving States more time to spend their \nS-CHIP allotments and ensuring that as many children as possible are \ncovered.\n  The bill provides immediate, temporary fiscal relief to states in two \nways: by giving states a temporary increase in their Medicaid match \nrate, or FMAP; and by increasing funding for the Social Services Block \nGrant. Taken together, these two approaches will help alleviate the \npressure on states to cut programs that serve low income families, \nchildren, seniors and the disabled.\n  The State fiscal relief provision recognizes that States are in the \nmidst of their worst fiscal crisis since the early 1990s. States have \ncut their budgets across many programs, from education to health care \nto other social programs. And because Medicaid is one of the largest \nparts of state budgets, Medicaid continues to be a prime target for \nspending cuts.\n  According to a recent report from the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid \nand the Uninsured, 45 states took action to reduce their Medicaid \nspending growth in fiscal year 2002, and 41 states are planning further \nreductions in fiscal year 2003. In my own State of Montana, Medicaid \nbeneficiaries have been asked to pay a larger share of the costs of \ntheir coverage, and provider reimbursement rates have been cut.\n  These program cuts have come about at the same time that Medicaid \nrolls are increasing due to the recession. As more people lose their \njobs and health insurance--just yesterday, we learned that in 2001 \nanother 1.4 million people joined the ranks of the uninsured, many \nbecome eligible for Medicaid. At the same time, States are forced to \ncut back on this vital safety net program when people need it most. \nThis is a vicious cycle that we must help end. If we don't, the \nultimate result of all this is an increase in the uninsured. Just as we \nsaw in the early 1990s.\n  The financial crisis facing State Medicaid programs is also felt by \nthe facilities that provide care to Medicaid beneficiaries and low-\nincome insured populations. To ensure that hospitals serving our most \nvulnerable populations can continue providing their vital services, \nthis bill eliminates the scheduled reduction in federal Medicaid \nfunding for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and low-income, uninsured patients. Without the \nrestoration of these DSH funds, safety net hospitals would lose nearly \n$3 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next three years. \nStates with smaller DSH programs will also benefit through this \nlegislation, as it provides them with greater resources to serve their \nlow-income patients.\n  This bill also seeks to continue the unqualified success of the S-\nCHIP program by ensuring that S-CHIP funds are used to cover as many \nchildren as possible, as efficiently and effectively as possible. By \ngiving states an additional year to spend funds that would otherwise be \nreturned to the Federal Treasury and renewing the ongoing system to \nallocate unspent S-CHIP funds equitably among the States, the \nlegislation will help sustain the significant progress S-CHIP has made \nin reducing the ranks of uninsured children. In addition, the new \ncaseload stabilization pool will provide additional funds to states \nexpected to have insufficient federal funds over the next few years, \nreducing the chance that children will be dropped from the rolls.\n  This bill would also make important improvements to the Medicaid and \nS-CHIP waiver process. Medicaid and S-CHIP waivers have become an \nincreasingly powerful way for the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to make changes to crucial health programs without having to \nconsult with, or seek legislative change from, the Congress.\n  The General Accounting Office recently identified serious problems \nwith the current waiver approval process, including a lack of \naccountability in several areas. I am pleased to have worked with \nSenator Grassley to develop legislation that would address the key GAO \nrecommendations and begin to restore integrity to the waiver process. \nMore specifically, this bill would require that the waiver process be \nmore transparent and require public notification when major changes are \nin store.\n  Our bill would also prohibit approval of future waivers that would \ntake dollars set aside for children's health and\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\nuse them instead on childless adults. Where Congress has set limits on \nthe use of federal dollars, waivers should not be used as a back door \nway to get around those limits.\n  Without question, the Medicaid and S-CHIP programs are vital \ncomponents of America's health care safety net, and both programs are \ncritical to the well-being of thousands in my State. The Billings \nGazette reported yesterday that about 14,000 of the 18,000 newly-\ninsured Montanans since 1999 were additions to Montana's Medicaid and \nS-CHIP programs.\n  But despite the critical role these programs play, I am not convinced \nthat we know enough about our nation's health care safety net. Based on \nlegislation I introduced last congress with Senator Grassley, the bill \nwe are introducing today would change that, by establishing the Safety \nNet Organizations and Patient Advisory Commission. SNOPAC would be an \nindependent and nonpartisan commission charged with the authority to \noversee all aspects of America's health care safety net, including \nMedicaid and S-CHIP. Based on an Institute of Medicine report, SNOPAC \nwill include health care experts from the disparate parts of our safety \nnet system, reporting to Congress on recommendations to maintain our \nintact, but endangered, health care safety net.\n  Some will argue that Congress has more pressing Medicare priorities \nto address than restoring payments to health care providers. They argue \nwill that before action on a bill concerning Medicare payment policy, \nCongress should debate and enact a solid prescription Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the need for a good drug benefit. I have \nworked for years to enact one, and I think that the lack of a drug \nbenefit is the greatest deficiency in the Medicare program today. \nAlmost 40 percent of seniors currently lack drug coverage. And for \nthose who have it, it is often unreliable and unaffordable.\n  I did my utmost to pass a drug benefit this year, and I will continue \nmy efforts until one is signed into law. But I will not support a \nbenefit that is unworkable for Montana. And I will not support reviving \na prescription drug debate that threatens passage of the important bill \nSenator Grassley and I are introducing today.\n  The United States Senate debated Medicare prescription coverage in \nJuly. We had four votes on four different proposals to establish a drug \nbenefit under Medicare. But all of those votes failed. None came close \nto getting the required 60 votes for passage in the Senate.\n  Voting again on a prescription drug bill that has not changed \nmaterially from the proposals we voted on in July is not the way to \npass a drug benefit. In fact, it's a prescription for legislative \nimpasse--on prescription drugs and on provider reimbursement issues.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, \nwith the recognition that there are other pressing issues facing the \nMedicare program besides provider payments, but with the acknowledgment \nthat maintaining access to health care services is also an important \ngoal.\n  As Calvin Coolidge once said, ``We cannot do everything at once . . . \nbut we can do something at once.'' Today is October 1, and large \nMedicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP payment reductions and changes will go \ninto effect. Congress should act as soon as possible to address these \nissues, to get something done, and to ensure access to care for our \nseniors, our children, and our disabled population. This bill is \nnecessary, timely and should be considered with expedition. I urge \nCongress and the President to act swiftly on this comprehensive \nlegislation and enact it into law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joining Chairman Baucus today to \nintroduce the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act of \n2002.\n  This legislation arrives at an important time for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and the providers that care for them: October 1. Many \nprovisions of the Medicare law that ensure adequate payment for \nproviders, and in turn, beneficiary access to care, expire today. I \nurge the Senate to consider this legislation with all speed, as soon as \npossible.\n  Our bill addresses pressing needs. The clock is running out on \nMedicare payments to doctors, who are scheduled for yet another \nreduction in their fees for a second straight year, absent \nCongressional action. Skilled Nursing Facilities also face a major \nreduction in payment today. In other areas facing imminent payment \ncuts, such as home health and hospital services, our bill injects \nfinancial support that will stabilize these essential services our \nseniors rely on. The legislation also provides billions in aid to State \ngovernments, many of them facing steep budget deficits, so they can \nmeet the needs of citizens who rely on the Medicaid and Children's \nHealth Insurance Programs.\n  In addition to ensuring continued access to quality care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, our bipartisan Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare \nEquity Act makes long overdue improvements to health care in rural \nAmerica. Our bill invests in States like Iowa, my home State, where \nsmall providers that practice efficient medicine are hurt by complex \npayment formulas that favor high-cost care in big cities.\n  The formulas also don't recognize special costs faced by smaller, \nmore isolated physicians, hospitals and clinics. It obviously doesn't \nmake sense to penalize States like Iowa who do more with less. That's \nwhy I'm so committed to fixing these formulas. The proposal I've put \ntogether with Senator Baucus would provide a tremendous infusion of \ncash to hard-pressed health care providers across Iowa and to other \nrural States. It takes money to ensure access to care for Iowans, and \nthis will help make the federal government part of the solution instead \nof part of the problem.\n  Together, Senator Baucus and I have introduced our bill under Rule \n14, which means the bill will be placed directly on the calendar two \ndays from now, rather than referred to our own Committee, the Finance \nCommittee. We agreed to take this extraordinary step because the Senate \nis basically tied up in knots right now. Well, our message is that \nMedicare fairness is too urgent to let this bill be a victim of \ngridlock. Our action today gives Senate Majority Leader Daschle the \nability to call the bill up as early as Thursday. In short, there's no \ntime to waste.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3019. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar \nEstrada Chavez and the farm labor movement; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource \nstudy of sites associated with the life of Cesar Estrada Chavez. Chavez \nis one of the most revered public servants in our history for his \nleadership in helping organize migrant farm workers, and for providing \ninspiration to the most oppressed in our society. It is important that \nwe cherish his struggle and do what we can to preserve certain sites \nlocated in Arizona, California and other states that are significant to \nhis life.\n  My fellow Arizonan, Cesar Chavez was born in Yuma. He was the son of \nmigrant farm workers, and an exemplary American hero. He no doubt loved \nqualities of life associated with his family's heritage, but he will be \nremembered for the sincerity of his American patriotism. He fought to \nhelp Americans transcend distinctions of experience, and share equality \nin the rights and responsibilities of freedom. He made America a bigger \nand better Nation.\n  While Chavez and his family migrated across the southwest looking for \nfarm work, he evolved into a defender of worker's rights. He founded \nthe National Farm Workers Association in 1962, which later became the \nUnited Farm Workers of America. Essentially, he gave a voice to those \nthat had no voice. In his words: ``We cannot seek achievement for \nourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community . \n. . our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and \nneeds of others, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  This legislation, almost identical to the House bill, H.R. 2966, \nintroduced by Congresswoman Hilda Solis, D-CA, in September 2001, would \nspecifically authorize the Secretary of the Interior to determine \nwhether any of the sites\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nmeet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic \nLandmarks. The study would be conducted within three years. The goal of \nthis legislation is to establish a foundation for a future bill that \nwill designate land for these sites to become Historic Landmarks.\n  Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what \nit meant to serve and sacrifice for others. He was a true American hero \nthat embodied the values of justice and freedom this nation holds dear. \nHonoring the places of his life will enable his legacy to inspire and \nserve as an example for our future leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cesar Estrada Chavez Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on March 31, 1927, Cesar Estrada Chavez was born on a \n     small farm near Yuma, Arizona;\n       (2) at age 10, Chavez and his family became migrant farm \n     workers after they lost their farm in the Great Depression;\n       (3) throughout his youth and into adulthood, Chavez \n     migrated across the Southwest, laboring in fields and \n     vineyards;\n       (4) during this period, Chavez was exposed to the hardships \n     and injustices of farm worker life;\n       (5) in 1952, Chavez's life as an organizer and public \n     servant began when he left the fields and joined the \n     Community Service Organization, a community-based self-help \n     organization;\n       (6) while with the Community Service Organization, Chavez \n     conducted--\n       (A) voter registration drives; and\n       (B) campaigns against racial and economic discrimination;\n       (7) during the late 1950's and early 1960's, Chavez served \n     as the national director of the Community Service \n     Organization;\n       (8) in 1962, Chavez founded the National Farm Workers \n     Association, an organization that--\n       (A) was the first successful farm workers union in the \n     United States; and\n       (B) became known as the ``United Farm Workers of America'';\n       (9) from 1962 to 1993, as leader of United Farm Workers of \n     America, Chavez achieved for tens of thousands of farm \n     workers--\n       (A) dignity and respect;\n       (B) fair wages;\n       (C) medical coverage;\n       (D) pension benefits;\n       (E) humane living conditions; and\n       (F) other rights and protections;\n       (10) the leadership and humanitarianism of Cesar Chavez \n     continue to influence and inspire millions of citizens of the \n     United States to seek social justice and civil rights for the \n     poor and disenfranchised; and\n       (11) the life of Cesar Chavez and his family provides an \n     outstanding opportunity to illustrate and interpret the \n     history of agricultural labor in the western United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESOURCE STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     complete a resource study of sites in the State of Arizona, \n     the State of California, and other States that are \n     significant to the life of Cesar E. Chavez and the farm labor \n     movement in the western United States to determine--\n       (1) appropriate methods for preserving and interpreting the \n     sites; and\n       (2) whether any of the sites meets the criteria for listing \n     on the National Register of Historic Places or designation as \n     a national historic landmark under--\n       (A) the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.); and\n       (B) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.).\n       (b) Requirements.--In conducting the study under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall--\n       (1) consider the criteria for the study of areas for \n     potential inclusion in the National Park System under section \n     8(b)(2) of Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(b)(2)); and\n       (2) consult with--\n       (A) the Cesar E. Chavez Foundation;\n       (B) the United Farm Workers Union;\n       (C) State and local historical associations and societies; \n     and\n       (D) the State Historic Preservation Officers of the State \n     of Arizona, the State of California, and any other State in \n     which a site described in subsection (a) is located.\n       (c) Report.--On completion of the study under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Resources \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on--\n       (1) the findings of the study; and\n       (2) any recommendations of the Secretary.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 3020. A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Cheyenne, Wyoming, \nmetropolitan area, to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today with great honor and pride to \nintroduce a bill that would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in Cheyenne, WY.\n  As our Nation's veterans have proven time and time again, whenever \nthe fear of war has knocked on America's door, we have had the strength \nto open it. This year has been no different. Since last September, we \nhave witnessed the beginning of a new kind of war, a war on terrorism, \nand we have been confronted by the most evil of leaders who seek to \ndestroy our love of country and freedom. Yet, our Nation's military men \nand women and our veterans have once again responded to the call of \nduty to protect everything we hold dear. They remind us that our faith \nin God, our belief and trust in our communities, and our strength as a \nNation can and will endure through these extraordinary times.\n  This is why I am introducing a bill to honor those who have given so \nmuch in defense of our great country. The price of freedom is not free, \nand many of our Nation's veterans have paid the ultimate price. \nMillions have been laid to rest in our Nation's national cemeteries, \nand millions more will follow. These veterans deserve to be placed next \nto those veterans with whom they so courageously engaged in battle \nthroughout the years.\n  All veterans deserve the opportunity to be buried in a veterans \ncemetery regardless of their place of residency. Fortunately, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs recognizes the importance of providing \nburial sites for our Nation's veterans next to their comrades and near \ntheir families. As such, they have established a goal to increase the \npercentage of veterans served by a national or State veterans cemetery \nwithin 75 miles of their residence to 88 percent by 2006. I commend the \nVA's efforts and believe my bill will help the department reach that \ngoal.\n  There are currently more than 53,000 veterans in Wyoming. They live \nin every town, big and small, and they must often travel hundreds of \nmiles for health care and other veteran benefits. The largest and most \nconcentrated group of veterans in Wyoming live near Wyoming's only \nmilitary base, F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne. Unfortunately, \nthis veteran population must travel either 110 miles to the national \ncemetery in Colorado or 235 miles to the national cemetery in Maxwell, \nNE. It is worse for the veteran population living in other areas of the \nState. There are no national cemeteries in Montana, Idaho or Utah, \nwhich leaves veterans in the northwest with few options.\n  Regardless of a veteran's place of residency in Wyoming, most are \nforced to select the Wyoming State Cemetery as their place of burial \nbecause it is the only state or national cemetery in the entire state. \nAlthough it is located in Wyoming's second-largest city of Casper, \nWyoming's State cemetery does not adequately meet the needs of veterans \nin a State that spans more than 97,000 square miles. It is, on average, \n150 miles from any other incorporated city, and is more than 175 miles \nfrom the most concentrated veteran population in Cheyenne. While I \ncommend the Wyoming State Cemetery for its exceptional service and \ncareful maintenance, this is an extraordinary distance for friends and \nfamily to travel to visit their deceased loved ones.\n  As such, I am introducing legislation today to create a National \nVeterans Cemetery in Cheyenne, WY because every veteran deserves to be \nburied near their families and with the honor that comes with being \nlaid to rest in a national veterans cemetery.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY IN CHEYENNE, \n                   WYOMING, METROPOLITAN AREA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Cheyenne, Wyoming, \n     metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and their \n     families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Wyoming and local \n     officials of the Cheyenne metropolitan area; and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in that area that would be \n     suitable to establish the national cemetery under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Authority to Accept Donation of Parcel of Land.--(1) \n     The Secretary may accept on behalf of the United States the \n     gift of an appropriate parcel of real property. The Secretary \n     shall have administrative jurisdiction over such parcel of \n     real property, and shall use such parcel to establish the \n     national cemetery under subsection (a).\n       (2) For purposes of Federal income, estate, and gift taxes, \n     the real property accepted under paragraph (1) shall be \n     considered as a gift to the United States.\n       (d) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for the \n     establishment of the national cemetery and an estimate of \n     costs associated with the establishment of the national \n     cemetery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 3023. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \na program to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore and \nprotect forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncontinue and enhance the USDA Forest Service's role in the restoration \nof the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Joining me in sponsoring this \nlegislation are my colleagues, Senators Warner and Mikulski.\n  Forest loss and fragmentation are occurring rapidly in the Chesapeake \nBay region and are among the most important issues facing the Bay and \nforest management today. According to the National Resources Inventory, \nthe States closest to the Bay lost 350,000 acres of forest between \n1987-1997 or almost 100 acres per day. More and more rural areas are \nbeing converted to suburban developments resulting in smaller \ncontiguous forest tracts. These trends are leading to a regional forest \nland base that is more vulnerable to conversion, less likely to be \neconomically viable in the future, and is losing its capacity to \nprotect watershed health and other ecological benefits, such as \ncontrolling storm water runoff, erosion and air pollution, all critical \nto the Bay clean-up effort.\n  Since 1990, the USDA Forest Service has been an important part of the \nChesapeake Bay Program. Administered through the Northeastern Area, \nState and Private Forestry, this program has worked closely with \nFederal, State and local partners in the six-state Chesapeake Bay \nregion to demonstrate how forest protection, restoration and \nstewardship activities, can contribute to achieving the Bay restoration \ngoals. Over the past 12 years, it has provided modest levels of \ntechnical and financial assistance, averaging approximately $300,000 \nyear, to develop collaborative watershed projects that address \nwatershed forest conservation, restoration and stewardship. With the \nsigning of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the role of the USDA Forest \nService has become more important than ever. Among other provisions, \nthis Agreement requires the signatories to conserve existing forests \nalong all streams and shoreline; promote the expansion and connection \nof contiguous forests; assess the Bay's forest lands; and provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to local governments to plan for or \nrevise plans, ordinances and subdivision regulations to provide for the \nconservation and sustainable use of the forest and agricultural lands. \nTo address these goals, the USDA Forest Service must have additional \nresources and authority, and that is what my amendment seeks to \nprovide.\n  This legislation codifies the roles and responsibilities of the USDA \nForest Service to the Bay restoration effort. It strengthens existing \ncoordination, technical assistance, forest resource assessment and \nplanning efforts. It authorizes a small grants program to support local \nagencies, watershed associations and citizen groups in conducting on-\nthe-ground conservation projects. It also establishes a regional \napplied forestry research and training program to enhance urban, \nsuburban and rural forests in the watershed. Finally it authorizes $3.5 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2010, a modest increase \nin view of the six-state, 64,000 square mile watershed. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 3025. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Chesapeake Bay \nEnvironmental Restoration and Protection Program; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with Senators Warner and Mikulski, to reauthorize and enhance \nthe Chesapeake Bay Environmental Protection and Restoration Program. \nThis program, which was first established in Section 510 of the Water \nResources Development Act of 1996, Public Law 104-303, authorizes the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide design and construction \nassistance to State and local authorities in the environmental \nrestoration of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  In 1994, when I first introduced the legislation to create this \nprogram, I spoke about the need for this assistance and the unique \ncapabilities the Army Corps of Engineers brings to the Chesapeake Bay \nrestoration effort. I want to underscore some of those arguments today \nand the vital importance of continuing and enhancing this program.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has been an integral part of the \nChesapeake Bay Program for many years. In 1984 the Corps completed one \nof the most comprehensive investigations of the entire Chesapeake Bay \nbasin, a landmark report which identified many of the serious problems \nfacing the Bay. The Corps played a vital role in the development of the \nBay Program's state-of-the-art computer model and has undertaken a \nvariety of major projects in the 6-state Chesapeake Bay watershed \nincluding the Poplar Island beneficial use of dredged material project, \noyster reef restoration, and removal of blockages to fish passage. The \nagency is currently conducting investigations on sedimentation, \nshoreline erosion, and environmental problems in specific watersheds \nthat we hope will result in additional projects to restore the Bay. And \nI am delighted that the Environment and Public Works Committee has just \napproved our new Study Resolution directing the Corps to integrate \nthese existing and future work efforts into a coordinated, \ncomprehensive master plan.\n  But while these projects and studies continue and the master plan is \nbeing developed, it is vital that environmental restoration efforts be \nsustained and expanded. Two years ago, the States in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed and the Federal Government conducted an extensive evaluation \nof cleanup progress since the 1980s and determined that, despite \nimportant advances, efforts must be redoubled to restore the integrity \nof the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. A new Chesapeake 2000 agreement was \nsigned to serve as a blueprint for the restoration effort over the next \ndecade. To meet the goals established in the new agreement, it is \nestimated that the local, State and Federal Governments must invest \nmore than $8.5 billion over the course of the next ten years. Nutrient \nand sediment loads must be significantly reduced, oyster populations \nmust be increased, Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and wetlands must be \nprotected and restored, and remaining blockages to fish passage must be \nremoved, among other actions. As the lead Federal agency in water \nresource management, the Corps has an essential role to play in this \neffort.\n  Since the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection \nProgram was first established and funding was appropriated, requests \nfrom State and local governments for\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nassistance under the program has grown dramatically. The design-\nconstruct nature of this program, which enables the Corps to streamline \nits process of undertaking on-the-ground environmental restoration \nprojects, is particularly appealing to State and local governments. To \ndate, the Corps of Engineers has constructed or approved $9.3 million \nin projects under the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and \nProtection Program including oyster restoration projects in Virginia, \nshoreline protection and wetland/sewage treatment projects at Smith \nIsland in Maryland and the upgrade of the Scranton Wastewater Treatment \nPlant in Pennsylvania to reduce the amount of nutrients delivered to \nthe Chesapeake Bay. These projects have nearly exhausted the current \n$10 million authorization.\n  The legislation which I am introducing increases the authorization \nfor this program from $10 million to $30 million. Consistent will all \nother environmental restoration authorities of the Corps of Engineers, \nit enables States and local governments to provide all or any portion \nof the 25 percent non-Federal share required in the form of in-kind \nservices. It also establishes a new small-grants program for local \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations to carry out small-scale \nrestoration and protection projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. \nThe program would be administered by the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation which has extensive experience and expertise in managing \nthese kinds of grants for other Federal agencies. Ten percent of the \nfunds appropriated each year under this program would be set-aside for \nthese grants.\n  In view of the great need and the many requests for assistance from \nthe Bay area states, this legislation is clearly warranted and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill continues \nthe legislative process that I started in the 106th Congress with the \nintroduction of the Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights. \nThe purpose of these bills is to improve the Federal Arbitration Act so \nthat it will remain as a cost-effective means of resolving disputes, \nbut will do so in a fair way. The Arbitration Fairness Act will provide \nprocedural protections to everyone who enters into a contract that \ncontains an arbitration clause. This bill would ensure that consumers, \nemployees, and small businesses that enter into contracts covered by \nthe Federal Arbitration Act will have their disputes resolved in \naccordance with due process of law, and in a speedy and cost effective \nmanner.\n  Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925. It has served \nus as well for three-quarters of a century. Under the Act, if the \nparties agree to a contract affecting interstate commerce that contains \na clause requiring arbitration, the clause will be enforceable in \ncourt. In short, the Federal Arbitration Act allows parties to a \ncontract to agree not to take their disputes to court, but to resolve \nany dispute arising from that contract before a neutral decision-maker, \ngenerally selected by a non-profit arbitration organization, such as \nthe American Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum. \nThe parties can generally present evidence and be represented by \ncounsel. And the decision-makers will apply the relevant State law in \nresolving the dispute. Arbitration is generally quicker and less \nexpensive than going to court.\n  In recent years, there have been some cases where the arbitration \nprocess has not worked well, but thousands of disputes have been fairly \nand effectively settled by arbitrators. Such a system is even more \nimportant because of skyrocketing legal costs where attorneys require \nlarge contingent fees. Accordingly, I have opposed piecemeal \nlegislative changes to the act. Instead, I believe that the Senate \nshould approach the Federal Arbitration Act in a comprehensive manner.\n  The approach of reforming arbitration, rather than abandoning the \narbitration process provides several benefits. Arbitration is one of \nthe most cost-effective means of resolving a dispute. Unlike \nbusinesses, consumers and employees generally cannot afford a team of \nlawyers to represent them. And their claims are often not being enough \nso that a lawyer would take the case on a 25 percent or even a 50 \npercent contingent fee. In an article in the Columbia Human Rights Law \nReview, Lewis Maltby, Director, National Task Force on Civil Liberties \nin the Workplace of the American Civil Liberties Union and a Director \nof the American Arbitration Association--not die-hard conservative \nentities--explains how court litigation is too expensive for most \nemployees:\n  ``Even if the client has clearly been wronged and is virtually \ncertain to prevail in court, the attorney will be forced to turn down \nthe case unless there are substantial damages. A survey of plaintiff \nemployment lawyers found that a prospective plaintiff needed to have a \nminimum of $60,000 in provable damages-not including pain and suffering \nor other intangible damages-before an attorney would take the case.\n  Even this, however, does not exhaust the financial obstacles an \nemployee must overcome to secure representation. In light of their risk \nof losing such cases, many plaintiffs' attorneys require a prospective \nclient to pay a retainer, typically about $3,000. Others require \nclients to pay out-of-pocket expenses of the case as they are incurred. \nExpenses in employment discrimination cases can be substantial. Donohue \nand Siegelman found that expenses in Title VII cases are at least \n$10,000 and can reach as high as $25,000. Finally, some plaintiffs' \nattorneys now require a consultation fee, generally $200-$300, just to \ndiscuss their situation with a potential client.\n  ``The result of these formidable hurdles in that most people with \nclaims against their employer are unable to obtain counsel, and thus \nnever receive justice. Paul Tobias, founder of the National Employment \nLawyer's Association, has testified that ninety-five percent of those \nwho seek help from the private bar with an employment matter do not \nobtain counsel. Howard's survey of plaintiffs' lawyers produced the \nsame result. A Detroit firm reported that only one of eighty-seven \nemployees who came to them seeking representation was accepted as a \nclient.''\n\n  Lewis L. Maltby, Private Justice: Employment Arbitration and Civil \nRights, 30 Col. Hum. R.L. Rev. 29, 57-58 (1998).\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\n  Without arbitration, the consumer or employee is faced with having to \npay a lawyer's hourly rate, which may amount to several thousand \ndollars to litigate a claim in court, for a broken television that cost \n$700 new. If this is what consumers and employees are left with, many \nwill have no choice but to drop their claim. This is not right. It is \nnot fair. Thus, Professor Stephen Ware of the Cumberland Law School, \nstates in a recent paper published by the CATO Institution that \n``current [arbitration] law is better for all consumers [than an \nexemption from the FAA] except those few who are especially likely to \nhave large liability claims . . .'' Stephen J. Ware, Arbitration under \nAssault, CATO Policy Analysis No. 433 p. 10 (2002).\n  Thus, while some have argued that the Congress should enact \nexemptions from the FAA for different classes of contracts from \nautomobile franchise contracts to employment contracts, such exemptions \nwould not help the overwhelming majority of the people who could not \nafford a lawyer to litigate in court. This is where arbitration can \ngive the consumer or employee a cost-effective forum to assert their \nclaim. Thus, before we make exceptions to the FAA for some of the most \nwell to do corporations in our society, I think it is our duty to \nconsider how we can improve the system for those less financially able.\n  Can we improve the arbitration system? Yes, but we must take a \nbalanced approach. In this approach we should protect the sanctity of \nlegal contracts. In any contract, the parties agree to all the terms \nand clauses included in the contract document. This includes the \narbitration clause. This is basic contract law, and the basic principle \nupon which the FAA has been supported for 75 years.\n  But this is not always the case. In certain situations, consumers, \nemployees, or businesses have not been treated fairly. That is what the \nArbitration Fairness Act is designed to correct.\n  The bill will maintain the cost benefits of binding arbitration, but \nwill grant several specific ``due process'' rights to all parties to an \narbitration. The bill is based on the consumer and employee due process \nprotocols of the American Arbitration Association that have broad \nsupport. The bill provides the following rights: 1. Notice. Under the \nbill an arbitration clause, to be enforceable, would have to have a \nheading in large, bold print, would have to state whether arbitration \nis binding or optional, identify a source that the parties may contact \nfor more information, and state that a consumer could opt out to small \nclaims court.\n  This will ensure, for example, that consumers who receive credit card \nnotices in the mail will not miss an arbitration clause because it is \nprinted in fine print. Further, it will give all parties means to \nobtain more information on how to resolve any disputes. Finally, the \nclause would explain that if a party's claims could otherwise be \nbrought in small claims court, he is free to do so. Small claims court, \nunlike regular trial court, provides another inexpensive and quick \nmeans of dispute resolution.\n  2. Independent selection of arbitrators. The bill will grant all \nparties the right to have potential arbitrators disclose relevant \ninformation concerning their business ties and employment. All parties \nto the arbitration will have an equal voice in selecting a neutral \narbitrator. This ensures that the large company who sold a consumer a \nproduct will not select the arbitrator itself, because the consumer \nwith a grievance will have the right to nominate potential arbitrators \ntoo. As a result, the final arbitrator selected will have to have the \nexplicit approval of both parties to the dispute. This means the \narbitrator will be a neutral party with no allegiance to either party.\n  3. Choice of law. The bill grants the non-drafting party, usually the \nconsumer or the employee, the right to have the arbitrator governed by \nthe substantive law that would apply under conflicts of laws principles \napplicable in the forum in which the non-drafting party resided at the \ntime the contract was entered into. This means that the substantive \ncontract law that would apply in a court where the consumer, employee, \nor business resides at the time of making the contract will apply in \nthe arbitration. Thus, in a dispute arising from the purchase of a \nproduct by an Alabama consumer from an Illinois company, a court would \nhave to determine whether Alabama or Illinois law applied by looking to \nthe language of the contract and to the place the contract was entered \ninto. The bill ensures that an arbitrator will use the same conflict of \nlaws principles that a court would in determining whether Alabama or \nIllinois law will govern the arbitration proceedings.\n  4. Representation. The bill grants all parties the right to be \nrepresented by counsel at their own expense. Thus, if the claim \ninvolves complicated legal issues, the consumer, employee, or small \nbusiness is free to have his lawyer represent him in the arbitration. \nSuch representation should be substantially less expensive than a trial \nin court because of the more abbreviated and expedited process of \narbitration.\n  5. Hearing. The bill grants all parties the right to a fair hearing \nin a forum that is reasonably convenient to the consumer or employee. \nThis would prevent a large company from requiring a consumer, employee, \nor small business owner to travel across the country to arbitrate his \nclaim and to expend more in travel costs than his claim may be worth.\n\n  6. Evidence. The bill grants all parties the right to conduct \ndiscovery and to present evidence. This ensures that the arbitrator \nwill have all the facts before him prior to making a decision.\n  7. Cross examination. The bill grants all parties the right to cross-\nexamine witnesses presented by the other party at the hearing. This \nallows a party to test the statements of the other party's witnesses \nand be sure that the evidence before the arbitrator is correct.\n  8. Record. The bill grants all parties the right to hire a \nstenographer or tape record the hearing to produce a record. This right \nis key to proving later that the arbitration proceeding was fair.\n  9. Timely resolution. The bill grants all parties the right to have \nan arbitration proceeding to be completed promptly so that they do not \nhave to wait for a year or more to have their claim resolved. Under the \nbill a defendant must file an answer within 30 days of the filing of \nthe complaint. The arbitrator has 90 days after the answer to hold a \nhearing. The arbitrator must render a final decision within 30 days \nafter the hearing. Extensions are available in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  10. Written decision. The bill grants all parties the right to a \nwritten decision by the arbitrator explaining the resolution of the \ncase and his reasons therefor. If the consumer or employee takes a \nclaim to arbitration, he deserves to have an explanation of why he won \nor lost.\n  11. Expenses. The bill grants all parties the right to have an \narbitrator provide for reimbursement of arbitration fees in the \ninterests of justice and the reduction, deferral, or waiver of \narbitration fees in cases of extreme hardship. It does little good to \ntake a claim to arbitration if the consumer or employee cannot even \nafford the arbitration fee. This provision ensures that the arbitrator \ncan waive or reduce the fee or make the company reimburse the consumer \nor employee for a fee if the interests of justice so require.\n  12. Small claims opt out. The bill grants all parties the right to \nopt out of arbitration into small claims court if that court has \njurisdiction over the claim and the claim does not exceed $50,000.\n  The bill also provides an effective mechanism for parties to enforce \nthese rights. At any time, if a consumer or employee believes that the \nother party violated his rights, he may ask and the arbitrator may \naward a penalty up to the amount of the claim plus attorneys fees. For \nexample, if the defendant party fails to provides discovery to a \nplaintiff party, the plaintiff can make a motion for fees. The amount \nof fee award is limited, as it is in court, to the amount of cost \nincurred by the employee in trying to obtain the information from the \ncompany. This principle is taken from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n37. After the decision, if the losing party believes that the rights \ngranted to him by the Act have been violated, he may file a petition \nwith the Federal district court. If the court finds by clear and \nconvincing evidence that his rights were violated, it may order a new \narbitrator appointed. Thus, if a consumer, employee, or small business \nhas an arbitrator that is unfair and this causes him to lose the case,\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nthe plaintiff can obtain another arbitrator.\n  This bill is an important step to creating a constructive dialog on \narbitration reform. This bill will ensure that those who can least \nafford to go to court can go to a less expensive arbitrator and be \ntreated fairly. It will ensure that every arbitration carried out under \nthe Federal Arbitration Act is completed fairly, promptly, and \neconomically. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to ensure that consumers, employees, and small business who \nagree in a contract to arbitrate their claims will be afforded due \nprocess of law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arbitration Fairness Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELECTION OF ARBITRATION.\n\n       (a) Fair Disclosure.--In order to be binding on the \n     parties, a contract containing an arbitration clause shall--\n       (1) have a printed heading in bold, capital letters \n     entitled ``arbitration clause'', which heading shall be \n     printed in letters not smaller than \\1/2\\ inch in height;\n       (2) explicitly state whether participation within the \n     arbitration program is mandatory or optional;\n       (3) identify a source that a consumer or employee can \n     contact for additional information on costs and fees and on \n     all forms and procedures necessary for effective \n     participation in the arbitration program; and\n       (4) provide notice that all parties retain the right to \n     resolve a dispute in a small claims court, if such dispute \n     falls within the jurisdiction of that court and the claim is \n     for less than or equal to $50,000 in total damages.\n       (b) Procedural Rights.--If a contract provides for the use \n     of arbitration to resolve a dispute arising out of or \n     relating to the contract, each party to the contract shall be \n     afforded the following rights, in addition to any rights \n     provided by the contract:\n       (1) Competence and neutrality of arbitrator and \n     administrative process.--\n       (A) In general.--Each party to the dispute (referred to in \n     this section as a ``party'') shall be entitled to a \n     competent, neutral arbitrator and an independent, neutral \n     administration of the dispute.\n       (B) Arbitrator.--Each party shall have an equal voice in \n     the selection of the arbitrator, who--\n       (i) shall comply with the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in \n     Commercial Disputes of the American Arbitration Association \n     and the State bar association of which the arbitrator is a \n     member;\n       (ii) shall have no personal or financial interest in the \n     results of the proceedings in which the arbitrator is \n     appointed and shall have no relation to the underlying \n     dispute or to the parties or their counsel that may create an \n     appearance of bias; and\n       (iii) prior to accepting appointment, shall disclose all \n     information that might be relevant to neutrality, including \n     service as an arbitrator or mediator in any past or pending \n     case involving any of the parties or their representatives, \n     or that may prevent a prompt hearing.\n       (C) Administration.--The arbitration shall be administered \n     by an independent, neutral alternative dispute resolution \n     organization to ensure fairness and neutrality and prevent ex \n     parte communication between parties and the arbitrator. The \n     arbitrator shall have reasonable discretion to conduct the \n     proceeding in consideration of the specific type of industry \n     involved.\n       (2) Applicable law.--In resolving a dispute, the \n     arbitrator--\n       (A) shall be governed by the same substantive law that \n     would apply under conflict of laws principles applicable in a \n     court of the forum in which the party that is not drafter of \n     the contract resided at the time the contract was entered \n     into; and\n       (B) shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be \n     available in court under law or equity.\n       (3) Representation.--Each party shall have the right to be \n     represented by an attorney, or other representative as \n     permitted by State law, at their own expense.\n       (4) Hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Each party shall be entitled to a fair \n     arbitration hearing (referred to in this section as a \n     ``hearing'') with adequate notice and an opportunity to be \n     heard.\n       (B) Electronic or telephonic means.--Subject to \n     subparagraph (C), in order to reduce cost, the arbitrator may \n     hold a hearing by electronic or telephonic means or by a \n     submission of documents.\n       (C) Face-to-face meeting.--Each party shall have the right \n     to require a face-to-face hearing, which hearing shall be \n     held at a location that is reasonably convenient for the \n     party who did not draft the contract unless in the interest \n     of fairness the arbitrator determines otherwise, in which \n     case the arbitrator shall use the process described in \n     section 1391 of title 28, United States Code, to determine \n     the venue for the hearing.\n       (5) Evidence.--With respect to any hearing--\n       (A) each party shall have the right to present evidence at \n     the hearing and, for this purpose, each party shall grant \n     access to all information reasonably relevant to the dispute \n     to the other parties, subject to any applicable privilege or \n     other limitation on discovery under applicable State law;\n       (B) consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, \n     relevant and necessary prehearing depositions shall be \n     available to each party at the direction of the arbitrator; \n     and\n       (C) the arbitrator shall--\n       (i) make reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the \n     hearing to the extent permitted by applicable State law; and\n       (ii) consider appropriate claims of privilege and \n     confidentiality in addressing evidentiary issues.\n       (6) Cross examination.--Each party shall have the right to \n     cross examine witnesses presented by the other parties at a \n     hearing.\n       (7) Record of proceeding.--Any party seeking a stenographic \n     record of a hearing shall make arrangements directly with a \n     stenographer and shall notify the other parties of these \n     arrangements not less than 3 days in advance of the hearing. \n     The requesting party or parties shall pay the costs of \n     obtaining the record. If the transcript is agreed by the \n     parties, or determined by the arbitrator to be the official \n     record of the proceeding, it shall be provided to the \n     arbitrator and made available to the other parties for \n     inspection, at a date, time, and place determined by the \n     arbitrator.\n       (8) Timely resolution.--Upon submission of a complaint by \n     the claimant, the respondent shall have 30 days to file an \n     answer. Thereafter, the arbitrator shall direct each party to \n     file documents and to provide evidence in a timely manner so \n     that the hearing may be held not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of the answer. In extraordinary circumstances, \n     including multiparty, multidistrict, or complex litigation, \n     the arbitrator may grant a limited extension of these time \n     limits to a party, or the parties may agree to an extension. \n     The arbitrator shall notify each party of its decision not \n     later than 30 days after the hearing.\n       (9) Written decision.--The arbitrator shall provide each \n     party with a written explanation of the factual and legal \n     basis for the decision. This written decision shall describe \n     the application of an identified contract term, statute, or \n     legal precedent. The decision of the arbitrator shall be \n     final and binding, subject only to the review provisions in \n     subsection (d).\n       (10) Expenses.--The arbitrator or independent arbitration \n     administration organization, as applicable, shall have the \n     authority to--\n       (A) provide for reimbursement of arbitration fees to the \n     claimant, in whole or in part, as part of the remedy in \n     accordance with applicable law or in the interests of \n     justice; and\n       (B) waive, defer, or reduce any fee or charge due from the \n     claimant in the event of extreme hardship.\n       (11) Small claims opt out.--\n       (A) In general.--Each party shall have the right to opt out \n     of binding arbitration and into the small claims court for \n     the forum, if such court has jurisdiction over the claim. For \n     purposes of this paragraph, no court with jurisdiction to \n     hear claims in excess of $50,000 shall be considered to be a \n     small claims court.\n       (B) Exception.--Where a complaint in small claims court is \n     subsequently amended to exceed the lesser of the \n     jurisdictional amount or a claim for $50,000 in total \n     damages, the small claims court exemption of this paragraph \n     shall not apply and the parties are required to arbitrate.\n       (c) Denial of Rights.--\n       (1) Denial of rights by party misconduct.--\n       (A) In general.--At any time during an arbitration \n     proceeding, any party may file a motion with the arbitrator \n     asserting that the other party has deprived the movant of 1 \n     or more rights granted by this section and seeking relief.\n       (B) Award by arbitrator.--If the arbitrator determines that \n     the movant has been deprived of a right granted by this \n     section by the other party, the arbitrator shall award the \n     movant a monetary amount, which shall not exceed the \n     reasonable expenses incurred by the movant in filing the \n     motion, including attorneys' fees, unless the arbitrator \n     finds that--\n       (i) the motion was filed without the movant's first making \n     a good faith effort to obtain discovery or the realization of \n     another right granted by this section;\n       (ii) the opposing party's nondisclosure, failure to \n     respond, response, or objection was substantially justified; \n     or\n       (iii) the circumstances otherwise make an award of expenses \n     unjust.\n       (2) Denial of rights by arbitrator.--A losing party in an \n     arbitration may file a petition in the district court of the \n     United States in the forum in which the party that did not \n     draft the contract resided at the time the contract was \n     entered into to assert that the arbitrator violated 1 or more \n     of the rights granted to the party by this section and to \n     seek relief. In order to grant the petition, the court must \n     find clear and convincing evidence that 1 or more actions or \n     omissions of the arbitrator resulted in a deprivation of a \n     right of the petitioner under\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\n     this section that was not harmless. If such a finding is \n     made, the court shall order a rehearing before a new \n     arbitrator selected in the same manner as the original \n     arbitrator as the exclusive judicial remedy provided by this \n     section.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to any \n     contract entered into after the date that is 6 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CLAIMS.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, nothing \n     in this Act may be construed to be the basis for any claim in \n     law or equity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/01/senate-section/article/S9723-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4847.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are the \n     following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\n   TITLE XXXI--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 3101.
