Also \ntransmitted is a section-by-section analysis.\n  The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) provides critical support \nfor a pivotal regional partner for U.S. efforts in the Middle East \npeace process. Jordan has taken extraordinary steps on behalf of peace \nand has served as a moderating and progressive force in the region. \nThis Agreement not only sends a strong and concrete message to \nJordanians and Jordan's neighbors about the economic benefits of peace, \nbut significantly contributes to stability throughout the region. This \nAgreement is the capstone of our economic partnership with Jordan, \nwhich has also included U.S.-Jordanian cooperation on Jordan's \naccession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), our joint Trade and \nInvestment Framework Agreement, and our Bilateral Investment Treaty. \nThis Agreement is a vote of confidence in Jordan's economic reform \nprogram, which should serve as a source of growth and opportunity for \nJordanians in the coming years.\n  The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement achieves the highest possible \ncommitments from Jordan on behalf of U.S. business on key trade issues, \nproviding significant and extensive liberalization across a wide \nspectrum of trade issues. For example, it will eliminate all tariffs on \nindustrial goods and agricultural products within 10 years. The FTA \ncovers all agriculture without exception. The Agreement will also \neliminate commercial barriers to bilateral trade in services \noriginating in the United States and Jordan. Specific liberalization \nhas been achieved in many key services sectors, including energy \ndistribution, convention, printing and publishing, courier, \naudiovisual, education, environmental, financial, health, tourism, and \ntransport services.\n\n  In the area of intellectual property rights, the U.S.-Jordan Free \nTrade\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nAgreement builds on the strong commitments Jordan made in acceding to \nthe WTO. The provisions of the FTA incorporate the most up-to-date \ninternational standards for copyright protection, as well as protection \nfor confidential test data for pharmaceuticals and agricultural \nchemicals and stepped-up commitments on enforcement. Among other \nthings, Jordan has undertaken to ratify and implement the World \nIntellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Copyright Treaty and WIPO \nPerformance and Phonograms Treaty within 2 years.\n  The FTA also includes, for the first time ever in the text of a trade \nagreement, a set of substantive provisions on electronic commerce. Both \ncountries agreed to seek to avoid imposing customs duties on electronic \ntransmissions, imposing unnecessary barriers to market access for \ndigitized products, and impeding the ability to deliver services \nthrough electronic means. These provisions also tie in with commitments \nin the services area that, taken together, aim at encouraging \ninvestment in new technologies and stimulating the innovative uses of \nnetworks to deliver products and services.\n  The FTA joins free trade and open markets with civic \nresponsibilities. In this Agreement, the United States and Jordan \naffirm the importance of not relaxing labor or environmental laws in \norder to increase trade. It is important to note that the FTA does not \nrequire either country to adopt any new laws in these areas, but rather \nincludes commitments that each country enforce its own labor and \nenvironmental laws.\n  The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement will help advance the long-term \nU.S. objective of fostering greater Middle East regional economic \nintegration in support of the establishment of a just, comprehensive, \nand lasting peace, while providing greater market access for U.S. \ngoods, services, and investment. I urge the prompt and favorable \nconsideration of this legislation.\n                                                  William J.
