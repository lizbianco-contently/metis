In such a time as this, give us the moral courage to examine \nboth our strengths and our shortcomings.

Rather than seeking first Your \nkingdom, we have often tried to add ``all these things'' unto ourselves \nthrough our own strength.

Rather, as with David, let our prayer for \nAmerica be that ``I have set the Lord always before me and because he \nis at my right hand, I shall not fall.''--Psalm 16:8.\n  We ask that as Your servants, called upon to lead this Nation, You \nwould always give these Senators ``eyes to see and ears to hear'' the \nway in which You have us to walk as a people. Aid us, O Lord, that we \nwould prosecute this current war with an eye toward establishing a \nfuture peace and that through our example other countries would be \nemboldened to value freedom, to cherish their own people, and to enact \nYour kingdom through our common lives together. In the power of Your \nname do I pray.

Mr. President, I take just a minute this morning to talk \nabout something that I think is very important. We had a debate not \nlong ago; there was a movement to have a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I can remember when I raised the first objection to \nthat during the time Senator Mitchell was majority leader, indicating \nin my amendment that if we were going to have a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, then we should not count Social \nSecurity surpluses. We were able to prevail in defeating that \nmischievous amendment which would have locked into the Constitution \nthis, in my opinion--it is my word--``phoney'' way to balance the \nbudget, using these huge Social Security surpluses for people to say we \nhad a balanced budget when we really did not.\n  For many, many years the Social Security surpluses were used to mask \nthe deficit. During the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, we \ndecided to no longer do that, that we would have an honest budget \nprocess whereby you would not count the Social Security surpluses. We \nwere able to have a balanced budget not using that method of \naccounting. In fact, we were able to pay down this huge debt that \naccumulated to some more than $5 trillion. So I have some \ndisappointment that the budget sent to us by President Bush now goes \nback to using that same method of accounting, using the Social Security \nsurpluses to mask the deficit.\n  One of the reasons for the deficit is the war. I know that. But it is \nnot the only reason. There are other reasons, and they are economic in \nnature, for why we have this unbalanced budget.\n  There will be time spent this week on examining the President's \nbudget just released today. I am very concerned, as I have mentioned, \nthat we are now witnessing a counting of the Social Security trust fund \nto hide what we are doing here. But it does not really hide it. We all \nagreed the last few years that the surpluses which we had in the Social \nSecurity trust fund would not count against the yearly deficit. It is a \nsurplus that is being run to provide for the retirement of the baby \nboomers. It\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\nwas done on purpose. In 1982 there was agreement, and it was bipartisan \nin nature. President Reagan, Tip O'Neil, and the leadership of which \nthe Presiding Officer was a part in the Senate got together and decided \nwe needed to do something about Social Security, and one of the things \nwe did by a bipartisan vote was to make sure that during the years we \ndid not need that much money--we would have a surplus, we would have \nmore money coming in than we would spend--we would use that for the \nbaby boomers, and that was the way it should have been.\n\n  The money from Social Security trust fund was not to be used for \nother programs. While it has been used in the past to mask the true \nsize of the deficit, we ended that practice in the years of President \nClinton. It is regrettable, Mr. President--and everyone should \nunderstand--that the Bush administration is now returning to the \npractice of hiding the true size of the deficit by counting Social \nSecurity as part of the inflated budget. I hope that we can all use \ncaution before heading down the road toward raiding the Social Security \ntrust fund to finance the rest of the government. If we are going to do \nso, let's do it honestly. Let's make sure we understand Social Security \nis masking the true deficit that we have every year.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S258-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JOHN AND JUDY RUTHVEN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize John and Judy \nRuthven, from my home State of Ohio, for their tireless work in \nrestoring the U.S. Grant Homestead--the home of our 18th President, \nUlysses S. Grant. This was the home Grant knew as a boy. He lived there \nfrom the time he was 1\\1/2\\ years old until he left for West Point.\n  After years of admiring the home, the Ruthven's purchased it in 1977. \nWhen they took possession of the homestead, it was on the National \nRegister. The Ruthvens would need to put in a tremendous amount of work \nbefore the homestead would become the National Historic Landmark it is \ntoday.\n  The homestead, originally built in 1823, was already over 150 years \nold when the Ruthven's took ownership. It had a leaking roof, a \ncollapsing side porch, a missing summer kitchen, a shed that was \nfalling apart, a basement that leaked, chimneys that needed repair, and \ntermites. The task to restore it was challenging, to say the least.\n  The first thing the Ruthvens did was contact an architect to consult \non the restoration. After many meetings, they began the long, arduous \nprocess of restoring the homestead.\n  While challenges were abundant, the Ruthvens were meticulous about \nevery detail and actually found great joy in the more difficult tasks. \nFor example, they meticulously searched for Grant family artifacts and \ntook painstaking measures to ensure that each new structure and piece \nof furniture matched pictures of the original home. They searched \nacross the State of Ohio looking for old wood and glass for the \nfloorboards and windows. In fact, the wood floors in the new kitchen \ncame from an old 1820's building and the wrinkled glass was from a \nbuilding being demolished in Lancaster, OH. They even used square-cut, \nhand-made nails in the process.\n  After all of the structural work was completed, the Ruthvens and a \nnetwork of friends scoured the State for furniture from the same time \nperiod. Judy was fortunate enough to locate a rocking chair at an \nauction that had been hand-made by Jesse Grant, Ulysses's father. They \nalso have acquired--on loan from the Ohio Historical Society--a couch \nand a cradle that had belonged to the Grant family.\n  In the end, the entire homestead had been scoured and cleaned, new \nplumbing and waterlines had been installed, old structures had been \nrebuilt and the homestead was decorated with period furniture. After 5 \nyears of reliving the life of the Grant family, the restoration was \nfinished and the Ulysses S. Grant Homestead was designated a National \nHistoric Landmark. Now, John and Judy Ruthven are in the process of \ndonating the homestead to the State of Ohio, so that all of America can \nlearn the history and enjoy the beauty of this home.\n  John and Judy Ruthven are generous beyond words. They are a tireless \nteam, giving so much of their own time and money and efforts to restore \nthe Ulysses S. Grant Homestead. I thank them for all of their hard work \nand for their great gift to the State of Ohio and to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S258-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NATHAN CHAPMAN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the life of \nSergeant 1st Class Nathan Chapman--a brave American who gave his life \nin Afghanistan to fight against the terrorists who threaten our way of \nlife here at home. Nathan attended high school in my home state of Ohio \nin Centerville. Nathan Chapman's unmatched work ethic and dedication to \npeople led him down a path of excellence.\n  Nathan rose rapidly through the army ranks and special units. A \nmember of the Army Rangers and--after only 8 years of service--the \nelite Green Beret forces, Nathan received 15 military commendations \nthrough his tours of duty in Panama, Haiti, and Operation Desert Storm. \nAn accomplished soldier with what his father called ``a quiet \nconfidence,'' Nathan Chapman was a credit to the American citizens he \nwas sworn to protect.\n  A communications expert, Nathan was known among his colleagues as a \nhighly capable soldier, who always was ready to volunteer for the tough \nmissions. Col. David Fridovich describes Nathan as ``a dynamic, \noutgoing, physically and mentally hard soldier. . .a stellar example of \nthe Special Forces ethos.'' I add that Nathan is also a stellar example \nof the American ethos, through his courage, intelligence, honor, and \ncharacter.\n  The people of Centerville, Ohio, have nothing but good things to say \nabout Nathan. His old wrestling coach, Rich Miller, said he knew Nathan \n``felt good about what he was doing and was a real professional.'' One \nof Nathan's Centerville friends summed it up best: ``Sgt. Chapman was \none of us. . . .''\n  As an Ohioan and an American, I thank Nathan Chapman for the ultimate \nsacrifice he has made for our country. I offer my condolences to those \nleft behind to cherish and celebrate Nathan's life--his parents, Will \nand Lynn; his wife, Renae; their two young children, Amanda and \nBrandon; and his many, many friends.\n  Amelia Earhart once said that ``courage is the price that Life exacts \nfor granting peace.'' Nathan Chapman worked for peace through his \ncourage and it cost him his life. But Nathan did not die in vain; he \ngave his life for the good of our Nation, fighting to ensure that his \nchildren's future and the future of all Americans would be free from \nterror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S258-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S258-S259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REMEMBERING CAPTAIN BRIAN RIZZOLI AND 1ST LT. WILLIAM SATTERLY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in talking about the important role that \nour service men and women play in protecting our nation, I would also \nlike to take this opportunity to mention two brave men from Ohio's \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base who died this weekend in an aircraft \naccident. I extend my deepfelt condolences to the families of Captain \nBrian Rizzoli, who had been living in Kettering, and 1st Lt. William \nSatterly, who had been living in Huber Heights. Their C-21 aircraft \ncrashed near Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. Few details have \nbeen released yet about the accident. In the meantime, though, I offer \nmy prayers and condolences to the friends and families of these two \nfine men.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, the New England Patriots \npulled off a thrilling 20-17 victory over the St. Louis Rams in Super \nBowl XXXVI. The victory is the first world championship for the \nPatriots, and it could not have come at a more poignant time for our \ncountry.\n  Since September 11, the courageous acts of countless Americans have \nset a new standard for the Nation. Indeed, a new American spirit has \nbeen forged. That sprit is characterized by sacrifice, humility, and a \nrefusal to quit in the face of adversity. At a time when our entire \ncountry is banding together and\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nfacing down indivualism, the Patriots set a wonderful example, showing \nus all what is possible when we work together, believe in each other, \nand sacrifice for the greater good.\n  That example came from the top, and it came from the start of the \nseason. Choosing to be introduced before the game as a team, not as \nindividuals, the Patriots set the tone for their victory. Coach Bill \nBelichick stressed teamwork, saying that only by working together could \nthe Patriots overcome their opponent, the best team in the NFL's \nregular season, the St. Louis Rams.\n  The coach put his faith in second year quarterback Tom Brady, the \nyoungest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl, and the eventual MVP of \nthe game. At the same time, Drew Bledsoe, team captain and the \nconsummate team player, cheered him--and the entire team--from the \nsideline.\n  But this was not a game won by a star quarterback alone, it was a \nteam effort. No one player rose above the rest--but together, they \nexcelled and defied long odds. The defense, a no-name bunch forced to \ndepend on each other, stifled the high-octane Rams offense. It was this \ndefense, led by Ty Law, Teddy Bruschi, Mike Vrabel, and rookie Richard \nSeymour, that got the Patriots ahead early in the game.\n  The second half saw a Rams comback, and a lesser team could have \nfallen under such dire circumstances. But these Patriots once again \nbanded together, for one final drive. With the game tied, momentum on \nthe side of the Rams, and overtime seemingly inevitable, the Patriots \nshowed their true spirit, using running back Kevin Faulk, receiver Troy \nBrown, and intelligent play from Brady to drive from inside their own \n20 yard line to give kicker Adam Vinatieri a chance to win the game \nwith only 7 seconds left on the clock. As his kick sailed through the \nuprights, the Patriots completed their unthinkable task: they defeated \nthe Rams, and won their world championship.\n\n  All of us in Massachusetts, and indeed all who live in New England, \nare proud of the Patriots and their extraordinary season. They finished \nthe season with 9 straight victories, a feat that could only be \naccomplished by a team using all 53 players on its roster. The Patriots \nhad to win two tough playoff games to make the Super Bowl. And even \nafter these improbable victories over the Oakland Raiders and \nPittsburgh Steelers, they were big underdogs to the Rams yesterday. \nUnfazed by these odds, the Patriots won again, defying their critics \nand naysayers.\n  Eight years ago Bob Kraft bought the Patriots, and today he will \nbring the Lombardi trophy home to fans who have been waiting for 42 \nyears. Congratulations.\n  The Rams also deserve credit, as they had a spectacular season and \nplayed a wonderful game. They are certainly an impressive team.\n  The Patriots' hard work and dedication encapsulates the new spirit in \nAmerica. I urge the Senate to approve this well-deserved resolution, \nwhich I will offer today.\n  In Boston, April 15 is Patriots' Day--a day when we celebrate the \nbrave men and women who fought for our Nation's independence. But, for \ngenerations of New England sports fans--from Bangor to Boston--\nyesterday will always be our Patriots' Day.\n  Today, the New England Patriots are the true patriots all over the \nland. Their perseverance, teamwork, and devotion represent the best of \nAmerica, and I'm proud to call them not only my home team, but also \nworld champions.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak further to the Senate and ask if \nI could extend my time for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT, pro tempore. Hearing no objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for the additional 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S259-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S259-S261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget President Bush presented today \nclearly demonstrates that we cannot meet our national security needs in \nthe wake of September 11, and afford to fully implement the enormous \ntax cuts which were enacted prior to that fateful day, unless we ignore \nour vital education, health, and human resources needs.\n  All of us agree that we must spend what is necessary to defend the \nNation against the threat of terrorism. These new demands on our \nresources, coupled with the recession, necessitate a reevaluation of \nthe entire budget picture--including the expenditure of $1.7 trillion \nto finance the tax cut. Unfortunately, when it comes to the tax cut, \nthe administration is unwilling to admit that the world has changed. If \nfuture tax cuts which disproportionately favor our wealthiest citizens \nare treated as a sacred cow, many of the programs that help our \nneediest citizens will be sacrificed. The war requires shared \nsacrifice, not placing all the burden on those families least able to \ncarry it.\n  Today, we find ourselves in a dramatically different and far less \nadvantageous position than we did one year ago. In January 2001, CBO \nprojected a $5.6 trillion surplus for fiscal years 2002-2011. One year \nlater, the projected surplus for that period is only $1.6 trillion, \nnearly all of it attributable to Social Security. According to CBO, an \non-budget surplus will not reappear until fiscal year 2010. Four \ntrillion dollars of the surplus is gone.\n  Whatever the merits of last year's tax bill at the time it was \nenacted, those circumstances clearly no longer exist. In the aftermath \nof September 11, we are facing major new demands on our national \nresources which must take priority. We cannot meet these demands and \nafford such an enormous tax cut without raiding Social Security and \nMedicare. Jeopardizing the security of millions of senior citizens to \nfinance the full tax cut is not an acceptable price to pay. We cannot \nnow afford the entire tax cut without ignoring critical national needs. \nNeglecting our children's education and the health and well-being of \nour families to finance this tax cut is not an acceptable price to pay. \nYet, that is what the administration budget would do. At this critical \nmoment, the Senate must transcend the old boundaries of the debate, and \nact in the nation's best interest.\n  Social Security is a major victim of the President's budget. His \nbudget does not merely dip into the Social Security Trust Fund for a \ncouple of years when we are experiencing a recession and fighting a \nwar. It proposes to raid Social Security every year through at least \n2010, taking a total of $1.464 trillion out of the trust fund. The \nmagnitude of the administration planned raid on Social Security is \ntruly shocking. It would dramatically weaken Social Security's long-\nterm financial stability. This reckless scheme seriously threatens the \nwell-being of every senior citizen and disabled person who will be \ndepending on the program in the years ahead.\n\n  Even with the raid on Social Security, the budget does not meet the \nnation's critical domestic spending needs. Discretionary domestic \nspending does not even keep pace with the rate of inflation. It \nreceives a real dollar cut.\n  The only fiscally responsible course of action now is to postpone \nsome future tax cuts that exclusively benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. \nThese future tax breaks are not scheduled to take effect until 2004 and \nlater. However, if they are allowed to take effect, they will cost \nhundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade. By delaying \nthem, we can save approximately $350 billion. More than one trillion \ndollars of tax cuts will still take effect as scheduled.\n  Under the plan I have proposed, no taxpayer would pay a higher tax \nrate than he or she paid last year. In fact, income tax rates for \neveryone would be lower in 2002 and in succeeding years than they were \nin 2001. The child tax credit would be increased as planned and \nmarriage penalty relief would be provided as scheduled.\n  The $350 billion in cost savings would result solely from a delay of \nfuture reductions in the tax rate paid by the wealthiest taxpayers in \nthe highest income brackets and from maintaining the estate tax on \nestates above $4 million. While a small number of the most wealthy \ntaxpayers may receive less of a tax reduction than they anticipated, \nthey will still be receiving billions of dollars in new tax breaks as a \nresult of last year's bill. Especially in a time of national crisis, it \nis certainly reasonable to ask them to contribute a fair share to keep \nour Nation strong.\n  These future tax cuts for those at the top are not part of the fight \nagainst the recession. They are not scheduled\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\nto occur until long after the economy emerges from the downturn. In \nfact, taking fiscally responsible action now will actually help the \neconomy--by leading to reductions in long-term interest rates that have \nremained stubbornly high because of the fear that unaffordable tax cuts \nwill lead to growing Federal deficits throughout the decade. Reducing \nthat threat will reduce the cost of long-term borrowing for businesses, \nand provide a stimulus for new job creation now.\n  Such a modest reduction in future tax cuts will help us to meet our \nresponsibility to the American people to improve education all along \nthe continuum from birth through college, to extend better health care \nto more people, and to ensure that workers can find the training that \nthey'll need to fully participate in the modern world economy. The \nAmerican people have not made future tax cuts their first priority, and \nCongress should not either.\n  At the very least, fairness and fiscal responsibility require that \nfuture tax cuts be reduced by the cost of the increased defense and \nhomeland security spending these perilous times require. This would \nallow our domestic priorities to receive the same funding which all of \nus agreed last year was the essential minimum.\n  We have only had the administration's budget for a few hours. \nHowever, the disturbing neglect of many of our Nation's most pressing \ndomestic needs is evident. I would like to take just a few moments to \ndescribe those to the Senate at this time.\n  First of all, let us take the area of health care. Support for our \npublic hospitals will be reduced by $27 billion.\n  The public hospitals in this country are some of the most beleaguered \nhealth institutions that we have in this Nation. They are the ones that \nrespond to the pressure when unemployment increases and millions of \nworkers lose their health insurance. Where do laid-off workers go when \nthey get sick? Where do their children go when they get sick? They go \nto the public hospitals. They are the principal institutions that treat \nthe uninsured and the neediest people in our society.\n  The idea that we will see additional reductions in terms of support \nfor these major institutions, which are primarily in the great urban \nareas of our country and operating on such a narrow edge in any event \nbecause of the extraordinary kinds of burdens they are facing, is a \nmajor mistake from a health policy point of view in terms of caring for \nour fellow citizens.\n  Reductions in the support for the training of pediatricians in our \nchildren's hospitals by some $85 billion is also a major mistake. We \nwant to make sure we are going to have the best trained pediatricians \nin the world to care for our children. I think the idea that the budget \nis going to shortchange the training for those individuals who have \nmade a commitment to making a difference, effectively equals a \nreduction in the quality of care, and is shortsighted. We are talking \nabout caring for the children of this country.\n  We see further reductions in support for medical education, which \nwill clearly reflect itself in a reduction of quality. We have many \nchallenges in our health care system, but one of the most important \nsuccesses of our health care system is the training, the \nprofessionalism, and the quality of our health professionals, who are \nthe envy of countries all over the world. Our training of health \nprofessionals is a magnificent example of the best we can provide.\n  We have other challenges in the delivery of health care services. For \nexample, the cost of health care and the fact that we don't pay for \nprescription drugs, which our elderly desperately need. But the \ntraining of well-qualified personnel is something in which all of us \ntake a sense of pride. We should not lose it. We are seeing a \nsignificant reduction in terms of support.\n  We are seeing reductions in health care professionals at a time when \nwe still have a very significant imbalance in underserved areas--both \nin rural areas and urban areas. To see a reduction in support for that \nkind of program makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n  Cutting funding in terms of the Child Care Development Block Grant \nprogram, at a time when the program is only serving about 12 percent or \n15 percent of the need in this country, fails children. Considering the \nimportance of that program for working families, and particularly for \nthe working poor, it also fails workers and families.\n  Seeing resources cut that help States move individuals from welfare \nto work, and which can also be used for childcare, training programs, \nand transportation, undermines our effort to help move people from a \nsense of dependency into independence.\n  I am disappointed in the area of education funding after we worked \nvery conscientiously with the Administration to restructure the K-12 \nprogram. We are reaching only a third of the children who would be \naffected by the thrust of the Title I provisions of the reform of \neducation programs. We are effectively going to see the same number of \nchildren covered. Because of the recession, an increasing number of \nchildren will qualify. One billion dollars of that is going to be \ncumulative. We are only reaching about a third of the children rather \nthan meeting the needs of all the children who could benefit from that \nprogram.\n\n  There is effectively an increase of $1 billion in terms of IDEA, \nwhich is the program to help local communities all across this country \noffset some of the burden they are facing in providing educational \nopportunities for special needs children. At this rate, it will take 15 \nto 17 years before we meet our responsibilities in assisting local \ncommunities and States in this area. We are failing our special needs \nchildren by failing to give that program the support it should have.\n  Finally, in the area of teacher quality, there is only level funding. \nSimilarly, for after school programs and bilingual education, there is \nno increase.\n  We spent a great deal of time in the last Congress to make sure we \nwere going to use the best of Republican ideas, Administration ideas, \nand Democratic ideas to try to bring about changes in our educational \nsystem, but we all knew it was going to take a combination of reform \nand resources. As we pointed out during the course of the debate, just \nhaving reform without the resources was not going to be consequential. \nJust having resources without the reforms was not going to be \nmeaningful. We tried to bring those two elements together. I think we \ndid a good job, but now we see in this budget no increase for many of \nthese provisions--many of which are so important in terms of \nstrengthening academic achievement and accomplishment for our young \npeople.\n  Finally, about 400,000 children drop out of school every single year. \nWe have the Youth Opportunities Act to try to reach out to those young \npeople, to try to get them back into school, and to try to get them \nemployment. One of the major reforms of the Workforce Investment Act, \nit is an effort to provide educational opportunities and job training \nto our most impoverished youth. Effectively, that program has been \nemasculated. The new Administration budget dramatically cuts funding \nfor the program, beginning it's eventual phase-out.\n  It makes absolutely no sense. We were trying to get reforms in terms \nof education, and then with the Youth Opportunities Program we were \ntrying to reach out to children who have dropped out and try to bring \nthem back into the system, either to complete their education or to \nmove them into training programs so they can be productive. That \nprogram has been undermined.\n  There are training programs for workers to get the skills necessary \nto be able to compete and produce--on-the-job training programs which \nhave really been the result of very strong bipartisan efforts to reform \nthe 128 different job training programs and 12 different agencies.\n  Republicans and Democrats worked together. We streamlined these \nprograms in a very efficient and effective way to try to help workers \ndevelop new skills in order for them to be more competitive. We now \nfind out this program is being significantly undermined.\n  If you are talking about young people, if you are talking about \nfailing to develop an effective prescription drug program for our \nseniors, if you are talking about missed opportunities in the area of \neducation and in training for young people, that is all reflected in \nthis budget.\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  The final point is that we are in danger of using up all of our \nSocial Security funds, paid by working men and women, by transferring \nthem into a tax break for the wealthiest individuals in this country. \nThe tax breaks that will go into effect in 2004 have jeopardized our \nability to meet important domestic priorities. There is going to be a \nbattle during the course of this year in terms of priorities. I look \nforward to being a part of that debate.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, one of the issues we are faced with, \nwhich will be most controversial, I suppose--and certainly very \nimportant--is that budget about which the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas been talking. Obviously, there are different views as to how one \ndeals with the budget. It is always that way.\n  There are those who think there is a never-ending demand for more \nspending and, therefore, more taxes, and that the Federal Government \nought to be involved in all of our activities in our lives. There are \nothers who believe there are essential elements the Federal Government \nshould address itself to; they change at different times, of course.\n  So it seems to me, as we take a look at this year's budget and this \nyear's spending and this year's taxes, we have to take a look at the \nsituation we are in and seek to meet the goals of our time. And those \ngoals change from time to time.\n  America faces a unique moment in our history. Our Nation is at war, \nour homeland is threatened to be attacked, and our economy is in \nrecession. If those are not factors that ought to be taken into account \nwith respect to a budget, I don't know what would be.\n  The President's budget has just come to Congress today, so we do not \nknow a great deal about the details. We will be holding hearings \nstarting tomorrow, and we will know more about it. But the outline of \nthe budget, it seems to me, meets the requirements of victory in this \nwar in which we are involved, as well as the tests of responsibility \nfor those areas in which the Federal Government, indeed, has a \nresponsibility.\n  It holds the Government accountable for results that address the \npriorities of the American people: Winning the war on terrorism, \nstrengthening the protection of our homeland, revitalizing the economy, \nand creating jobs.\n  Defense spending is increased by 12 percent. His budget nearly \ndoubles homeland security spending. So it provides for the kind of \nsafety all of us certainly have put at the top of our priorities at \nthis time. The growth for spending in programs outside of defense, \nthen, are held to 2 percent. We have been having something around 6- \nand 7-percent growth when we have not had the terrorism threat. So \ngrowth in those areas is reduced.\n  I think one of the interesting issues--and a little different than \nwhat we have just heard--is that the President's budget provides \nsignificant funding increases for health care, prescription drugs, \neducation, the environment, agriculture, and retirement security, and \nreturns to budget surpluses within 2 or 3 years if, indeed, we have the \nkind of economic return that we are talking about from the way we spend \nour dollars. The fact is we do not have the reserves that we did have; \nin relation to tax decreases it is a relatively small amount, about 14 \npercent. The remainder of the loss in revenues has been for increased \nspending in the war on terrorism and the recession.\n  So if you are talking about surpluses, the way you get to deal with \nsurpluses is to increase this economic movement forward, to increase \nthe growth in the economy. That is where the surpluses came from, \ncertainly not by increasing taxes at a time when we are in a recession.\n\n  So the priorities, of course, will be winning the war on terrorism--\nsome $38 billion, a 12-percent increase, to increase the capacity of \nour military, to improve the living conditions of our military, and so \non--and strengthening our homeland security, which, of course, whether \nit be boundary patrol or whether it be airline security or whether it \nbe bioterrorism or whether it be the emergency improvement of \nintelligence, are things that clearly must be done.\n  But, of course, if we are really to deal with this business of \nbudgets and this business of surpluses, we have to deal with the \neconomy. That is what we are going to be dealing with later this \nafternoon, tomorrow, and the next day in terms of an economic \nstimulus--to provide more push to those signs of an increased economy \nthat we have before us. Hopefully, we can do that. The best way to \nguarantee surpluses in the future is to strengthen the economy.\n  Education: This proposal builds on the successful passage of the No \nChild Left Behind Act, which the President and the Senator from \nMassachusetts had a great deal to do with and gave leadership. In \nfiscal year 2002, it dramatically increases to historic levels the \nfunding for special education with $8.5 billion, boosts funding for \nlow-income students $5 billion, funds important reading initiatives so \nthat every child can read by the third grade, and provides $10 million \nfor a new initiative to recruit librarians. So the idea that we are \nignoring education simply is not the fact.\n  Health care: It provides a refundable tax credit to subsidize up to \n90 percent of the cost of health insurance for low- and middle-income \nAmericans. It expands the number of community health centers by 1,200 \nto serve an additional 6.1 million patients. It doubles NIH medical \nresearch spending. That is this budget we are talking about. For \nprescription drugs, it provides $190 billion to strengthen Medicare \nwith Medicare prescriptions over a period of the next 10 years.\n  The environment: It provides record funding for EPA's operating \nbudget. It fully funds the land and water conservation fund. It \neliminates the park maintenance balance by 2006 if we continue to do it \nthat way.\n  Energy, of course, is one of the real issues. It provides $9.1 \nbillion for incentives.\n  At any rate, those are items in the budget. The point is that we \nreally need to look at where we are and how we are going to best manage \nadditional spending on our war on terrorism and providing for our \nsafety and freedom and trying to get the economy moving so that we will \nhave more and more revenue without increasing taxes. I cannot think of \na worse time to increase taxes by eliminating tax reductions than at a \ntime of recession.\n  So these are the issues that each of us will have to deal with as \ntime passes. I think we will be able to do this. Certainly, we have \ndone it before. I think it is very important we have a budget agreed to \nby the Congress so we have some constraints in spending so we have a \nbudget that says to the appropriators: Here is the amount that can be \nused for agriculture, and here is the amount that can be used for \nwhatever. Otherwise, of course, there is no end to the amount of \nspending.\n  There are a million things that we would like done, but we have to \ngive some thought to what is the appropriate role of the Federal \nGovernment in terms of participation in these various programs? What is \nthe State's role? What is the local government's role?\n\n  We hear--when I am home, at least--that we have too much Federal \nGovernment in our lives, but, on the other hand, we ought to have more \nmoney for these things. You have to make decisions between items to \ndecide if you like Government closer to the people, if you like the \ncalls made by the bureaucracy from Washington. These are the kinds of \nthings I believe ought to be decided. So budgets are quite more than \nthe amount of money that is going to be spent, even though, of course, \nthat is the discussion.\n  Budgets are a matter of determining priorities, a matter of taking a \nlook down the road as to where we want our country to be, what kind of \nprograms we think are best for growth, for creating jobs, so people \nwill be able to work in good jobs, and to be able to decide what the \nrole of the Federal Government is vis-a-vis the other levels of \ngovernment that are so important to us.\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\n  These are all part of the budget. Obviously, it is very difficult to \nput together a budget for a massive operation such as the Federal \nGovernment. But I do believe, as we move to what have to be \nexpenditures for the emergency that is before us, we ought to see if we \ncan have some logical control over the remainder of the spending so \nthis deficit, which hopefully will be a short-term deficit, does not \nget any larger than it has to be. These are the decisions, these are \nthe judgments we will have to make. Different people have different \nideas, but, hopefully, we will come out that way.\n  I think the President has done a super job of putting together a \nbudget. I think he has recognized our country's needs. I think he has \nalso recognized the reality that we just can't keep endlessly spending \nand continue to grow the size of Government. It seem to me, asking for \nmore accountability throughout the Federal Government is one of the \nimportant aspects of our future.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am a member of the Commerce \nCommittee and we were looking forward to the opportunity of questioning \nthe immediate past CEO of the Enron Corporation today. Unfortunately, \nhe did not appear before the committee as had been expected, and I did \nnot have the chance to pose some questions to him.\n  Specifically, I would have asked about the public institutional \ninvestors, like State pension funds, whose retirement funds around this \ncountry lost so much money because of their investments in Enron stock. \nThere are more than 20 pension funds--and in the Chair's home State of \nCalifornia there were some 4 or 5 pension funds, not only from cities \nsuch as San Francisco, but likewise one of the more major statewide \npension funds of California which was the pension fund that was second \nmost in losses as a result of having purchased Enron stock. The \nspecific amount for one California pension fund--and it was just one of \nabout five--was about $145 million.\n  Far exceeding that was the $335 million that was lost as a result of \nthe Florida public retirement system holding Enron stock and finally \nselling it for 28 cents a share.\n  One could wonder, what does this have to do with all of the rumors \nand rumors of rumors of what was going on? It has to do this: Why would \nan outside money manager named Alliance Capital Management Company, \npreviously associated with an Enron Corporation board member, purchase \nalmost 3 million shares of Enron stock after October 22, which was the \ndate that the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its \ninvestigation?\n  In addition, the company announced on October 17 a loss of $1.2 \nbillion. As a matter of fact, in a short period of time, just a little \nover 3 weeks, the stock value of Enron dropped from $32 a share to a \nmonth later at $9 a share.\n  On October 22 when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced \nthat it was going to start its investigation, the stock value started \nplummeting, and still this money manager continued to buy Enron. Money \nmanagers for the Florida pension fund are selected by the State Board \nof Administration of Florida, which is the board that runs the Florida \nretirement system. This money manager purchased almost 3 million shares \nof Enron stock for the Florida Board of Administration--starting at $32 \nand dropping all the way to $9 per share. Two weeks later when it \nbecame apparent that Enron had gone bust, the Florida retirement system \nsold its shares for 28 cents a share; thus, losing this humongous \namount of over $300 million.\n  What seems to me to be interesting, and the question that I wanted to \nask of the immediate past CEO of Enron is: Was there ever any \ndirection, was there any evidence of any direction, was there any \ninformation of direction from Enron to public pension funds throughout \nthe country, like the Florida retirement system, to purchase the stock. \nThe stock was falling and I wanted to ask if public pension funds were \nasked to purchase Enron in order to prop up the value of the shares. I \nwanted to ask if Enron thought that public pension funds could help \nstabilize the value of the stock so company loans that were supported \nby collateral of Enron shares would not be called on for repayment by \nthe company.\n  What was the motivation that would suddenly cause an institutional \ninvestor like a pension fund, known for professionalism, and \nconservative handling of investments--and when each of the three \ntrustees are sworn under a fiduciary duty to protect the assets of the \nretirement fund--why would purchases of almost 3 million shares of \nEnron stock be made within a 3-week period, when the price of the stock \nis dropping like a rock? I would hope that a public pension fund would \npurchase mostly solid investments, at very low risk, instead of very \nrisky investments.\n\n  Had I been at the Commerce Committee, that is the question I would \nhave asked. Today I have tried to communicate what I would have asked, \nand I thank the Chair for the privilege of sharing this information \nwith the Senate.\n  I take this opportunity to comment and illustrate what I wanted to \nask the former CEO of Enron by showing a chart, which dramatically \nillustrates the fact of how the Florida retirement fund purchased \nshares of Enron stock even while the stock price was dropping like a \nrock. As mentioned previously, stock prices were $32 on October 17 when \nEnron announced it had over $1 billion in losses. On October 22, 5 days \nlater, the stock is just below $25 when the Securities and Exchange \nCommission announces an investigation of Enron.\n  Lo and behold, at this point, on the day of the announcement of an \ninvestigation by the SEC, an outside money manager for the Florida \nretirement system--which I point out again, is supposed to protect the \nretirement system's assets for the future and present retirees. \nFlorida's public pension plan is fully funded and guaranteed, not by \nthe shareholders, but by the taxpayers of the State of Florida. We can \nsee from October 22 to November 16 what happened to the value of the \nstock. In the period of only a little more than 3 weeks, one of \nFlorida's outside money managers, Alliance Capital Management, \npurchased shares at $22 each, and continued purchasing until the end of \nNovember, the money manager purchased shares at $9 each. The chart \nillustrates that the stock dropped precipitously in that 3-week period \nin what is supposed to be one of the most conservative of investment \nportfolios to protect the security of the state and local workers in \nFlorida.\n  And finally the money manager sold all of the shares for Florida on \nNovember 30 at 28 cents a share, with a $335 million loss in the \nportfolio for Florida state and local workers and retirees. Other \npublic pension funds suffered losses, more than $1 billion overall; \nhowever, the biggest loss of $335 million occurred in Florida.\n  Within this short period of 3 weeks, the purchase of almost 3 million \nshares after all of this information about the difficulties of the \ncompany had been made public, the question is: Why?\n  If any evidence is ever found that in fact there was some direction \nfor outside money managers like this one for Florida--who, by the way, \nthis outside money manager included a principal executive back last \nsummer who still sits on the Enron board--what was the motivation here? \nDid they think this was a good stock buy, as they have said? Or was \nthere a motivation that somebody was whispering in their ear, telling \nthem to buy as the stock was getting into trouble? We need further \nexploration and a through review of Enron's relationships with \ninstitutional investors.\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n  It is a dramatic story, that additional shares were purchased as \ndisturbing information starts to come out about the company: 302,000 \nshares purchased on October 22; 125,000 shares purchased on October 25; \n374,000 shares purchased on October 29; 318,000 shares purchased on \nOctober 30.\n  On November 8, Enron admits it has overstated profits by $568 \nmillion. On November 13, lo and behold, the Florida pension fund buys \nanother 582,000 shares, just 5 days after Enron admitted publicly that \nit had overstated its profits by $568 million.\n  Then, on November 14, the Florida pension fund buys another 479,000 \nshares. How did this happen? On November 16, the Florida pension fund \nbuys another 210,000 shares. And, sadly, on November 30 the Florida \npension fund sells 7.5 million shares at 28 cents a share, thus \nincurring the $355 million loss.\n\n  I know a little bit about this because in my previous life as the \nelected State Treasurer of Florida, I sat on that pension board. The \nthree-member board of trustees called the State Board of \nAdministration, includes the Governor, the Treasurer, and the \nComptroller. The board typically does not involve themselves in the \nday-to-day activities of the buying and selling. Far from it, in the \npast, the board--when I was there, we would not touch that with a 10-\nfoot pole. That was left to the professional money managers.\n  But policy was set by the board. One of the most interesting times on \nthe board that I had was as the swing vote to determine whether or not \nthe Florida retirement system would sell--get rid of--its portfolio of \ntobacco stocks. Clearly, I knew what I wanted to do because I thought \nthat it made good social policy to get rid of tobacco stocks. But I had \na higher duty as a trustee of the State Board of Administration. I had \na duty, a fiduciary duty to the retirees and future retirees, to the \neconomic sanctity of the retirement fund. The threshold was very high \non what we should and should not do in setting policy. So, too, what \nthe professional, full-time managers should and should not do with \nregard to the purchase and sale of assets, including stock: a fiduciary \nduty for only the best, the most safe, and the least risky kind of \ninvestments. Why? Because we were trustees for all of the state \nretirees and future retirees of Florida.\n  As a former Florida State Treasurer, I want to express my concern \nopenly in the Senate. Clearly when I see activity such as this, where \nalmost 3 million shares are purchased within a 3-week period while the \nvalue of the stock is dropping. After the last purchase on November 16, \nonly 2 weeks later the entire portfolio of 7.5 million shares are sold \nfor only 28 cents a share. Why did this happen?\n  Had the former CEO of Enron appeared in front of the Commerce \nCommittee today I would have asked him that question. I would have \nasked him if he had no direct knowledge, then who would? Who would have \nmade those choices, and why one of his board members, Mr. Frank Savage, \nwho used to be one of the managers of Alliance Capital Management--why, \neven though at the time of this purchase in October and November he was \nnot one of the managers--why would such purchases of a risky investment \nthat turned out to be so costly, why would that investment have been \nmade? Had I had the opportunity today in the Commerce Committee, that \nis what I would have asked. Rhetorically, to the Senate, I ask some of \nthese questions. And as we get into the investigation of this Enron \ndebacle, these questions must be answered.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the Senate. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida for his comments. The largest retirement pension system in \nthe United States is in the State of California.\n  Those systems have had very significant losses. I think his comments \nare very well designed and should be taken as a major indicator of \nfault and problems.

Madam President, prior to September 11, the travel and \ntourism industry employed more than 18 million people, with an annual \npayroll of about $160 billion. The industry was the first, second, or \nthird largest employer--I should say the most, not the largest \nemployer, but the first, second, or third most important----\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Industry.\n  Mr. REID. Industry in some 30 States. I appreciate the Senator from \nFlorida coming up with that word. It is the No. 1, 2, or 3 driving \neconomic force in those States. It is estimated that travel and tourism \ngenerated $93 billion in tax revenue during 2000 for Federal, State, \nand local governments. When our Governors and other State officials \nfind themselves strapped for cash to pay for such basic services as \neducation, $93 billion, and the figure has in the past been going up \nevery year in tax revenues, it takes on increased significance.\n  During the past decade, travel and tourism has emerged as the \nNation's second largest service export, generating an annual trade \nsurplus of about $14 billion. This, of course, is no surprise to the \npeople of the State of California, the State of Florida, and certainly \nthe State of Nevada. Those Senators who are present now recognize the \nimportance of the travel and tourism business.\n  In the year 2000, 36 million people came to Las Vegas through the \nairport. It may be surprising, but McCarran Field is busier than L.A. \nInternational Airport. It has more people come and go through it than \nL.A. International. It is the sixth busiest airport in North America, \nand last year some 36 million people came to Las Vegas through the \nairport. This contributed about $32 billion to our local economy, \nsustaining approximately 200,000 hospitality- and tourism-related jobs.\n  Since September 11, these impressive numbers have declined \nsignificantly. According to the Hotel and Restaurant Employees \nInternational Union, 41 percent of the hotel and restaurant employees \nin Washington, DC, have been laid off. In Las Vegas, the fastest \ngrowing metropolitan community in America, 30 percent of hotel and \nrestaurant employees have lost their jobs.\n  There are similar cuts all over America: Phoenix, Orlando, San \nFrancisco. Around the country, more than 450,000 jobs directly related \nto tourism have been lost, and the forecast for the industry from this \npoint is not much better.\n  The Travel Industry of America estimates travel by Americans will \ndecrease by about 8\\1/2\\ percent this winter as compared to the months \nof December, January, and February a year ago, with a decline of 3\\1/2\\ \npercent for the entire year 2001 when compared to travel during the \nyear 2000. The Travel Industry of America estimates this will result in \nnearly $43 billion in lost travel expenditures in 1 year.\n  Because travel and tourism is so important to Nevada and so many \nother States, I believe that any economic security package must include \nincentives and other stimulative proposals to get people traveling \nagain. That is why I have joined with Senator Kyl, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, Senator Hatch, and Senator Miller to move this legislation.\n  I personally believe there are other things we could do to help \ntravel and tourism. I am one of the original cosponsors of and I am \nsupporting legislation Senator Dorgan has offered. I am supportive also \nof legislation Senator Boxer has offered. But to have bipartisan \nsupport we have this measure now before the Senate, and I think we \nshould move forward.\n  There are three key components in this legislation. First of all, a \n$600 tax credit per individual and a $1,200 tax credit per couple, at a \nmaximum of $200 per trip, for the 60 days after date of enactment of \nthis amendment.\n\n  What this would mean is if someone is traveling to Miami for a \nconvention, they would get a $200 tax credit. This would stimulate more \ntravel. After the first trip, they would be eligible for a $200 tax \ncredit; after two trips, $400; after three trips, $600.\n  This proposal provides a genuine incentive to the leisure traveler to \nencourage Americans to get back on airplanes, rent a car, to stay a few \nnights in their favorite hotel, enjoy a few meals at their favorite \nrestaurant. Moreover, by capping each trip to $200, our amendment \nprovides an additional incentive for travelers to make multiple trips. \nThe tax credits would be temporary and provide immediate results.\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\n  People need to feel good about traveling. I personally feel safer \ntoday flying in an airplane than I ever have. It is somewhat \ninconvenient at the airports. We were at an airport yesterday and I saw \nsomeone take off her shoes. My wife said: That has happened to me.\n  It does not take long to take one's shoes off, and they do not do it \nto everybody. It is a random search. I think it is good they are doing \nthat.\n  In short, I think we are really getting it down better at airports. I \nthink we are moving people through more quickly. I was in one of our \nNational Laboratories on Friday at Sandia, and they have a booth that \nyou can walk in and in 5 seconds they can determine if you have been in \ncontact with any type of explosives for many days in the past. The \nwhole walk-through takes 12 seconds, actually takes 5 seconds to do the \ncheck to find out if there are any explosives.\n  We are going to start putting some of these techniques in place at \nvarious places around the country, and someday we will have them \neveryplace.\n  We have a machine for sniffing explosives. It is like a little scoop. \nWhat they have now looks like a shovel.\n  We are getting things down very well. People should feel good about \ntraveling. We want this legislation to cause people to feel better \nabout traveling.\n  The second part of this legislation would be an increase in the \ndeduction for business meals and entertainment expenses. It increases \nthe deduction from 50 to 80 percent for 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this amendment.\n  I can use, again, myself as an example. After I practiced law for a \ncouple of years, the people who ran the law firm I worked for said they \nthought I could develop some business and have an expense account. What \nthat meant to me was I could go out and try to get business for my law \nfirm. I could take people to dinner. I did not have the money to do \nthat except for this expense account. With the expense account, I did \nthat. It generated business for the hotels and the restaurants in Las \nVegas. As a result of that, people had to prepare meals for me and my \nprospective clients or clients we already had who we were trying to \nkeep happy.\n\n  People had to serve that food. The restaurant had to buy that food. \nIt generated business for everybody. That is what this legislation is \nabout. I never liked that we reduced the meals tax deduction, but it \nwas done, first from 100 percent, to 80 percent, to 50 percent. We want \nto raise it to 80 percent for 6 months. We call for a temporary \nincrease in the deduction, as I indicated. It would be temporary, but \nit would be stimulative.\n  I believe we got this going--people wanted to make it permanent \nbecause of the entertainment industry. The restaurant industry would \nthink it was helpful. Increasing the business meals deduction will have \nan enormous and positive impact on our Nation's restaurants and the \nmillions of Americans they employ.\n  As I indicated, third, restoration of the spousal deduction provides \n100-percent deduction for spouses on business trips 6 months after the \ndate of enactment. This proposal will encourage more spouses to travel. \nThey will spend additional dollars in restaurants, hotels, rental car \nagencies, and travel-related expenses.\n  This proposal encourages spouses to travel. It is not only family \nfriendly, but it also encourages the business traveler to spend \nadditional dollars to help stimulate the economy in Nevada and \nthroughout the country.\n  This has wide-ranging support. I have a letter I received recently, \ndated February 1. This is from Jonathan Tisch, chairman of the Travel \nBusiness Roundtable. Let me name a few of the participants in this \nRoundtable: Detroit Metro Convention Visitors Bureau, National \nRestaurant Association, National Hockey League, Omega Travel, United \nAirlines, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Las Vegas Visitors & Convention \nAuthority, Four Seasons Regent Hotels & Resorts, American Airlines, \nGreater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce, Six Continents Hotels, \nDiners Club International, IBM, Wyndham International, American \nExpress, American Resort Development Association--literally dozens of \norganizations are part of this Roundtable. They have signed on to what \nwe are trying to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter and the attached member list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Travel Business Roundtable,\n\n                                                 February 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the 70 members of the \n     Travel Business Roundtable, I would like to thank you and \n     Senator Kyl for your leadership in offering an amendment to \n     the economic stimulus bill to provide much-needed stimulus \n     for the travel and tourism industry. We deeply appreciate \n     your efforts over the past several years to call attention to \n     the contributions our diverse industry has brought to the \n     U.S. economy, and we are particularly grateful for your \n     tireless work in recent months to ensure that our concerns \n     are addressed in any economic stimulus package that moves \n     forward in the Congress.\n       You saw first-hand in your own state the upheaval and \n     economic crisis that hit the hotels, restaurants, casinos, \n     resorts, convention centers, rental car agencies, shopping \n     centers, amusement parks and attractions that make up our \n     industry in the days and weeks following the September 11 \n     terrorist attacks. While there are signs that the U.S. \n     economy as a whole is recovering somewhat, a forecast of the \n     TBR Index of Leading Economic Indicators shows that recovery \n     for our history will be slow over the next two years, and we \n     will still be unable to regain 2000 levels by the end of \n     2003. Naturally, one of our deepest concerns is the toll this \n     may take on our employees.\n       While we are still assessing the fourth quarter of 2001, \n     the most recent projections for the U.S. industry show losses \n     of $43 billion for the year in traveler expenditures and the \n     loss of more than 450,000 travel and tourism jobs nationwide. \n     And all the indicators show that there will be further \n     layoffs in the industry this year. A recent Milken Institute \n     study of the impact of the September 11 attacks on the 315 \n     U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) shows that areas \n     across the U.S. stand to lose more than 1 million jobs this \n     year in the travel and tourism sector. In the hotel sector \n     alone, PricewaterhouseCoopers is projecting 18,000 layoffs \n     this year--that is on top of the 257,000 hotel workers laid \n     off in the wake of September 11. In addition to those who \n     lost their jobs outright, there are countless other travel \n     and tourism employees who are working reduced hours--and \n     therefore taking home less pay--due to the slowdown in \n     business, and often their willingness to work shorter shifts \n     so that their colleagues will not lost their jobs.\n       As you are acutely aware, local governments and states are \n     feeling the slowdown in business and leisure travel as well--\n     both because their coffers are emptying from the drastic \n     reduction in tax revenues that tourists provide and because \n     they are struggling to assist displayed workers. A December \n     2001 report by the U.S. Conference of Mayors showed that \n     requests for emergency food assistance climbed an average of \n     23 percent, and requests for emergency shelter assistance \n     increased an average of 13 percent in the 27 cities surveyed. \n     They note in their report that declining tourism since \n     September 11 is one of the factors that is driving up these \n     numbers.\n       Clearly, we must differ with those who say that the urgency \n     for the passage of an economic stimulus bill has passed. \n     Congress' quick enactment of airline assistance and airport \n     security measures have gone a long way toward keeping \n     travelers flying and helping restore traveler confidence. \n     However, keeping the airlines in business alone is not \n     sufficient to stimulate travel spending. We believe that an \n     economic stimuls bill that includes tax incentives for \n     leisure and business travelers and tourism promotion \n     assistance will help provide the final boost that our \n     industry and our workers so badly need.\n       Again, we thank you, Senator Kyl and your colleagues in the \n     Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus for your diligent efforts on \n     this matter, and we are happy to provide our assistance as \n     the process moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jonathan Tisch,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Attachment.\n\n                               Membership\n\n       Dieter H.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I had the privilege of being \na cosponsor of the amendment with the Senator from Nevada. It is \ninstructive to lay out the reasons as to why so long after September 11 \nthat the Senator from Nevada and others, including myself, are offering \nsuch an amendment with regard to stimulation of the economy and \ntourism.\n  Travel and tourism encompasses 5 percent of the GDP. It generates \nmore than $578 million in revenues. Travel and tourism, as an industry, \nsupports more than 17 million jobs. It provides more than $14 million \nin trade surplus, and more than 95 percent of the businesses in travel \nand tourism are small- to medium-sized businesses. That begins to tell \nthe story of why this amendment is important to the economy.\n  Do we think we are in a recession? Yes. All economic indicators are \npointing to the fact that we are in a recession right now. What would \nthis amendment do, and why is the travel and tourism industry suffering \na recession right now?\n  Take, for example, the No. 1 tourist destination in the world which \nhappens to be Orlando, FL. Last week, National Public Radio reported \nsince September 11 unemployment in the Orlando area of central Florida \nhas doubled to a 7-year high and that it is likely to continue rising \nfor some period of time. At the same time that tourism is down, the \ncorollary central Florida convention business faces a 5- to 15-percent \ndrop in convention attendance as companies are cutting back in their \ntravel budgets.\n  If we want to do something about stimulus, this amendment helps with \na tax credit to encourage people take a leisure trips just for the next \n2 months after the enactment of the bill. That, to me, is clearly a \nstimulus-type activity for the economy.\n  If, for 6 months, the bill says we are going to encourage people to \ngo into the restaurants by being able to deduct business meals as a \nstimulus, not just at the 50-percent level but at an 80-percent level, \nthen clearly that is stimulus in the short time frame of six months.\n  With regard to the matter before the Senate, I add to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Nevada my support for this amendment to the stimulus \nbill. This is of limited duration. Part of this amendment lasts just 60 \ndays. It will give us an economic jolt as we attempt to jump-start the \neconomy and get us out of the recession and back into economic \nrecovery.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I want to repeat something that I \nstated over the weekend. It will be my intent to vote against any large \nstimulus package at this time. I do so because I believe a stimulus \npackage right now is not necessary. I believe, when compounded with the \nPresident's budget and other items, it actually works as a significant \ndetriment to us doing what we need to do, which is have a balanced \nbudget.\n  In his remarks last month before the Senate Budget Committee, Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said an interesting thing. I would like \nto quote him. He said:\n\n       There have been signs recently that some of the forces that \n     have been restraining the economy over the past year are \n     starting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm.\n\n  And it appears the economy is stabilizing without the need for a \nstimulus.\n  Among the positive signs the distinguished Mr. Greenspan cited are \nthat businesses are working off their inventories of unsold goods, \nfreeing them to increase production and hire more workers.\n  According to the latest economic reports, the moving 4-week average \nof jobless rates continues to dip while the pace of manufacturing \nactivity throughout our country surges. Unemployment appears to have \nstabilized. The manufacturing index is up. The consumer confidence \nindex is up. Orders for durable goods are up. Most importantly, we \nnotice a slight increase in gross domestic product. Although it may not \nbe much, it signals that the worst may well be over.\n  I agree with Chairman Greenspan's assessment that ``while 3 months \nago, it was clearly a desirable action'' to pass a stimulus measure, we \ndid not, and, ``fortunately, it turned out we didn't need that \nparticular [action].''\n  If you sort of put this in context, the House has passed a very large \nstimulus package. The debate is going on in this Chamber on two \nstimulus packages. They then need to go to conference, and the \ndifferences would have to be resolved. It is very clear to me that by\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nthe time the stimulus package goes into effect, it really would have \nnegligible effect.\n  Although there is still a ways to go before the economy is fully \nstabilized and is growing again, I believe we are moving in the right \ndirection.\n  I want to point out that now the President's budget has come to the \nHill with very large increases in defense, the end program, if we begin \nthem, is that we must continue them over the next 5-year period, and \nlarge increases in homeland security, some of which will be new \nexpenditures and will need continuation in this post 9-11 era. Making \nlarge cuts in many domestic programs with dollars being spent on a so-\ncalled stimulus, to me, becomes even more questionable.\n  In fact, many of the measures which have been proposed by the \nPresident and which have been under discussion in the Congress over the \npast few months are not, to my mind, well calibrated to provide a real \nstimulus impact. They add to the tax package we passed this past June. \nI voted for it because I felt at the time it was well deserved. The \neconomy was strong, the surplus was up, and it is not unreasonable to \nexpect when both of those are present that the taxpayers should be \nenabled to keep more of their money. I basically believe that is good \npublic policy.\n  However, in September we began to see an unprecedented event add to \nour problems. That unprecedented event, of course, has brought on the \nneed for homeland security and increased defense allocation. \nDownstream, this means that these two items can well crowd out also \nvitally needed domestic programs. The transportation budget has been \ncut dramatically, I understand. Transportation is a stimulus. \nTransportation puts people to work. The transportation budget provides \ngood jobs. I suspect, if that cut goes through, we will find those jobs \nwill diminish.\n\n  There are many elements of the plan the majority leader has proposed \nwhich I believe are important--not for their stimulative impact but as \nan issue of basic fairness and past practice for those of us in this \nbody.\n  The first is the 13-week extension of unemployment insurance. I would \nsupport this as, again, a matter of the practice of this body. I was \npresent in the 1990s when we extended unemployment insurance at least \ntwice that I can remember. That was during the periods of recession.\n  According to the Department of Labor, every dollar used for \nunemployment benefit results in a $2.15 increase in the gross domestic \nproduct. That is the sum total of goods and services in our country.\n  Today, over 1 million people are unemployed. In my State, that is \nover 13 percent of the country's total unemployment. Since September \n11, unemployment benefits have run out for 190,000 Californians. Since \nSeptember 11, over 900,000 Californians have started receiving \nunemployment benefits, which shows the impact of that dastardly event \non September 11.\n  It is estimated that 300,000 people in California alone would be \nhelped by this 13-week extension. Nationally, extending unemployment \ncoverage will benefit more than 600,000 people, and again continue to \nrevive the economy.\n  I think we should do it because we have done it before, because it is \nthe right thing to do, and because it is the fair thing to do.\n  There is one other part of the leader's package that I would support. \nThat is the temporary change in the Federal Medicaid Assistance \nProgram, known as FMAP. That is a formula that provides States with \nadditional funds to make sure that health care is available to those in \nneed. It is a measure supported by virtually all of our country's \nGovernors. It is supported because the recession essentially has pushed \nmore people into Medicaid. In fact, one study has found that just an \nincrease in unemployment from 4.5 to 6.5 percent, which is what \ntranspired last year, adds 800,000 adults, 260,000 disabled, and 2.1 \nmillion children to the Medicaid rolls of our 50 States.\n  I would support the 1-year increase in the Medicaid assistance, or \nFMAP, by 1.5 percent to every State, and an additional 1.5 percent to \nStates with higher than average unemployment. This is essentially the \nsame proposal that is in the majority leader's stimulus package.\n  I have submitted an amendment which would do only those two things. I \nhope, if the time is appropriate, that I will be able to offer that \namendment. I think these are two elements of the Daschle package which \nare worthy of support.\n  Madam President, I say these words because I have said them in other \nplaces, and I think I ought to say them in this Senate Chamber. It \nwould be my hope that we could pass the extension of unemployment \ninsurance and the FMAP Medicaid changes--the FMAP amounts to about $5 \nbillion--and do so as a matter of fairness.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as people who are watching know, we \nare in debate on the economic stimulus package with Members on both the \nRepublican side, as well as the Democratic side, offering amendments to \nthe underlying bill the Senate majority leader put down about a week \nago. We are going to work our way through those amendments.\n  I go back to what I call square one and remind our colleagues and the \npeople of this country there has already been a bill passed in the \nHouse of Representatives, a bill the President said he would sign, a \nbill I hope we get a chance to vote on before we finish work on the \neconomic stimulus package, a bill I hope will become the law of this \nland, one that is truly bipartisan and truly is a stimulus. I call that \nthe White House-centrist stimulus plan.\n  This bill that has passed the House of Representatives, that the \nPresident said he would sign, is something for the most part that has \nbeen worked out by Members of this body, not the other body, people who \nare Republican and Democrat, in the middle of the political spectrum of \nthe Senate. Since it is bipartisan, since the President had an \nopportunity to meet with a bipartisan group and said he would sign it, \nbefore the holidays the House of Representatives went ahead and passed \nthe bill. We did not have an opportunity to vote on it before the \nholidays because of the fact the majority leader sets the agenda for \nthe Senate, and he did not see fit to bring it up. I will explain this \nplan so people know we do have a bipartisan proposal, not only a \nbipartisan proposal that would have bipartisan support in the Senate \nbut one that has passed the House of Representatives and that would be \nsigned by the President of the United States.\n  As we think of the 800,000 people who are unemployed since the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, there would be some hope for those \npeople in this legislation. I will name just a couple before I go into \ngreater detail. One, a 13-week extension on unemployment benefits, \nbeyond the 26 weeks that States otherwise provide. Second, provision of \nhealth insurance benefits for those people who would have had health \ninsurance where they were last employed, even for people who did not \nhave health insurance before they were laid off. They would get some \nbenefit of that program, as well.\n  If we can get this passed, it will take a lot of anxiety out of the \ndaily lives of those unemployed people. A bipartisan benefit is needed \nto help dislocated workers. Another has tax provisions and investment \nprovisions that would actually stimulate the economy to create jobs.\n  The plan's unemployment insurance proposal represents an \nunprecedented commitment to American workers. It provides up to 13 \nweeks of additional unemployment benefits to eligible workers. An \nestimated 3 million unemployed workers would qualify for benefits, \naveraging $230 a week. These benefits would be 100-percent federally \nfunded, meaning the States and the businesses in the respective States \nthat support the unemployment trust fund would not have to have any tax \nincrease as a result of what we are doing in mandating an additional 13 \nweeks.\n  The plan transfers an additional $9 billion from Federal funds to \nState unemployment trust funds. This transfer\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nprovides the States with the flexibility to pay administrative costs \nand provide these additional benefits. Obviously, the intended purpose \nis to avoid raising their unemployment taxes during the current \nrecession. We know it is bad to have a policy of a tax increase during \na recession. That tends to make the recession worse.\n\n  Also, in regard to the bipartisan White House-centrist plan is the \nplan's commitment to provide health care for dislocated workers. This \nis something that has never been done at a time this country has been \nin recession. This would be quite a departure from past social policies \nof our Government for a social contract with our people. It goes \nfurther and wider than any other proposal and gets more help to more \npeople more quickly than any other proposal. When I say ``any other \nproposal,'' I mean all of these proposals are precedent-breaking for \nsocial policy of our Federal Government in helping unemployed people \nget partial payment or support for their health insurance.\n  Several proposals have been put forth before the body. This White \nHouse-centrist proposal actually gets help almost immediately to those \npeople who need it by getting a certificate at the time they apply for \nunemployment that can be used kind of like a voucher to buy health \ninsurance. It commits over $19 billion to this health insurance \nassistance. This is over six times as much money for the temporary \nhealth insurance assistance that was provided under the original \nstimulus proposals.\n  The White House-centrist plan takes a three-pronged approach to \ngetting health insurance assistance to the people in need. First, the \nplan provides a refundable, advanceable tax credit to all displaced \nworkers eligible for unemployment insurance. This goes beyond the \npresent policy, COBRA insurance, that people can pay out of their own \npocket once they are laid off, continuing, though, the insurance they \nhad where they last worked for 18 months. We are through this \nlegislation allowing the unemployed who had insurance where they \npreviously worked to continue that health insurance and to have some \nhelp for the first time in paying for it, but it will go to those who \nwere not covered by the COBRA policy, as well.\n  The value of the credit would be 6 percent of the premium. The credit \nhas no cap, so regardless of what the cost was to the employee and the \nemployer where they previously worked, they will be able to continue to \npay that full policy. Of course, this is available to individuals for a \ntotal of 12 months during their unemployment if that should happen \nanytime between the years 2002 and 2003. Individuals can stay with \ntheir employer COBRA coverage or they can choose policies in the \nindividual market that may better fit their family needs. Obviously, \nthis makes sense. If you want to lock people just into their COBRA \npolicies, it forces people to stay with those policies that could be \ntoo expensive to keep when they are unemployed, even considering \nsubsidy.\n  The White House-centrist bipartisan bill also includes a major new \ninsurance reform to protect people who have had employer-sponsored \ncoverage and go out into the private market for the first time after \nbeing laid off. It makes COBRA protections available to people who have \nhad only 12 months of employer-sponsored coverage rather than 18 months \nas under current law. By doing this, we greatly expand the group of \ndisplaced workers who cannot be turned down for coverage or excluded \nbecause of preexisting conditions. The new 12-month standard is \nespecially important for people with chronic conditions who have \ndifficulty affording coverage on their own without the Federal law \nhelping these people get coverage that perhaps they otherwise would not \nget.\n\n  The second prong of the White House-centrist bipartisan proposal is \n$4 billion for the States for enhanced national emergency grants which \ncan be used to help all workers, not just those eligible for tax \ncredits, to pay for health insurance.\n  Finally, the third prong of the proposal includes $4.3 billion for \none-time temporary State health care assistance payments to the States \nto help bolster their Medicaid Programs. We know the Medicaid Program \nis an important safety net for low-income children and families and \ndisabled individuals.\n  I detract a bit for a moment from my remarks, specifically about the \nWhite House-centrist bipartisan proposal that I hope we get a vote on, \nto speak about this $4.3 billion one-time temporary State health care \nassistance to help the Medicaid Program. We had a debate last week on \ntwo amendments that were put forth to supplement Federal Medicaid \npayments to the States because States in financial trouble are having \ndifficulty keeping their commitments under the Medicaid Program. Even \nthough the amendments offered last week were a little bit more money \nthan what we are talking in the bill that passed the House, and that \nthe President would have signed if the Senate acted on it before \nChristmas, the fact is that the States would have $4.3 billion in their \ntreasuries right now to take care of some of these needs, except for \nthe fact that we were not able to bring this bill up on the floor of \nthe Senate prior to the Christmas holidays.\n  This seems to be very important because, at the time before the \nholidays, the National Governors Association was asking for $5.1 \nbillion of temporary help to the States for their Medicaid Programs. \nObviously, $4.3 billion is not $5.1 billion. But the fact is, we could \nhave had this $4.3 billion in the State treasuries right now, rather \nthan having to debate that either in the White House-centrist \nbipartisan bill or in the amendments that were offered to the \nunderlying bill last week.\n  For instance, I met with legislators in my State of Iowa during the \ninterim between adjournment on December 21 and our reconvening on \nJanuary 23. During that period of time, they were bringing this up with \nme, speaking with me about the problems they were going to have keeping \ntheir Medicare commitments and that they really wished they had help \nfrom the Federal Government in this regard.\n  I had an opportunity to remind them that I had a telephone conference \ncall with a lot of Republican and Democrat legislative leaders, along \nwith some administration people of my Governor, Vilsack, as well as \nGovernor Vilsack himself, to discuss this very issue early last \nDecember at the time the National Governors Association was lobbying \nfor that $5.1 billion of Medicaid supplement.\n  I obviously had sympathy for our legislators, knowing that we had an \nopportunity to pass this bipartisan White House-centrist plan with the \n$4.3 billion in it that would have been in the treasuries of the States \nat that particular time. I reminded them that maybe Governors, instead \nof working with those of us in Congress who were sympathetic to their \ncause, probably should have spent their time talking to the \nSenate majority leader about bringing that bill up before Christmas so \nthis $4.3 billion could have already been in the State treasuries.\n\n  With that parenthetical on a very small issue of this White House-\ncentrist bipartisan plan--that could have passed the Senate because it \nhad bipartisan support, if we would have been able to bring it up last \nChristmas--I now move to discuss the individual income-tax reductions \nin this White House-centrist plan.\n  This is really the stimulus part of this bill. The other part \nobviously addressed the need to help dislocated workers, people who are \nanxious because they are laid off. There are about 800,000 people who \nwould probably not otherwise have been unemployed except for the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon.\n  This White House-centrist plan would accelerate the reduction of the \n27-percent income-tax rate to 25 percent. Otherwise, this 25-percent \nrate is not scheduled to go into effect until the year 2007. Remember, \nthe President signed a tax bill on June 7, last year, which was the \nlargest tax reduction passed by the Congress in 20 years. That bill, \nsigned by the President, did reduce some rates immediately. But it also \nscheduled various rate reductions in the year 2004 and 2006, both for \nall the rates except for the 10-percent rate and also the 15-percent \nrate, which were already low and had the benefit of other tax \nreductions, such as marriage penalty and child credit, and the \nrefundable tax credit as well.\n  So what we do as an economic stimulus in the White House-centrist \nplan is speed up from the year 2007 to immediately, the year 2002, that \n25-percent\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nbracket but only that bracket. We do not touch the 35-percent bracket, \nfor instance, which will not materialize until the year 2007.\n  The reduction of the 27-percent rate is going to benefit singles with \ntaxable incomes as low as $27,000, heads of households with taxable \nincome as low as $36,000, and married couples with taxable incomes as \nlow as $45,000.\n  Obviously, what we are trying to do by gearing this rate reduction to \nmake it permanent immediately, from 27 percent down to 25, is to make \nsure that people with incomes as low as $27,000, $36,000, and $45,000 \nhave an opportunity to have less money taken from their paycheck. They \nwould have that money in their pocket. They could spend it or invest \nit. Whatever they do with it, it would be a stimulus to the economy and \nprobably much more beneficial as a stimulus to the economy than any of \nthe other things we are doing, particularly including speeding up the \naccelerated depreciation for corporations and even small businesses.\n  I hope it is very clear from my concentrating on the lowest income \nthat this is applicable to, for the 25-percent bracket, that these are \nnot wealthy individuals. These are middle-class, working Americans. The \nTreasury Department has estimated that the White House-centrist plan's \nacceleration of the 27-percent rate reduction will yield $17.9 billion \nof tax relief in the year 2002 for over 36 million taxpayers, or \napproximately one-third of all income level taxpayers.\n  Also, business owners and entrepreneurs account for about 10 million \nof those benefiting from rate reduction. When you can do things to help \nsmall businesses, particularly small businesses that are not \nincorporated, you are helping the people who create jobs in America. So \nthese small business people will benefit from this rate reduction from \n27 percent down to 25 percent as well.\n  The White House-centrist plan also provides cash supplements to lower \nincome persons who did not participate in last year's tax rebate. The \namounts would be the same as the rebate that was signed by the \nPresident on June 7 last year: $300 for each individual, $600 for \nmarried filing jointly, and $500 for heads of household.\n  The advantage of the tax rebate in this instance, on the stimulus \nplan, is philosophically exactly the same as we had in mind last spring \nwhen we passed the bill signed by the President with the tax rebates in \nit. That was to get money out immediately, particularly to lower income \npeople who maybe have a tendency to spend it more than people who get \nrebates--people who have higher incomes, and stimulate the economy for \nthe benefit of the demand side of the equation because that also \ncreates jobs.\n  So we are talking about individual rate reductions for middle-income \npeople as a stimulus to the economy, we are talking about tax rebates \nfor lower income people as a stimulus to the economy, and soon I am \ngoing to be speaking about bonus depreciation for businesses to \nencourage investment in businesses, large and small, to have another \nway of stimulating the economy.\n\n  The 30-percent bonus depreciation is one way of doing it. The small \nbusiness expensing amount from $24,000 to $35,000 is the second way of \ndoing it through business investment. This will further stimulate \npurchasing by small businesses.\n  The bipartisan White House-centrist plan also expands the net \noperating loss carryback period from 3 years to 5 years. This will \nallow businesses that are experiencing losses to improve their cashflow \nby reclaiming taxes paid to prior profitable years.\n  The plan also eliminates components of the alternative minimum tax \nthat most often causes corporation taxes to increase during an economic \ndownturn. Oddly enough, under the alternative minimum tax, when a \ncorporation's income goes down, it can actually be penalized through \nhaving additional taxes applied to them through the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  I want to make very clear that this bill does not refund any \nalternative minimum tax credits that were accumulated over prior years. \nFor instance, last fall you heard about the first bill to pass the \nHouse of Representatives. That bill has been shoved to the side. It is \nnot the bill I am talking about here--the White House-centrist plan \nthat for a second time passed the House of Representatives before \nChristmas. But that first proposal in the House of Representatives \nwould have given cash refunds all at once for the alternative minimum \ntax credits.\n  You have recently been reading--and have discussed, I presume--about \nthat plan which would have given Enron hundreds of millions of dollars \nfor previous alternative minimum tax credits.\n  The White House-centrist plan, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives, as I said, as differentiated from that first bill that \npassed the House of Representatives, does not have the refund of those \naccumulated tax credits. So Enron would not benefit to the great extent \nyou have been reading about in the papers. That is not stimulative. We \ndidn't leave that out because of Enron. Enron was not an issue at the \ntime this White House-centrist plan was written. We did it because \nrefunding those tax credits is not a stimulus to the economy. We want \nthis bill to be a stimulus to the economy as well as to dislocated \nworkers through their time of anxiety and unemployment.\n  The White House-centrist package is a solid economic stimulus plan. \nIt is a compassionate plan that puts displaced workers first, and it is \na bipartisan plan that has votes of enough Republicans and Democrats to \npass. Albeit, I confess, if somebody wants to say they don't want \nanything going through the Senate that doesn't have at least 60 votes \nto stop a filibuster, this would not have 60 votes. It seems to me that \nshould not have been an issue prior to the holidays when we weren't \nallowed to bring this bill up, when you consider that the former \nSecretary of Treasury under the Clinton administration was saying we \nought to have a stimulus package. Alan Greenspan, Fed Chairman, was \nsaying we ought to have a stimulus package. The President of the United \nStates and leaders of both political parties in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate were saying we ought to have a \nstimulus package. Albeit, what kind of a stimulus package? There was \nsome disagreement over that. But at the time of adjournment just before \nthe holidays we had a bipartisan vote to get this bill to the \nPresident, and we weren't able to bring it up.\n  That was a time of anxiety. We could have put that anxiety behind for \nall of these people who are unemployed and we would not be debating \nthis issue right now.\n  We have lost, I suppose, 5 or 6 weeks since our adjournment prior to \nChristmas. Here we are debating a stimulus package. I hope we have a \nchance to reach an agreement and get this completed and hopefully avoid \na conference with the House. But if we have to go to conference with \nthe House, we will have a stimulus package.\n  Quite frankly, there are Members of this body who probably thought \nbefore Christmas that we would definitely need a stimulus package who \nnow may have some question about it, considering the fact that \nunemployment last month was stable and because of the fact that we had \na two-tenths percent growth of gross domestic product the last quarter \nof last year. Economists tell us they think the economy is turning \naround. I tend to see those as good prospects for the continued growth \nof the economy.\n  But the reason I want a stimulus package even in light of all of that \nis the fact that most recessions after an uptick--in other words, in a \nrecovery, there is growth but then there is a downtick somewhere along \nthe line. Two or three-quarters out, there is a downturn in the \neconomy, not having an official recession, which is a two-quarters \ndownturn. If we can pass a stimulus package even in light of what we \nhope is an improving economy, it seems to me that we could have an \ninsurance policy against having a downtick in the recovery as we have \nhad in most recoveries in recent decades.\n  We have an opportunity to do for the unemployed workers two things: \nOne, help them during this time of unemployment with additional \nunemployment compensation of 13 weeks, and to help with their insurance \ncosts that they might not otherwise be able to keep during their time \nof unemployment. But most importantly, because workers would rather \nhave a job than have unemployment checks, we have an opportunity \nthrough the tax rebate\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nfor low-income people, through the 25-percent bracket for middle-income \ntaxpayers, and through the accelerated depreciation for corporations \nand the expensing for small businesses, to create jobs. These workers, \nthen, would get their paychecks from their own productivity. That is \nwhat the workers of America want.\n  That is why we should have an opportunity to pass this White House-\ncentrist bipartisan bill that has passed the House of Representatives. \nIt can be brought up in the Senate at any time, and we can get it to \nthe President with the assurance that the President will sign it. That \nis what the President said he would do.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

DELAY IN MEDICAID UPL CHANGES FOR NON-STATE \n                   GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR OPERATED HOSPITALS.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n     regulations promulgated on January 12, 2001, provided for an \n     exception to the upper limits on payment under State medicaid \n     plans so to permit payment to city and county public \n     hospitals at a rate up to 150 percent of the medicare payment \n     rate.\n       (2) The Secretary justified this exception because these \n     hospitals--\n       (A) provide access to a wide range of needed care not often \n     otherwise available in underserved areas;\n       (B) deliver a significant proportion of uncompensated care; \n     and\n       (C) are critically dependent on public financing sources, \n     such as the medicaid program.\n       (3) There has been no evidence presented to Congress that \n     has changed this justification for such exception.\n       (b) Moratorium on UPL Changes.--The Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services may not implement any change in the upper \n     limits on payment under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     for services of non-State government-owned or operated \n     hospitals published after October 1, 2001, before the later \n     of--\n       (1) June 30, 2002; or\n       (2) 3 months after the submission to Congress of the plan \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Mitigation Plan.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall submit to Congress a report that contains a \n     plan for mitigating the loss of funding to non-State \n     government-owned or operated hospitals as a result of any \n     change in the upper limits on payment for such hospitals \n     published after October 1, 2001. Such report shall also \n     include such recommendations for legislative action as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I offer this amendment along with \nSenators Graham, Nelson of Florida, Miller, Corzine, Dayton, Kerry, \nMurray, Torricelli, Clinton, and Schumer. Our amendment will place a 6-\nmonth moratorium on the final rule issued last month with regard to \nMedicaid upper payment limits.\n  On January 18, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \npublished a rule that would eliminate a critical payment source for \nAmerica's public safety net hospitals.\n  One year ago, we adopted a bipartisan legislative and regulatory \ncompromise on this matter. This new rule flys in the face of that very \ncompromise we made last year.\n  We have already closed the loopholes that some States were using to \nabuse this aspect of the Medicaid Program. We accomplished this in last \nyear's Medicaid UPL rule by creating three separate aggregate upper \nlimits, one each for private, State, and non-State government-operated \nfacilities.\n  While ending abuses of the system, the rule also allowed a higher, \n150-percent payment limit, for payments to non-State-owned government \nhospitals. This policy was developed after a lengthy negotiation \nprocess to allow States to pay these public hospitals a UPL of 150 \npercent of what the Medicare Program would pay for the comparable \nservices.\n  The intent behind this policy was to help compensate the safety net \nhospitals for the added costs associated with treating the large number \nof America's most vulnerable, low-income and uninsured patients.\n  CMS has the tools and the oversight authority to make certain that \nMedicaid funds are spent appropriately. Current Medicaid UPL policy \nrequires State Medicaid Programs to submit detailed reports on how \nthese funds are to be used. Now CMS says it is curbing the payment \nceiling because of the potential abuse of the system, but no one--not \nCMS, not the General Accounting Office, and not the Office of the \nInspector General--has reported any known abuse of the current 150 \npercent UPL policy. In fact, only a few States, Arkansas and \nMississippi among them, are operating under the new rule.\n  The 150-percent limit has strong support in Congress. We stated as \nmuch in last year's Labor-HHS appropriations report, which pointed out \nthat eliminating the higher payment category compromise would be \ndisastrous for all safety net hospitals that participate in the \nMedicaid Program. Congress also directed the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to refrain from issuing that regulation.\n  CMS is issuing this change in spite of clear opposition from \nCongress, the National Governors Association, and the hospitals that \nserve our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. As many of my colleagues, \nI hold that the Senate should take a hard look at this issue before we \ngo back on the agreement we made last year.\n  The Senate Committee on Finance should have a hearing on this issue \nas soon as possible, and we should work together quickly to consider \nand enact alternative ways in which Congress can assist the public \nhospitals that serve such a large percentage of low-income and \nuninsured patients.\n  In fact, the second part of my amendment asks the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to tell Congress what measures we can take to \nmitigate the lost funding that will ensue from this new rule. Simply \nput, if we are cutting off the Medicaid UPL program, we must do more to \nensure Medicaid Programs that assist these hospitals are\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\nworking properly and that their payments are adequate. With this \namendment, Congress will formally ask HHS for assistance in this task.\n  I do not know about other people's States, but I have had a multitude \nof my smaller hospitals that are now covering even five and six \ncounties because other close-by hospitals have already closed. They are \nin dire straits, and if we put one more thing on their back, which \nwould be to take away this 150 percent, we are going to put even those \nhospitals out of business. This is something that is unbelievable in \nlight of the economic development in rural America.\n  I know Finance Committee Chairman Baucus is interested in holding \nhearings on the Medicaid UPL. In fact, he had scheduled a hearing on \nthis issue on September 13. Unfortunately, the horrible events of \nSeptember 11 prevented us from having that hearing as we turned to more \nimmediate concerns.\n  Some may argue this amendment is not germane to an economic stimulus \npackage. I wholeheartedly disagree. The public safety net hospitals in \nmy State and across this country have told me that elimination of the \nhigher payment limitation or payment limit category will be disastrous. \nThe No. 1 cause of bankruptcy in Arkansas is unpaid medical bills. In \nsome parts of my State, such as the rural delta region, the uninsured \npopulation among working adults is as high as 28 percent. What better \nway is there to stimulate the economy than helping people avoid \nbankruptcy, providing health care in an area where it may not otherwise \nbe provided?\n\n  What industry is going to locate in an area that has no health care \nprovider? They do not want that liability. Their employees do not want \nthat lack of quality of life. What better way is there to keep our \nsmall towns and rural areas healthy than to ensure that these hospitals \nstay open? In our rural communities, access to dependable medical care \nis just as important as a strong public education system. Towns without \nhospitals fail to attract a workforce for the economic growth necessary \nto keep their economy vibrant and growing.\n  Last summer, CMS approved the Arkansas Medicaid UPL Program. The \nsupplemental payments flow directly to the participating hospitals \nwhere they are used exclusively for health care and Medicaid purposes. \nThese payments have literally been the difference for some Arkansas \nhospitals between continued operation or closing their doors. We cannot \ntell these hospitals we are going back on our agreement at a time when \nthey face increased demands as a result of a slowing economy and a \nrising unemployment rate and a rising uninsured rate.\n  Madam President, we depend on our hospitals in times of personal \ncrisis. We depend on our providers. Now they are asking for our help. \nWe must not turn our backs on them.\n  I urge all colleagues to join me today in voting for this amendment, \nsupporting this amendment; to look to your States and see how \ndesperately you will be affected if this is allowed to happen. I \nencourage all colleagues to join me in this effort. Health care is \nprobably going to be, if not already, one of the foremost issues we \nwill deal with in this next year. This is only the tip of the iceberg. \nOur hope is through this amendment we can do some good in beginning to \ndeal with the problems we will be facing in this new year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I come to the Chamber to talk briefly \nabout our current circumstances legislatively and see if we might \nclarify where we are. It is important for everyone to understand how we \nreached this point.\n  Last fall, the Democratic and Republican leadership, in concert with \nthe administration, worked very closely together to come up with a \nlegislative agenda that addressed the needs in the aftermath of the \ntragedy of September 11. We worked together and passed a supplemental \nappropriations bill that dealt directly with the needs of our armed \nservices, as well as the needs of New York. We passed it virtually \nunanimously.\n  We took up legislation to deal with the use of force authority that \nthe President felt he needed. Working on that, along with appropriate \nMembers in both the House and the Senate, Republican and Democrat, \nworking collectively, we passed the use of force resolution almost \nimmediately--and unanimously.\n  We then took up the airline subsidy legislation. Again, we had to \nwork through some very difficult questions regarding what kind of \nassistance, how fast, and what the criteria would be. We passed along \nwith it a victims fund for the victims of New York and the Pentagon. \nAgain, working with that working group and those who were directly \ninvolved legislatively, we passed that nearly unanimously. We had \nsuggested in addition, of course, we try to provide benefits for \ndislocated workers. Our Republican colleagues said: No, let's save that \nfor another time. We are supportive, we just don't want to do it now.\n  So we backed away.\n  We then took up the airport security bill. Again, working \ncollectively, it came to the floor, and we passed it nearly \nunanimously. Again, many of our colleagues raised the concern about the \ndegree to which employees were still at the end of the line.\n  We helped airlines. We helped airports. We helped the Defense \nDepartment. We had done as much as we could to respond, but again our \nRepublican colleagues said: No, let's wait until the end of the line.\n  We said: OK, we will wait.\n  We did have a cloture vote, but we pulled the amendment after we \nfailed to get cloture.\n  We then took up the counterterrorism legislation. Again, we worked \ncollectively. It was beginning to be a model that seemed to work fairly \nwell as we responded to each and every one of the stated needs and the \nagenda that both parties shared with regard to responding to the \ndisaster.\n  I recall vividly in early meetings at the White House, in discussions \nwith the joint leadership, that is what we needed to do on economic \nstimulus: Let's take a model that worked. If it had worked for all of \nthose legislative items, it would work for economic stimulus as well. \nSo let's do it there as well. We could move ahead, we could negotiate, \nwe could come to the floor. If people had amendments, we could do that.\n  I recall vividly our Republican colleagues saying: No, on this one we \nhave to draw the line; we are not going to negotiate. We are going to \nuse what is called regular order. We are going to send you something \nfrom the House, and you can take it up and deal with it here in the \nSenate.\n  I felt it coming. I knew why we were going to go to ``regular \norder.'' The reason is because there was an agenda. That agenda had \nmany pieces with which they knew we would not be in agreement. They did \nnot want to negotiate those out before they could roll out that so-\ncalled agenda, and that is exactly what has happened.\n\n  The House acted. We had hoped we could get bipartisan consensus here \nin the Senate before we moved to legislation. Those were blocked. \nNegotiations broke off. We had no option other than to move forward \nwithout the benefit of a bipartisan consensus even here in the Senate.\n  I find it all the more ironic that some of us are accused of \nobstructing when it was we who clearly made the outreach effort at \nevery level, at every stage, with every group. Republicans refused to \nnegotiate for 3 weeks last fall. Time was wasting. We had no other \nchoice but to move forward with the hope that at some point our \nRepublican colleagues could join us. We now know that never happened.\n  In the negotiations after we began moving our legislation forward--\nand, by the way, we talked to the experts, Alan Greenspan, Bob Rubin, \nso many experts during that period from September through October. The \nBudget Committee on a bipartisan basis was doing about the same thing. \nI found it remarkable, and I remember commenting at the time, based \nupon the negotiations and the discussions we had, how clear it was that \nthe economists, regardless of party, had specific recommendations on \nwhich they were\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nin agreement. It was clear that the stimulus package ought to be \ntemporary. It was clear that it ought to be cost contained. It was \nclear that it had to be truly stimulative if it were going to be of any \nvalue. Those were the goals. They specified with some frequency that \nthose goals had to be in place.\n  I found it all the more disconcerting that when we finally saw the \nRepublican proposal, there was very little temporary. It was all \npermanent. There was very little immediately stimulative. A lot of it \nwas delayed many years. And while we had all agreed that maybe a $60 \nbillion to $70 billion stimulus package made the most sense, theirs was \nabout $180 billion, more than twice what was the agreed-upon amount.\n  They insisted on eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. \nThat was one of those issues they were just determined would be in any \neconomic stimulus package. They insisted on rate acceleration, even \nthough the CBO has reported that both rate acceleration and alternative \nminimum tax repeal have very little stimulative value. That is not a \nDemocratic Policy Committee review. That is not a partisan analysis. \nThat is the Congressional Budget Office. So overlooking the advice of \nthe economic experts, ignoring the evaluative report of the \nCongressional Budget Office, our Republican colleagues have insisted on \na nonstimulative, permanent tax change that is very costly.\n  We were at this for several months last year. We laid down a bill. \nThey made a point of order stopping the process from going forward. \nThey could have amended it, but they made a point of order instead and \nstopped the legislation from going forward. Yet Democrats were accused \nof obstructing.\n  In as genuine an effort as I knew how to make, over the period \nbetween the first and the second session, I thought: How are we going \nto break this impasse? We could go back and have another rehash of all \nthe old debate of November and December. We could have brought a bill \nto the floor that we knew didn't have the 60 votes. Some suggested that \nwe take up the House bill. We knew it didn't have 60 votes. That was \nnot going to break the logjam.\n  So the idea we came up with was simply to take the components--\nadmittedly, they were not word for word but they were components found \nin both bills--components dealing with extending unemployment \nbenefits--both parties profess to be supportive of that. After all, in \n1992 we extended benefits for up to 59 weeks. In 1982, we extended \nbenefits for up to 49 weeks. And in 1974, we extended benefits for up \nto 65 weeks. Today, we are talking about extending benefits for an \nadditional 13 weeks. Both parties agreed to that.\n\n  Both parties agreed to a bonus depreciation. Both parties believed it \nwas important to have a bonus depreciation. We differed in the years, \nbut that was the second component.\n  The third component was a recognition about the rebate--that some got \nit; others didn't. Why not provide a tax rebate to those who got no \nhelp the first time, last year? Both parties addressed that as \nsomething they could support.\n  And both parties acknowledged in different ways that States are going \nto be exposed to huge costs, first, with the bonus depreciation, $5 \nbillion, and, second, costs they will incur in additional Medicaid \nbenefits they are going to have to pay out as a result of people losing \ntheir jobs and incomes going down. So there was a recognition, No. 4, \nthat we would provide some assistance to those States.\n  This is the third week on this bill. One of our Republican colleagues \nsaid no bill is better than the bill Daschle laid down. Madam \nPresident, I don't know where we go. Our colleagues have chosen not to \ntry to amend the pending legislation, this proposal, but the underlying \nbill. Why? I don't know. And they are rejecting this common ground \nproposal and have suggested, now, other amendments that have nothing to \ndo with stimulus in the short term--absolutely nothing.\n  A couple of examples: Some want to make the estate tax repeal \npermanent. That takes place, not now in 2002, but in 2010. The Bush tax \ncut passed last year. Some suggest we make that permanent.\n  That is not a stimulative approach to the economic circumstances we \nare facing right now. You can argue philosophically whether they are \ngood or bad, but what that tells me is that our Republican colleagues \nare not interested in an economic stimulus bill right now. I am not \nsure why. If they were interested, we would come up with stimulative \nproposals that do not permanently amend the Tax Code.\n  The economic experts told us: Don't do anything permanent, don't do \nanything long term, don't do anything that takes place a decade from \nnow; do something that affects the economy now.\n  They also said: Try to contain the cost. But making the estate tax \nrepeal permanent costs $104 billion over 10 years. It would not take \neffect until the year 2010. Making the Bush tax cut permanent costs \n$350 billion over the first 10 years and $4 trillion over the next \n10. That wouldn't take effect until 2011.\n\n  Here you have the economic experts saying do something stimulative, \ndo something immediate, do something that doesn't exacerbate the long-\nterm fiscal picture. Yet Republican colleagues are doing just the \nopposite. They are doing something that takes effect in 2011. They are \nnot doing something temporary. They are doing something permanent. They \nare racking up debt.\n  On those two issues alone, we are talking about $350 billion in the \nfirst 10 years alone and $4 trillion in the second 10 years when the \nbaby boomers retire. That is just permanent tax cuts, and much of this \nis Social Security and Medicare money that we are talking about.\n  We only have two choices. The first choice is to pass them. The \nsecond choice is to block them. Those are the only two choices.\n  It appears the Republicans want to block them. You don't need to be \non an economic stimulus bill for 3 weeks. They all tell me it is \nimportant for us to take up the agriculture bill. I am told it is \nimportant to take up the election reform bill. We all heard the \npassionate speeches about taking up the energy bill. The longer we are \non the economic stimulus bill, the longer it will be before we can take \nup these other very important pieces of legislation.\n  I know there is plenty of opportunity for the blame game. How easy it \nis to say, well, they haven't taken up these bills, and it is their \nfault. We will take our share of the responsibility, but I don't want \nto hear that in the Senate Chamber. It isn't us holding up this bill \nfor 3 weeks.\n  I have no other choice but to file cloture today for a vote on \nWednesday on this bill. That is the only way I know to bring this to a \nclose. If the cloture motion is agreed to, we will finish the bill this \nweek. Regrettably, it will probably take most of the week. If we fail \nto get cloture, I will have no other choice but to pull the bill and to \nmove to other legislation. It will then become clear that we will not \nhave a stimulus bill in the short term. I believe it will become clear \nwho it is that doesn't want one.\n  We have done all we know how to do. In good faith, I have put a bill \ndown. In good faith, I offered it for debate. In good faith, we have \nentertained amendments on both sides. In good faith, we have had little \nschedule to accommodate Senators who have other scheduling priorities. \nWe have little time left and much to do. I am hopeful that beginning \nWednesday we will know what it is we will be able to do.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Madam President, I send the cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, pursuant to past practice, I ask \nunanimous consent that the live quorum with respect to the cloture vote \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is really above my pay grade to \nrespond to what the distinguished Senate majority leader said because \nthere are other Republicans who are likely to do that. I don't do it as \na leader, but I want to observe some things which have been said and to \nrespond to them kind of in the sense of how I see it as one Senator, \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  I happen to be the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee \nthat has jurisdiction over tax legislation, tax credits, health \ninsurance, unemployment compensation, and most issues that deal with \nthe stimulus package.\n  My involvement, particularly with Senator Baucus as chairman of the \ncommittee, and obviously the top Democrat on the committee, has been in \ntrying to arrive at some sort of bipartisan agreement on a stimulus \npackage. We are not given much credit for what we have tried to do, if \nyou compare the environment laid out by the Senate majority leader.\n  For instance, I don't think it takes into consideration the fact that \nsometimes during our negotiations Senator Baucus was under an unwritten \nrule laid down by the Senate majority leader that if two-thirds of the \nDemocrat caucus didn't agree with what he was negotiating or what he \nhad agreed to, then it could not be accepted. That probably wasn't \nmeant as a hard and fast rule, but it was surely interpreted as putting \nSenator Baucus in an impossible position to negotiate.\n  If Senator Lott, as my leader, told me to not negotiate for anything \nif you do not have two-thirds of the Republican caucus behind it, \neffectively that would end negotiations. I wouldn't want to be \nnegotiating under those circumstances. I do not know how you can arrive \nat agreement.\n  If both political parties had a rule that you couldn't negotiate \nanything unless at least two-thirds of each caucus was behind it, that \nwould be like saying you ought to have two-thirds of the Senate to pass \nany bill. We have some very conservative Members in the Republican \nParty--one-third of our group would be about 16 or 17 people--who could \nnullify anything I was negotiating because I am not as conservative as \nthey are. If they had a veto over it, nothing could be done. On the \nsame hand, there are probably 16 to 17 very liberal Members of the \nDemocrat Party. If they have a veto over some of the things we are \ntrying to get and which the center core of the Senate can agree to, \nnothing is going to be negotiated on that side either. That was the \nsituation we had sometimes during the debate last fall.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, could I ask my friend to yield for a brief \nsecond?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield without giving up the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Madam President, no one questions the fairness of the Senator from \nIowa. I was present in the LBJ Room when Senator Daschle explained to \nthe Democrat Senators the process that was taking place to try to come \nup with a consensus on the stimulus package. He said he wanted to make \nsure when negotiations take place it comes back here and by more than a \nmajority. I may be paraphrasing. The two-thirds was never mentioned. \nThat is something that just kind of developed. I was there, and I think \nthe Presiding Officer was there. But ``two-thirds'' has come up, and it \nis really not valid.\n\n  Maybe Senator Daschle could be criticized for saying he needed more \nthan a majority, I say to my friend from Iowa, in that the procedure \nwas a little unique, but Senator Daschle--I really can't speak for him, \nbut I was at the meeting--wanted to make sure that everyone understood \nthat this was an unusual process, and he would make sure, when he \nbrought it back, that he would go over it with everybody before it was \napproved.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Iowa, there was no two-thirds rule \nthat Senator Daschle set. I was at the meeting.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, whether it is a majority or whether it \nis two-thirds, if I had to go back to my Republican caucus to find out \nthat I had a certain percentage of the caucus behind me, there would be \nno point in negotiating.\n  I do not dispute what the Senator from Nevada just said, because he \nis an honest person and he would state it as he sees it, but it was \nwidely interpreted and it was printed in the press as ``two-thirds.'' \nEven some people from the other side of the aisle seemed to indicate \nthat in the press. So that is what my statements are based on.\n  The point is, a caucus appoints people to negotiate something that \ncan get through the Senate. That means 51 votes. Whatever restrictions \nwere put on--the specific percentage aside--it is an impossible \nsituation in which to negotiate. That was the environment that was \npresent during these negotiations, during this period of time that the \nSenate majority leader is trying to use as an excuse when nothing could \nget done and saying that Republicans were holding it up.\n  Another comment that was made during the debate, within the last \ncouple weeks this bill has been up, is when the Senate majority leader \nreferred to Republicans offering amendments. We had this agreement \nbetween the two sides to have an even number of amendments offered: \nRepublicans will offer amendments, Democrats will offer amendments. A \nRepublican would offer an amendment and then a Democrat would offer an \namendment. This is so we each have an equal opportunity to get our \nideas on the Senate floor for debate. That isn't something used just \nfor this bill. It is done quite often in this body, just so this body \nfunctions and functions in a fair way.\n  There may not be, at this point, as many Democrat amendments filed as \nRepublican amendments, but under the procedure in which we are \noperating there can surely be an equal number of amendments if the \nDemocrats want to have an equal number of amendments.\n  I would like to respond to the argument that Republicans are delaying \nand not cooperating. I would like to put that proposition to the test \nand look at each side and their movement.\n  We had a stimulus package, suggested by the President of the United \nStates, in early October, which was before there was a consensus even \nwithin this body that the Finance Committee or those of us who lead \nthat committee ought to be working on one.\n  The President, as a Republican--but he did not do it because he is a \nRepublican; he did it because of the anxiety that had been in the \ncountry at that time, and is still there because of the September 11 \nterrorist attack--needed to do what he could to stimulate the economy \nas well as helping people who were unemployed and who had health care \nproblems. So the President put a proposal on the table.\n  I would like to have you look at the President's proposal. President \nBush took issues off the table that maybe just Republicans would want \nmore than Democrats. For instance, he took the capital gains reduction \noff the table. At the same time he was taking issues off the table, he \npurposely put some on the table that appealed to Democrats, such as the \nextended 13 weeks of unemployment benefits and rebates for payroll \ntaxpayers.\n  What I am speaking about occurred in October when he first put his \nproposition on the table. That was not well received in the Congress, \neven among Republicans. So the President has moved a long ways to do \neven more than what he suggested.\n  But I want to say upfront, the President of the United States was \ntrying to be as bipartisan as he could by suggesting things that he \nknew Democrats would want.\n  In early December, he encouraged the centrists--they are a group of \nDemocrats and Republicans who are more in the center of the political \nspectrum--to push to get a compromise package and indicated that he \nwould work with them. They came up with something.\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\n The President met with them, both before it was finalized and after it \nwas finalized. The President said: If the Senate passes it and if the \nHouse passes it, I will sign it.\n  So I think the President of the United States--albeit he is a \nRepublican--was out in front on this issue, both from the standpoint of \nthe original proposals and from the standpoint of trying to get \nsomething that could pass the Senate that he could sign.\n  We heard from the distinguished majority leader a little earlier \nabout how Republicans objected to help for unemployed workers and \nhaving health insurance for unemployed workers coming up on the airline \nbailout bill. But we were following the consensus of people who were \nsuggesting that if we were going to have a stimulus package, that there \nshould not be anything in it that was industry specific--industry \nspecific meaning helping just unemployed people in the airline industry \nwhen you have other unemployed people who would not get help. \nConsequently, we were following the advice of people such as Chairman \nGreenspan to be very generic in our approach to helping business or to \nhelping individuals.\n  On the other hand, I do not like the accusation that somehow helping \nthe airline industry did not help the workers. If those airlines had \ngone under, instead of there being 30,000 people unemployed, there \nwould have been 330,000 people unemployed. Keeping the airlines flying \nkept workers on the job and less of them laid off.\n  We recognize that laid-off workers need help. Obviously, that is why \nthe President came out with a proposal. It was not an industry-specific \nproposal but was a generic approach to help workers--and not just from \nthe airline industry but from all industries--with the additional 13 \nweeks of unemployment benefits.\n  It was also said that Republicans refused to negotiate for 3 weeks. \nThis was that period of time when there were shackles put on Democrat \nnegotiators when we negotiated with them. That was part of it. But also \nthat does not give credit to the hours and hours that Senator Baucus \nand I spent negotiating prior to a bill ever coming up on the floor of \nthe Senate. It does not take into consideration, also, the fact that, \nat the instigation of the majority leader, the Senate Finance Committee \nmet, and contrary to how we normally do our business in a bipartisan \nway, there was a push to get a very partisan bill out of the Senate \nFinance Committee. And it did come out on a party-line vote.\n  So it seems to me that if we are going to be accusatory, we ought to \ntake into consideration that when there was an opportunity to develop a \nbill in a committee--the Senate Finance Committee, which almost always \ndoes things in a bipartisan way--there was an effort to go strictly \npartisan and the result was to go strictly partisan.\n  We have the President of the United States pushing more than anyone \nelse, and the House Republicans passed a bill in early fall. That was a \nbill not very many people liked. The House accepted that. They scaled \nthe bill back and agreed to go to conference a quasi-conference, not a \nformal conference such as we used to have.\n  The House of Representatives, in this informal setting, along with \nrepresentatives of the White House, made this deal with the Senate \ncentrists, what I call the White House-centrist bipartisan package that \nwould have a majority vote of the Senate, albeit not the 60 votes that \nare required.\n  The bottom line is that the President of the United States, in saying \nhe would sign the bill, and the House of Representatives, in passing \nit, took up the challenge and did what needed to be done. Here we are, \nonce again, in the Senate ignoring something that had a majority \nbipartisan vote in December before we went home for the holidays. Here \nwe are again. Presumably, it has the same bipartisan votes we had then.\n  Look with me at the other side of the aisle. I already mentioned the \npartisan bill in the Finance Committee. I already mentioned the \nintractable position in conference over non-COBRA eligible, meaning \nwhen you are unemployed, you only have to take the insurance from where \nyou were laid off, and if you did not have that insurance, you would \nnot be able to get any other insurance under that proposal.\n  We allow people to continue the insurance from where they worked with \n60-percent credit, but we also allow people who are unemployed who did \nnot have insurance where they last worked to get the same 60-percent \ncredit. But there was an ideological block to that on the part of \nDemocrats who were negotiating. Then we had the refusal of a vote in \nDecember on the White House-centrist agreement.\n  I think the Democratic leadership has resisted movement to the center \nrepresented by a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats who call \nthemselves the centrists. Even though I am more conservative, I have \nbought into that plan as one we ought to pass in the Senate. Many \namendments have been filed, debated, and voted on, so we have been \ntrying to move this bill along.\n  I am going to finish where I started last December. Let's have a vote \non the White House-centrist agreement. If we pass it, the President \nwill sign it. The unemployed will get their unemployment checks, \npayroll taxpayers will get rebate checks from the Federal Treasury, \nmiddle-income taxpayers will get more money in their paychecks, and the \nunemployed will get help with health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom Iowa. He is a person who has always been very deliberate and never \nhides his positions. I have no doubt if he were the one calling the \nshots and, as he said--and I am using his words--if it was in his pay \ngrade, I am confident this legislation, the economic recovery bill, \nwould have moved much further along.\n  I have to say in response to my friend from Iowa that he is really \nlooking at this matter, as he set out on the record, with a pair of \nglasses that do not magnify properly. They want to do what they want \nrather than go through the regular process and have legislation that we \ncan amend, the so-called centrist package. The problem in all this--and \nthe majority leader laid this out very well earlier this afternoon--in \nthe Senate, whether we like it or not, it takes 60 votes to pass \nlegislation. If someone opposes what you are trying to do, then you \nhave to have 60 votes to break a filibuster and, in some cases, to \novercome a point of order.\n  The fact is, the items the Senator from Iowa mentioned, about which \nhe feels so strongly, do not have 60 votes. The two leaders know that.\n  Senator Daschle, after literally months of wrangling on this, said: \nOK, all this out here we do not agree on, but there are four things on \nwhich we can agree; why don't we pass something that has those four \nmeasures in it?\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\n  That is what we have been debating since we came back into session on \nJanuary 23. It does not matter what we try to do, it is not quite right \nwith the other side. Even though these four matters in Senator \nDaschle's bill are matters everyone is saying publicly they agree on, \nthey will not allow us to move forward on this legislation.\n  They are even offering their amendments to the underlying measure so \nthat at some time they can raise a point of order again on Senator \nDaschle's measure that is before the Senate.\n  To show how sincere the majority has been on this issue, they raised \na point of order to knock down our economic stimulus package, and \nbecause it did not have 60 votes, it worked.\n  We could have, if we did not want to do an economic recovery package, \nraised a point of order on their legislation, but we chose not to do \nthat because we wanted to keep this before the Senate. We wanted to do \nsomething with the stimulus package. Had we not wanted to, we could \nhave raised a point of order on their legislation, and it would have \nfallen just like ours.\n  I understand the majority leader's frustration.\n  It does not matter what he comes up with, it is not quite good \nenough. I suggest when the political scientists, the historians, go \nover what has happened on the economic stimulus package late last year \nand this year, the record will be clear to the effect that Senator \nDaschle has been unable to move not because of anything he has done or \nnot done but simply because the minority has not wanted to move \nforward.\n  In the Senate, if there are 49 people, 45 people, 41 people who do \nnot want to move legislation, legislation cannot be moved. That is the \nproblem we have had.\n  So I hope when we vote on cloture on Wednesday, my friends on the \nminority side will join with us to bring debate to a close on this so \nwe can move forward with the legislative package that will stimulate \nthe economy.\n  It may not satisfy everything that everyone wants. For example, today \nI offered an amendment, which I think is tremendously important to this \ncountry, dealing with stimulating tourism, not in the year 2009 like \ntheir death and estate tax proposal but today and tomorrow, something \nthat would stimulate the economies all over America because it would \ngive people an economic incentive to fly. It would give people an \neconomic incentive to buy dinners, to go places, have vacations, \nactivities that would stimulate the economy.\n  I indicated earlier today almost a half million people have been laid \noff in the travel and tourism business since September 11. These are \npeople who have no jobs. A lot of these people are people who are on \nthe Welfare-to-Work Program. They were trained because they could no \nlonger be on welfare. I support the Welfare-to-Work Program. They were \ntrained to be a housekeeper, a maid, maybe a cook, an assistant to a \ncook in a restaurant. Many of these people had never worked before in \ntheir life. They had a job, but they lost those jobs and now they have \nfallen through the cracks. They did not qualify for unemployment \ninsurance, and they are really out on the street.\n  All we are trying to do is move forward on legislation to stimulate \nthis economy. We have so many more important things to do. We have to \nfinish the farm bill. We have to do something about election reform. We \nhave a bipartisan bill to do that. We also have energy legislation that \nmust go forward in the immediate future. So I hope when the vote is \ncalled on cloture on Wednesday that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will vote in favor of cloture and bring debate to a close on \nthis economic stimulus package so we can move forward with the \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2728\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2728 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 2698.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the \n                 qualified small issue bond provisions)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, one of the things we are seeking to do, of \ncourse, in an economic stimulus package is to cause some jobs to be \ncreated. The amendment which I have offered increases the expenditure \nlimitation on small issue bonds for manufacturing facilities. This is \nan amendment which\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nwould go back and readjust the limits that are in law which allow for \nissuing of bonds for manufacturing facilities. The amount of the bonds \nthat can be issued in any one particular time were set in 1977 and 1978 \nso, obviously, things have changed since that time --in fact, many \ntimes over--as the equivalent has been changed.\n  This amendment would make adjustments to industrial revenue bonds, \nthe rules and regulations for manufacturing facilities. The amendment \nwould not increase the amount of bonding capacity available to \nindividual States. In other words, it would not be an increase of \nexpenditures but, rather, would give more flexibility to those who are \nmaking grants to make them for a larger amount.\n  Actually, the industrial revenue bonding capacity available to an \nindividual State is the greater of an amount equal to $75 per State \nresident or $225 million. The formula is not affected by this \namendment. Therefore, the amount of bonding available would not be \naffected.\n\n  The maximum bond capital expenditure limitation on small issue bonds \nfor manufacturing facilities has been $10 million. This amendment moves \nit to $20 million. It does not change the amount of money available. It \nsimply makes more flexible the amount that could be offered for a \nparticular facility. It provides for an inflation adjustment. This was \nestablished in 1978. The purchasing power of $10 million today is much \nhigher, of course. This amendment provides that inflation adjuster we \ndiscussed.\n  We have had some experience with this in our State where people seek \nto develop new facilities, new manufacturing facilities, which create \nnew jobs. This allows the builder to issue bonds which are then \nguaranteed, which gives them a much lower rate, and encourages the \ndevelopment of new businesses and new bonds. It is designed primarily \nfor software biotech manufacturing and production. It is something we \nought to consider. It is not an expense but, rather, an adjustment to \nan existing program that makes it more consistent with today's change \nin the value of dollars.\n  It addresses the financial problems caused by inflation. It amends \nthe definition of manufacturing facilities to include a new economy, \nbiotech and software. It allows companies to use industrial revenue \nbonds for research and development facilities which is a critical \ncomponent.\n  I think this can be accepted by both sides. It does not affect the \ncost of this bill. It does make what is available now much more \nflexible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama is here to speak on behalf of the \njudge he worked so hard to nominate. I ask unanimous consent we \nimmediately move to the matter relating to the nomination of Judge \nCallie V. Granade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Callie V. Granade, of \nAlabama, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his courtesy. I \nwill speak about Callie--known as Ginny--Granade, who will be voted on \nshortly for the U.S. district judgeship for the southern district of \nAlabama. Ginny Granade is a nominee of the highest order. President \nBush has nominated her to be the judge in the southern district of \nAlabama. She has the temperament, integrity, legal knowledge, and \nexperience that will make her an outstanding jurist on the Federal \nbench. I know this from firsthand experience.\n  She served as assistant U.S. attorney when I was U.S. attorney for 12 \nyears. She had been originally appointed assistant U.S. attorney by my \npredecessor in the late 1970s. She served with great skill and \ndistinction. I was there when she was named one of the first senior \nlitigation counsels in the Department of Justice, a position that \nrecognized her extraordinary skill and integrity in prosecuting \nthroughout the country.\n  Later, she became the chief of the criminal section of the U.S. \nAttorney's Office under my tenure, and then she became the acting U.S. \nattorney, until recently, when the new U.S. attorney was confirmed by \nthe Senate.\n  Ginny is levelheaded, fair minded, trustworthy, and very smart. She \nhas tremendous capabilities. She graduated from the University of Texas \nSchool of Law. After graduation she served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable John Godbold for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. Judge Godbold was chief judge of the Fifth Circuit. When the \nFifth Circuit split, he became chief judge of the Eleventh Circuit. He \nwas one of the great jurists in America. This old Fifth Circuit is the \nsame circuit in which her grandfather served, one of the grand judges \nof the old Fifth Circuit. He is widely credited as being part of a \ngroup of judges on that court who wrestled with and moved the South out \nof its days of segregation into a new day of race relations. He \ncertainly is a champion of those causes.\n  As Senator Durbin recognized in the hearings, his was a contribution \nto harmony and integration in the South.\n  Her experience has been particularly valuable for her to serve on the \nbench. She served for 20 years in the U.S. Attorney's Office where she \npracticed on a regular basis, in the very same district court for which \nshe has been nominated, as well as her experience in appellate work in \nthe Eleventh Circuit where she always wrote her briefs and argued her \ncases. The cases she tried have given her extraordinary exposure to \nunderstand how a Federal district court works, and more importantly, \nhow a Federal district judge should conduct herself.\n  Since Ginny joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in 1977 as the first \nfemale assistant U.S. attorney in the southern district of Alabama, she \nhas proven her merit as an extraordinary prosecutor and leader. Her \nabilities in the courtroom have been demonstrated time and again in her \nprosecution of complex white-collar fraud cases, tax cases, public \ncorruption cases, cases of every kind--cases she not only tried but \nsupervised.\n  I remember one case very distinctly. It was the longest criminal case \nto my knowledge ever tried in the district, 11 weeks. She was the lead \nattorney. It was a very intense case, with prominent attorneys on the \ndefense side representing prominent defendants. It was well and \nintensely litigated.\n  At the end of the case, she made, without a doubt in my mind, the \nfinest closing argument I have ever heard. It was down to earth, \nsimple, not emotional, but logical. She took every allegation, every \ncontention of the Government's case and explained patiently and in \ndetail, with that incredibly bright mind of hers, why the allegations \nin the indictment were true, and obtained a conviction in that case.\n  To me, that is an unusual skill. It is an unusual ability she \npossesses. I have never in my many years of practice seen anything \nbetter.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously rated her well \nqualified, the highest rating one can receive. I thought that was a \ngreat testament to her reputation with the attorneys in the southern \ndistrict of Alabama. They know her. They know her reputation. They are \nthe ones to whom the Bar Association talks. It was a tremendous \naffirmation of the excellence of her career and the integrity she \ndisplayed year after year after year.\n  Former Senator Howard Heflin of Alabama, who also was chief justice \nof the State of Alabama, and a Democrat, is a fan of Ginny Granade and \nhas supported her and stated he knows of no opposition to her \nappointment. Her litigation skills, as well as a command of the complex \nissues, has won her respect and admiration and overwhelming support \nthroughout her area of practice.\n  I am glad we are moving on this nomination. We have a judicial crisis \nin the\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nsouthern district of Alabama where I practiced for many years. I \nreceived a letter from our chief district judge, Judge Charles Butler, \nwho underscored the need to get this position filled.\n  He is the only active judge who is serving now in that district. The \ndistrict is authorized three judges with a fourth approved by the \nJudicial Conference of the United States. One of these vacancies--the \none being filled today--will be the longest district court emergency \nvacancy in the country, one that is a crisis because we have so few \njudges and such a heavy caseload. So I really appreciate the \nwillingness of the Senate to move this nomination forward today.\n  One of the things I think is most valuable as a judicial \ncharacteristic is that a judge should have good judgment at the basic \nlevel.\n  You can tell people who have good judgment. When people have good \njudgment, people ask them for their opinion. They seek out their \njudgment. When I was U.S. attorney and I had a tough question and a \ndifficult matter to wrestle with, and I often did, I went to Ginny \nGranade's office and asked her opinion, as did every other lawyer in \nthe office. In fact, judges were even aware of that. Young lawyers also \nsought her opinion before they went to court, to ask how they should \nhandle a case or what she thought was the legal answer to this, or is \nthis evidence admissible, or is that evidence going to be excluded. \nThey would get her opinion first.\n  The story is often told that young assistant U.S. attorneys who \nappeared before Federal judges in the district, who were cornered about \nthe way the Federal judge thought about the law, would say, ``Well, \nGinny told me that is what it was.'' That was generally enough to get \nat least a respectful hearing by the judge.\n  I suggest in the filling of this vacancy with Ginny Granade as a \nFederal judge, we are going to have done a good day's work. The \ndistrict will have a person of integrity and ability, a person who has \nnever been politically engaged in any way but who always has loved the \nlaw, has been a person of absolute integrity, a person who worked \nexceedingly hard, who I know respects the position of a Federal judge, \nwho will work to master it in every conceivable way, and once that is \ndone will preside with the most wonderful temperament but in charge at \nall times. She has had the experience to do this.\n  I am excited for her. I am excited for the attorneys in the Southern \nDistrict of Alabama who will have the honor to practice before her.\n  In my view, a highly important characteristic of a judge is he or she \nis a judge you look forward to appearing before. Some judges, will give \na lawyer a headache just thinking of going into their court. Other \njudges make the practice of law a delight. Her experience and practice \nmake me confident that the lawyers and the litigants in the Southern \nDistrict of Alabama will enjoy and appreciate their opportunity to be \nin the courtroom she will control and preside over. She will represent \nthe Federal Government and the laws of the United States in an \nexemplary manner. I am delighted her nomination will be before this \nbody shortly. I am confident she will receive the same unanimous vote \nthat the ABA gave her, with their highest recommendation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the nominees' home \nState Senators for working with us on this nomination and by commending \nthe majority leader and our assistant majority leader for bringing this \nmatter to successful conclusion today.\n  Callie Granade is the second nominee being considered from Alabama in \nthe last several weeks and the second confirmed to fill an emergency \nvacancy. On November 6, the Senate confirmed Judge Karon Bowdre by a \nvote of 98 to 0 to a longstanding vacancy on the Northern District of \nAlabama District Court. Today the Senate will take final action to fill \na longstanding vacancy on the Southern District of Alabama District \nCourt.\n  This nomination was received on September 5 and reported favorably to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee just a few days before the Senate \nadjourned last December. It is being taken up in the first days of our \nreturn. These Alabama district court vacancies have persisted for years \nwhile Senators were unable to agree on acceptable nominees with the \nprevious administration. Unlike the nomination of Ken Simon, which \nlanguished for more than 6 months in 2000 without a hearing, both Karon \nBowdre and Callie Granade have been considered promptly. I congratulate \nthe nominee and her family on her confirmation today.\n  Confirmation of Ms. Granade will be the seventh confirmation filling \na vacancy designated as a judicial emergency since I became chairman \nlast summer. Unfortunately, the White House has yet to work with home-\nState Senators to send nominees for an additional 15 judicial emergency \nvacancies and 31 federal trial court vacancies.\n  With today's confirmation, the Senate has confirmed three additional \njudges since returning late last month. The Senate will have confirmed \n31 judges since the change in majority last summer.\n  Of course, I have yet to chair the Judiciary Committee for a full \nyear; it has been barely 6 months. But the confirmations we have \nachieved in those 6 months are already comparable to the year-end \ntotals for 1997, 1999 and 2000 and nearly twice as many as were \nconfirmed under a Republican majority in the Senate in 1996.\n  The 1996 session was the second year of the last Republican \nchairmanship. In that 1996 session, only 17 judges were confirmed all \nyear and none were confirmed to the Court of Appeals--none. I expect \nand intend to work hard on additional judicial nominations through this \nsession and to exceed the number of judges confirmed during the 1996 \nsession.\n  The Judiciary Committee held its first hearing of the session on our \nsecond day in session, January 24, for Judge Michael Melloy, a nominee \nto the 8th Circuit from Iowa, and district court nominees from Arizona, \nIowa, Texas, Louisiana and the District of Columbia, a total of six \njudicial nominations.\n  I have set another hearing on the nomination of Judge Charles \nPickering for the 5th Circuit for this Thursday, February 7, 2002.\n  I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a \nshort month with a week's recess.\n  I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited \na frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last \nseveral years.\n  I have already laid out a constructive program of suggestions that \nwould help in that effort and help return the confirmation process to \none that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I have included \nsuggestions for the White House, that it work with Democrats as well as \nRepublicans, that it encourage rather than forestall the use of \nbipartisan selection commissions, and that it consider carefully the \nviews of home-State Senators.\n  This past summer, by the time I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Federal court vacancies already topped 100 and were rising \nto 111. Since July, we have worked hard and the Senate has been \ndiligent in considering and confirming 31 judges, thereby beginning the \nprocess of lowering the vacancies on our federal courts. Since I became \nchairman, 26 additional vacancies have arisen. Still, we have been able \nto outpace this high level of attrition and lower the vacancies to \nunder 100.\n  During the last 6\\1/2\\ years when a Republican majority controlled \nthe process, the vacancies rose from 65 to over 100, an increase of \nalmost 60 percent.\n  By contrast, we are now working to keep these numbers moving in the \nright directions. Our majority leader, with the help of the assistant \nmajority leader, is clearing the calendar of judicial nominations and \nthe Senate has proceeded to vote on every one of them. This is one of \nthe reforms that\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nsignals a return to normalcy for the Senate, which had gotten away from \nsuch practices over the past 6 years. Since the change in majority, \njudicial nominees have not been held on the calendar for months and \nmonths or held over without action or returned to the President without \naction.\n  I have observed that to make real progress will take the cooperation \nof the White House. The most progress can be made most quickly if the \nWhite House would begin working with home-State Senators to identify \nfair-minded, nonideological, consensus nominees to fill these court \nvacancies. One of the reasons that the committee was able to work as \nquickly as it has and the Senate has been able to confirm 31 judges in \nthe last few months is because those nominations were strongly \nsupported as consensus nominees.\n  I have heard of too many situations in too many States involving too \nmany reasonable and moderate home-State Senators in which the White \nHouse has demonstrated no willingness to work with home-state Senators \nto fill judicial vacancies cooperatively. As we move forward, I urge \nthe White House to show greater inclusiveness and flexibility and to \nhelp make this a truly bipartisan enterprise. Logjams exist in a number \nof settings.\n  To make real progress, repair the damage that has been done over \nprevious years, and build bridges toward a more cooperative process, \nthere is much that the White House could do to work more cooperatively \nwith all home-State Senators, including Democratic Senators.\n  Of course, more than two-thirds of the Federal court vacancies \ncontinue to be on the district courts. The administration has been slow \nto make nominations to the vacancies on the Federal trial courts. In \nthe last 5 months of last year, the Senate confirmed a higher \npercentage of the President's trial court nominees, 22 out of 36, than \na Republican majority had confirmed in the first session of either of \nthe last two Congresses with a Democratic President.\n  Last year the President did not make nominations to almost 80 percent \nof the current trial court vacancies. As we began this session, 55 out \nof 69 vacancies were without a nominee. In late January, the White \nHouse finally sent nominations for another 24 of those trial court \nvacancies.\n  After the committee receives the indication that the nominees have \nthe support of their home-State Senators and after the committee has \nreceived ABA peer reviews, these recent nominations will then be \neligible to be included in committee hearings. Because the White House \nshifted the time at which the ABA does its evaluation of nominees to \nthe post-nomination period, these 24 nominees are unlikely to have \ncompleted files ready for evaluation until after the Easter recess. \nEven then, over two and one-half dozen of the Federal trial court \nvacancies, 31, may still be without eligible nominees.\n  We have accomplished more, and at a faster pace, than in years past. \nWe have worked harder and faster than previously on judicial \nnominations, despite the unprecedented difficulties being faced by the \nNation and the Senate.\n  I am encouraged that this confirmation today was not delayed by \nextended, unexplained, anonymous holds on the Senate Executive \nCalendar, the type of hold that characterized so much of the previous \n6\\1/2\\ years. Majority Leader Daschle has moved swiftly on judicial \nnominees reported to the calendar.\n  I thank all Senators who have helped in our efforts and assisted in \nthe hard work to review and consider the dozens of judicial nominations \nwe have reported and confirmed. I thank, in particular, the Senators \nwho serve on the Judiciary Committee. I thank them not only for their \nkind words, but for their helpful action since this summer.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving ahead to fill \njudicial vacancies with nominees who have strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \neditorial from the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 27, 2002]\n\n                          Mr. Leahy and Judges\n\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, Democratic chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, gave a speech on the Senate floor Friday \n     that, on the surface, seemed like another round of partisan \n     warfare over judges. But embedded within the rhetoric was a \n     significant step toward bringing some comity back to the \n     judicial nominations process. Mr. Leahy promised ``steadiness \n     in the hearing process'' and ``regular hearings'' on judges \n     at a pace faster than the Senate has managed in recent years. \n     He promised also that these hearings would not be weighted \n     too heavily toward relatively uncontroversial district judges \n     but would give appeals court judges a fair shake too--\n     including specifically a number of court of appeals nominees \n     whom liberals oppose.\n       One can quibble about the names the senator left off his \n     list; he did not, for example, promise a hearing for D.C. \n     Circuit nominee John Roberts. But the overall message was \n     positive. If Mr. Leahy sticks to the plans he laid out, this \n     could be a fair and productive year for judicial nominations.\n       Mr. Leahy also asked that President Bush do more to \n     accommodate the concerns of Senate Democrats in making \n     nominations. It is a message that Mr. Bush should take to \n     heart. In two courts of appeals in particular, the 6th and \n     4th circuits, Republicans blocked President Clinton's \n     nominees for years, keeping seats open that Mr. Bush is now \n     keen to fill. Democratic senators from Michigan and North \n     Carolina want a say in who gets nominated and are blocking \n     Mr. Bush's nominees. Mr. Bush has the right to name whomever \n     he wants, but the Democratic grievance is legitimate, and the \n     process would benefit greatly if these logjams could be \n     broken in a fashion acceptable to both parties. It's hard to \n     imagine that nowhere in these two states are there potential \n     judicial candidates whose records and qualifications stand \n     above politics.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Callie V. Granade, of Alabama, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama?

Mr. President, I come this evening to add to the \nunderlying legislation that we are now calling a stimulus package, or \nat least an effort on the part of Congress and this Senate to produce a \nSenate version of stimulus that we might get to the House and into \nconference, an amount that I think is a clear and important part of \nthat stimulus package.\n  As President Bush has said, Americans know economic security can \nvanish in an instant without health security. Today nearly 40 million \nAmericans lack health insurance, a crisis that can only worsen today's \nclimate of job loss and double-digit health premium increases.\n  In 1997, Congress launched a test program to see if medical savings \naccounts could provide families with health security. That program has \nsucceeded. Despite unnecessary restrictions, over one-third of the \nparticipants were previously uninsured. A medical savings account \neffort to extend coverage to the uninsured at a fraction of the cost of \ngovernment health care programs has worked in this economy. Rather than \nletting this promising reform program expire this year, my colleague \nfrom New Jersey and I have introduced an amendment to make medical \nsavings accounts permanent and widely available. That is the thrust of \nthis amendment.\n  I have some great accounts of our country's citizens who have used \nthis advantage, many of them hard-working men and women, middle or \nlower middle class Americans. Let me cite an example. These are the \nwomen. Kay Heine, Kristina Anderson Wright, and Rebecca Turner had this \nto say for the Wisconsin State Journal:\n\n       All three of us are working, middle-class mothers. Two of \n     us are single moms. We all have medical savings accounts that \n     provide health insurance for our families. Our message to \n     people in Washington in plain, unmistakable English, is \n     that MSAs work for working families.\n\n  So I hope as we consider the stimulus package, my colleagues would \nconsider\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nthis amendment, make it a part of the stimulus package to not allow \nthis very important program to expire and for these citizens to lose \nit, and, more importantly, that we should be adding citizens by giving \nthem the opportunity to have medical savings accounts as a part of \ntheir insurance portfolio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed).

Mr. President, is the amendment filed and the cloture \nmotion filed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the amendment and the cloture motion have \nbeen received.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For the sake of my colleagues, the amendment that I \nsent to the desk is the White House-centrist bipartisan bill that was \npending in the Senate--not pending but was filed after it passed the \nHouse of Representatives\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nbefore the holidays with one slight modification that represents the \nBond amendment on expensing, which was adopted. Otherwise, the \namendment is the same as what has passed the House of Representatives \nand the President said he would sign.\n  I hope we have an opportunity to get 60 votes for cloture on the \namendment and that we are able to get that amendment adopted, get the \nbill to the President for signature, and consequently, then, \nimmediately--not 3 or 4 months down the road when we have a conference \ncommittee trying to reach some agreement--get help to stimulate the \neconomy through accelerated depreciation for business, through middle-\nincome-tax reduction, making it permanent the 27-percent bracket down \nto 25-percent bracket, and tax rebates for low-income people to \nstimulate the economy on the demand side, consumer spending. All three \nare meant to create jobs and will create jobs.\n  Also, this amendment is for the displaced workers; those mostly \naffected because of what happened on September 11 will get an increase \nof unemployment compensation of 13 weeks and a 60-percent tax credit \nfor health insurance, and we do it in a way that people can have the \noption, if they do not want COBRA, to have other insurance, and also to \nhelp those who did not have any COBRA insurance where last employed.\n  It is a well-rounded stimulus package that will get the job done. The \nfact that it passed the House of Representatives and will be signed by \nthe President is reason enough for this body to adopt it, particularly \nbecause in this body nothing gets done that is not bipartisan. This has \nbipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Friday the children in my State \nof West Virginia had reason to celebrate. I am delighted to announce \nthat the Communities in Schools Program and America's Promise have \njoined to form a new partnership aimed at giving our children resources \nthat help them to stay in school and be successful in life. This \nexciting new program, launched on January 31, 2002, is called the \nAlliance for Youth.\n  Bill Milliken, Communities in Schools CEO and West Virginia Governor \nBob Wise joined together last week to signal the start of a major \ninitiative to help students. The Alliance for Youth combines the \nmissions of education and community service with the goal of making \neach more accessible to students in West Virginia. Through the \nAlliance, children can connect with concerned adults and have a safe \nplace where they can develop useful life skills, have a wholesome start \nin life, and have the opportunity to become involved in their \ncommunities. As a former VISTA worker, I personally know how public \nservice can change and improve someone's life. Providing more \nopportunities for public service will help both the communities served \nand the students involved. By helping to shape the lives of our \nchildren, the Alliance for Youth Program is making the most important \ninvestment in our future.\n  Years ago, the National Commission on Children which I chaired, \nchallenged society in general to create a moral climate for our \nchildren. The Alliance for Youth Program responds to this challenge. We \nall understand that the chances for children's success are tied to \nquality education, strong child development, and strong support from \nfamily and caring adults. It is my hope that the Alliance for Youth \nwill continue the worthy and important work of providing children with \nextra support for a successful start in life. I applaud this new \npartnership, and I look forward to seeing the results of its valuable \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S281-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 30, \n1997 in Chicago, IL. A woman and two gay men were attacked by several \nmen who were shouting anti-gay epithets. The assailants, Matthew W. \nPolley, 21, Jason C. Polley, 22, and Kenneth A. Schultz, 20 were each \ncharged with a felony hate crime in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S281-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATIONS TO SOUTH DAKOTA'S SUPER BOWL XXXVI PARTICIPANTS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Also, during Adam's early athletic years at \nCentral High School in Rapid City, I was pleased to have nominated him \nfor a service academy appointment.\n  Although Adam will be remembered for his Super Bowl winning kick, his \ntwo field goals during the playoff game against the Oakland Raiders may \nhave been even more impressive. During a snowstorm, he kicked a 45-yard \nfield goal to send the game to overtime, and then kicked the game \nwinning field goal in overtime to win the Divisional Playoff game. \nWithout his leadership and resolve, the New England Patriots would not \nhave been in a position to play in the Super Bowl, let alone win it. \nAdam reflects the best of South Dakota, and I know I speak for the \nentire State when I say congratulations on the great victory. We are \nall very proud of you.\n  Also, I would like to congratulate several other particpants from \nSuper Bowl XXXVI who have South Dakota ties, including Adam Timmerman, \na guard for the St. Louis Rams and a SDSU graduate; Matt Chatham, a \nUniversity of South Dakota standout and backup linebacker for the \nPatriots; Brad Seely, a Baltic native and Special Teams coach for the \nNew England Patriots; and Mike Martz who was born in Sioux Falls and is \nthe head coach of the Rams.\n  It is very satisfying to know that even though South Dakota has no \nprofessional or Division I sports, we were very well represented in the \nbiggest sporting event in America. Congratulations to all who played \nand participated in one of the best Super Bowls ever played.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S281-5", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S281-S282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to honor February as \nBlack History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has paused to \nrecognize the contributions of black Americans to the history of our \nNation. This is no accident, February is a significant month in black \nAmerican history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham \nLincoln, and\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\nscholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in the month of \nFebruary. The 15th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified 132 years \nago this month, giving black Americans the right to vote. The National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in \nFebruary in New York City. Last Friday, February 1, was the forty-\nsecond anniversary of the Greensboro Four's historic sit-in. And on \nFebruary 25, 1870, this body welcomed its first black Senator, Hiram R. \nRevels of Mississippi.\n  I want to take time during this important month to celebrate some of \nthe contributions made by black Americans in my home State of Oregon. \nSince Marcus Lopez, who sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, become \nthe first person of African descent to set foot in Oregon, a great many \nblack Americans have helped shape the history of my State. Throughout \nthis month, I will come to the floor to highlight some of their \nstories.\n  One important story in the history of the Pacific Northwest belongs \nto a black pioneer named George W. Bush. George Washington Bush, a \nveteran of the War of 1812, headed west on the Oregon Trail in 1844 \nhoping to leave the racism of Missouri behind him. A wealthy farmer, \nBush purchased six wagons, packed up his friends and family, including \nhis Irish wife, and settled in The Dalles. Upon arrival, Bush \ndiscovered that the racism he was trying to escape was, tragically, \nalive and well in the Oregon Territory.\n  While slavery was illegal in Oregon, my State shamefully tried to \ndrive out blacks through the enactment of exclusion laws, including a \ndisgraceful ``lash law.'' The lash law required that a black person be \nwhipped twice a year ``until [they] shall quit the territory.'' As a \nresult of this law, Bush was forced to move across the Columbia River \nto live under the more hospitable rule of the Hudson's Bay Company. \nBush thrived as a farmer and rancher in the Puget Sound area, and his \nsuccess attracted a large number of settlers to the Northwest. Because \nhis prosperity helped spur the tremendous growth of settlements north \nof the Columbia, Bush, one of the first black Oregonians, is now \ncredited by some historians for bringing the land north of the Columbia \nRiver, present-day Washington State, into the United States.\n  Bush might never have completed his journey to Oregon had it not been \nfor one of the first Oregon Trail guides, a black man named Moses \nHarris. Harris spent years trapping in the Northwest, and was one of \nthe explorers who christened Independence Rock in what is now the State \nof Wyoming. Harris was renowned for his knowledge of the region, and, \non more than one occasion, saved lost or stranded wagon parties from \ncertain death along the treacherous route to Oregon. He guided \nthousands to the Pacific Northwest, including the famous Whitman party, \nand did so until his death of cholera in 1849. Without Moses Harris, \nand people like him, Oregon, as we know it, would not exist today.\n  Moses Harris and George Bush are only two early examples of the black \nmen and women who changed the course of history in Oregon and in the \nUnited States. During the remainder of Black History Month, I will \nreturn to the floor to celebrate more Oregonians like Harris and Bush, \nwhose contributions, while great, have not received the attention they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S282-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        MAJOR STEWART H.

Mr. President, for more than twenty-eight years \nit has been my pleasure to know and work with Victor Swenson in many \nefforts to promote the humanities at the State and national levels. On \nFebruary 1, 2002, Victor retired as the Executive Director of the \nVermont Council on the Humanities, a leadership role he has effectively \nfilled since the Council's inception in 1974. Today, I rise to express \nmy gratitude for his dedication and service to all Vermonters.\n  Every State has a humanities council, but few are as innovative, \ncreative, and self-sufficient as the Vermont council on the Humanities. \nEarly on, under Victor's stewardship, the Vermont Council determined \nthat the first step in broadening Vermonters' participation in \nhumanities programming was ensuring that all Vermonters were able to \nread. This undertaking, creating a state in which every individual \nreads, participates in public affairs, and continues to learn \nthroughout life, involves an enormous commitment. It is a self-imposed \nand ambitious challenge that the Council has taken on completely. The \nCouncil has distinguished itself as a national leader in promoting \nreading.\n  Victor's work with the Council has been so successful and has enjoyed \nsuch a long tenure that it would be impossible to discuss one without a \ncomplete mention of the other. Throughout this long association, Victor \nhas held an unfading belief that the humanities can and must be used to \nimprove life in meaningful ways. Victor believes rightly that all \nVermonters benefit from any investment in the humanities, and the \nCouncil has been his vehicle for advancement. In January 1974, Victor \nset up office in Hyde Park, VT, with a budget of $140,000. His first \ntwo grants were to the Crossroads Humanities Council in Rutland, VT, \nand to the Vermont Historical Society. As with those first two grants, \nthe Council has used its position to challenge the people of Vermont to \nenrich their lives locally through the humanities. The Council has \nworked for the preservation of historic papers and documents, the \ncreation of reading programs, initiatives to improve teachers' \nabilities in teaching the humanities and many, many other meaningful \nprojects.\n  The importance of Victor's influence in Vermont for more than a \nquarter of a century cannot be overemphasized. I congratulate Victor on \nhis retirement and I sincerely wish him the best of luck in whatever he \nmay do next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S282-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S282-S283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE TRIUMPH OF THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I salute the New England \nPatriots for their amazing win in Super Bowl XXXVI. We are so proud of \nour Patriots for bringing home this championship and for the manner in \nwhich they achieved it: through determination, class and teamwork. Some \nfollowers of the Pats through their startling season have deemed New \nEngland a team of destiny. I agree with that characterization if one \ndefines team of destiny as a collection of individuals who worked \ntogether as an efficient, loyal combination in the face of adversity \nand doubt.\n  From Fort Kent, ME, to Waterbury, CT, from Williamstown to Wellfleet, \nNew England sports fans have hungered for a sports title since 1986. \nFew would have guessed that it would be the Patriots who would end this \ndrought by bringing home their first championship. Although blessed \nwith four decades of star players such as Gino Cappelletti, Jim Nance \nand Babe Parilli in the 1960s; Sam (Bam) Cunningham, Russ Francis, and \nJim Plunkett in the 1970s; John Hannah, Mike Haynes, and Stanley Morgan \nin\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nthe 1980s; and Irving Fryar, Curtis Martin, and Chris Slade in the \n1990s, the Patriots had never won the big game.\n  Thanks to the dedicated ownership of longtime season ticket holder \nand local philanthropist Bob Kraft and his family, however, the \nPatriots became a better, stronger franchise both off and on the field. \nFaced with an untenable stadium situation, Kraft, using his own money, \neventually built a wonder in CMGI Field, which will open this fall as \nthe new home of the new world champions. Forced to replace the \nlegendary coach Bill Parcells, Kraft eventually hired Bill Belichick, a \nlow-key mastermind who has justly earned a reputation for devising pro \nfootball's most devious defensive schemes.\n  Still, in spite of Coach Belichick and his team of heady assistants \ncoordinated by Romeo Crennel and Charlie Weis, few expected the \nPatriots, 5-11 last season, to even contend for pro football's ultimate \nprize. Indeed, the Pats stumbled to an 0-2 start, lost franchise \nquarterback Bledsoe, and appeared, behind unheralded Tom Brady, a sixth \nround draft choice who had begun 2001 as a third-string quarterback who \nhad thrown but three passes as a rookie, about to fall to 1-4 against \nSan Diego. But Brady led a remarkable comeback to overcome San Diego \nand its Massachusetts quarterback Doug Flutie of Natick and Boston \nCollege.\n  This turnaround heralded a season in which the Patriots would \novercome obstacles in step-by-step fashion. After falling to the St. \nLouis Rams 24-17 in Foxboro, the Pats refused to lose again, reeling \noff six regular season and three playoff wins in shockingly methodical \nsuccession. Rather than serving as a distraction, a healthy Bledsoe \nserved as a rallying point for Belichick to demonstrate his \ndecisiveness, Brady to show his skills, and Bledsoe to reveal his \nclass.\n  Haunted by the phantom roughing-the-passer call against Sugar Bear \nHamilton in a 1976 playoff and the paralyzing of Darryl Stingley in a \n1978 exhibition, the Patriots overcame their old AFL foe the Oakland \nRaiders at Foxboro Stadium's final contest. Truly a win for the ages \nand the region, the overtime thriller took place in several inches of \nsnow and ended in the Pats' favor thanks to the clutch receiving of \nEast Boston's Jermaine Wiggins and the boot of Adam Vinatieri, pro \nfootball's best pressure kicker whose playoff beard had begun to \nresemble that of former Boston Bruins great Raymond Bourque. As the \nclock neared midnight on that snowy Saturday, the Patriots celebrated \ntheir 16-13 sudden-death comeback with long snapper Lonie Paxton making \nsnow angels in the end zone.\n  In spite of these heroics, critics downplayed the Pats' chances \nagainst the number-one-ranked defense of the Pittsburgh Steelers in \nHeinz Field, their fine new facility. The all-around special play of \nthe overlooked but record-setting receiver and returner Troy Brown put \nthe Patriots on the scoreboard first, but then disaster seemed to \nstrike in the form of an ankle injury to Brady. Fortunately, Bledsoe, \nalthough inactive for more than four months, came off the bench to \nspark the Patriots to an upset that returned them to the Super Bowl in \nNew Orleans for the third time.\n  Backed by Bledsoe and Brady, the strongest QB combination that the \nNFL had seen since the Rams rotated Norm Van Brocklin and Bob \nWaterfield in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Patriots nevertheless \nfound themselves an overwhelming underdog to lose by double digits to \nthe record-setting St. Louis Rams and their offensive machine. But Tedy \nBruschi, Ty Law, and Lawyer Milloy led a hard-hitting defense. Brady, \nDavid Patten, and Antowain Smith controlled the ball on offense, and \nthe Patriots led their fine and worthy opponent for most of the game. \nWhen the Rams tied the score with 90 seconds to go, other teams might \nhave lost their composure and the game. But not this club.\n  The Patriots played with poise, relying on the youthful Brady to \nsling the short passes that put the Pats in position for another heart \nstopping kick by Vinatieri. For the first time in Super Bowl history, a \ngame ended with a winning offensive play, a field goal. While worth \njust three points, this kick meant so much more, a Super Bowl win for \nthe players, coaches, owners, and fans of the Patriots, and a reminder \nof the timeless value of believing in yourselves and your teammates.\n  Mr. President, I commend the champion Patriots and the runner-up Rams \nfor their achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/04/senate-section/article/S283-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO EXTENDING THE AGREEMENT OF JUNE 24, 1985 TO JULY 1, \n2004, CONCERNING FISHERIES OFF THE COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 66\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an \nAgreement between the United States of America and the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China extending the Agreement of June 24, \n1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with \nannex, as extended (the ``1985 Agreement'').

They are for us what Pearl Harbor was to an earlier generation of \nAmericans: a terrible wrong and a call to action.\n  With courage, unity, and purpose, we met the challenges of 2001. The \nbudget for 2003 recognizes the new realities confronting our nation, \nand funds the war against terrorism and the defense of our homeland.\n  The budget for 2003 is much more than a tabulation of numbers. It is \na plan to fight a war we did not seek--but a war we are determined to \nwin.\n  In this war, our first priority must be the security of our homeland. \nMy budget provides the resources to combat terrorism at home, to \nprotect our people, and preserve our constitutional freedoms. Our new \nOffice of Homeland Security will coordinate the efforts of the federal \ngovernment, the 50 states, the territories, the District of Columbia, \nand hundreds of local governments: all to produce a comprehensive and \nfar-reaching plan for securing America against terrorist attack.\n  Next, America's military--which has fought so boldly and decisively \nin Afghanistan--must be strengthened still\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nfurther, so it can act still more effectively to find, pursue, and \ndestroy our enemies. The 2003 Budget requests the biggest increase in \ndefense spending in 20 years, to pay the cost of war and the price of \ntransforming our Cold War military into a new 21st Century fighting \nforce.\n  We have priorities at home as well--restoring health to our economy \nabove all. Our economy had begun to weaken over a year before September \n11th, but the terrorist attack dealt it another severe blow. This \nbudget advances a bipartisan economic recovery plan that provides much \nmore than greater unemployment benefits: it is a plan to speed the \nreturn of strong economic growth, to generate jobs, and to give \nunemployed Americans the dignity and security of a paycheck instead of \nan unemployment check.\n  The plan also calls for maintaining low tax rates, freer trade, \nrestraint in government spending, regulatory and tort reform, promoting \na sound energy policy, and funding key priorities in education, health, \nand compassionate social programs.\n  It is a bold plan--and it is matched by a bold agenda for government \nreform. From the beginning of my Administration, I have called for \nbetter management of the federal government. Now, with all the new \ndemands on our resources, better management is needed more sorely than \never. Just as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 asks each local \nschool to measure the education of our children, we must measure \nperformance and demand results in federal government programs.\n  Where government programs are succeeding, their efforts should be \nreinforced--and the 2003 Budget provides resources to do that. And when \nobjective measures reveal that government programs are not succeeding, \nthose programs should be reinvented, redirected, or retired.\n  By curtailing unsuccessful programs and moderating the growth of \nspending in the rest of government, we can well afford to fight \nterrorism, take action to restore economic growth, and offer \nsubstantial increases in spending for improved performance at low-\nincome schools, key environmental programs, health care, science and \ntechnology research, and many other areas.\n  We live in extraordinary times--but America is an extraordinary \ncountry. Americans have risen to every challenge they have faced in the \npast. Americans are rising again to the challenges of today. And once \nagain, we will prevail.\n                                                      George W.
